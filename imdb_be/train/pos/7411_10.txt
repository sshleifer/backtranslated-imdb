The key to joy and beauty, pain and sadness of life is our ability to recognize that life is essentially what it is, we do not constantly struggle with this one compelling truth. At the same time, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but it is so difficult for most of us to understand. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth, but it allows us to detect it in its own way. This is a beautiful, yet simple story, a fable that plays very well. Watching an actor like best to be in the room with real people than just watching actors. <br /> <br /> I struggled with how to write a review of this thin film, so that others will be motivated to see it. I'm at a loss. The story of the men in the bath. It looks like a real turn off, is not it? But nothing could be further from the truth. US title for this film a shower, but this is almost the antithesis of the major thematic elements in the film, which is en suite. I am still at a loss. Speaking about the history or the characters will not do them justice. <br /> <br /> So I'll just tell you how much I loved to watch this movie and how touching and moving experience was. I was also very entertaining. I deeply cared hero, and I am deeply about what happened to them anyway. For every story, that is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you are inspired by films like The King of Masks or Nha One Less, then make sure you see a shower. Netflix has it, and DVD-quality video and sound are excellent. I watched it in the original lanquage with well-made and well located British submarines. <br /> <br />
