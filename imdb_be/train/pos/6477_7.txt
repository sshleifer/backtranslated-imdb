"Five days," billed as something special in the crime drama, which consists of a series of episodes, each set on one particular day of the police investigation. But in fact, the history of the element is much less significant than it may seem at first to think like the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is barely noticeable, and very little distinguishes the program from other crime of countless stories. In fact, one almost could not help comparing the pattern of the last "Prime Suspect" as one of the auxiliary sections focuses on a single, cynical woman cop retires, and it is not only the absence of Helen Mirren, which makes a comparison unfavorable, there are many suras 'ozna over-emoting, manipulative music and set of characters, it would seem far-fetched, so that each of them in a certain sense, responsive, another suspicious. And it is possible to guess wrong long before the end, but not because of the internal dynamics of the plot, but rather due to the construction of the drama as a whole: some things must be true in order to justify such a way that focuses on a series of specific characters in a certain time. Despite these shortcomings, the series has grown on me, in the end, I was completely trapped. But it's a sad sign that the BBC, which used to be done like "The Singing Detective", boasted that, "perhaps the best drama of the year": there are few true originality of the proposed here, and the demand shows a lack of ambition, it's awfully frustrating. "Five days," not actually a trash; but it is formulaic, and one would hope that the best thing that the BBC would have to offer something a bit more innovative and fresh.
