A new page in the history of Victoria and Albert revives director Jean-Marc Vall√©e. fleeting thoughts of most people's Queen Victoria is that women who have dominated for several decades, and lived their lives in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role, since it gives the audience a different view. It reflects Victoria in her youth, ascent to the throne, and the early years. Blunt's Victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film. Her strong scene with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All the actors acquit themselves well including Miranda Richardson that could have been disposed of role. <br /> <br /> While it's not the story of the dramatic arcs and acting "acting" moments, the story is still interesting enough to make it worth a look. There are several historical liberties that were taken in the written form of the screen, the film tries to stay true to the relationship between the Victoria and Albert and the royal and social structure of the period. Set and costumes are outstanding. <br /> <br /> This film will be the most obvious, it refers to the story, period drama, and Blunt and other actors. Heartily recommended <br /> <br /> Class :. A
