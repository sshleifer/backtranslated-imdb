Stone Boy almost forgotten drama of the 1980s. Given how many famous or well-known people will soon be in the film, one question is how this can be so ignored. It is a slow, moody, but touching story about the tragedy that befalls the family farm. The film is more or less a charge Midwestern stoic values ​​and suppression of emotions. The film is not for everyone, but someone who can assess the real human drama would it OK. <br /> <br /> In the first moments of the film, we see two brothers beheaded in the early morning hours to pick peas and maybe shoot a duck or two, if you're lucky. When lifting the fence of barbed wire, the gun accidentally discharged, and the younger boy fatally shot his older brother. Those boys, apparently did not take the hunter safety course. Way for two men to pass right over the fence like this with one gun will be as follows: First man rises later. The second person then passes his gun over the fence. The first man then sets up the gun and help others through the fence. At no time should a man have his hands on the gun and how the fence. <br /> <br /> In any case, when his brother was killed, 12-year-old Arnold regresses in his own world. He did not even run for help after his brother was shot. He just goes ahead and picks peas and tells his family about what happened later. At no point during the funeral or inquiry does Arnold seem to show any remorse or sorrow at all. His family seems to avoid it. Perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother. Vile uncle played Frederic Forrest apparently upset with Arnold, despite the fact that the death of his older brother lets him go to a friend of the child. Arnold's parents do not seem to understand how to deal with their son. They did not even try to talk to him. About the only person he can talk to his grandfather, who played in typical Artfully grandfather Brimley. After a while, even Arnold moved to the old timer. <br /> <br /> Nothing seems to get by Arnold to open until he takes a fancy trip to Reno Nevada inexplicable look for his ex-wife of his uncle. After he meets her, he begins to come out of his shell after apologizing to her breaking her marriage, starting a family all the hustle and bustle of the accident. From this point, the film becomes a quick study of reconciliation and revival. <br /> <br /> To act compulsively away in most cases. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close make a perfect stoic farm parents. Forest well, but perhaps tries too hard to direct the work of Paul Newman in the HUD. The cinematography is exceptional, too. If you like a picture of Moody 'ordinary people, this one might be for you. Some of them may even be recommended to bring some tissues. 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dogs.
