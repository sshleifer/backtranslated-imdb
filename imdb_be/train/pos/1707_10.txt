This film is not for everyone. You either bright enough to "he" or it is not. Fans of sci-fi movies that do not take themselves too seriously will certainly enjoy this film. I recommend this movie for those who can appreciate the parody, and parody. All I recommend this film enjoys it. If you love movies Monty Python or Mel Brooks, you'll probably enjoy it. Speech characterization made so insincere and one-liners fly fast and furious.
