Yesterday I attended the world premiere of «Descent» at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I had a great time. It was sold and with the participation of all the major stars, including my brother, Marcus Patrick spacers. <br /> <br /> I give the film begins with 7.5 of 10 possible stars. <br /> <br /> movie begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) in college. Can you imagine a typical college environment with wild parties and flirting occur. Pictures in this film was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust), and they become lovers. It turns out that just like any other relationship in the beginning. Man looking for a woman's attention and love, and a woman playing hard to get. Both played it well. Very innocent flirtation between them. He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very dull and dark. They end up in the basement, which is very dark and lit by many candles. In fact, it reminded me of a dungeon. That's where he shows his true colors, and proceeds to rape her. It is very dark and rough rape scene. This scene is not for the young or faint of heart. Rape scene is a bit long and hard to accept, but it is necessary for the rest of the film, which is worth. <br /> <br /> Maya is now starting to lose his soul to drugs and sex. She falls into a bottomless pit. She begins to visit the wildest parties and wakes up in the morning in a room with no recollection of how she got there. She told me to go see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character, they say that "he is a man who saves all who need saving." He's actually the one who enters My Drugs. They begin a relationship of dependence, which comes into play later in the film. club scene at this point of the film photographed with special expertise. I thought they did well, and I noticed that the cameraman applauded at the end of the show during the credits from the audience. <br /> <br /> Maya then in college, like TA, and who is in her class - Jared her rapist !! You could see the confusion and emotion on the face of May. What should I do ?? What do I do next ?? Arrows on her face and emotions are invaluable. <br /> <br /> What unfolds further, it is not really happening. It operates interested in Jared. She seems to want to revive the relationship and be loved again. I sat there, saying it could be really happening. It was not. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites him to her apartment and, of course, it shows up. Now her apartment is dark and gritty. She told him to undress completely. He thinks he's going to get "lucky". Then she teases him, as any woman can. She caressed him everywhere, and he gets excited. Note :: for those who plan to see the movie, this scene is full nudity - may not be for a young audience <br /> <br /> Then she turns the situation, and it becomes a beast and proceeds to rape. it. Again, a dark scene, sandy, and very rude. <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch a movie and do not want to know what happens next, skip this step and go to the last item. <br /> <br /> Here Adrian got into the picture. Maya Adrian save (?) Her performing very rude male with Jared. She thinks it's the ultimate revenge. Adrian continues to take all the courage and Jared undresses his dignity to anything. Mark, like Adrian, playing the scene as believable as one can. He is a strong actor playing the strong character and the power goes out all over the screen. After the film, during the Q & A session, Marcus explained that the scene requires a lot of trust between them and Chad. Maya believed that this place will save her, but I do not think it does. One of the final scenes have a close-up face of Mace, and you will see a tear roll down her cheek. It was a fabulous close-up scenes and causes permanent discussion from those who go to see this film. She received her revenge she wants ?? It was satisfying how she expected ?? In my opinion, it is not. This only exacerbates the situation. <br /> <br /> This is a great film, it will be fine acting role, and I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see him. I have just a little hesitant when under the age of 17 years. Rosario, Chad, and Marcus to be commended for a job well done. Guides and photographs should also be commended. It was a night that I enjoyed.
