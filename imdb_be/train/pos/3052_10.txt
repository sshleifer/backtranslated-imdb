Surprisingly even emotionally unsettling chiller of tired middle-aged man (William H. Macy), who finally decides to leave the family business (assassination) to run it quietly overly demanding father (Donald Sutherland), seeing shrinkage (John Ritter) and flirting with other patients (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> We are talking about a major dilemma, but "panic" is a top-notch thriller that looks like "American Beauty" answers «The Professional». Mace and Sutherland are the stand-outs here. Excellent debut of the first-time writer / director Henry bromellite. I am surprised that this film did not get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks.
