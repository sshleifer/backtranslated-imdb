I liked this movie a lot. it's dark, it's not a bullet lighting, car-chasing movie numb your brain activities. Many of the characters origins and motivations are originally vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. it is good to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds <br /> <br /> In the end, driven by love or revenge or the desire to repent. - he does what he feels "right", "Will God ever forgive us for what we did.? - This question is not a mortal man can answer - so he does what he feels, what he should do what he is good at what he was trained to do <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is a great actor. - I honestly can not think of a bad movie he did - and he has a great supporting cast. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
