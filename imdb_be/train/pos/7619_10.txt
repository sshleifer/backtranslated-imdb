Intriguing. Exciting. Drama. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that only touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the great history that is lost speak. <br /> <br /> The active up to rare visual effects, losing is an important show on television for fans of science -fiction, fantasy, action, adventure, and a lot of mystery. <br /> <br /> Every member of the cast is so well matched, and so well in the role, you either love them or hate them, or just do want their death. <br /> <br /> visual effects, using the (rare) is actually quite well done, given the normal production of the show. Whether it is "smoke monster" for polar bears losing believable in terms of eye candy. <br /> <br /> As far as history, nothing can compare with the enormous complexity of this show took the audience as I endure. Beginning to end, the continuity of the almost perfectly, characters evolve and constantly evolving story slowly gives answers to your questions so much crave. <br /> <br /> In general, virtually no crime in Lost. This makes for drama / sci-fi TV that retard the progression made for comedy :. He set the bar <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Lost those who are patient, intelligent and loving every moment of the trip, no matter how long it takes to reach the end. NO <br /> <br /> See the show.
