"Dressed to Kill" is the best film of Brian DePalma, an absolute thrill ride of suspense, humor and style that is unmatched today. DePalma has a bum rap in Hollywood, as most people say he picks Alfred Hitchcock. He did not. Hitchcock could only dream that shows in their DePalma thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original uncut version of "Dressed to Kill" is no longer available on video. Current copy is released Goodtimes Jack Valenti R rated cut approved. But some copies of the original cut DePalma still exist. This one extends Warner Home Video, as if in a cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover, or in the black clamshell case with playbills on a silver substrate. They are the ones to get, if you can find a copy. I have one green, and he is one of my treasured possessions. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to the story. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, sexually frustrated wife, who is being treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) to his obsessive fantasies. During a trip to the museum (the real tour de force for DePalma in terms of camera work and suspense), <br /> <br /> Miller picked up by a stranger. You can pretty much guess what happens to her, since the ads and box art to give the story. But there are some complications. Prostitute (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) brilliant teenager decided to solve the crime. And Dr. Elliott answering machine has a specific message about a missing ... razor ... <br /> <br /> I'm not spoiling the movie at all for you, so that I described above occurs in the opening half hour and big surprises are reserved for DePalma last hour. This film is obvious, however, enough for Valenti (head of the MPAA) to require the reduction of the film. What surprises me is that he wanted to cut. A few cuts in the opening scene in the shower, and one or two scenes of carnage and some dialogue Nancy Allen (Valenti wanted to "cock" was changed to "bulge"). This film, which is very strong and bloody, though the objection sexual content. I would like to hear an explanation Valenti to how sees two women in the tender love scene in «Lost and Delirious» somehow more damaging to a young mind than Arnold Schwarzenegger to take down a man with a chain gun. It's just not fair. <br /> <br /> What makes the "Dressed to Kill" so well that not only are the technical credits the first year, but the performances are very good as well. Michael Caine, which was a lot of shit in this period of time, gives one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, perhaps because it actually has a strong role here. Nancy Allen adds is its range of performances, which it pegged as one of the most overlooked and underrated actresses in the world. Keith Gordon as beautiful as a genius, and I loved all these inventions it. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors, who have never received the recognition he deserves. A recent joke AFI list of the 100 best thrillers have shown that very few people actually know what a thriller. If they were really open their eyes this time, they would have seen that DePalma staked his career in thrillers and in fact the best craftsman. This is even better than "Psycho." It's a shame that very few actually know that. <br /> <br /> **** 4 stars
