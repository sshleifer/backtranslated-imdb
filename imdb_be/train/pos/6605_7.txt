2054. Paris is the Escher pictures of people and vehicles scurrying along on several levels, a clear tribute to Metropolis by Fritz Lang. Paris as a cutting-edge and fall into disrepair. And in the moments between turns observation rather young medical researcher kidnapped just after the departure of her sister in a seedy nightclub. The brutal police captain investigating. Said harsh black-and-white, with dark hallways, shady paths and a single light source with the characteristic most hardboiled noir, comparison with Sin City inevitable. But the story owes more Masamune Shiro and William Gibson than Frank Miller, in high-tech surveillance, stealth suits almost invisible and ruthless super-corporations, as much a part of the landscape as the tools and machines. The film never creates a thought laden atmosphere of cyberpunk vision of Gibson with his technically difficult marginal characters faced with industrial types of corporations, all of which seem to have their own Ministry of Fear, but the audience will definitely get the feeling that in the future, Paris is not a utopia and science future no less friendly. And, as a police procedural unfolding story line, we are taken into the dark recesses of individual ambition under the brilliant veneer cultivated PR image corporation Avalon. motion capture process used herein produces a form somewhere between the B & W and the subsequent generation of comics Rotoscoping and interesting or obsessive depending on your tastes. Nevertheless, a great visual feeling on display here, and the future of Paris is filled up to the smallest detail, giving the picture a unique look, which in turn is a Spartan and Baroque. Worth a look.
