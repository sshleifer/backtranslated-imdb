There are moments in the film that are so terrible, your teeth hurt. But knowing that there are only a few weeks left before the code of movies harmless and fresh, the Paramount is rushed into production before leering innuendo and out of fashion. Vanity is so terrible anti-woman, it's delicious. As sings Kitty Carlisle, women are portrayed with price tags that offend in the Bronx prostitute. They go out of molluscs (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) in positions of absolute obedience. The servants of the law, are so stupid they can not find the door, get to see her skirts and giggle. Bare chest girl's choir sit uncomfortably in giant cacti (Can they be a source of mind-bending, perhaps?) While we listen to "Sweet Marijuana" and watch the blood get on chorines infants. <br /> <br /> Of course, Carl Brisson phonetically learned his line and does not seem to have a clue what he was saying. But all this stands as Norma dwarfs, while no one is looking. <br /> <br /> Taking a moment of gentle fluff seriously lacking point of the whole exercise. Watch it with a charter member NOW and prepare to meet the whole of Hollywood courage mid ticks between body blows. <br /> <br /> Toby Wing, by the way, is the icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington did not hurt either. <br /> <br /> Be sure to stroll Memory Lane.
