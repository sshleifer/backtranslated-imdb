The late Dudley Moore had the most prominent role of his too short career in 1981, Arthur, in a deafening alternately funny and moving tale, which creates a warm smile, a big belly laughs, and sometimes tear when you are in the right mood. Moore received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for the role of Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "car race, play tennis, caresses a woman, but it does have a weekend away, and he is his own man." Arthur was destined to inherit $ 750 million if it marries the girl calling society named Susan Johnston (Eikenberry), which is a spoiled daughter of an underground gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) waitress / actress struggling with Queens who steals ties to father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances over the past 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as acid-tongued butler Arthur and best friend Hobson, whose outward behavior contempt Arthur covers more than the feelings of parents. There are other ridiculous fees Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald, Arthur crazy grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy first time director by the name of Steve Gordon, who, unfortunately, died the following year. It was also forgets continued a few years, but this is a classic not to be missed.
