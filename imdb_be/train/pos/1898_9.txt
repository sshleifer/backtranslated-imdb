Alcoholic father drummer, Who, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in the film. Liza Minnelli, who usually OVERACTS, did a pretty good job of that, and was able to turn the cheek Dudley Moore at every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole every single scene. It was a very "different" film that allows the viewer to be able to look into the other life. We often try to catch the repetition of this film on satellite. Repose Dudley Moore; It was such a nice movie. A lot of satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby / wealthy. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John rather obeys.
