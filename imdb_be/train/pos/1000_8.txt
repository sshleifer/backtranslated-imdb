I liked the movie. Some of the scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I liked the opening scene in particular that had a semi truck in it. Very intense action scene, which seemed to be well done. <br /> <br /> Some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways, such as the time of filming, unusual colors or interesting angles. In addition, the film is funny some parts. I also liked how the evil guy was depicted too. I would give the film 8 out of 10.
