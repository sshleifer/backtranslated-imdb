House game is a great movie on several levels. This is a great mystery and shocking thriller. It is blessed with a magnificent performance Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna and strong, a strong supporting cast of players, and this introduces Ricky Jay, cheating extraordinary, magician and magic historian. His dialogue written by David Mamet, say, as if in a game manner and gives the film (in which reality is often in question) extra dimension unreality. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the game house is a compelling glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and swindlers, diametrically different from Sting, who played only for the glamor and yuks. At this level, it succeeds admirably. <br /> <br /> However, you can not avoid examination at a deeper level of self-satisfied women odyssey of professional competence in the incredible strength and self-realization. The only film I know, referring to the topic of the emergence of personal power in the woman as a worthy way is undervalued Private Benjamin. This is quite a nice film, unfortunately, it scatters its attention by jumping between several themes and the use of fine performance Goldie Hawn chasing some easy laughs. House game adheres to its business. As Poe once said a good story, it leads to stroke his conclusion. <br /> <br /> There is another strain of movies-on-women, embodied Thelma and Louise, big-budget business money maker with contempt topic that women prisoners, or do not realize that they are their own internal forces. That scar. <br /> <br /> As usual, you really have to see this film in the cinema. It should be natural for film festivals. Assign it to the one next to you when you get a chance. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of the House Game and gave my 23 year old daughter. Better she should see it on your TV, nothing at all.
