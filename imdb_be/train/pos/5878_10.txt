Garam masala is one of the funniest movie I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar as beautiful as a womanizer who has to deal with 3 girl and engaged at the same time. John Abraham Funny at the time and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail very rich, as usual, in most of his films. Director Priyadarshan has put great films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are among the best. Garam masala his funny movie, which he did. Three alien actress average. Rimi sen does not get much scope in this film. I was amazed at how Priyadarshan has made a film with a simple story about a guy who has to deal with 3 girls at once. All 3 girls have a day off on the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with loads of laughter, it is a one-stop Non Entertainer.
