If you read Mother Night and liked so much (like me), you just have to see the movie to understand what you need to understand the fundamental element Vonngut letters - that outside of his story is very Vonnegut, and that you can not put the human mind to screen. His whit and humor just can not be decrypted by using a script or even the best performance of the actor. I believe that this film is more than asking key questions, create Vonnegut in his book, but these frequent moments of cynical satire found on the page are not shown on the screen. Does this mean that the film misses? Of course not. In my opinion, the film is a success, because it does not attempt to recreate the experience of reading the book (it is not the medium for those who are too lazy to turn the page). He is successful because he takes the basic elements of the story created by one of the true treasures of art of America and presents it in a frame without pretense. I have seen other versions of the film with Vonnegut books, where the director is clearly trying to send genius Vonnegut and loses control of his own craft. I would not put this film as one of the best I have ever seen, but it stands on its own two feet, as one well worth watching. Taking the "voice" of Vonnegut's story from the film or try to insert it, but it can, Night mother tells her story with a twinkle, and retains the fundamental lessons of the story without confusion, distraction, and disappointment.
