10 out of 10, it's brilliant, super documentary must see, with footage from the war that people have not seen for many years, as long as it was featured in the 1974 movie clips in this documentary does not miss anything from the war, some of the clips left me dumbstuck. The entire series of more than 20 episodes long, and Sir Laurence Olivier and the narrator tells the incredible story of the war. Simply, it is still probably the best documentary of the war so far, and now still be able to pack a tremendous punch for 25 years. You have to look at it at some point, even if it is a few episodes, even though you will still be blown away with the impact this film meant for those who were there suffered and died in the name of the WAR, in the WORLD AT WAR ..
