There are so many words I want to use to describe this film, but can not do it I can? This film is a film to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry, and then cast. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie if you are easily angered profanity, sex, poverty, homosexuality ... and everything else associated with nature. She was a woman, and that can not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all their other debuts, I think BASEketball is the winner. I laugh now just thinking about some of the stupid things that they do in the movies. Watch a movie !! That's all I'm going to say. It's kind of hard for me to leave this comment, because I am one of those people like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a bad word in almost every line burns on their lips when they talk. So I keep it professional. Best Film. Heck yes !!
