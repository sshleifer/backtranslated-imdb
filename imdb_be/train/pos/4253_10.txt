really great movie, one of the best I've ever seen. Touch and simple - like life, sometimes cry sometimes laugh, and it's just beautiful. not too much, just like it is suppose to be. Really liked the idea of ​​the film, no one is good or bad, all or only people sometimes make mistakes mainly because of the pressure of society, everyone is trying to stay strong and some succeed more than others, and most importantly, that you do not have reasons to be angry - you can do it, but in the end the anger goes away, then you need to get back to the love although it is difficult, it is real happiness <br /> <br /> Great actors and pronunciation. , The film really gets you into the feeling of the film. <br /> <br /> good good good. <br /> <br /> I recommend to see it, especially if you want to see the life of the Italians ..
