How can someone say that it's bad, it is beyond me. I loved this show, before I even saw it. For 3 reasons: 1. The history intrigued me, Jessica Alba and 2. 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and please see the entire first season before deciding that this is bad, because I know that when you watch the first season, you will love it and go out and buy a Season 1 and Season 2 on DVD, and then joined the company to get Season 3 Done! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox, and I'm sure many of you supporters of «Dark Angel» hate them. They have something for the preservation of a good show! Not all of you agree?
