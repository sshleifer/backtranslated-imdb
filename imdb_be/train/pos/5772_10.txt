I was watching this show as a kid and I loved it! I saw him when he came to the Toonami years ago .... Sheesh, I sound like an old man! I must have been 13 or 14 when he came to ... But in any case, it was a large portion of the line, and I'm one of those girls-girls who were looking (and favorite) Sailormoon, and I enjoyed it very much. Animation was not the best .... Pretty funny in parts, in fact, and the voice was very lame in the beginning, but it was still a good watch, and I found myself caught up in its day-to-day. <, Br /> <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic, and always one of my favorites. Ryo go !!!!
