I remember the first time I saw this film - I was in the office, weekend work and the TV was on the background noise. But gradually I found myself more and more involved in this film, I have never seen or heard of until I was completely overwhelmed. A matter of life and death (the British name - Stairway to Heaven in the US), a beautiful, compelling, cranky, and move, all in one beautifully written, acted well, well designed package. It's a classic that really rank right up there with Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, and chariots of fire. Why did not he did not get the same public notice and video store fame? Fortunately, some experienced critics have put it on their Â«Top 100 of all time" lists. There is hope - the 1940 fantasy hit was not 'till the 60s, and the Wizard of Oz was hopeless at the box office, but did hit on television. Buy - rent it - look - demand it! You will not be disappointed!
