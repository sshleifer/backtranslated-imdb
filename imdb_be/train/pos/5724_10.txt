Massive few shivers down your spine! I am surprised that there are people who do not like it! I saw him at 10 o'clock in the morning and still scared stiff! And I have seen hundreds of thriller / horror movies! To call loudly, I'm 22 !!! I mean, well, sound is not particularly good, perhaps even b-movie-ish. But the real kind of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the very beginning, to hit you again and again with merciless, unforgiving, terrorizing scene! So many clich√©s no one never ceases to amaze / funk! You know, it goes, it goes, it goes, BOO! and you still jump out of his chair. Take a pillow and a blanket, call the closest friend again, i do not see at night! Hats off to the Japanese!
