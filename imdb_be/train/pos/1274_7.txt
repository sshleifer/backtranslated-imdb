Please note that all those who do not like and enjoy this film said that it was not as good as the book, or that it is different from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand this kind of criticism. Books and movies are different media. While books have hours and hours to design the characters and storylines of the film are about 120 minutes. However, the film has the advantage of stimulating multiple senses: visual, audio, and imagination. I do not care if the movie is as good as, and in fact, has no resemblance to the book on which it is based. What is the difference? I judge it for what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was charming. Old and often saw the story, prone to cliches, it could easily have been uncomfortable. Nevertheless, Riffen Reeves and pull it off. One reviewer found Riffen far back. I would never have guessed that he was 40, when she made this film. It is to her credit, as an actress, she played 23-24 years remarkably well. I also think that it is about the best thing Reeves ever done. The story could have been stronger, and I agree to the playback screen could use "twist." Nevertheless, it is well worth a look; obviously not powerful love story, but rather a magical novel that will leave you satisfied, that love is a powerful emotion and good overcomes evil. And it's nice to see the "love story" without mandatory and # $% short, bare buttocks, or hours twirling a shift of kissing. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music is excellent.
