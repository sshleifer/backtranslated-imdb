I have seen in recent years the region 2 DVD of this film is shown in the "horror" in the shops of Oxford Street and is advertised as a "classic thriller." In fact, it is almost exclusively a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for more than four decades. <br /> <br /> Maybe it constantly cheerful, energetic and good-natured humor in fact comes as a bit of a culture shock for many accustomed to the sour and cynical taste many British comedy of the last twenty five years. However, there are still those who appreciate its lively and cheerful personality and the complete elimination of pathos. Asuka had a large idol Tommy Cooper, who often borrowed "self-strangulation" gag, Arthur tries to entertain the stranded passengers. <br /> <br /> There is odd, a rare occurrence in accordance with the rated Linden traverse, which influences how the mysterious Julie.
