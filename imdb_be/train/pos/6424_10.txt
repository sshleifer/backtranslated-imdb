As a child I remember being nine or ten, and loving this film. It was all a Bollywood thriller / comedy film. This imitation of Bad Boys, obviously! All exchange of identities, but the arrival of twins throws everything out of the window, and then comes the picturesque scoundrels who dance and sing! The scenes in the film are not revolutionary, but still a strange scene. The film is really funny, and it was a great comeback Amitabh Bachan is necessary. Govinda is a gem, as always, and this is probably his best work to date, it shines like a side impact and provides the best comedy scenes, available in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The songs lyrics .... how funny and throws .............. bringing laughs when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan strange very funny and make you laugh as Â«Bade Mia" .... his accent ... body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> 'Assi chutki NAAB re Daal' best song ... ........... fun.
