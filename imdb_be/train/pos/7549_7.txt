Young cat is trying to steal back his brother soul from death, but only gets half, and then must pass an adventurer to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I'm not sure what's going on in this movie, which is full of strange, very surreal images, some parents may find disturbing, (ie.the cat cutting off part of the pig, which is traveling with them and fry it like bacon, that all three are eating). <br /> <br /> This is a very strange film, which some compare with Hello Kitty on acid, I think it's more like Hello Kitty, as is done Dali (Of course, it is more alive than Destino, which is directly on the based on his work). <br /> <br /> If a very off beat film that will challenge your perception of things, to see this movie. Just be prepared for some very strange images that will be burned into your memory forever. <br /> <br />
