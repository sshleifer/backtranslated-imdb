This complicated story begins simply enough, with the British reporters take a bet on the Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood, he could not spend the night in a ghostly castle Blackwood. One writer wanders the dusty rooms and corridors, while the music and a glimpse of Waltzing couple did not lead him into an empty room. He sits on the harpsichord and begins to play the melody he heard, and was surprised to be caught on the shoulder of a stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. She tells him ambiguous magic / horrific way that she had prepared his room upstairs, and that someone is always expected in the night ... Night of the Dead. So begins a strange series of supernatural events, a journalist confuses the rest of the night. Spoiler GO: It probably will not surprise too many viewers to know that the beautiful Elizabeth's actually a ghost. This does not prevent her from falling in love with a journalist, but it makes things more difficult for them than for middle pair. It's a fun movie, absolutely everything: the ghosts, ghostly castle, recurring visions of past events, sex and violence (. Although both were relaxed in the version most Americans have seen over the years) alluring, captivating Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. She has an amazing charisma in contrast to those who have you ever seen in a movie. Recommended!
