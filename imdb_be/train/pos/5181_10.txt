I thoroughly enjoyed this film as a whole, but four things really stand out: the perfect comic timing and performance of Sam Raimi in the camp to hand people a great characteristic of Alan Arkin on the owner of the camp, and best cinematography (?). Beautiful gold-tone exterior scenes in the film appeals to me, as the sunset on the lake attracts me to their summer memories. <br /> <br /> In the dialogue and mood feel very natural and believable. Some observers have criticized the lack of a "deep" scenario. For me, this is exactly what makes this film lack of work. The characters and their problems seem to be real, and because of this, I care about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all the pieces together to create a single entity, that feels good.
