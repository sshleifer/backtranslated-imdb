Complex film to comment on, as you say, that's bad? Well it is not, but it is also hard to say that it was good. What it is, it is a clear view, this is as close as you get complete devastation, not being there. This photo tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand, brought to life, you know you want to look away, but you have to look. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers handle the commentary is very good, even in the most tragic circumstances, have a look at something that is happening in another country, nor condones or icons. Facts, pulp and little need for the viewer to grasp or understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> You can not change history, and you do not want this film stands as a testament to humanity in the darkest hour.
