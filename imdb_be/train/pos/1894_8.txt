I remember trying a few minutes of the film, I was very surprised that I have not seen it all, from Steve Gordon directed his only film directed before dying of heart failure. Basically Arthur Bach (Golden Globe win and Oscar nominated Dudley Moore) is a happy drunk millionaire everything he could want, mansion, butler Hobson (Oscar and Golden Globe winning and BAFTA nominated Sir John Gielgud), and many drinking, he should inherit the $ 750000000, if he marries the daughter of a millionaire boyfriend Bert Johnson (Stephen Elliott), they are the woman he chose and family, Susan (Eikenberry). But instead, Arthur finds himself falling in love with Queens waitress Linda Marolla (Golden Globe nominated Liza Minnelli), which, of course, faces a legacy, and 3/4 of the fate of his family from Stanford's father (Thomas Barbour) and Aunt Martha (Geraldine Fitzgerald ) After the death of Hobson, Arthur, on the wedding day, listen to the family's wishes, but aunt Martha was still giving Arthur a legacy to live happily ever after with true love Linda. Also starring Ted Ross as Bitterman, Barney Martin, Ralph Marolla, Anne DeSalvo, Gloria - Hooker, Maurice Copeland as Uncle Peter Bach, Justin Johnston Aunt Pearl Bach, Florence Tarlow Mrs. unfulfilled, Marcella Lowery as Harriet - Maid Martha, John Bentley, Perry and Peter Evans, Preston Langley - Party Guest. Moore amazingly funny and a little cringing almost always drunk millionaire, Minnelli pretty as the woman he loves, and Gielgud, of course, makes a great impression as the Oscar humorous sarcastic humble servant Moore terrific screwball comedy. He won the Oscar for Best Original Song for "The theme of Arthur (the best you can do)" (he also won a Golden Globe) (it was number 79 in the 100 years 100 songs), and he was nominated for Best Writing Screenplay written directly on the screen he was nominated for a BAFTA Anthony Asquith award for film music of Burt Bacharach, and he won a Golden globe for best Picture - comedy / musical. Sir John Gielgud was number 35 on the 50-Greatest British actors and the film was number 53 in 100 years, 100 Laughs. Very good!
