Let's face it: the last season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I've ever used (mostly, I have never found a dry spell lasts the entire season). But if you judge the show last season, of course, it will come across as worse. It is totally unfair because assessment-- «That« 70s Show »was, in its day, a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era, and the people who lived there were not so different than we are currently. <br /> <br /> Well ... ignoring the season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace star Eric Foreman, horny bastard teenager with an everlasting love Donna (Laura hurdles), the feminist girl next door. Playing his friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez), and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic views in (almost) every episode. The best one is probably Fez, exchange student who is mentally messy as they get. In which country is it? Try to understand it! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith phenomenal, parents Eric. Rupp as Kitty, both menacing and sweet, like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Baron, while Red Smith exists mainly to scare pogees of all. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts played very well against each other, as parents Donna, chauvinistic, but nice Bob and Midge airheaded. Tommy Chong has a random appearance like Leo, Stoner, acting as a father to Hyde. <br /> <br /> In addition anachronistic mistakes that are often over-the-top and lessons sometimes come (and that lamentable last season), "70" is a terrific show with amazing writing, spot-direction and Wellness Wiebe pulsates through each episode. They are all in order.
