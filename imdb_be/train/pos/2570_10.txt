Well, this is probably one of the best films I've seen, and I love it so much that I remember most of the scenarios (especially the scenes in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks wind), and even with a script in my head I still like to look at Jerry Lee, the German Shepherd hysterical and really put to the test to see who is smarter. The tag line is true, as well. Not to mention the current great though Christine Tucci sounds different whisper (Check filmography under the CSI, if you do not know what I mean). It's too bad that this film contained only one question Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work, it would be very cool to see the tricks that Zeus and Wells had up his sleeve.
