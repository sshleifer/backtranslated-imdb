As is known, an anthology of films do not succeed very well with American audiences (I guess they prefer one standard storyline). New York, I love you, this is the second stage of the anthology series of films dealing with the cities and the people who live and love in them. The first was "Paris, J'Taime», which I really liked. The film was composed of several segments, each of the written and / or directed by another director (most of whom were French, but there is a very funny segment directed by Joel and Ethan Coen). As with "Paris", this one is also ontology, directed by several directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapoor et al.), As well as the «Paris'deals with the residents of New York, and why they love the city they live. It has a highly professional actors, showing love Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki, as well as features such seasoned veterans like James Caan, Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly, while others do not (although I believe that it will depend on individual tastes --- I will not spoil it for someone else, identifying the ones that have worked for me, and those that do not). The word is that the next entry in the series will be in Shanghai, China (Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany and Athens, Greece with the question?). They speak mostly in English, but there are bits of Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. Rated «R'by MPAA for strong language and sexual content
