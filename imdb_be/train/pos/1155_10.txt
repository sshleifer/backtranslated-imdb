It's very funny. It has a large cast, each of which give great performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It is a well-written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I do not like soap operas, although I never look at them. But I love this movie, because it's so crazy and off the wall, it beats the hell out of any silly soap, they have to daytime television. In my opinion, this is the best film of 1991.
