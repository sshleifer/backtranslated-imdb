I see that my ancestors saw in the young Bette Davis. She Splendid throughout this almost rebellious political comedy, which actually plays a major Warren Williams as a political operative constantly for him alimony. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant, his ex, and I found that was rooting for her everywhere. Williams character is not entirely sympathetic, and he was not even worthy of CIT. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does. As a candidate pulled out of his sleep in a political convention, and appointed to be the governor, in order to prevent a rival candidate put forward, so that the whole mess are in the internecine political struggle in the party called "Progressive Party." If you have a political mind, you probably , see the party, other than the one with which you are affiliated reflection in the fictional "progressive party" Williams and Kibby. I could have done the exact parallels, but we're not here for that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those of us who love the old comedy. If you've ever watched any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey name (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE Rainmakers), you will find Frank McHugh and right hand Williams, look and behave much like Bert Wheeler. He lied to me. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my wife and I would recommend this one.
