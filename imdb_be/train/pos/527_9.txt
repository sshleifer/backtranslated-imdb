It is not surprising that the writer / director Michael Powell considered the "matter of life and death," his and charming fantasy Pressburger from 1946 until his favorite of their films together. Released during the post-World War 2, this colorful romantic adventure would provide just the tonic for injured, which restored the nation, which needs a good uplift. <br /> <br /> After a series of other patriotic films about the war, "the archers made it one of their nimble, skittish, and most of the patriotic party. Quintessentially British for defending British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners), it is also noticeably Americanized baroque compositions, technical ingenuity and subtle multinational cast. <br /> <br /> Ironically repeating the other one thousand nine hundred forty-six classic "It's a Wonderful Life,Â» AMOLAD opens on the big sky, with one of the remarkable voice-overs, preaches about the earth and the heavens, and what a great, awesome the world in which we live. <br /> <br /> then it will cut into the cockpit of the British, was badly damaged in a fire and a co-driver is already dead. It sounds confusing, but the relationship soon make an informed with the events that follow. <br /> <br /> Since the work in about 5 minutes, a hasty exchange between the British pilot Peter (David Niven) and American contacts Radio June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in its vicinity. Resigned to death, however, Peter runs out of a lot of vitality, the charm and the outpouring of confession, and his warm accessory June closed mutual exchange of "I love you." <br /> <br /> Keeping with the magic of the moment, Peter, through an oversight of its conductor 71, whose job it was to take him to the "Another World" escapes death and finds himself stranded on the beach. Later, he meets June biking, and instantly corresponds to the body with a voice. <br /> <br /> But, realizing his mistake, the high court wants Peter goes back and order a French conductor (Maurice Goring) down to earth to restore it. But Peter is adamant to live out in June and the leader of an error, and willfully protects your corner. <br /> <br /> The fate of Peter ultimately lies with the heavenly court and the US Attorney (Raymond Massey), whose jury is composed of several dead war heroes and chic British delegates. Surreal court that dissolve in b / w back into the Technicolor rich, when the verdict is announced, may well be a dream, but the last shot in the hospital confirms the predictable result. <br /> <br /> abstract, filling the frame "Stairway to Heaven" (the American title of the film) is used twice: the first time in B / W, if he exalts Peter and his mysterious French guard up, crossing the giant statues of potential lawyers for Peter Court, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, softly-lit color staircase provides the setting for what is a significant way to the cinema. - Peter and June frozen side Boke, they were surprised staring ahead in the frame, their fate is sealed <br /> <br /> unlikely love divided between Peter and June will never be soft or wordy; it is considered a noble and understanding that it is time enough for getting married and just need to convince people they love, so that he can keep them together. <br /> <br /> French conductor, which can freeze time, and the body of the people, obtrudes many of the key moments together, Peter lectures about the history and among his mischievous tricks, holding the book of Peter "Top 100 Games of tricks" and his coffee cup. <br /> <br /> As visually inspired other joint Powell / Pressberzhera, it was the first time when they are combined with the color b / w ?? the latter being a cheerful quality when used for celestial scenes, and both are equally fascinating. <br /> <br /> The outstanding scenario is more than meets the creative set design, with dialogue that sounds so ak immediate that does not feel like it has been written or performed for the screen. Funny and witty letter Powell / Pressberzher deserves equal acclamation of them forte for color and composition. <br /> <br /> Made in 1946, "A Matter of Life and death "is one of those movies that defy his age, looking fresh and inventive, even at this age, when the CGI is to patch their artificial effects, likely eliminating them from their emotional surprise. <br /> <br /> Another concussion change will include the need to reduce the average seconds to cut and inevitable pleas to cut the dialogue so that it can maintain a low attention span of most viewers. Powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, which gives him the freedom to experiment with images, without changing the logical development of the heavy Peter.
