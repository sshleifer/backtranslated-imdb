This would be my number one film of the year for 1991, except that the beat with a brilliant JFK. This is such a wonderful film! I loved it. I love stories where lives of different characters intersect with others, how to cope with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but eclipsed by Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin. I never just as Martin or his style, but here he is big. I loved the entire speech he gave Kline towards the end of the Grand Canyon. Drafting was excellent. Larry Kasdan is IMO, great dialogue writer, the path of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. There he formed some three-dimensional characters and a well thought out story lines, as well as reports that give a positive sense of our lives. Really great movie. 4 out of 4 stars
