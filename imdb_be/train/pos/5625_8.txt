Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) living in fear after approached lone cyclist. She was shaken to death so her attacker knows her address. As might be expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker beats Marjorie house and exposes her abject terror. Bruised and bloody, Marjorie manages to get the upper hand on the attacker, knocking the living daylights out of jerk and making it helpless due to wasp spray in the eyes and throat. Hog tied and beaten himself, Joe tries to explain to himself the neighbor of Marjorie room (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard), when they return home. There is almost a hint of mercy, but not from Marjorie. Should it continue to provide their own punishment? Violence, sexual violence and coarse language to make rankings R. Fawcett really moving away from ditsy roles forever Stain his career. Kudos to director Robert M. Young.
