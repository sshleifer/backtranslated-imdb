I've never heard, Rob Roy MacGregor, before the "Rob Roy" was released, but the film is definitely worth seeing. Playing the title character, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role that he brought Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a very good job, as well as his wife, Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is the one person is very likely to make your skin crawl. <br /> <br /> In general, it comes out as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think of how Hollywood has released two films nearly back to back, taking a blow to the FA. Very good. Also starring John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
