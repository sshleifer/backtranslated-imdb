The book, which is based on the film was delightful; It took a while to come to grips with the unconventional style of Houellebecq, but as soon as I understood the mood of the letter, I was fully involved in the world of sorrow author. In fact, no other book has influenced me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing - is to find out their own personal struggle and made the futility of my own struggle harder to take. Houellebecq ideas artistically passionate hero Harel and apathy and indifference to the world, which rejected his painted pictures. This is a film that shows today's society for the lowly man in all its horror. Let's hope that the situation will change in the future, but as yet we have to take the rat race, as shown in this film. It's probably best that Harel Welbeck or wholly create a work of genius like that again. One is enough for any man.
