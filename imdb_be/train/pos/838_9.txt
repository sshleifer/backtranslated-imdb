*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> A well-articulated stories and movies together, Brosnan never been better in the role of the film outside of his films "Bond". After "after sunset" his newest part of 2004 brings laughter and a great time. Professional hit man, so to speak, Julian Noble at the meeting in Mexico City completed the exact opposite afford the high strung businessman Danny Wright (Kinnear, perhaps one of his best roles) and on business. Two on-screen duo produces comically charged laugh riot and put nya nya laughs. Davis in one of his best roles, starting with «American Splendor» provides another magical and witty performance. One of the most enjoyable years of the best films. My final rating 9/10
