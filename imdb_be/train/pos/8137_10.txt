If you want to CB4, you have no idea what you're missing if you have not seen this movie yet. This movie is crazy fun, and it includes a lot more about the hip-hop industry than any other film parody ... It is a pity that this film has not been released on DVD, because this is one film that everyone I ever I watched it with love and wanted to copy. If you really want to laugh and you like hip-hop and a little bit familiar with some old-school performers, definitley rent this film. There are not many places where video having a copy, but if you happen to find one that you will not be disappointed.
