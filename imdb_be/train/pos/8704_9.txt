There is a lot of crap coming out of Hollywood lately. <br /> <br /> A friend sent me a movie over and over again, as a surprise, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> I turned it on and I could not stop watching this drama, but with an odd twist. Imagine if Romeo, as well as in Shakepeare, was a superpower. Sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should pay attention to the new Russian cinema, they tell stories that are not about big explosions and CGI. He takes a simple basic premise and tells the story, without spectacles. This is very similar to the Asian film with dark Russian twist. Of course, it's not perfect, but never mean anything. You know that power, but it is never explained or not fully realized until the end. This becomes secondary to the history of emotions. I do not want to see a remake, it's too cool, as it is, the system of Hollywood will, as usual, to spoil him. Duties at the highest level all around. Directing and camera work is much higher than most of the crap that is out there. Kudos to all the participants, and will turn a lot of people on this independent epic. +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find me, look.
