In order to get in touch with the beauty of this film is to pay close attention to the soundtrack, not only music, but as all sounds help to weave images. How beautiful opening scene led to the expulsion Gina sets the theme of moral ambiguity! Notice how the music to enter characters, we brought in marriage to Giovanna. Do not expect to find here a lot of the political life of Italy in 1943. This is not what this is about. On the other hand, if you are receptive to music and sounds, you will drive in a word that reaches beyond neorealism. By the end of the film, we have moments of Antonioni, like landscape, that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than real places. This is one of my favorite films of Visconti.
