Unusual film with Ringo Lam, and one that is strangely overlooked. Combination fancy kung fu with more realistic depiction of swords and lances are driven through the bodies of particularly scaring within the first ten minutes. Horse rider get chopped in half and his waist and legs to keep a horse. Several horses are cut. This is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his brothers Shaolin insane maniac captured and imprisoned in the general Red Lotus Temple, which seems to be more a torture chamber and then the temple. General has similarities with Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, when he ejaculates distorted philosophy and making terrible scenes of human blood. <br /> <br /> production is very impressive and installation bleak. Blood everywhere. The action is very well done and mostly coherent, unlike many scenes from HK time. Sometimes the film turns into absurdity or the effects of cheese, but it's never bad enough to ruin the movie. <br /> <br /> Find the one, it's one of the best Hong Kong kung fu films since the early nineties. Just remember that it is not for children.
