Be careful with this. Once you get yer mitts on it, it will change the way you're looking at a kung fu movie. You will miss the story of all kung fu movies now, you'll want the depth and nature of the development, you will crave mystery and unpredictability, you will require a dynamic camera work and stunning backdrops. Unfortunately, you will not find all of these aspects in a kung fu movie, EXCEPT Five deadly Venom! <br /> <br /> easily the best kung fu movies of all time, poisons combines a rich story full of twists and turns, with colorful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best filming, to get out of the '70s years. Success who loved the film depends on the ability of viewers to decode a symbol that, and who specializes in that poison. One of them is the centipede, the snake is two, three is a Scorpio, four is a lizard, and five is the frog. Each character has different features, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. This is the hook, we learn together with the student character, to find out who these people are different. We had shoes (so to speak), and we have to choose who to trust and who we are not doing as well as he does. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only the plot, characters, and a large operator, it is also interesting to observe that makes it more valuable in my book than almost any other film of its kind, it is worth a lot of hours to pick up on all what's going on. Poisons lesson that kung fu can really do ... just do not expect a lot of other films of kung fu, to live up to his glove.
