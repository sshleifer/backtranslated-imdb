After all, who witnessed the social changes in the 60 and 70 years you can also suggest that by 2022 the residents of crowded cities behave. <br /> <br /> I did not like most of the scenes, in addition to the death of the priest: too cheap even for the Seventies. The plot is not too polished. But the big scenes and ideas - like death Sol, then, as the rebels and the dead bodies had to deal with, "furniture" - outweigh the disadvantages of this film <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 ..
