I really miss the good old fashion production Spooky films. When Ismail merchants and James Ivory has been tasked to obtain such a film it may be one, except for the absence of internationally known, the top drawer cast. This is one of those movies that you see only a dark night with a pizza and some popcorn, and you do not even bother to do the dish until the morning because you just want to hide under the covers. Bravo director Herbert Wise Writers Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, top design production John Bunker, Art Direction by John Ralph and excellent cast for making me shudder and feel so alone, even if I live in one of the most populated cities in the world in the beginning 21 th century. I gave him a "9" to "10", because the production and budgetary constraints, TV, they really pulled out the big show.
