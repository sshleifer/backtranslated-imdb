This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say that you should start from the beginning, but I must say that I was a bit confused i start! <br /> <br /> Clark gets hit on the head and wakes up on the floor of Fairview Mental Institution and ridiculed for believing that he was a superhero. Clark said that the life he knew that everything in his head. Mad. He also found some things that are unusual Martha married Lionel; Lex is bound to a wheelchair with his legs cut off after the accident on the bridge; Clark and Lana is dedicated. But he finds one acquaintance; someone who is dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also believes that the mentally ill are also of the known world of Smallville. And the doctor fugitive from the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me back to Buffy episode entitled "Normal AgainÂ», where Buffy begins to have vivid dreams-of a mental hospital. The doctor tried to convince her that all she knew was her imagination, and she, in fact, with the mind. Her parents were still married, they still lived in Los Angeles, its members did not exist, the angel was never her boyfriend and she had a sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires, too, does not exist. Both episodes are a little sad, because doctors do not just tell the characters that all her imagination, but he tells us that it really is: a fantasy, and it brings us back to reality. It's good, though, to have a sense of reality every once in a while, but we watch these shows to get away from reality. It is again a pleasure, because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
