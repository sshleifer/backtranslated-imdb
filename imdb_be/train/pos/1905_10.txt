Quite simply ridiculous and shiniest comedy film of all time ... so, of course, in my personal list of the top ten. This one also gets a hard top ten on the scale of the vote. Millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore) is a middle-aged "child" who refuses to take a mature way in life, and avoids all the necessary functions. He also refuses to give up the bottle. One day he and his personal butler, Hobson (Gielgud), shopping in Bergdorf Goodman and run in small larcenist, Linda (Minelli). Arthur and Linda chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. There are a lot of funny set of parts. In one such scene, Arthur (drunk for most of history) knocks on the door of the apartment and gets an ear shattering threats from human "Siren" ( "My husband has a gun !!!!). Implementation of participant must be duly noted : Geraldine Fitzgerald plays the loving is not yet merciless grandmother Arthur, sir John Gielgud almost steals all shows with his sour fun-isms (He took home an Oscar for it), and Christopher Cross provides the main theme song (the Oscar winner "The best thing you can do "). It's a shame the late Dudley Moore n Ameur last month (March 2002).
