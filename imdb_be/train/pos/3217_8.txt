Kurt Russell is so believable and act as non-stop, what it takes to think about it later, to understand that there is an honest-to-goodness important topics [to overcome the fear of the stranger, learning to rise above the early-conditioning, strength, love and friendship can bring etc.] in the storyline. It is so very rare "action flick Man" and even I [who thinks that the majority of A / A hard smear] liked the movie and recommend it to every guy I know ..... it's a shame this one unsold because it is right was one of the biggest hits of the adventure box office - it has something for everyone, without straining credulity or losses almost moments non-stop action, I'm afraid that the answer is not becoming a hit is that adults do not go to see him at any younger.. 20 years old, probably not only seen more violence advertisements in their video games, but probably either did not catch the multi-layer multi-thematic beauty or does not care about it. This film can convert any who avoid A / A, as the senseless violence. If a guy takes his lady [or leases it or see it on the cable list] to see this film, it will be much more likely to get her to go with him in other action films.
