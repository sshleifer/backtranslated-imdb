It's just funny to watch !!! <br /> <br /> Well, they want 10 rows, so: This is a parody of 50th / 70th werewolf movies. Many satire, some political. It Feels Like earlier Clouseau film (probably because of Alan Arkin), but with less buffoonery. If you like movies Naked Guns you like it too (again, less than a farce in it). <br /> <br /> In fact, humor ranges from light sexual connotation (inevitable in the teen comedy), is really an urgent social and political satire. The transformation of the middle school of the Moon from the 50s to the 70s is really funny. The sequence of changing the presidential portraits is brilliant! OK, maybe the sun shining, but still fun. There are tons of (histarical) cracks, since the 50s Cold War paranoia, and in the late 70-ies of inflation. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just watch the movie if you get the chance!
