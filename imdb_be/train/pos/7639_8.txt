This is not a great film. Act is not surprising (some sub-charterers even played badly), the film is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really new or inventive. If you love great movies, this one is not for you. but he has a big - really big plus history. History Larry works because we know the story of his own life. Girl, we did not ask today, we could not test, one we descended, it's our history. This film works because the touch, it's a great story, because it's small. This is the life that we all have, with apologies to all we have and still get a message: every life we ​​could have lived had its drawbacks. The first time I watched it, I was 15. It was indicated in the party at my school. 16 years later, I still think about it every once in a while, and every time I see her, she puts a smile on my face. Careful. It will do you good. You will be happy with what you have.
