If the two writers to do the script of a horror version of Breakfast at Tiffany's, you know, something will go right. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman great actors. FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scene where Patrick Holly looked up and down like a objectifier, are simply amazing. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate Strangers, where Sally Kellerman worked, was a big part of it. Surprisingly gummy worm was simply amazing. Nathan was a very beautiful cat. But what was that scene where Patrick Hall followed in the garbage, and Mr. Gooding had attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What he did fumble around out there? And not every man is a woman, as shown by Sally Kellerman. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside Victor, it was amazing.
