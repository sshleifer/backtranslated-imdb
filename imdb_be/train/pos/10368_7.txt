Meryl Streep was incredible in this film. She has an amazing knack for accents, and it shows incredible skills in the film as a whole. I really felt for her when Lindy was being followed. She played really, too. She got cranky, depression, and unpleasant, as the media and the government continued their relentless Witchhunt. I did not expect much from the film initially, but I was really interested in this, and the film based on a real person and real events. He was better than I expected. Sam Neill was also outstanding; this is the best job I've seen of him, and I really liked him in other films (a piano, for example). I gave the film 7, but if I could only estimate the act, I would give it a 9.5, and is ideal for 10 Strip.
