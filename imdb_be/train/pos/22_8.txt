If you fast-forward through a terrible singing, you will find the classic tale underneath. Christopher Walken is very humorous and surprisingly well in this role. His signature style of acting works well slowly Puss in Boots. Other actors as to their parts. I have not found any of the acting is terrible fake or uncomfortable. The King, in particular, is a real dunce, though, and I wonder if it has to be. I can not remember the original story. Special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not too fake, like some of the computer-generated fare that we see today. Overall, I recommend this film for children and adults who have a child at heart.
