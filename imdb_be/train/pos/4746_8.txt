This film seems to draw a border. - on the one hand, those who loved him, on the other hand, those who find it unbearable <br /> <br /> To begin with, a lot of comedy in this film that many viewers do not " receive. " Of course, the mask looks like Jet Li, Bruce Lee Kato - it should, it's a joke. The guy who has a time bomb sewn into his heart - provocatively? Of course, this is a joke! Some readers may ask, if the film is to be so ridiculous, why all the unnecessary and massacre? Well, for one tolerance to such a level of violence is actually different from culture to culture; and while Hong Kong viewers will recognize this violent extremes, it is, of course, only a little more than an average of HK action movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, Black Mask is really the kind of film that takes a convention of the genre and pushes them to the extreme, simply because they themselves are completely unrealistic Convention. After decades of watching people shoot without any visible open wounds, many people were afraid to see Bonnie and Clyde and The Wild Bunch criminals beat blood everywhere. But the fact is, if you shot with rapid metal shell, it is almost certain that the blood will spurt, especially in the arteries. <br /> <br /> This film is a Chinese comic book movie. It is true that the films Spiderman never get it mountains - but if they were true to reality, they are! Well, despite its comic origins, this film is a true reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have flashy, overly stylized shooting and editing. If the makers of this film shot him with an eye on Hollywood-style nostalgia (such as missile troops, or the recent film Sky Captain), I doubt that anyone would find it offensive. <br /> <br /> but, as it stands, I still had a lotta pinning the movie.
