Lupine is sent to Morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. His only clue interesting gem that gave him old. This is a good place for both Lupine, with the desert hot and exotic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> One interesting thing about this film is that the jig has a much smaller role than usual, as a rule, is in a different place than Lupine, on the one hand, their classic dynamic together is missing, but it's a change of pace. In addition, so Lupine could focus on ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fudiko rules in this. Throughout the functions she seduces Lupine, and our audience. Then there's Lara, Girl this particular story, and it's pretty nice. This one has more nudity than any other anime Lupine, who have fun contrast. <br /> <br /> There's a very entertaining ninja effeminate guy who is the best villain in this, and, of course, it has some great fights with Goemon's, as well as some funny scenes with Fudiko. Inspector Zenigata, of course, and on the warpath here in great shape. <br /> <br /> Quite a lot, it's a smooth ride with Lupine. The site is located on the middle level, and there are some slow spots, but overall this film is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
