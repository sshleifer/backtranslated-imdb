This movie was amazing, and even less than convincing the end, it's still worth a look. The film begins as Claudette Colbert was going to marry Robert Ryan. If the minister asks if anyone has any objections, the guy gets up and announces that Colbert CAN NOT get married, because she was already married !! Colbert says that this is not so, but when they investigate they find the judge and many others remember her wedding, and there is even a signed license wedding! Slowly, it becomes apparent that reason Claudette seen and the people around her seriously doubt her sanity. Then, if it is assumed, first husband was killed, all evidence and suspicion falls on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The film is gripping mystery suspense film, like what I described so far only the first half of the film, something that costs a surprisingly smart and fascinating. Unfortunately, the conclusion is, though, a little let down, as the guiding force behind all this turns out to come "out of left field" - and confusing, because it was so unexpected and impossible to guess, based on information provided to the viewer. However, despite this, the film was so good, I can even forgive the limp ending. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job as a "knuckle-busting" the bride, while other performances were also excellent but him.
