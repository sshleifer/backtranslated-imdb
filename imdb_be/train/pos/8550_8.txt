Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, and 3 was big only to perform Seann William Scott as Stifler, but after that the quality has fallen. Camp Group has kept a fairly high standard with characters you actually care, but the Naked Mile was the same joke and recirculation line section (gender issue Erik Stifler is Jim). That was some funny moments, like a game of football against dwarfs and "punishment" in Coozeman, but overall it lacked originality and "Mile" was just stupid and idiotic. Not to mention the annoying friend who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough about the Naked Mile. I watched boarding with caution, as I thought that it could take the series to a new low, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest there is no real plot, but it is filled with hot girls (Ashley incredible) and sex jokes a lot. Yes, it is formulaic and old jokes, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with a rich performance. Greek Olympiad entertainment especially the penultimate and final event while the cameo Christopher McDonald cheerful. There are weaknesses, though. Coozeman as annoying as he was in the first, I am still puzzled how he ever got a part. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman bad Erik Stifler worse. John White did Naked Mile pain to watch, but in the hostel he takes his work to a whole new low. First of all he lacks charisma, which is a prerequisite Stifler. You really can not care less about him. The only reason why I was worried about his attitude was so Ashley can be on the screen! It shines on it as the rest of the actors. Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting, and has as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> Speaking of that movie is not fun and fear Coozeman, that his girlfriend is not quite brilliantly funny girl. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is worth renting, get some of your friends and have a laugh when an emetic festival and to express their anger at Eric "loser" Stifler.
