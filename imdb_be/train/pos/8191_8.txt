Impossible Planet Satan Pitot together make up the top two "new" Doctor Who episodes in the second season. Having said that, it should be apparent that a large part of the story basically transposes the plot Quatermass and the Pit (1967) for outdoor installation space, with the history of the universe is interwoven with the Beast 666. These emotional ties cement episodes between Rosa and the doctor, at the same time underlining the Rose growing confidence, establishing it as long as not quite equal-but-getting-there partner with our favorite time of the Lord. It should also be noted Matt Jones elegant script, which reduces time to time over-reliance on a single line for a doctor, and performances throughout the cast, especially the excellent Shaun Parkes as acting Captain Zachary Cross Flane.
