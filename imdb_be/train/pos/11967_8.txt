I do not know if it's a comedy or not, but I agree that it is one of the greatest television show ever. It's great that the show is still airing. And I love Michelle. It's cute on the episodes when she was a child, and she was saying, and she sometimes says something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This show can relate to children and adolescents, and .. well, the family as they struggle through hard times and try to solve it as a family. I do not know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone. <br /> <br /> I love this episode, I think her name is DD .. older girl accidentally stole a shirt, and he was a lot of lessons about the theft. It was a great episode. An example of what this TV show shows family run things as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to everyone.
