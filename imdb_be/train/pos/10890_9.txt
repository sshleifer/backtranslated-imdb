Come on people. This film is better than the 4. I can see it happening ... rich people did crazier things than this. And it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I watch a comedy to entertain, to escape from the pressure of light for a short time, and do not take anything too seriously. This film fully meets this goal. I judge the film on its own merits, and I'm not about to compare Surviving Christmas in Blazing saddles. I watched quite dysfunctional people turn into caring, lovely people who could easily live down the street from my house. He will remain on my list of "favorite ..... must watch out for the holiday season." If you just want to have fun 90 minutes, watch this.
