I saw this film when it first came out. It was an official selection at the International Festival of Temecula Valley Film, and I voted for him for the best film. <br /> <br /> Justin Priestley as hot as psychotic, but a complex of Amanda. This is not your usual crazy film. Many interesting and original painting by genre. Order a "fatal thrust" for the younger set with some great blues, mixed as the object of affection of Amanda is married and coming blues singer, who has less time for her husband, as her career takes off. <br /> <br />
