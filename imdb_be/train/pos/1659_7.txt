Fragment in the life of one of the first female artists to achieve a historic fame, "Artemisia" tells the true story of the longing of a young Italian woman of artistic expression and the variability it faces. In the film, stunning costumes and sets and a good cast and the cast. However, it is confusing in its attempt to reflect the esoteric art of both time and straining in his presentation of the artist passion depicted on the canvas and examined by its defeat with men. A good movie for those who are interested in the painting of the Renaissance period, or movies.
