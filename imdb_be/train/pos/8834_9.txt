Very well made film is set in the early 60-ies of communist Yugoslavia. Five young actors who were teenagers in the center of the story gives a strong, sincere and deeply emotional performances. A clear image as a natural trust and naivety inherent in teenagers can be easily manipulated, and how it affected the rest of his life. Highly recommended.
