Like almost everyone else who commented on this film, I can only wonder why it never appeared on video. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him at the age of 12 on Â«The Late Show," about 1972. I also remember the poison gas attack and lucky clad horses. (I do not remember more horrifying bits I saw, described here, they are likely to have been cut out for the television audience.) But the scenes that I really liked were the ones that caused the death of Lord Kitchener aboard HMS-Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago . Cruiser scene convict, who is close to a minefield in the storm indeed frightening, as I remember. <br /> <br /> Do not remember the score, but the comments of others now I wonder. Get this video!
