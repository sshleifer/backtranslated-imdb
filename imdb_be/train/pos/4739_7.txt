Very good martial arts movies and Jet Li is the best as the master Bruce Lee .li fine, as a low-key librarian / cop who saves all over again. It has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as kung fu king, you do not mess with .Francoise Yip just beautiful mixed race in this original way, which is unique because of its mixed heritage, she is innocent and lure all at the same time that I found memorable .the villain, a man with sunglasses and long hair is very good as well, but I can not find his name in the credits, can anyone help me with this? Thank you! Enjoy Hack Gap or Black Mask, in any language, its good fun!
