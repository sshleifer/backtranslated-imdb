Orson Welles was able to knock me on my ass with each image I see it. Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, beautiful Ambersons, Touch of Evil, Process, and the chimes at midnight. The site may have a tendency to be complicated sometimes, and sometimes it seems to be moving can be a little bit too quickly (in about an hour it was edited, if the screening test went bad). It does not matter, however. You can not watch movies Wells and manage to focus too much on the site. Its direction determines how much direction. Almost every scene of the film can be made with any other scene he directed. Check in the hall of the court scene. Usually, they are action scenes that I can not stand them. Case in point, try to sit own speech Welles towards the end of coercion. The Lady from Shanghai, just pay attention to the level of detail in this hall stage trial. Make sure that the jury, which is always sneezing and breaking production. Or just look at the lighting in the scene. I know it's just a simple blinds, and that it is constantly used in the era of film noir and crime films, but Wells gives it a beauty all its own. Dialogue is also excellent. Wells had a skill, a skill that no one gave up to have to commit a crime film, which contains examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he was talking Shakespeare or spitting hardboiled line, he had the right to stir the soul. 10/10.
