This game is fun, and it has a story that you could actually expect to see in the comics. Spider-Man was framed by a mysterious impostor. City have captured strange gas and symbionts in Venom and Carnage are popping up all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could this be Doc Ock? Well, he seems to have turned a new page. Venom, too, seems not to participate because he just ticked that Spider-Man is perhaps cost him a pretty good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other characters and a lot of the villains Spider later will solve the mystery. The struggle is the main, is not difficult to pick up fights with the bosses is pretty fun. You collect comic books, you run out of the Internet, and it is more fun to cross the city. However, it is also a weak point. Bobs is not so great as all you do is hover over the city like Spider-Man seemingly strengthens its web to the sky. You also do not have a lot of maneuverability Web Rigging anything especially when compared to say, Spider-Man 2 video game movies. Nevertheless, it makes for a pretty bad swings with other elements of particular stories. So be prepared for the fact, Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, mystery, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for one wild ride action.
