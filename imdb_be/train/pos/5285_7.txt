You may think that you are in for some serious sightseeing, if the premise of the film is mainly between the two characters as they travel 3,000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia, after passing through much of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour, and there is no stopping to soak in the sights. <br /> <br /> father Ed is in its darkest years, and wants to do Hajj. However, since walking and taking a mule with a question, he wants to go to Mecca by car. He can not move, and thus enlists Reda, in protest against his son to get his car where they have broken down. <br /> <br /> But Reda saw no reason to have him come along when his father could pick plane. He resents the idea of ​​putting his private life on the content for this pilgrimage he could not understand. And so we set off in this difficult journey with father and son, not being best buddies. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is the witness of the father and son pair who stand face to them, strange people, they meet with the Duke of it in various weather conditions, and alternating between rest stops motels and sleep in the car. We see the gap is clearly generation in their attempts to communicate with each other, the father tries to impose his son, and the son is trying to establish itself as an adult, but the circumstances we see show that Red pretty fish from the water, after many meetings, they are really about 'combined quite well, despite their differences. <br /> <br /> It may be very likely to have this film released last week to coincide with the Hari Raya Haji, and having the opportunity to observe our protagonists to join other pilgrims in their pilgrimage. The final scene in Mecca is really a spectacle, and you would also feel the claustrophobia and fear as Red tries to track down his father among the thousands of people accumulates. Attractions in Europe may have been deliberately did not stop, so as to create an anticipation of, and focus on the final destination. <br /> <br /> This, of course, called home the idea of ​​telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. Do not miss it, and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that this evening's session was still in the full house.
