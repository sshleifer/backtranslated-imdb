All I can say about Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series ... if you even remotely «PC» or have seriously messed up sense of humor, then you probably will not get it. How sick and disgusting as this film is really a comedy, not a "horror" movie at all. If you can appreciate someone who pushes the limits of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable, to the point where is gets so out of hand that it is a comic, you have to see it to believe it. This film is out of control, that the main studio can not touch it with a 10 foot pole (with a condom on the end). In my opinion though, the best, the most extreme works of art come from the way underground. If you do not stick to the same old formula, that people are used to seeing, they reject it. <br /> <br /> I saw a stack of terrible, sad, g-class Indy movies that were just a waste of very good video tapes or DVD-R. I also saw a stack stink bombs coming from these major studios, which have been spending millions of dollars. If NO budget film these two Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro go out and blow all other "shock" of the film is completely out of the water, you really have to take a second look at all Indy movie scene. Seeing this, you can really see how much freedom Indie filmmaker could have, if they work on their own. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, even other people who have seen the film and "hated" to recognize the fact that they were laughing all the way through it. I do not think there's maybe somebody will bother to watch either of these two. So, if you do not take all that you have seen in the media too seriously, and are able to laugh at the man-hating, puppet wielding psychopath who finally snapped, you have to see it. You may just be able to see it only stand a cult, it's there. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 is one of the favorites in my collection of over 1,000 DVDs.
