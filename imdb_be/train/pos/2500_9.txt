... it will probably be the best word to describe this film (in my opinion). In addition, one large fan service latch for Girls fan (well, it was redundant ~), it was a story that blew me away. cheers Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know that some people will not agree with me on this, but it was not any of the three great actors (the guys who played Shaw, son, and Kei), which gave the best performance (for me, anyway) . it was Taro Yamamoto, boy # 5 Battle Royale! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love Hyde, I adore his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little off, but I loved the scene where he danced with the body Man killed kill the other guys. and Gackt was not at all, that's too bad, I chose as his character was kind of aloof from the beginning. nothing much I can say about my background on the lee Hom Wang, I will not pretend to know it, but he carried his own weight with a stellar cast. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji many Taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's not). while the complete song lasts about nine minutes, you would not notice length, because you will enjoy hearing Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is a must-see not only for the fans (huge number of fans ~), but also for those who love fantasy, futuristic films in the Asian style.
