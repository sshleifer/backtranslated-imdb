After seeing this film again proved to be infinitely superior to me this time than the last time I saw him. Act stunningly beautiful. Characters very clearly. Brad Pitt just fine, as a wandering son who rebels. The rest of the actors and actresses equally well in all respects. Robert Redford makes a great period piece from the days of speakeasies 1920s. The scenery is incredibly beautiful mountains and streams of western Montana. Overall, this is one of the best films made in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You have to see this movie! <br /> <br />
