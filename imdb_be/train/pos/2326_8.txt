Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield), until they both start to fall in love with his neighbor Court (Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes, that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart, and their love for each other will never fade away. <br /> <br /> It was truly heartbreaking story about first love. Perhaps the most painful story about young love that I've ever seen. All actions are strange and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance in his first film. I would like to give a man on the moon 8.5 / 10
