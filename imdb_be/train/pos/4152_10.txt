I watched a lot of Cold Case episodes over the years, starting with season 1 episode in 2003-2004. And although most of them were good, that this episode was not only the best of the best, but has a few rivals in the Emmy categories. Although some may disagree with the content of the story (ie male-male romance), I doubt that anyone could look at it without being deeply moved by their spirit. <br /> <br /> The story, in fact, about the case, which was opened on the basis of the testimony of a dying drug dealer. Two central actors of two police officers in the 1960s by the name of Shaun Coop (aka cold case victim, going by the name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In the history of Coop is single, the Vietnam War vet, with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are police partners and form not only friendship, but also the secret relationship that they both have to hide from the deep and clearly homophobic cultures, common at the time. <br /> <br /> retrospective scenes of life mainly in black and white, with color bits now and then penetrate. Examples include their patrol car red, yellow curtains blowing gently in the window in the bedroom, Jimmy, where Jimmy's wife observed Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss each other in a state of alcohol. I found it interesting that only selected items were painted historical scenes, the rest in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and justification. <br /> <br /> Apparently colleagues gomofob tension between patrol and two central actors only increases the intensity of the episode. One of the key emotional scene when the Coop to his father after the child's baptism Jimmy. In this scene, COOP father, Sarge, who was a respected colleague on the force pushes Coop rumors surrounding COOP relationship with Jimmy. You can feel sorry for Coop, at this moment, as the shame Coop Coop father had showered - «You're not going to disgrace our family ... and you are my son, too." -. Clearly demonstrates the hostile views of same-sex relationships that era <br /> <br /> Additional tension can also be seen in the locker room, the police, where Coop and another officer go for it after Coop and Jimmy are designated as "Batman and Robin homos." <br /> <br /> as for the relations between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Jimmy Coop wanted more in his life. Once you can see the stress in Jimmy's face as he must choose between his passion for his wife and children, his church, and yet his undying loyalty to Coop. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jimmy care it from the Coop, realizing that he can not have both Coop and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop could also be killed for his knowledge of drug money and corruption in the police which reached up to force <br /> <br /> The most touching scene in the whole episode was when Coop, as he sat, died from gunshot wounds in his patrol car, quietly uttered his last words on his police radio to your partner.: ". Jimmy ... we were lucky not to forget that. «<br /> <br /> choice of soundtrack was outstanding during the entire episode. I enjoyed the final scene with actor Chad Everett, playing still mourning Jimmy, only much older now, and that is still lacking his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this incident and consider it the best. This is without a doubt the most well-written, well-acted, and well done all the episodes of cold case I've ever seen.
