This may not be memorable classic, but it is a touching romance with an important theme, which emphasizes the importance of literacy in contemporary society and the devastating effects of career and life for any unfortunate person lacks this vital skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who meets a fellow staff her factory job, illiterate cafeteria worker named Stanley. Iris finds that Stanley can not read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. Of course, as would be predicted, two, although initially wary of involvement, to develop feelings for each other ... <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda competently played Iris, a woman with problems on their own, to deal with the vacancies that have no prospects and two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and her husband offensive. However, Robert De Niro, of course, sparkling in his endearing figure intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing dignity to the role that commands respect. They are not your typical charming young yuppie couples, as is usually portrayed on the screen romances, but ordinary working class, the average age of couples with fairly mundane struggle. <br /> <br /> I will not give away the end, but this is a great, touching romance and personal look at the troubling question of illiteracy among the adult population, but also from the point of view of a fictional character.
