......... and you get Alien baby. Do not get me wrong, this film is much less obvious (or not) than beauty, but it is (was) a new theme for Bollywood. This theme has been adopted, but it is far from the semen, kills, and Julia. Honestly, this topic is presented in a very pure form. But the plot is is the number of cliches. The beginning of the film is presented in a very «FILMI» way. There are some very small plot holes. The film raises once Rani has a miscarriage, where you feel that you are watching something other than a regular movie. Otherwise, the entire sequence of the family felt overdone in the beginning. Action could not be better. Salman Khan sometimes surprising and sometimes lets down. And then he gave one of the best performances. In addition, its role is written so well that you justify every time he solves the problem. Rani was adequate. Throughout the film, you feel her character the most, but it is marred by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is picture perfect. Of the three, it gives everyone a run for their money. It's amazing how it can be just as convincing, if it is not to blame. And believe me, Madhubala away from your neighbor. This role is one of the reasons why I appreciate it most. The supporting cast, as the family you see in HAHK, where they are of no importance to the story until I found them reasonable here. The songs are pretty good. The title track is my favorite of them all with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (look at the world in the field of view) are the two songs that fit the film perfectly. Cabaret number, moreover, in the sofa couch (Crazy), may have been reduced while the number one Punjabi caught irritation, although he had a good dance. Otherwise, the film is definitely worth seeing.
