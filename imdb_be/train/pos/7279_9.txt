My grandma bought me this film when I was 5 (I always love horror) and even I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is amazing and the history of original and interesting. I especially love the scene where the RV is under attack in the desert. Rocks really strong for a low-budget film with. Actions above average for this kind of movies and music is terrible. This is certainly, uder-rated gem. I recommend it to anyone who loves these amazing movies from the late seventies, early eighties, such as "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Hospital Massacre" and "The Return of foreigners Deadly Spawn" . Definitely a classic !!
