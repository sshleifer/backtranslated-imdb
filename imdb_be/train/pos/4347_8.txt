I will not go into too much detail about the plot of this film, as the other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the film very much. a performance of Peter Falk is reason enough to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> The small scale of the «Road Trip» film with Falk and Paul Reiser in upstate New York in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film. <br /> <br /> It is very well written with the target audience of adults in the form. Many based on the humor of reality and some well-played drama give the film a sense of what it might be your own family. <br /> <br /> In fact, I can not say about this movie, except that it's a damn shame that a great film as it gets more exposure while the other stuff out there doing stuff. <br /> <br /> it's fine to see Falk with a big leading role human again and he makes the most of it. This proves that his famous friend and writer / director John Casavettes was right in the foundry Falk in many of his groundbreaking films 60s and 70s.
