As someone has already said here, every scene in this movie stone. Most movies, fortunately, there is one scene that is ideal, but the director Zhuison hit a home run every time. Throw only got the right to take on different scenarios, and in addition, musical settings of Dick Hyman opera and other music made for a perfect match. It is hard to imagine how they kept the exact mood going for a long film production. Comedy thin (mostly), and the camera-work reflects every little emotional narrative tone. Cher this comedy course, Vincent Gardenia (that I know of, primarily through its role of Frank Lorenzo to everyone in the family, while I have not seen him in this, and then off-Broadway in the 80 years) deserves more star than he ever received, and Aiello ~ d-x unfortunate loser only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving the prestige of a huge cast. My Zhuison ever wrote about this film? <br /> <br /> I'd love to read it. It is difficult to understand why the average rating is so low ... IMDb
