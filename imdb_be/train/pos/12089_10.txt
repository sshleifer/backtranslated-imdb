<br /> <br /> The film is dominated by dark-haired Barbara Steele, it was obvious when I was seven or eight, and created a permanent image of pale, vampiric men and women intrusive castle, looking for blood. Steel is an icon of horror movies and the otherworldly beauty, and views of the walking dead precede NIGHT Romero Living Dead shamblers, uniting them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I do not see the connection between this film and the chase, which is reasonable, but ambiguous about the forces present. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie without pretention, daring you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There is no such draw persecuted in congested Claire Bloom. Comparison to fascinating surface. <br /> <br /> And no, this film does not have to be redone. Not only that, he is a product of the sixties, but a large percentage of incompetent idiots in Hollywood can not understand Macabre formula for terror. This formula is based on one important factor: good writing. Low-grade classics like the castle and the Poe films with Corman R. Matheson and OUT Tourneur In the past, share a strong common written form. It's simple. Get real writer Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie, and let them put the story in a modern cinematic mess. In addition, even if Hollywood tried some raw material to change and stop the use of a product known to be a beautiful past.
