A great example of "cowboy noir" as it was called, in which the unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses a job because he insists on honesty (he has a bum leg). With nothing to do, what he can do, he decides that this time it will lie. When he walks into a bar, and the owner of Wayne (the late, great JT Walsh) his mistakes for You the man whom Wayne hired to do his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in top form), Michael accompanies and receives money Wayne . * * Then he goes to Susan and tells her about the intentions of their husbands, and makes * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If this is not enough to complicate the real hit man, "Lyle from Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, in a perfect role for him) shows, and Michael even more trouble than before. <br /> <br /> «Red Rock West» gets a lot from their seats. Directed by John Dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother Rick, was smart in realizing the history of building in a really secluded small town that may have seen better days, and in which people can be involved in any form of schemes, it is also fun idea kind of trouble an honest man could get in if they decided to abandon their principles and yield to the temptation of any level. It is noticeably darker and twist-laden story with an assortment of basic symbols, which, if not damaged, have at least been morally compromised as Michael. Lighting cinematographer Mark Reshovsky well in his moodiness; even the climax is set in a cemetery, it gives a pleasant pathological quality of the whole thing. Even if the recording is not particularly "logic or worthy of trust", the film has a nice way to intrigue the audience and draw them just right. <br /> <br /> Cage does a good job in the lead, but his co-star has a great old time sinking their teeth into their fleshy and greed motivated characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh all fun to watch in these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor beautiful as deputies Walshs' (in one particularly good cornering Walsh as the local sheriff), and have an entertaining cameo for country and western star Dwight Yoakam, who also decorates the film with nice titles will be adjusted. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty good little movie worth checking out. It moves forward at an impressive pace, and if nothing else, of course, never boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
