"The Notorious Bettie Page" about a woman who always wanted to be an actress, but instead became one of the most famous women in the history of stabbing America. Bettie Page playing Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America. Type modeling Bettie Page participated in included the bonds of poverty and that lead to the US Senate investigation in 1950. <br /> <br /> Who is from the movie, all I could think about how far we have come in terms of pornography since 1950. You can go online now and find some of the most disturbing and shocking images ever captured the footage in question «The Notorious Bettie Page", it seems, almost childlike and innocent. Most of the footage, including slavery Sun feature nudity when Bettie Page was still involved today we have hurt the image, where we can see a woman having sex with animals. I believe that perhaps the envelope has been pushed too far since 1950, because, looking at the film from the point of view of modern pornography, it was very tastefully done. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was very impressed with "The Notorious Bettie Page," I found the movie is very well done and interesting. The film is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks exactly like Bettie Page and gives a very clear picture. I also thought that since the film was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic, since it made the audience believe that they are watching a film, created in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film was the work seemed to be a few scenes that were cut off, and seemed to be a little shorter than they should be. I watched it, and it seems that 10 minutes had been cut from the film since its initial showing at the Toronto Film Festival. In addition, the ending was pretty tame, and I was expecting a little more of it, or perhaps some of the items, to come to the screen to tell the audience about the life of Bettie Page, where the film left off. This is my only two complaints about the film, except that the direction was tight, the acting was great, especially Gretchen, and the letter was good. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron, who directed "American Psycho", which is one of my favorite movies is the director and the author of «The Notorious Bettie Page." I feel that Mary is a very talented director, who knows, how to create the settings and create big movies based on the character, because like "Psycho», Bettie page is the study of the nature and fine in this. Harron captures the '40s and' 50s with ease, as well as all the characters. She is a very talented director, who I hope will be around for many years <br /> <br /> The result :. «The Notorious Bettie Page" is definitely worth a look. This is a very interesting story that shows how America and the world, has come in terms of pornography. The film also provides excellent performance, Gretchen Mol, which literally nailed the role of Betty Page on the head. And top it off with a talented director who has been able to capture the look of the previous era, and you have a good movie on your hands. Unfortunately, this movie is likely to be a flop, as it is not so much, except the people who have grown up in an era will show interest in the movie, but I think it's worth checking out. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel final rating for «The Notorious Bettie Page" is 8/10. This is an interesting character study of one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in American history.
