What if a platoon of G.I. by the Japanese army had to be sent back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the Tokugawa shogunate? Big step to the right? The film does exactly what it says on the tin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the authors did not bother to explain, as a rule, funny science fiction, sf fetish transport time. No, it is about and why. They just did. However, the transport time sequence trippy as hell, and is quite nice, if not a bit outdated. Not as silly as you might imagine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film should be a prerequisite to a T. But while he loses a little pair with different storylines that follow the advent of the GTRI medieval Japan, picks a fight with a devastating sequence. Undoubtedly, it is the main agenda. The whole concept and the allocation of the film itself, was probably originated from this simple step: what if G.I. Equipped with the latest in modern war had to fight the samurai? And boy does it deliver. <br /> <br /> The main battle sequence that covers more than half an hour, probably one of the best of its kind in the 70's action / war movies. Not only that, he is relentless and exhausting at the pace and length, it is also a terrific mix of styles and techniques that are only unique premises as GI Samurai can deliver. I mean, where else would you get the possibility to distinguish between tanks, Ninjas complete with shuriikens, helicopter and samurai in one shot? GI platoon led by Lieutenant Iba tears literally in hundreds of extras, sprayed them with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This is a mishmash of styles with one foot firmly rooted in sprawling jidai- Geki Kurosawa epic Kagemusha Samurai Banners and Hiroshi Inagaki, while others are in the western action and war movies. There are stylistic touches (eg, other than slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that bring Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari about Keom to mind. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by Westerns and other Hollywood works, and vice versa, and G.I. Samurai easily turns this East meets West in a melting pot of fascinating film. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers gratefully take all this seriously, and benefits greatly from his movie. Not mocking mentality is completely absent, it's just that he's not trying to pander so bad it's good, the audience, who enjoy laughing at his films. The budget was probably huge, as is evident in the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for the production, which is not a traditional Dida-Geki), and special effects. The camera-work and editing all at the highest level, a little better than the movies with high artistic ambitions do not deserve. <br /> <br /> This is not withouts drawbacks or known. There are plenty of "songs" of the scene, where all kinds of 70s of Japanese rock, disco and a mounting play country songs (there is a link stage, the love interest of the scene, "war is hell" scene, etc.). The songs are pretty lame and banal and distract from it all. Despite the fact that the clock on the whooping 140 minutes, it flies like a bullet for the most part. Nevertheless, some of the scenes, retrospective and podagovory in the first half can be clipped to a denser effect. <br /> <br /> The cast also deserves a mention, featuring such well-known names like Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyazhi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf), Tsunhiko Uotas (Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, they are hitting the right notes.
