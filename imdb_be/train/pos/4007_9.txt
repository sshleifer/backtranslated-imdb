Hard surprisingly clever piece of work from a talented British writer Qureshi, who wrote Â«My Beautiful Laundry" (this is the best thing he has done since). We are talking about reasonable people whose lives are not built up much. They have squandered what they were given, and largely empty vessels. The only character on the screen, the name of his mother who lived until she feels dead inside, while rough handyman Sun shows her some affection and awaken her to the joys of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treat it with a fair compassion. This is a film in which people and a place to feel familiar, where the characters exist beyond the screen. In some ways, this is a bit like "Sunday Bloody Sunday", but it is generally more rigid part of the job. Directed by Roger Michell, it allows you to build the scene instinctively. And it's great acting. <br /> <br /> In the eponymous mother of Anne Reid betray her wasted life in every gesture. There is not a false note in her very lived-in performance, and that is very wonderful actor Daniel Craig shows shading his character than even Kureishi wholly enjoyed. If the film strikes a false note is perhaps in the nature of talentless daughter, who find themselves in dirty stories with a man her mother seduces (or should that be the other way around), and even messier life, but she's so good at playing Cathryn Bradshaw she catches you in the not less. The film is also very nice to look at (DOP Alwin Kuchler) i should be treated, do not hesitate, as the best British film of the year.
