Many strings attached is not one of the best performances of Mensa to date. Mencia known to poke ridicule and racial problems. However, it does more than this stand-up performance, which took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencía material not only make you laugh, but it also makes you think about what actually happened to society today. <br /> <br /> In this hour long performance, Mencia says things such as illegal immigration, that women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion of the Passion of Christ by Mel Gibson and argument that he was in with a woman about it or not, it depends on Jesus, and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally disabled. Mencia even discussing whether one should have the right to speak out and tell an anecdote. <br /> <br /> Mensah is not afraid to offend that many times gets him in trouble with his critics. For example, he does not go more far (and he admits it) with a joke about the Pope John Paul II, the and that he is likely to do in the sky right now. <br /> <br /> The main message Mencía in all his speeches that we should all have a voice, and we should use that voice to speak what we feel, and do not be afraid to offend. He reminds us that we have the right to freedom of expression, and that we should use this right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you like this performance, I would definitely recommend watching Mind Mencia, his show on Comedy Central.
