The film is about wannabee-x, have never been and x is less than the heroes, making it against the odds. Where we have heard that before. But if you are unlucky, spoonbill Blue Raja Mr.Furious and you know that this is not your usual rags to riches stories. <br /> <br /> The classic presentation of Eddie Izzard, Tony P. one of the boys Disco leaders and Geoffrey Rush as the Arch Villain show actual thought went into the casting. <br /> <br /> Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance, an odd choice for the role of Captain Amazing is in place. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you are sick comic gone- film stereotypes. Why is anger can not be a superpower?
