This film brings many classic movie old memories, where actors do not take their clothes to the audience watching their movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think the main advantage of this movie a strange chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it is definitely making the film. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of comments about the film being annoying and too wet. In response to this, I think that to some extent this is a correct analysis, but given that this is a film Barjatya I think that compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been reduced significantly. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, when the sentimental moments come, you are smiling, wanting a promising couple all the best and hope that nothing bad will happen to them. <br /> <br /> Another important advantage is the performance Shahid and Amrita. Both worked very well, especially Shahid, who looks great in the movie. Amrita looks stunning and should be taken seriously as a major star of the future. <br /> <br /> Although I really liked the film as a whole, I feel that it was too long. Some of the middle can be cut off and it would be possible to make even more of an impact. I also think that music, although it fits into the film when you see the situation a little bit old-fashioned, and the film would help if more refined sound was available. Although picturisation songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein excellent. <br /> <br /> In general, I would definitely recommend this film, his romantic, looks great and has a dramatic climax (I will not go into details, just in case you have not seen it. <br /> <br /> PS. If you are prone to weeping takes tissue! (I had a few)
