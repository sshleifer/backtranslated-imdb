That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This monster movie (musical) was recognized as appropriate for the children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The boy goes on a magical journey to the island, mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, supposedly a dragon is more like a newt with conjunctivitis and charming to me to say the flute is a witch (Billie Holliday, who was considered the "little good" in time). <br /> <br /> flute restored to "interesting" witches convention with witches who have gay old time. Boy dress-up clothes, then as the "fairy" to return the flute. <br /> <br /> not suitable for children.
