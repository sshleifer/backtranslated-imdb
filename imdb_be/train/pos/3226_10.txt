I do not remember this movie, getting the release movies here. I saw him only when he came to the cable. The film deals with the dehumanizing children killing machines. In particular, one person, it is replaced and discharges (literally) to offset the global community in which he finds himself unable to cope with the coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that many people expected that it would be Rambo in space, and would be happy if it was <br /> <br /> I am certainly happy that was' nt. - Kurt does an excellent job to sketch an emotional cripple. The scene in which he was sitting outside the compound shows that it is, even though a decision within two words-mo replays detract from the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not the classic SF movie so that Bladerunner, Alien, quiet operation, run or THX1138 Logan had, but unfortunately the nearest I've seen it for a long time. <br /> <br /> it changes into a movie in true extent he does'nt Arnie crack one liners he does'nt become Snake Plissken and definative no happy ending. <br /> <br /> That's why this film did'nt well. He did'nt follow the formula, and among the 18-25 year old target American audience that is inexcusable, as it was'nt that they expected to see. <br /> <br /> fear and discipline. <br /> <br /> Always.
