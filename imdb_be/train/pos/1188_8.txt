I was initially dubious about this film (just because of the subject), but richly drawn characters, fairy tale scenes of hunting buffalo, and a dramatic conclusion to make it well worth a look. Initially I had problems with the recognition of the two buffalo hunters, but as the movie progressed they decided more. I am still haunted by the final scene.
