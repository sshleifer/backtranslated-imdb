Syntax The future as seen in 1939 in England. As war loomed in Europe, the salvation of humanity will not be found in the policies of the past. It's up to the brave new world of science, to overcome past mistakes person. <br /> <br /> The concept relative to the viewer Beware of your leaders and what you said. Thinking outside the box may lead to a brighter tomorrow. There will always be running and fear, and to learn to overcome it is our only hope. <br /> <br /> pros and cons, I saw this movie for a long time and recently downloaded it from the Internet (it is in society domain). This fascinating work at different levels. Since the story about the future, as can be seen from 1939, it has obvious shortcomings. This vision of the future as a terrible and capricious. This film was cutting edge for its day. The special effects are very good, as is the storyline. Actions suffers a bit in the British theatrical sense, in that it can be tilted slightly to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is the fact that science and technology can solve all our problems, we now know, is not always true. Film another story line is that charismatic leaders bane of human existence, and will probably always be with us. <br /> <br /> In the background of almost all subsequent science fiction films you can see in this movie. Set design and wardrobe "Forbidden Planet", failures of the technology in "2001: A Space OdessyÂ», even the magnificent scenery / Cityscapes of "Star Wars" is obliged to a certain amount of inspiration for this film <br /> <br. /> The finale of the film leaves the viewer a little surprised. While optimism is in its final sequence reaching for the stars, we are left to wonder when mankind will ever be able to do it. Even when we arrive, there are those who are trying to hold us back. This vision of the future films, as well as an interesting bit of humor by today's standards. Huge flying machine and gun, which can shoot a man into space never materialize in the real world, but in 1939 they were recognized as the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Many of the great British actors in this film, as young men. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson is the most famous and their public speaking skills is evident here. Raymond Massey curious choice to play the main character, Cabel. His character comes across almost like a new Christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece of cinema history, whose themes are still relevant today, even if his vision had missed.
