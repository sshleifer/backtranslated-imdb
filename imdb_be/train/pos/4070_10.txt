I know the anime. I was in this long before he became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people know that Dragonball Z was even. And just so you know, I do not brag about my, let me say this: of all the anime I've seen a castle in the sky, is certainly one of the best. It's obvious people say Gone is the best, but I do not agree. Most people only know the movie because he's one for the award Acedmy; it is not an exaggeration - I showed Princess Mononoke Castle in the sky for people who have only ever seen Gone, and they agree that the last two are the highest of the three. Personally, I would never have thought that anything can be compared to Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw the castle in the sky. I still believe that to the better of the two, but the castle in the sky, easily on a par with them; in many respects, the castle has the basic elements that are missing Mononoke. In any case, if you only saw Gone, and I think that is the best movie of Miyazaki, get ready to have your ground swayed.
