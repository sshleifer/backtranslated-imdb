Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She's a waitress for Speakeasy father in a small mining town crummy. It also sells her man. She runs away to New York and literally sleeps her way to the top <br /> <br /> Initially, I only saw the 71 minute version, but it's pretty extreme. - for its time. Currently, it's pretty tame. The film moves very quickly and has a lot of sexual innuendo - some of them comes off as a bit silly (but fun) today. It moves so fast, you can easily ignore the fact that most of them could never happen - even in 1933. There's nothing classical or monumental about it - it's just a fast, gleefully dirty little movie, a lot of fun. It only breaks down at the end with a little "moral" ending, that the censors demanded. He comes across as incredibly stupid and (I saw it in the theater, and the audience laughed at her - a man quite rightly said, "No way"), I have just seen the uncut 75 minute version, which has a different, more tragically and much better than the end of this version is not thought lost until 2004, when she was discovered by mistake I believe that this is the only release -.! but be aware <br /> <br /> action well -. Stanwyck jumps in her role and it plays the way from the top. it makes you believe that she loves to be tough and sleep around. There is also a strong subtree ymlivayuts performances with beautiful Donald Cook and George Brent. Also pay attention to the pre-stars John Wayne in a cheerful little like a gentle and soft office worker! Fun, fast and dirty. I give it 9.
