Personally, I loved Cut thouroughly. It was the first time I saw the theatrical release of the Australian slasher flick. Genre usually limited to mainstream Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> With all the usual cook comedies and the drama come from Australia, I enjoyed being able to see homegrown horror film that was not a rip off anything. I do not even think it was actually a parody of other movies. It was a supernatural horror theme as A Nightmare on Elm Street, Sun Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, and therefore there was more suspension of disbelief. I think it's time Australian films have tried to get more into the main genres. <br /> <br /> Cut was the original, scary enough, and ultimately just a bit of fun. I would give it a seven out of ten and will not treat it as anything serious. He did what I expected it to do, entertain and scare me enough time to be satisfactory. I enjoyed it.
