Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought it would be some dumb children's movie, and it's absolutely not. It was so unbelievably funny for everyone, adults and children. I saw it once because it was almost out of the theaters, and now it's finally coming out on DVD this Tuesday and I was excited the way, as you can see. you should definitely see it if you have not already, it was so cool! <br /> <br /> Liz
