Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably the funniest. Delirious best stand-up comedy I have ever seen, and it should be for those who love a good laugh !! I watched this movie a hundred times and every time I see it - I still side splitting fun. This is definitely one for the video library. I guarantee that you will watch it a few times to hear all the jokes, because you will laugh so much - what you miss half of them! Delirious oars <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there are a lot of funny comedians out there - after watching this stand-up comedy, most of them will seem like second-class citizens. If you've never seen it - get it, watch it - and you'll love it !! This will make you scream !!! :-)
