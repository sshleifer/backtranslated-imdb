This is a collection of documentary films, which last 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame of artists worldwide. Documentary films are diverse and deals with a variety of native concepts, the only shared it 9/11 as a theme (very small in some cases). Some weak segments while others are very strong; some political, some are not; some of them are only about 9/11, some just use 9/11 as a theme touch human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; Some mainstream while others are abstract and art). This film was not censorship in any way for any thoughts so that you can see, very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think that the two segments can really mark the right wing tick (one from Egypt, where the dead American soldiers and a dead Palestinian suicide bomber returned to the spirits, even from the UK, which lists the US-backed overthrow of Chile, September 11, 1973, which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrific atrocities). Mexico was the strongest segment, listing drop towers, and as a result of the death in a vivid fashion (you have to see it to believe it). <br /> <br /> While the final product is not uniform, some segments are almost "useless", I still recommend it. It is very difficult to classify this film, because the segments vary throughout (some are weak, some are very powerful;). I give the rating of 9 out of 10 just because some segments were fine and the issues which are generally prepared to censor (Mexico segment, the segment of the United Kingdom, Japan segment, segment Egypt).
