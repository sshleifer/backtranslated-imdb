American film debut Greta Garbo analogy of how our lives can be swept away, and we know the fate of our actions, both in the flow, causing us to lose a part of yourself along the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with the character of Ricardo Cortes Don Rafael, landlord. Ricardo's in love with her too, but too easily influenced by his domineering mother. Leonora ends homeless and went to Paris, where she became a famous opera singer and developed a reputation for being a whore. In fact, some of it bitter relations over the abandonment of Rafael. <br /> <br /> She returns to her home to visit her family, and eventually puts Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that it is the famous La Brunna Garbo and acts to its role as a diva, she was really appreciated and again with Cool arrogance in her latest drawings. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortes reminds a lot of Valentine's looks in this part, and he was groomed to be a clone of the MGM Valentino, although he never thought he could be the reality, and he was right. He is believable in a stale part as a weak-willed boy mom, and allows himself to age realistic, but comical at the end of the film. He can not win Leonora, when she returns home, and then when he goes after her, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This film is beautifully shot, with brilliant lightning sequences and lots of pointing to Spain at the time, is an authentic look. There are also some fine secondary performances veteran Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall, and Mack Swain. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is a story about lost love and missed opportunities, I do not think that Leonora and Raphael would have been happy together, as it needs to be a more traditional wife, and she was very career woman, and I do not think I would have been happy in a small village. The ending is a fact of life, and pulls no punches. <br /> <br /> See this as an American film debut Garbo and precursors of things to come
