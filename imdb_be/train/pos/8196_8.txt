I do not know why people think that this is a bad film. Its got quite a good story, good acting and a change of location for Harry did not hurt either. Of course, some of his offensive and gratuitous, but it is not the only film like this. Eastwood is in good shape as Dirty Harry, and I loved Hingle in this film, as a small town cop. If you like Dirty Harry, then you should see this one, it is much better than DEAD POOL. 4/5
