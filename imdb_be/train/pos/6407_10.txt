I went to this movie in the cast and crew show call my friend, who is a movie producer asked me. Forget what you've seen in advertising, forget what you've heard, go see the movie for yourself. I was more than surprised by this. In the world of The Grinch, Charlie's Angels, Day 6th, Unbreakable, here is a film that is worth your hard earned bucks! Nice scene, great cinemtrophy and cast you want to eat the heart. I found it to be one of the years most films planned power and wisely. Robert De Niro deserves a nod OSCAR. If you could give an Oscar to everyone involved in the package, it will be a movie.
