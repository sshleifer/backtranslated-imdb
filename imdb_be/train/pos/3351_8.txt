Very good western.This was first author Richard Wilson, director of the film, as it was the first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It's nice to see a young and very pretty girl Angie Dickinson in the cabin. Robert Mitch comes to this city, which is dominated by rogue states and hired as city handler, but people are worried that it will go too far, and the harm that it will do for the town's businesses. There are some similarities in the story of "Warlock", which was made in 1959, this film holds up very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you on the edge.
