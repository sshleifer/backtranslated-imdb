I remember watching this film, thinking it was so interesting. I really wanted to know what happens next. I was amazed at how they can fit into an 8-minute short-circuiting. We begin in the schoolyard. , Two friends are discussing on skipping class. Kid B says Kid A "Let's not go to class today." And the kid refuses, claiming that they might miss something really important. So baby B jumps and small are in a class. When he gets there the teacher tells him that today they are going to learn only the most important lesson they ever learn. they're going to find out the meaning of life. it gives everyone a pamphlet, and when it hits the baby, she runs and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid is not will be shared, so kid goes in search of a teacher. When he finally tse, finds it, he gets the shocking revelation that the true meaning of life. I invite all to watch this short. It takes only 8 minutes out of your life, but the message is so important, it can help you for a lifetime.
