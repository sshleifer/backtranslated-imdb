Zucker directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this stupid farce. Yes, this question is an acquired taste and it depends on the abundance of babble gags, but it's always funny in the last unlike some comedic effort. The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes, from the very obvious to a finer mind that you need to pay attention to everything in the frame, or you're likely to skip them. Like his previous efforts, which include the "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "The Naked Gun" humor flies almost every second. There are so many things that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What distinguishes this film from other pale imitations in a parody of the genre is that he has an actual storyline. While others depended too much to make fun of famous scenes almost casual films (take the "Mafia", please), the film tells a new story with cute characters. It affects sports movies in general, as well as a real satirical lampooning sports industry instead of any specific films. Even for people who do not care about «South Park», its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, to make a good pair of leading actors of genuine chemistry. The film also makes extremely efficient use of the Kama athletes, sports announcers and other celebrities, especially cheerful little Robert Stack "unsolved mystery." By the way, the loan tenure for the final jokes with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. In general, Zucker reached, the words may be applied to a mixture of sports movie, soak the house.
