It's amazing, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If there is such a thing as "smart" horror movies, this film it. I began to be afraid and sorry that someone else was watching it with me, and it is unlikely to have a plot! I'll have to see this film again several times before I feel that I really understand. If you're the kind of person who likes to "My Dinner with Andre" and the films of Godard, or if you are doing a lot of psychotropic drugs, you will probably enjoy this film. Wow.
