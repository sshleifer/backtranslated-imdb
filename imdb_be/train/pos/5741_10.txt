One of my favorite movies that I've seen in the preview in Seattle. Meanwhile Khalsa was strange, with outpatient words can convey your feelings / thoughts. I actually sent Mike Ferrell some donations of money to help get the film distributed. That's good. The system says that you need more lines, but does not want to give away plot thing. I was in the audience in Seattle with Hulce and director, a writer, I think, and Mike Ferrell. They talked for about an hour epilogue. Not quite dry eye in the house. Why Hollywood continues to be stupid, I do not know. (In fact, I know it's our fault, look what we have seen) Well you get what you pay for a guy. Get it and see it with someone special. This is a gem.
