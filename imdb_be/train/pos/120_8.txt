This is not the work of each film to stimulate you superficially. I'll take more ambitious failure hit the mass market in any given day. Although it really can not be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. This decoding quality torment me watch it again and again. This is a complex, provocative film that does not wrap things up neatly. The problem with the film in its structure. His impenetrable plot seems to be winding, as well as a second end fastened. While all technically dazzling film definitely too long for this device. The long-awaited culmination of awakening Leo arrives about 20 minutes later. <br /> <br /> more film often comes at the expense of a decent script, but this innovative camera technology offers a lot of visual ideas. Compositing artificiality is provocative and interesting; The character is a rear projected, but his own hand in the foreground does not. World depicted intentional insidious and absurd. Keep your eyes peeled for a memorable, technically strange murders that will make your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> The compositions staggering. Who would choose to release (out of print), a video cassette into the pan and scan format should not be, never seen him. Where the DVD? <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible how anyone could give it a bad review many of the original. You should see it at least once. You get the feeling that von Trier has bitten off more than he can chew, but the film ends up richer than him. I suspect that he is familiar with a foreign correspondent Hitchcock, in which cunning Europeans manipulate American fool Wells and several films that take the mad joy in the technique as well as he does. All movies von Trier to investigate the plight of the middle of relentless Naif societies. After Zentropa, von Trier moved away from this type of experiment brash technical relative to a boring overestimated, Vona-nuanced juice as Breaking waves and dancing in the dark.
