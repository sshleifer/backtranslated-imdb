Yes, I did, as I sit here, red-faced, remembering felt almost guilty when I watched it a couple of weeks ago while my wife decided to look at something as insignificant (in comparison), as "Mummy Dearest». <br /> <br /> How do you explain the appeal of "Batman and Robin" - I mean the only ones who ever really counted, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible show, with horrible stories and terrible action - and, oh yes, it was very funny! And the same applies to the "reunification" and "retrospective" films. Adam and Burt invited to the auction, where the old Batmobile is going to sell for charity. But it will be stolen, and our friends (as themselves), jump in the person of his old characters (if not their costumes) and head to find out what happened. Along the way, they think of the series, and we can see how it all came together in retrospect, with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden play young Adam and Burt television series. It really was very interesting to get some behind the scenes looks at the old series, and Adam and Burt just went back to the very character (despite the fact that they were not really the nature - well, you have to look to see what I mean). It was also nice to see, Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you're not a supporter of the old series, you'll hate it. If - forbid - you actually thought that Michael Keaton and George Clooney made acceptable «Batmans», then you'll hate it even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt, and are still willing to admit that you never miss an episode. - Well, this one is for you <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true - 9/10
