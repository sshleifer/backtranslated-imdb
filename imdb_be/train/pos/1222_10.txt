I spied this short on the DVD of the best of New Zealand shorts, everything is fine, but the French doors was amazing. It begins slowly and you wonder if there is anything going to happen. Just as you relax in the hum drum home renovation, the spookiest thing. <br /> <br /> EEEEkkk, I would stop watching, but I was stuck. <br /> <br /> The film dips into the primal fear of the dark and with little, if not any special effects. He cools you right to the bone. A simple but brilliant concept opens up all these memories, when I was young and dream't the most unlikely, but frightening situations. <br /> <br /> filmmakers visual style drumming and the protagonist takes you through the story convincingly. This quality is short, I have not seen in awhile. <br /> <br /> French doors have all the features of a large function, unfortunately ends after ten minutes or so. Nevertheless, a great ending, which asks you to want to know more. <br /> <br /> I loved it and well done and thank you for the trip. These New Zealanders really proving talent. <br /> <br /> The new fan.
