Kolchak existing entertainment. Great history and a great cast, and nothing more, to weigh it down. Darren McGavin provides spirited performance that pulls the audience along with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin kind of solid support that most of the leading actors can only dream of having. Some outstanding guest stars to add color and inspiration in some episodes - Erik Estrada in the Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in the heights, Antonio Fargas into zombies. It is easy to see how adolescence spent watching Kolchak forced Chris Carter set up The X Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
