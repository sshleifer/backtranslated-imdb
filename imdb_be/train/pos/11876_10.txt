I know when one looks at this film, Brian DePalma today, I'm sure there have been endowed with criticism that it dated. In addition, on violence. When I looked at this film on VHS, when I was 20, I thought it was ulta-strong and the sand as well. But I did not get "it". <br /> <br /> A few decades and people go, how do I know how much I did not get in this movie !! This is a remake of the miraculous that was made back in the 30s / 40s. How can you improve a classic? I do not. But you have to tell the tale, which brought up to date through the eyes of the "new immigrants" for much greed-ridden decade, more lenient 80s. DePalma, the stone and the gang are ambitious, disturbing and a darn good movie right. <br /> <br /> To die .... Disco and New Wave / Punk took longer, but these immigrants from Cuba, who had to make a new home in Florida can not tell the difference. It was interesting, it was what they wanted, but how to get it ???? For these immigrants, there is only one way to get it in Florida, where they were..by having a lot of money and get the money, you had to take over running the drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been fantastic for me as Tony Montana, "the little train that could." What a strange way to have your main character to look at America: fight, to kill, to steal. lies, deception everything to gain - "money, women and power." <br /> <br /> That's what Tony saw the American dream <br /> <br /> He wanted, he wanted to live and his entourage did not see anything wrong with that, as he went to get it. Team Tony Montana English was heavily saturated with «F» word, but what are you waiting for, Emily Post of girls for him and his colleagues Horts? See how they came to America, they knew that they were exposed to. This is the way Tony and his team decided to "be all they can be in America." It's all about power. Tony Montana would have done everything to achieve it..it all his violence, lying, stealing, crooked, thieving glory. <br /> <br /> As part of the film, which is embodied in the 1980 to me, it is money laundering. Crew Tony bringing bags of drug money banks. Do those around Tony and his care of the crew? In clubs, where he spent drinking? No. Money was money, and the money, you get the power. Tony is living high off the hog. He and his pretty blond American trophy he married Michelle Pfieffer played well. <br /> <br /> After the arrival of Tony Montana to power, he learns that it's really crappy there. He laced with doubt, he is addicted drug, it is paranoid, he is surrounded by those who want to take him in a bloody acceptance, his American blonde trophy wife addict 80, he learns that it is boring, it needs to keep on top of his empire, because .. . he goes down. And he goes down in a terrible rigid fashion, but then again I ask, what are you waiting for? <br /> <br /> This is the quintessence of the 1980 film, which tells you a distorted story about how some people understand the American dream ... an obsession. It is a strong, bloody, too so..but stimulated exciting point home. Not all Cubans thrown out of Cuba, landed in Florida in the 80s there was something like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But to show how poor the 1980s was its emphasis on greed and money as a common action in the US to "be someone" and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their life in America. <br /> <br /> Makes you wonder - is there anything since then - have learned today?
