I remember this movie years ago, I think, BBC2. I would really like to see it again - does anyone know, how can I get a copy? As I recall, it was especially powerful movie, in particular, a scene that stands out, horses wearing gas masks. Also, I really can not remember too much about the history - that's why I want to see him again! I trawl the internet, but I can not find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - may not have a DVD or VHS of the film on the market. I would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this. Many thanks in advance for your help. Best Regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
