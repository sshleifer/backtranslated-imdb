When our local television station first run, he filled a large part of its schedule with the old British programming. "Lock Up Your Daughters!" It was properly in the air, and I - under the influence of the opening few seconds of the film - insert a blank tape. The best thing I ever did. <br /> <br /> The actors are perfect for their characters and bring them to life beautiful, complete with matching accents (Foppington Christopher Plummer will leave you in stitches, as will be nimble and her family), ambiguity have a lot of land line wheel inside the circle to mix and match characters, funny gags are hidden in each scene, and risky comments made on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> I showed the film to friends a few years ago, and they called the piece "Lost Treasure", as much for the actors, as well as for the history. On this day, I can crack up just thinking about the dialogue. If the stone if or find your way to the release of DVD, I'll be on the front line.
