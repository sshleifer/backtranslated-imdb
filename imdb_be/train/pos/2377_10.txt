I waited a long time for someone to take the correct version of the classic novel H.G. Wells' "War of the Worlds." Timothy Hines finally made it! I just could not believe how good it was! From action to suits, broken, this world special effects, I just can not say enough! It was great! Dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performances in the top-notch cast! It must be seen to be believed. I'm sure that did not. And I read all the negative comments from others, and can not believe what they were saying. We must have watched a different movie, huh? And those real bad comments on this vepsaian guy, the guy who he is, well, he just does not know what he says. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, Mr. Hines.
