I love this show, as it is action packed with adventure, love and intrigue. Well, I like a few times! It's so nice to see a show, where all the characters work well together, and they treat each other with respect. It is also very good this Dick Van Dyke in the television role, as I have only seen it in Mary Poppins. a mixture of the protagonists, Marc, Amanda, Jesse and Steve really capturing the audience. This is a show you must watch!
