Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave all the people the ability to love the whole world, but considering that the human heart is very small in size, each person has a special place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that it might have been the motto of some of the most prominent directors of our time, when they are taught to profess eternal love for this special place and reflect the situation in the life of its inhabitants and visitors. The result is a beautiful collection of short films, Paris Je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Koysaet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on an exciting walk through Paris, the human districts feelings, desires and expectations. <, Br /> <br /> always some other quarter are always some very touching story about the lives of ordinary people in search of love, whether it's in the parking lot, the art studio, the metro station. And Paris Je t'aime of the huge array loves- love for your partner, child, father, for those who meant the world to us, but no longer around, love that needs to be revived, fluke love for this stranger, as your eyes meet, or love, just I wanted to be ... today, tomorrow- but who knows? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this film is not only about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, the daily ups and downs. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not at all sentimental and warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I give this film 9, because in the final part of this shows how some of the stories can be developed further, but not all of them, and that is something that I think is not enough, and "further development" I do not mean any specific reference to the future of the characters. As far as everything else is concerned, I can only say- fun. It makes you want to leave it all behind you, escape to Paris and live these little romances themselves.
