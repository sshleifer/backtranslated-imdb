Unfortunately, 8 Simple Rules, were the last sitcom that John Ritter began working on after his tragic death in 2003, he was one of my favorite actors. He had it all, comedy (who can forget it in Three companies), but he also was an excellent dramatic actor (Unforgivable ?? worth watching TV movie) How I loved all the other actors of the series (Katya Hey, Kaylee, and Martin) John was the star, he was a lot of reasons I was drawn to the show in the first place, and this was his perfect comedic delivery, which has been able to crack me up every time. <br /> <br /> I loved how the show was not annoyingly sweet (just as I have loved Cosby show, let us, they were very kind to each other lol) they painted the typical dynamics of the family brilliantly. It was enough that realistic with all related rivalry and discord between the parents, but they still kept it funny. Many American comedies try to fill the show entirely with morality and what is not, and this show did not do it. Yes, there were some, how to deal with important issues such as drugs and bullying, but they did not try and be anything but funny family comedy. <br /> <br /> The way they wrote the death of John was brilliantly done before the show, I still cry like a baby every time I see it. You can feel the raw emotions were those incredibly heavy episodes. <br /> <br /> I am sad that the show was canceled, I still enjoy watching the replays, and I never get tired of it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will always remember, for your hilarious description of this over protective father, who would prefer to close their daughters in their room than their subsidize boy =) you swing Ritter !!!
