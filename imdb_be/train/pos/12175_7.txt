What would you say about a man who is going to get married and have his bachelor party with some of his closest friends on the Hawaiian guy bar? Everything went smoothly until he takes his "bachelor party hat" is. What would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancing and then sleep with her? What would you say if the exact girl was a cousin of his finances? A new low, is not it? Well, Paul Coleman, playing comic Jason Lee, leads this experience in a sickening blur and a new low. I must say that this is one of his good leading role. However, I believe that his role in Vanilla Sky was better to act. <br /> <br /> His finances after Karen plays up and down the actress Selma Blair, while the character Karen, Becky, played by the beautiful and talented Julia Stiles. Going back to where we left off, Paul now has to deal with problems that arise in one another. He gets the disease, we have to deal with some people, and to play games with their lies cunning or any member of each of the families could get P.O'ed, including one of his relatives, which was not a "bowel movement" within 14 days. Vomiting it all leads to a long-awaited wedding with a fun scene before he was summing up all the hell that Paul and his brother had to go. <br /> <br /> in general, a Guy Thing pretty funny and good. Sometimes history can not seem to go anywhere and get tired of the scene here and there, but it is a mixed film. and if uc Infernal and fellow supporter Butt sitcoms CTV Brett, Corner Gas, you would recognize a small role played by Fred Ewanick, the same person who is fun to play Hank in the series. This movie is all right. It's another feather in the hat Lee (fairly empty caps so far, however) <br /> <br /> My rating :. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
