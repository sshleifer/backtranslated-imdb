For what it is, "Youth Victor Vargas" is about as close to perfect as a film can get. Or obvious genius with a fledgling filmmaker, or just one of those lucky mixtures where everything clicked (probably some of each), it's just a little piece-of-town life of ethnic first love Flick specifies its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds. The film begins with a strong aroma, "the street", but it works its way into the Latino family business, and then focuses on the story that says a lot about the youth of uncertainty and deep natural desire to love others. In my experience, it has never been so much done so little (throwing TYROS, novice director, etc.). Praise by critics, but not all, "Youth Victor Vargas" is recommended for fans of indie and realists in the simple stories of rich humanity. (A)
