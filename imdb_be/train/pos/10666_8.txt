If I really became interested in movies at the age of eleven years old, I had a big list of "must see" movies, and I would go to Blockbuster and rent a two or three over the weekend; some of them were not for all the spectators and my mom would go nuts. I remember one of the films on the list was a "chorus" and could never get it; so now to see that it is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> Of course, I lost my list and I would do anything to get it back, because I think there were some really interesting things to watch there. I mean, take the «A Chorus Line», stage of the game turned into a film. I know that this is what we see a lot nowadays, but back then it was a little bit different, apparently, and this film has something special, <br /> <br /> Most of the musical films made today, take a chance camera gives them free to create different landscapes and take the characters in different places. "A Chorus Line" was born on the stage in the play, and he died in the same place as in the movies. After a great audition held by a recognized choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough sends a large number of dancers as they try to get a job <br /> <br /> Everything happens on the same day :. Stress, not knowing ,, the stress of having to learn the numbers tacit competition between the dancers ?? and all this is happening on the stage, where Douglas each dancer put on the spotlight and make them talk about their personal lives and their most terrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers, and they are all fantastic, but they list shortened as the clock runs. <br /> <br /> As with the movie I've seen recently, "A Prairie Home Companion" radio show broadcast, Atenborough here is dealing with the problem of succession. On or behind the scenes, things are happening, and time seems to stop. Again, I'm not cut out when Atenborough shoot a lot, but it's not exactly like that; and in any case it is a great directing and editing (John Bloom) work. But in this small stage, what you're wondering what to do with the camera ?? With only one parameter, cinematography Ronnie Taylor finds its way, making close-up on certain characters, change the scale, showing the scene from different angles and. also gives us a beautiful view of New York <br /> <br /> in one decisive moment, Douglas says those who remained: "Before you start eliminating: you're gorgeous, and I would like to hire you all, but I can not. " It made me think of the reality TV show today, where the only thing that matters is singing or dancing talent and where judges are always saying that the exact words for the contestants to some of them go (even if they are not good). It's difficult, you have to imagine; at least here, where they are really amazing. <br /> <br /> In order to tell some of the stories, the characters use the songs, and in one second, the stage takes on a new life, and it is literally a "dream come true. Music Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Edward Kleban do theater for the transition of the film without flaws, revealing the feelings of these dancers and allowing them to do these wonderful choreography by Michael Bennett. Book at the theater also becomes flawless and very short script Arnold Schulman; which is very touching at times. So if it's not a song it will be with the word; but «A Chorus Line», it is impossible not to be moved. <br /> <br /> During a rehearsal breaks in listening, Cassie, a special dancer plays Alyson Reed, comes on stage to convince Douglas's character that she can do it. The words "let me dance for you" has never sounded more honest and beautifully put into music and lyrics.
