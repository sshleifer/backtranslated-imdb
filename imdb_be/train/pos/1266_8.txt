I have read some of the previous comments that say that this film loses steam before the end of the film, and that it has the same end of the Cape Fear. I totally disagree. I'm going to give a simple overview for ordinary moviegoers there. I thought it was perfect casting. I thought it was one of the best performances of Ed Harris. What an evil psychopath !!! I have great respect for his actions after watching his performance in this film. I was chained throughout the film. If you love mystery thriller, this is definitely a movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Johansson in the film. This film is filled with top stars, and I highly recommend it!
