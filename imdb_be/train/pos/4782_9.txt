Well, it's certainly unlike anything else other director Lynch. A lot of weird things, no violence, no profanity. Nevertheless, this is a great movie. It's a little slow, but perhaps it was deliberate, because it is the old story of 6 weeks (this is my guess on its duration) path. Characters are ordinary people and, therefore, they truthfully. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. Anyone who has a sibling can relate to it. Lyle and Alvin did not even have to say anything. For a moment they were back in the old days, and all fighting forgotten.
