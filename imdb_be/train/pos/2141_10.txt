Masayuki Suo, who removed the thin film on the role. After a decent «Fancy Dance» and the classic (in Japan anyway) college sumo comedy "Chico Funjatta», Suo was their huge steps smashing success. <br /> <br /> The history is interesting. We both laugh often (Naoto Takenaka oars, as it is in the two previous films them) and really root for the characters. But the big bonus of this film look to me gives the viewer in Japanese society - the real life in Japan. Suo has a knack for showing real events with an entertaining atmosphere. As a result, a film that will pull you in, make you laugh, make you think, and how to entertain you and to give you an idea of ​​modern Japan. <br /> <br /> Also, pay attention to the main actors with 8 Chico Funjatta, as they all reappear in various roles with the secondary characters (TAKENAKA) short cameos (a lot).
