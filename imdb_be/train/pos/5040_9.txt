I first saw Frailty trailer on Yahoo Movies way back in the day, after hearing a Stephen King praise him to the skies. Nya really a fan of the star, I still wanted to see it because I'm a big fan of the thriller. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The action was great, especially with two little boys. I used to hate the children of actors, but the young and the young Adam Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton is really a good job directing it too. It was beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> It is also necessary to note the plot twists and turns. Three twisted end hit hard and fast, and I did not see them coming. The final twist of the film, combined with the seriousness of what has just been discovered, gives me chills to this day, despite the fact that I am a movie so many times over looked. <br /> <br /> A true gem,
