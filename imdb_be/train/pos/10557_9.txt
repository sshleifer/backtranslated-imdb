Just I saw this at the International Film Festival in Vancouver in 2003, and it was funny as hell and a little surreal. It takes place in Toronto, where these two losers live in this old house in the center of the highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are great as two losers who wish the world would just go away. Action, dialogue and write very well, and the entire film looks great for such a low-budget film with. Director / Writer Vincenzo Natali was present at the screening, and he seemed so smart and down to earth. This guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well in a small budget, it puts a big budget Hollywood crap shame!
