I first saw this movie when it was shown at the now defunct Trio channel several years ago, and recently watched it again - the SANS commercials - at Sundance. I was amazed the first time, and found it to be more engaged at the second viewing. For example, some of the segments are far from perfect - hysterical comment Amos Gita stands out like a sore thumb - but taken in the constellation 11 September 1 is a general success. Best of Show: awesome last segment Imamura, in which modern critics, such as stupid Mick LaSalle is misinterpreted as an attack on "terrorists", but now stands revealed as a masterful antiwar polemic; Samira Makhmalbaf introductory part, which manages to blend a deep sympathy for the victims of 9/11 with a prophetic concern for the children of Afghanistan; and funny children's crusade Idris Ouedraogo for Osama bin Laden - the hunt almost as a serious and successful company, as well as for the real Osama. Segment Youssef Chahine is a noble, if unsuccessful experiment, which at least has the courage to remind the audience that bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creating an American foreign policy and the CIA, and although the investigation of the nature of Sean Penn, seems absurd, it is also effective bitter part of the film. In general, essential viewing, and a darn sight better than reactionary World Trade Center Oliver Stone.
