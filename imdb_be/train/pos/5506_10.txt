I can not understand why none of the "reviewers" gave the film "0", except for political reasons. No, the film is not explored both "sides" of the story, but it is certainly one film in favor of Chavez against the tide of propaganda against it should be seen as an attempt to balance the story as a whole (especially considering A. History of CIA involvement in Latin America in the fermentation of civil unrest - Google national security archive and B. The lighting in this country and in other places with clearly fake scenes Chavez supporters firing non-existent enemies). What is most surprising in this movie is the fact that the filmmakers stayed in the presidential palace of ways, although the coup - of course, the first in the documentary solutions - with images of the coup of both sides !!!
