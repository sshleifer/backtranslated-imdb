This production PM Entertainment laced with enough bullets to do the John Woo said, "Enough already!" Of course, it is not so beautiful as Woo can deliver, but it gets exploitative work in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. When his wife is framed for the murder of the governor of the team, using look-alike as a cyborg, it's up to Eric to clear his name. Wilson gets to pull the Van Damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and its angry cyborg counterpart. Why the Academy of the Armed Forces I took notice and me. Being manufactures PM, there are tons of car chases, explosions, car (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. I particularly liked the van, which turns in the air before it even comes close to touching the exploding truck. My other favorite complicated neighborhood girl coming to improve their karate trainer Don. It's just a chance to show some effects Lawnmower song around 1995.
