This film is well done on so many levels that I am in fear that score as low as (5.9 / 10 (576 votes), this letter). This movie has incredible special effects, really epic story, a complex interaction of a large nature and stunning battle - they need to see to believe! The only complaint I have subtitles in HK DVD version of me (some lines they had not been translated - ???) <br /> <br /> I just do not understand when I read and heard from various sources .: "It has confused story .... "" I could not follow the story .... "or" characters have come out of nowhere ... ". From the 1st time I watched this movie, I realized, followed him, knew why the characters were there and I absolutely loved it! I watched it about 8 times already and each time it's pure pleasure. Yes, and it's not just my opinion, because I showed the film to many fellow Americans (people who have never seen a film before HK) who feel the same way. Not one of them did not follow the storyline and each man declared his love for this film. About the people, why can not we have such things as it comes out of Hollywood? At least, Lord of the Rings has been a good marriage of special effects, character development and story line. <br /> <br /> It does not come from the Asian cinema lover a beginner. I have a large library of Asian films, and I must say that this film is one of my biggest DVD. If you look at it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and an epic feeling of the film. You will be involved in this fantasy world, and you do not want to leave! I have seen the version of 1983 and 2001 (both made by Tsui Hark), and the 2001 is much better than IMO <br /> <br /> In addition, subtitles, I have another complaint about this movie. I do not want it to end .... I ask you, Mr. Chu - can we please have a sequel?
