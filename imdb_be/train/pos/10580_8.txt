This fabulous film should be viewed in the knowledge that millions scraped together 10 cents to see it and forget about the darkest day in and day economic conditions during the 30s. Remember that 10 cents bought a loaf of bread back then, so it was a small luxury for many people. This is evidence of how Hollywood has made every effort to make the United States feel a little better about yourself. You will notice that the studio system in Hollywood at the time, many of the actors and actresses have been type cast in such films, such as James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondel and Guy Kibbee. Then, as the US military industry I have always been respected with enthusiasm and patriotism in the use of military precision marching by and large choreographer Busby Berkeley, after all.
