Wow! Stacy Peralta walked to Dogtown and Z-Boys with the same stunning documentary about the history of big wave surfing culture in America. Bonding insider archival materials, as well as interviews with surfing legends, we are transported to a bold and vigorous life free of pioneers whose sheer passion for the sport has spawned an industry that today touches the lives of millions of people. <br /> <br /> It is getting to know these icons and their history that gives the film its warmth. You can feel the respect Peralta has for this group, as we hear accounts of Greg Noll steps from the pack reverence fellow surfers on the beach at the singularity call 50-foot swells off the North Coast of Hawaii. Or Jeff Clark, surfing provocatively dangerous Maverick from the northern California coast all only for 15 years before it was found and began surfing destination in California. A story storybook with Laird Hamilton, today surfing icon. Hearing Greg Noll reverently refer to Hamilton as the best surfer ever sent a shiver up my spine. <br /> <br /> (By the way, Noll, Clark and the others were at the Sundance screening. Noll modestly described himself as old, over the rolling hills of a surfer. He was deeply touched by his reception of the audience and the movie. he and Clark was cute personally, as they were in the film.) <br /> <br /> riding Giants tribute to these extraordinary athletes while at the same time, rewarding us with insight into the size and monstrous power of waves they seek, turn inside vertical drop required to get to them, and almost incomprehensible mix of adrenaline and fear, w of surfers experience each time they take on a monster swell. <br /> <br /> All of this, and the film has more. For those of us who do not live in California in the 60s, we get an idea of ​​the influence of surfing on the American pop culture. (And, to my surprise, the impact of the film Gidget surfing!) Peralta also weaves as a primer on some of the technical aspects of the sport and history of innovation in equipment. I am not a surfer, but like the rest of the Sundance audiences, I was totally fascinated by this film. Peralta rate his claim as the Big Kahuna of American documentaries.
