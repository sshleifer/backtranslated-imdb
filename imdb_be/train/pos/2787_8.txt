Initially, I was shooting this movie for my daughter as she is fond of football - and I was not disappointed that the path (except the plot to interfere in football scene). Dad, I think I was a little surprised by the introduction of the theme of lesbianism - but I must admit that as a parent, these questions are readily available for children at the moment (how uncomfortable I feel with this theme). In a sense, this emotion has been transferred directly into the basic premise of the film - that in a certain age you have to trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is introduced young British origin teen girl - Jasminder (Jess) - East-Indian heritage, who dreams of playing professional football. The forthcoming marriage of his elder sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities to study it (in a good way), her hopes and fears for its future. <br /> <br /> multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting method to study the frustration Jess with her expectations for her parents - again, no different in essence than most child-parent relationship. <br /> <br /> In general, football scene is large (much to learn in slowmo), and while I did not need a story line - that it was necessary to keep the film going.
