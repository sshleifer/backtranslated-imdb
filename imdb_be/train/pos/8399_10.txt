Love Trap Sun In short, it is quite obvious, a full-length film with a duration of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> While I write this, I might as well talk a little more about the Trap of love. I often ask what makes love Trap different ... that's how I answer this question: 1). It introduces the characters - one in particular - that has never been seen before in movies, period <br /> <br /> 2) It shows more of the truth about love, and delves deeper into the very concept of love than any other film when the US ever made, in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as well as in the way they say that unlike any love story you ever saw. <br /> <br /> 4) it offers a very timely idea for a variety of cultural issues, both within and outside of the Black community. <br /> <br /> Since then, people will come to see the Love Trap, as is entirely original works, as is possible in this era, it is very refreshing, real and honest. This is a rare morality play complete food for thought. <br /> <br /> Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information about the movie.
