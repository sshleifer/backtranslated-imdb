This film is the second film in the immersion Shifrona after his wonderful character study in "El funds del Mar". With the «Tiempo De Valientes», it creates a very well-made character, far from prototypes and with unprecedented chemistry between them. I saw the talent Szifron, to represent every character in a lighthearted way, but enough to involve us emotionally with them. His control over them is great, so that it restores the film a great direction and overall brilliant polished script, the characters laugh and cry with real moods and invite the audience to join them in their emotions and their evolution on the screen. <, Br /> <br /> The Spanish take English, cityscape Buenos Aires at night replaces the Hollywood sets and the room is as interesting as any other, so we have a film daring to compete on Hollywood farming. <br /> <br /> But I want you to see the movie, mainly because I've never had to deal with such cute characters, all of them. It seems that the script is ideal for actors, and vice versa. I really believe, with the creation of a movie like this really Argentina prior to the competition.
