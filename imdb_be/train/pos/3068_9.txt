I gather from reading previous comments that the film went straight to the cable. Well, I paid to see it in the theater, and I'm glad I did, because visually it was an amazing film. Most of the plants, it seems that they were made in the early 60's (Office shrinkage, which is dated differently, besides), and if you leave Neve Campbell sequence, the entire film is the beginning of the 60th washed- with the atmosphere and the use of restaurants the film was exciting. For the first time a director whose background, I believe, in writing, he has a great eye. During the first ten minutes, I felt that the story lacked credibility, so I just voluntarily suspended their disbelief and go along for the ride. From the point of view of action and image of father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, the mother-child relationship, the film was spot-. William H. Mays, nice to look at, it seems to fill the void left in the end Tony Perkins, if it is a magnolia any indication. Tracey Ullman as an abandoned wife was quite touching to me. This three-dimensional image of the character is too often viewed by society as a two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to your collection of memorable pictures. Image parents (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me, indirectly, tours Vincent Gallo 66, though muffled quite a bit! I would definitely pay money to see the second film from this director. It has self-discipline in the 50s directed by b-crimefilm (P.T.Anderson it will never be!), But it has a visual style and a way with actors who enjoys the attention.
