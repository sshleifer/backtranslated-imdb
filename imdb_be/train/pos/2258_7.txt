I believe that a great effort Sarafina Whoopi Goldberg. In addition to her, there is no other star in the film and its role is less than the title character, Sarafina. After all, I work in middle school with the city kids, I think it is a very important film to show the history of South African apartheid. Sarafina is a film about education and relationships of teachers with her apprentice, Sarafina. I bought a video with very little video service. I watched it and quickly crossed the musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this film for teachers and their students to understand. Now that I do not know the other actors and actresses in the film, I think that they are very popular in South Africa, and I am glad that they are removed from the South African actors and crew members, with the exception of Goldberg in a small role, but if it makes people watch this film than Whoopi reaches worldwide appeal.
