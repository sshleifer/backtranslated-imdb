Erotic movies of the 1970s was tame compared with triple X romps today, which is good. Because there is a good story around naked rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I want them to have some vampires effects that they had in the period of time and the sex was to get in the way of history a little bit. Plus some of the accents were hard to understand in periods of time, but it's worth watching the unedited version, then edited to version called Devil's Plaything. But if you do not take care of the plots naked women dancing and having sex, it is not the film for you. However, I enjoy it, and I give him ... 7 STARS.
