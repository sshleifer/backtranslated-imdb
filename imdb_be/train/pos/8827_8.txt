With a minimal budget, duration of eight minutes and a lot of imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the most touching shorts I've ever seen. The subtlety of the script is really great, because it does not give away the ending until the last moment. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you that a short, since you will be able to enjoy a lot more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: directing, writing and acting in that terrible short is the finest effort I've seen in recent years. Also pay attention to March Belenguer performance, its unbelievable reaction arrows <br /> <br /> Overall rating :. 8/10
