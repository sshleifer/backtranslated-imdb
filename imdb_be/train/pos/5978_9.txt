This is a true '80-film ": Then they did perhaps 100 times more movies than at present, and this makes many of them are quite interesting ... it was a cultural phenomenon that no longer exists. At the present time, probably the same kind of people who would make a cheap "on the videoÂ» -movies in the eighties, making cheap porn. Porn seems to sell. Anyway, it's above-average level of trash movie: He has a good and a fascinating story, and it's very well done, I think. In one scene, you can even see swinging the microphone at the upper edge of the image. Of course, there is also a small cameo Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute to the film "success", even though they are good in their small roles. Monster, heavy singer "Tech Summit" looks really awful, especially when he sings. One of the most terrible monsters that I've seen in horror movies. I might have nightmares of him the next night. Not recommended for those who like intellectual movies.
