Despite the budgetary constraints, this is a great movie, proof that the efforts and imagination can overcome a lack of cash. The discovery, in which cave drawings seem to show how some dinosaurs, at least survived in human epoch, is a good distraction. After that, a meteorite descends into the lake and causes heat that, in turn, leads to the deposition of frozen dinosaur eggs (probably cave paintings suggest, instead, that this is not the first time such a thing had happened). When a prehistoric beast, it's well animated plesiosaur, which soon causes the disappearance of the local area. Okay, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still a real fun for fans of the movie monster.
