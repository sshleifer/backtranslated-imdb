Original uncensored print of this amazing film was found in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and was featured in several specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews, which I found on the Internet, in the original, all of the return dialogue and innuendo intact; later they were either removed or completely re-shot in the studio was originally issued, in order to pass the state censorship of New York. I also read that the DVD is "expected in 2006," and we can only hope! If we do fortunately, it will include a comparison between version 2. Note that freed censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I've seen. Stanwyck rules!
