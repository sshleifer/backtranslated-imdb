When I first heard that Hal Hartley makes a sequel to Henry Fool, I was excited (it was a personal favorite for a few years), and then gently, when I heard that it was something to do with terrorism. Just saw it, though, I was surprised to find that he had worked at the same time of a different kind than the film Henry Fool. Preparation and direction of the two was dead, and the effect was beautiful ... special kudos go to Hartley reassembly almost all the cast, down to his son Henry, who was only in the original four. As I have said, though, this film is very different from the first, but it works: I put up with the change of tone and subject matter of the fact that 10 years have passed, and the characters would find themselves in a variety of situations, as the first film ended. In this case, an unexpected adventure follows ... and that's all I'll give ... not to mention the fact that I need to see it again, to see exactly what is happening and who is double crossing over someone. Although this is certainly one of the best films I've seen in a while, he suffers, like many throughout his end, as it seems that Hartley is planning a third and now the film leaves you hanging. I'll have to buy my tickets for Part 3 ( "Henry Grimm"?) In 2017.
