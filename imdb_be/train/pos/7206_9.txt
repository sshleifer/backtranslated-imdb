Excellent portion within the area of ​​a portion of borders. Shame about my two heroes of the film, which has good Snog. It must be my upbringing :) <br /> <br /> Very good acting all. You never know who is going to outdo anyone. Last little twist at the end allows everyone to get what they deserved. <br /> <br /> I recommend to all. Harmless, ironic thriller that, if he has any shortcomings, perhaps, Michael Caine on the use of the word "bloody", but it's his signature, is not it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
