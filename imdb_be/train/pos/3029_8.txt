Roman easily surpasses the best parts of the film and is a direct translation of what is written Greene; for example, a quiet but dark humor, which burst into the scene with Boyer and Lori, or killed a child-an obsession that takes over the part of the plot. If the film is different from the novel, it tends to be inappropriate. <br /> <br /> However, I do not want to say that the movie is bad in any way. He always looks the part and the story remains in the mind, like a good 'un. Some of the supporting characters were shares of actors who could anything turn their hand to. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
