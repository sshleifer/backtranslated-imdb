I once thought that this movie was the worst of the Muppet movies. Now I would like to remove this application. In my opinion, now the worst Muppet movie was a TV movie is a very fun Muppet Christmas, I rip off this wonderful life that was really terrible. Muppets Take Manhattan is nothing special, but it miles more enjoyable than MERRY Muppet Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs that "you can not take no for an answer" songs one Muppet Babies and sing songs for the biggest final. How I loved the TV show Muppet Babies, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence here (I said it was that inspired the show Muppet Babies) <br /> <br /> In MELODY MANHATTAN show itself was a real showstopper, with a Muppets Sesame street even show up at the wedding. As Kerman puts him in the last line, "What better way could that ever end?". But I want to make something that was between the beginning and the end was a bit more interesting. There are lovely cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and the big dance sequence with Rizzo and rats (the late great choreographer Jim Henson himself) and the film, of course, entertain. I must say that although the Muppet Movie, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and Muppet Christmas Carol are three defininitive Muppet movies.
