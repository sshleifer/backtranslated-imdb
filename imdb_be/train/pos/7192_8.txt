If you're a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action, on the whole it should be seen. Directed ace team of the republic William Witney and John English, and starring Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this series delivers! I will not bore you with the story (who cares less talk, more of a struggle?); what really matters here Hadley great interpretation of character / s and stunt work Dale Van shekel and Yakimov Kanatt. <br /> <br /> *** Stunt SPOILERS following *** <br /> <br /> You can see the impact this film had on the Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro comes in the original Star Wars trash compactor in one chapter, who came to the rope bridge a'la Temple of Doom in the other, making the horse-to-coach transfer to the Raiders, and even runs through the tunnel, the villains to overturn a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him, just as Ram Mole makes at Indy in the temple destiny. In addition to all this, the action of the whip high as Zorro to disarm the villain, safety swings, etc. with his trusty whip. Most of the goals of the work fairly lame, for the first chapter, which shows a stunning sword rampage in a cupboard choreographed sword / stunt legend Ralph Faulkner, who makes a rare appearance of the screen as an evil except Rodriguez. It was the first series I've ever seen on a morning in Bijou, when I was a kid, and I have since hooked on them. <br /> <br /> Fighting Legion Zorro supplies «Z» merchandise!
