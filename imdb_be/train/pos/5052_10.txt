This is a great movie. As a Canadian who grew up in the rural life of many of his sign, winter, canoeing, trapping, hunting, and the like. Easy to take the familiar for granted, but after watching the film several times it is grown on me. <br /> <br /> The history of Great Gray Owl is well known to many Canadians loan Attenborough Director and screenwriter Nicholson to expand the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan is not very good drawing a complicated man, a very fine job. Annie Galipeau beautiful in her first big role. The rest of the cast is solid.
