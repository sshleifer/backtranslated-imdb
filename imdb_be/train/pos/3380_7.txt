I've seen tons of science fiction with '70s; some terribly bad, but others thought provoking and really scary. Soylent Green fits into the latter category. Yes, sometimes it's a bit old-fashioned, and let the furniture is good for a chuckle or two, but some of the film seems awfully prophetic. Here we have a movie for the first 9 years of the blade that dares to imagine the future as Somthing dark, scary, and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson fare much better at this than the Ten Commandments, and Robinson assisted suicide scene is crawling prophetic Kevorkian and what happened to him. Some of the facilities are dated (you can imagine the director get away with the concept of "women as furniture" in our oh-so politically correct 90s?), But it's rare to find a movie with the Decade of me that can actually make you think. This is one I would like to see on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation, I do not think that the total amount of the film will be due. Check it out.
