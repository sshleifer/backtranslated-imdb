This film is just too funny, totally non-PC gangster romp. If Mel Brooks made a picture of the Mob in the 30s, it would probably look like this. Too many great one-liners, to remember, and while it is not for everyone who Doesnt laugh a whole bunch of times doesnt have a pulse. So, I put it on and you laugh Iceholes !!!
