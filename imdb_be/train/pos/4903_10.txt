Inspired at least a little Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, which has performed throughout the war years in the house of Covent Garden Opera, this movie chronicles the attempts of elderly saksofonistomom reform (almost) all girl group with which she played like a schoolgirl before the end of the Second World War. Too short retrospective to the original group on the scene to bring us great music, and will help to fill in the background to members of the group, and, in particular, to the relations of girls with a lone male member - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to dodge the call-up). <br /> <br /> He Holm ( "Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench in turn leading fine performances as newly widowed Elizabeth, and cunning, debauchery Patrick drummer. The late Joan Sims is ideal as a leader of the group, now she plays the piano bar on the beach, and June Whitfield glows like trombonist of the Salvation Army. Cameo appearances of other greats like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The film is to travel down memory lane, with all star cast that should, by all the rules, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. All I can say is, I hope it looks as good at their age! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still incredibly fox in 69 years. Of course, she still gets my heart rate going! As I watched, I mentally berating casting director not to use age-matched women. Then I looked at the girl and found that every one of them old enough to have been performing in London one thousand nine hundred forty-four (although it may be a little stretch for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like the swing group thrive on nostalgia, or just want to see how well a woman can control the look with almost three quarters of a century behind it, do not miss this film. <br /> <br />
