hi .. I think Just Cause is one of my favorite films of Sean Connery, is a tense psychological thriller with the excellent performance of the Cast Ready, especially Connery..it also has one of the best lines I've seen in the films, so that the dialogue is very good in this one. . it also has one of the best scenes in the film, ever, when the character Sean interview Ed Harris in prison simply fantastic..i enjoy this one a lot, and I can not recommend it enough, in fact, do not miss this one ! Do not pay attention to the negative comments, saying that the last 30 minutes of sucking, it was as strong as the rest of the movie, I actually find the Just Cause movie is very entertaining ..
