It is so rare to find a literary work adequately transferred to the screen, that I may have praised this film more than he deserves, but not much. As a long-time disciple of Vonnegut's work, I have no hesitation in recommending the movie to their readers, at least those who love him as I do. Casting inspiration: Nolte understated triumph, bewildered in defeat, decisive in court. Sheryl Lee juicy throughout, but its handling treacherous Resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes us forget its beauty. Alan Arkin delivers fully attractive but not less insidious Soviet spy <br /> <br /> I do not feel that you need to read Mother Night, to evaluate the film. although if you have not read Mother Night, you'll probably want to after watching the film. <br /> <br /> Note the changes from color to black and white and back again, and do not miss the final symbolism loop Campbell. Watches also to Kurt Vonnegut cameo towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby «White Christmas» will never sound the same (I write in mid-December, when the song becomes heavy on the radio, and it's driving me nuts).
