IMDb lists it in 1972, for some reason, but also other sources that I have seen, including outstanding programmok mark it as 68. Is there really does not matter, except that it is quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first works of art to combine the two, apparently) in the context of the Star Gate sequence in 2001 , released in the same year. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and super-saturated optical printing ink, and the psychedelic feel of the series of colors, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc. It is quite compelling and quite beautiful. Of course, it helped paved the way for many other emerging video artists in the 70s, and deserves to be better known.
