Since September last year, I borrowed four to six films every week from Harold Washington Library, which boasts a large DVD collection. (The HWL is really circulating library: three-quarters of his films at any given time) Recently, I was thrilled to find The Short Films of David Lynch. Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I raise the country dull. I am here to announce that well spent for fans of David Lynch, watching eight half-hour episodes. <br /> <br /> The most characteristic feature of these short works are their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. The ends of the blatant vote ACCENT breaks. Physical violence delivers blows. Chirping birds and buzzing nest brush around the edges. Many other elements of the filled band. Walk crude animation often keeps in sync with the sound, but the soundtrack hit me like Lynch primary interest in the creation and dissemination of this work. In a sense, these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms. <br /> <br /> However, the situation strange, ugly, deep, blunt and funny as hell. And there's plenty of room in them to think about how absurd we humans can be. I can not say that I'll watch collection again, but for those who reveled in his movements, that is a set of Inland Empire, Country blunt worth half an hour of your time.
