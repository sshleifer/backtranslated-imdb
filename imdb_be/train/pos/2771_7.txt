David and Bathsheba is a lavish Hollywood Biblical pattern is produced with 20th Century Fox for Zanuck, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Peck {King David}, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah) and Jayne Meadows (Michael). <br /> <br /> The film is based around a second Old Testament book of Kings in the Bible. It follows, King David, who as a child was punished Goliath, and now we find him as an adult, the second king of Israel. Hard and assured King David, however, is the matter of the heart causes big problems. This time he spies Bathsheba taking a shower {re} bath, then "the beginning of a path that includes adultery and treachery; a journey that will end in God's judgment call. <br /> <br /> As a rule, for this genre, David and Bathsheba big, grandiose production. From its wonderful scenery to this positively gorgeous Technicolor picture {} Leon Shamrey, he has enough quality to justify sitting along side the best the genre has to offer in terms of production value. Atypically, tho, the film sedately paced and belongs to the 99% of the drives should be purely a dialogue. This is not one for fans of action or those who need a certain amount of bias, to go with their buckle. This is a very humanistic picture, actually it lets not beat around the burning bush here, it's biblical love story with flecks sins heart. But it's not bad at all, because breaking it, we find that it is very well acted {Peck Stoik more vulnerable to what happens in real well and Hayward pushes it to the max}, and it will be fine story director with knowledge of the ability to frequently overlooked Henry King. And although some of the dialogue, admittedly distorts induction symbol stream is never interrupted as Phillip Dunn (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) Oscar nominated screenplay keeps the attention throughout. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the forgotten picture in terms of genres Bible / swords and sandals (most likely because it Talky piece that has a heart as its main selling point), but it really is well worth the time those who are interested in the most lavish of genres. 7/10
