I have often wondered how many CASPER designed for children ... of all the issues revolving around their identity (in this film lead us to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, and his house is a cemetery plot) as well as alarm messages brought this particular film. Maybe, Casper meant a morality play or Famous Studios felt opens new horizons in the cartoons "reality". <br /> <br /> There's a good BOOS TONIGHT well animated project will no doubt have. But the development of the plot involving a fox (who becomes friend of Casper, but meets a tragic end) is the problem <br /> <br /> Give credit Famous Studios. - they decide to die ... but relatively harsh way of mourning Kasper quite graphic and disturbing for children (though isolation does offer a happy ending, but I will not give the ending), and the violence is quite steep, even by the standards of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> This can be a good cartoon for parents to use to help explain the death of children - but I would not push him into the VCR for playful cartoon break.
