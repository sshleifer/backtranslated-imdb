I would like to see it for a long time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of the movie, I thought it was great the next after that, though, he began to pull. Action and direction were amazing. In fact, everything in the film seemed to flow for the script, with the exception of. Sometimes, the only thing that keeps my attention the fact that the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look at the big cameos Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald.
