Best animated film ever made. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation is absolutely incredible effects, but the branches of the human mind, the soul and philosophy. History shows a family of cats, where big sister dies, the younger brother sees it and saves her body, but when she wakes up, she was left without a soul. Thus, the two sibling cats embark on a journey to find him. I spoke this way to many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I watch it I find more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not in the physiological aspect of this then you still love him. The animation is gorgeous, and the creative scene will be attached to the screen you are. For example, ocean freeze in time, God is the soup of the land, and a bit strange CIS retelling of Hansel and Gretel. In conclusion, Cat Soup absolute pleasure for all. <br /> <br /> PS- Not for children, gratuitous violence are included.
