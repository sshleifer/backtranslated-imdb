This film is enhanced my opinion of Errol Flynn. Although Flynn, of course, most famous for its know-how and sprezzatura (throw in a pair of high falutin 'European conditions!) This film gives him an opportunity to stretch (although only slightly) as an actor, he plays with great shameless careerist ego and nerve to match. The supporting cast is excellent; everyone seems to have chosen well for their roles. <br /> <br /> The story moves briskly and, though not particularly deep (he misses, perhaps intentionally, the ability to provide social commentary on the massively unequal distribution of income during this time), it is certainly entertaining and happy. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also quite faithful history. I also really liked the big paintings of San Francisco 1880. In general, there is a bit like this movie ... very well worth the time to watch it.
