I saw this movie back in the 80s and almost forgotten, when I noticed that it was on television again and watched it. I thought that I loved this little sleeper, when I first saw it, and I liked it even better on second viewing. <br /> <br /> All of the actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, Jason Presson (as a twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting death of his elder brother) is excellent. The film has a very authentic feel to it - understated, quiet, deeply touching story of family aching with grief. Dialogue is a rare but eloquent nonverbal action is outstanding. It seems like a simple version of an ordinary rural people SANS psychiatrist, but equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> The Stone Boy worth the time and emotional energy involved to look into it.
