Youth, Sexuality, and the French village - one of the most unique films you will ever see. If you can see that there is not a feat, given how difficult it is to find a copy thereof (the combination of deficit and censorship). It is sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting, and sometimes funny. Trifle sad, and in the middle, but overall you can not call myself a fan of the bizarre film as long as you have seen it at least once.
