Vincent Price next to HOUSE WAX (1953), a film that cemented his reputation as a horror icon, just revolves around the bitter ?? although resourceful ?? showman. Although the remake, the former (a shot in Technicolor) remains above the effort; He said that, except for some resist the comic, mandatory resort cheap tricks (it was another showcase 3-D) and the occasional narrative flaws (what happened to the missing bag, which allegedly turned into a police station, containing the severed head?) it offers more than enough thrills Grand Guignol-type and the total cost of the camp (price hamming it up in different guises as the inventor of the illusion that masquerade as "passed" Star magician, who took advantage of his genius), to stand on his own two feet. By the way, directed by Br participation here proves not a coincidence ?? as narrative includes elements the names of two horror (as starring Cregar) that he has previously helmets resident (1944) and the hangover AR (1945). Young conductor plays Mary Murphy (Price and ingenue assistant) and Patrick O'Neill (as her detective boyfriend ?? oddly enough, he had to take a leading role in the same part, the Chamber of Horrors [1966], which I purchased in time to serve as encore before). An interesting side here adoption of the latest novel methodology for the identification, fingerprinting, which is crucial in ensuring Price fall (in a predictable, but very inconvenient fiery climax) ?? although persistent shadowing his amateur crime novelist mistress has, at least, a lot to do with it in the long run! Watching the stars in the role of cross-linked to the measure, the film leaves a lot of fun ?? in particular, in the compact after 73 minutes.
