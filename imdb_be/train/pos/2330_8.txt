This show is good. I like to act, amusing bits and wit it. Actors Lee Pace, Anna Friel ... etc, they all did great in the show. The show started much of it funny, illogical basic idea of ​​bringing dead people back to the first series and honestly as what people say, the first few episodes of the second series were a little let down, but later came back looking good anyway. And now I really hate the fact that he was going to be canceled. Why not just let the ABC is not complete until the end, when all the episodes already made ?? I really want to know how the story will be. I think that it should be given the opportunity, as there are still so many viewers who love it.
