"Cosby" In my opinion, it is necessary to see the CBS hit! I'm not sure if I had never seen each episode, but I still liked it. It is difficult to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really liked the song. If you ask me, but I liked it all, it would be nice if Madeline Kahn did not die during the exhibition run. Since this happened, I always wondered what the show would be like. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing has always been very strong. In conclusion, despite the fact that can be seen on TBS now, I strongly recommend that you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
