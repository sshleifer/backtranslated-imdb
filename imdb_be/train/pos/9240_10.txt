We found this film to video service costs $ 2 to buy. The whole movie stinks really bad! The so-called colonel who the hero here, if the coating could be trusted, must be in his eighties and could barely walk. Nevertheless, he managed to shoot some of the most stupid ninja in the world. Then the story goes, Colonel, which makes sense, given the inability of old to do anything worth mentioning Now two awful eighties-looking guys take over, in what has to be some kind of story. I lost a hundred times, but did not mind, because the film is so bad that it's really fun to watch. Zero-budget trash with actors is not worthy of the name. Go, check it!
