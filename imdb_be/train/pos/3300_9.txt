Pakeezah has a very interesting history (which is well documented in the "Fun Facts" section) on how he came to be. It seems as if the fate of conspiracy to experience Kamal Amro (Director), at the same time in the soul wanting to finish his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah rides on metaphor, poetry and visual eloquence. As a result, the intensity with which emotions go to reach a dimension that can not be very real, but very effective, and leave an impact on the viewer. <br /> <br /> mine lives Kumar and Nargis tragedy Jaan Sahib as her own. Other stars of the film, but her are Ghulam Muhammad (musical director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background score) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Their music and cinema leaves you spell bound. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in the world of cinema. This opens up new layers to you every time you look at it again. Kamal Amro is one of those rare poets of cinema, and he left us all a gift.
