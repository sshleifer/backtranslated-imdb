My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story, read it several of his classes. He never sounded all that interesting to me, though, and I bought a DVD figuring it would be a film that will not really up my alley. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is replete with set-up and I thought I was right. It starts a little slow, and I must admit that I was a little sad - but interesting enough to stay with him. Boy, I'm glad I did because it ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding film. I would certainly look at it again! <br /> <br /> The casting was very good. Since I have not read this book, I can not vouch for the accuracy, but I have to say that Jon Voight was really lovely. characters do you like that you would have hated the ones you had to hate, and laughed at by those who were supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I can see how some people might not like this film, It's tedious at times, especially at the beginning. All the flashbacks can be distracting (although they are important for the history). Once the story starts to come together in the end, though, I think that you paid back in spades for your patience. When all is said and done, I think it's a very good film. - 8-10 <br /> <br />
