Recently I found this movie on VHS after watching it for a few years, I was not disappointed. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov star and co-author of the original screenplay (nominated for an Oscar). Other stars have heard include Karl Malden, Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays accountant / conman, just released from prison notorious Wormwood Scrubs England (he appropriated from the headquarters of the Conservative Party, was chosen because he is a liberal). He immediately starts searching for a new employer, from which he may steal, and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. He socio-engineers its way to the London men's club and learn the identity of the best computer scientists in the city, he steals the identity of one of Caesar Smith, who had just left the city in South America to continue his collecting moths hobby in the wild, he says to his way in Tom-Can-Co, the American conglomerate headed by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper hires Smith and shows him around the computer center, especially its safety function, which consists of a flashing blue light. Ustinov asked the computer how to defeat its security and computer helpfully tells him Â«Disconnect blue light." The use of hacking techniques from 30 years in the future, Ustinov breaks into a computer system and a program for creating checks, written in a variety of fictitious firms. The scheme begins to unravel when the assistant Klemper in Willard G. Gnatpole (Newhart) says the number of businesses Ta-Can-Co appears to be a business transaction with a scam Ustinov companies. With the help of his secretary, Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and live happily ever after. To tell you how to spoil this very funny, romantic, intelligent and forward in time the picture.
