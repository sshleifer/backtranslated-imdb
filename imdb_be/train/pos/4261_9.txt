I loved this movie. Not just because I'm a big fan of the Bleibtreu, although almost all German films that count. But also because he is not the protagonist. The lead taken by Barnaby Metshurat, which was the only reason for playing Juliet in 2001, and who actually carries the film on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> family moved from Italy to Germany, who are looking for the "German Dream" (this is my own invention and ironic ...) cheap labor in the steel and coal industries. However, they eventually open a restaurant and the journey takes the film at this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From this point on, the story told in the main, that of the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). of Gigi's dream to become a filmmaker he is at risk of rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. Below is excellent - and completely neutral - look at what life could be formed by the choices you make <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is not to say life (Gigi and Giancarlo in) was great. successful or more complete and more interesting. He just gives us useful to look at what it must be like to search for identity, when the two countries involved and the mentality. and this view is not moving bitterness and contempt for any country that makes it such a great film for all and in every country dealing with stress as a result of immigration. The fact that the film director Fatih Akin moved to Germany from Turkey in 70 years also gives the film a great measure of his confidence and emotional accuracy. Icing on the cake of a fantastic performance of all actors, especially Metschurat and - this I really need to emphasize - the little boy who plays young Gigi. performance, that the baby would have been out of reach, just about anyone who! Great movie, watch it.
