This cleaver movie with a love for centuries. The film consists of Keaton searching lady love in the Stone Age, ancient Rome and currently (1920). In all three cases it is usual cowardly Buster and he fights against Wallace Beery for his loved ones. Of the three periods of time, I think I liked the Roman one is better, although I admit that it may have also been Cheesiest. I really liked the scene with a lion, which was obviously the guy in the suit, as well as the strange chariot race in the snow - but what I really enjoyed the most was to see all the strange acrobatics Keaton. Nevertheless, all three time periods were good old-fashioned fun and the film, not the best, is still an exceptional and enjoyable film. Check it out!
