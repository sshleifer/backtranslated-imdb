I really thought that it was not so bad. Not a great work of art, but Dermot M was far stronger performer. Patricia Arquette was the replays most of the time. He was actually playing the cello, which was very impressive, and his lines were not forced. In addition, it is an incredibly beautiful person. Really sexy. Add that talent, and most of all he was a lot more bearable. He always gives his all, even if some of the projects he was involved in not quite hit the high score .. not the fault of the actor in most cases. He, unfortunately, was in some strange movies that simply do not resonate at the box office. Always with A-list actors, but just do not always "hit". But he was "worth every penny" any DVD rental or purchase. See The Wedding Date with Debra Messing - one of his best films in general. Worth every penny! ; ) (If you have not already seen, yes, you will find that quote!)
