It was a very good movie and totally unfair to judge without taking into account the time when it was released. There are some movies that do not get older, but this is clearly outdated. However, I saw this movie when I was a boy, and for more than twenty years, as the images of how stories were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, as we were unable to assess it again on DVD. In fact, I remember this film as a subject of several conversations and meetings, where the boys talked about the things we have in common. So it was a bit of a sense of disappointment and even sadness, when we finally had the DVD. Firstly, there was the theory of how our generation was naives. Secondly, I think there's something else. I would be an asset, that this film is something that should be fun for all contemporary filmmakers, particularly those who focus on the horror genre decompose. This injury, an idea which gives the consistency of the film; the fact of a person being mutilated produces deeper fear than death and torture. I remember a sick feeling was when the monster to come off the hand with Kurt. And in the end; if the creature bites doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. Another great thing morbid atmosphere that prevails without break through the intensities of all the scenes, regardless of when the action in the secret laboratory, lonely street, where the people in the car looking for a woman's body, the kinematic scheme of a locker room, and so on. It may be the reasons why this is not a good film just technical stuff. For example, in the scene of the accident and a man saving his bride's head more accurate work done for another, and the second block of the modern director can be fun. The same with all scenes, including one from the hand of Kurt. In addition, something can be done with monster makeup. Some remakes were good; I think that in this case the attempt is worth it. However, black and white tone to be maintained.
