In fact, this is one of those films that you would have to give a 7.5. The fact is, as has been said, it is a great pleasure. Amazing atmospheric. Asuka really come across as the top, but it's a great car for him, as well as O, Mr. Porter Will Hay. If you love old movies dark houses and train, then this is definitely for you. <br /> <br /> Ironically this kind of movie you want to see again and again. This friendly and charming in an endearing sort of way with all the nostalgic references that have done a great fare during wartime. Once a group of characters to play off each other as they do in many other typical British wartime movie. It would be nice to have seen this film when it was recorded Ealing studios. A real pity that one thousand nine hundred thirty-one original has not been preserved
