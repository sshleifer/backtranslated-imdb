Great farce! That, of course, it's all meant to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, and there is the slightest effort in that direction. Maybe the plot actually take, or take place at any particular time or place? Probably not, because in the end, it's just, just, cinema and films are based on the presentation, rather than from reality. The sole purpose of this film is to entertain, of course, not to educate, and entertain it does, the reality of magic and carefree beat the wind. I think most would agree that of documentaries, we expect enlightenment and authenticity. But for fun, I want it now describes as a "no-brainer", which combines the game in every way. In just a few giggles and open laughter now and then, it's good fantasy fare.
