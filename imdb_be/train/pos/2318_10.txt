I saw this film as a teenager, and immediately identified with the image of Reese Witherspoon Dani clothes, 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana CIRCA 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister Maureen (and in now rarely seen Emily Warfield), and a sense of the ridiculous to the point of view of its conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen Court Foster (Jason London), the son of a close friend of his mother (Gail Strickland) moves in next door, Danny feels his first crush, while the court enjoys his company, and strong-willed spirit. Dani was able to get her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving behind Dani. close relationship sisters break serious competition, that breaks the deepening only when the court dies in an accident. The girls then made to understand how much they need each other. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper, just perfect as loving parents trying to balance individuality of their daughters, at the same time trying to keep the family together. Beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many others contribute to the strange atmosphere of the film easier time. <br /> <br /> touching coming of age film with a timeless message.
