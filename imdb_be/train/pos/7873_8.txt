Page 3 is most definitely a very fun and exciting discovery that very cleverly exposes the hypocritical lifestyle Mumbai elite. From fake smile plastered kisses, Page 3 leaves no stone unturned in discovering the shocking lives of the rich and famous. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption, scandal lurking in every dark corner of the world of glitz and glamor. Mankind and generosity similar desert oasis in this world, where social Darwinism is preferred mentality. All are constantly hungry for more money, more fame, and more high reputation, forcing them to make the most disgraceful things imaginable, from signing the contract to film the funeral of child molestation. All that is possible in this cosmopolitan city, where there is such a wide gap between the social classes. The viewer sees the ugliness of both of these classes through the eyes of the main character. She oversees the suffocating atmosphere and stunning frenzy that secular life. Bollywood moguls, politicians and criminals all intertwined in a very confusing mess! Kitne Ajeeb Let the good track, as cheerful Kuan main Oaks Jaongi. Terrific film with excellent character development!
