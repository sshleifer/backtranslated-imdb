Gripping yet anxious look on Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Eddy) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin of the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, battered house, which was considered dangerous for the health of the city. It becomes very clear very quickly that these two well past the eccentric. Little Edie seems the most from the way she acts with thinking ten years, even if it is actually 53. The content is largely made up of two things. The first talk was Little Edie lambastes Big Eddy for driving away all their potential suitors and destroying it seeks a career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions tend to become very rhetorical, senseless, and often funny. The second part consists of long bouts attempts singing of both sides. Each, of course, think that their singing is perfect, and this is just another one who sounds bad. In one amazing Bolshoi Eddie actually physically attacked Little Edie with the cane just to get her to stop her trills. Very exciting one gets the feeling that some of their major operation happening here and things are too far away to know that. The filmmakers seem to treat it as a freak show at the circus, coming every day to write (and laughter) that's strange behavior may occur. Ultimately, it is a sad picture, as it shows how the world is just past these two steps. Their hopes and dreams as decayed mansion where they live. Despite the controversy, the two need each other more than ever. After all, without the other there would be no escape from loneliness. The strangest line goes from the Big Eddy which many cats relieve themselves throughout his bedroom. Her response to complaints about the smell incredible.
