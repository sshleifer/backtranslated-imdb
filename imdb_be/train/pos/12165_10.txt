Frownland, like one of those intensely difficult situations, when you end up laughing out loud just in time; and just at that moment when you realize that you do not laugh, you've already reached the top of the voice resoundness; and as you look around you in ghostly white faces with their gaping mouths and wide open glazen eyes, you feel a piercing pain began in the pit of your stomach, and suddenly rushing throat and ... well, you get the point. <br /> <br /> But for all his troubles and blows in the face, Frownland, in fact, an excellent piece of work that, after watching the vague confusion of the protagonist and all its troubles and miserable failures, makes you want to scratch your eyes and at the same time, you feel sorry for him sickenly. <br /> <br /> It would be much easier for me to just get out of the film's Ronald Bronstein, but for some crazy reason, I felt unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all grainy film irritation to offer. If someone puts you on fire, they tend to want to put it: Stop! Fall! N-roll! But with this film, you want to watch the flames slowly engulf your entire body. You suffer pain - perhaps out of spite, or some unknown masochistic curiosity, I can not even try to explain <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main movie will never let you down this film comes to a theater near you. But if you get a chance to catch it, prepare yourself to bring the dog fur.
