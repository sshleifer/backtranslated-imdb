Rented watching this short (<90 minutes) work. This is by far the best treatment Modesty got on film - and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, agreed by participating as a "creative consultant." The nature of, and we who love it, are handled with respect. Spiegel direction is the best, what he has done to date, and the casting was very well done. Alexander stage almost physically perfect as a match with the original illustrations by Jim Holdaway modesty. Amazing find the one who threw it! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope that Tarantino & Co. It will continue to do more in this series - I am particularly interested to see who they want to be incomparable Willie Garvin!
