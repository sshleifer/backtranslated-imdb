I love all the films by Michael Landon Jr. and casting Michael Landon Jr. Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" could not have been better. Dale Midkiff is a way to remove this character. <br /> <br /> This movie kept me fascinated from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Miss Death and Willies girl with synchronization Clarks visit was only time the gods. How they dealt with death and Clark helped them to do so was that of the love of parents. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 films before it [Love Comes Softly, loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey], I feel like, you can watch this film and understand it easily. Nevertheless, rest and want to see the previous 3 films due to the history of all the characters have for them. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon, Jr. is an excellent director <br /> <br /> I look forward to many more films from him in the future.
