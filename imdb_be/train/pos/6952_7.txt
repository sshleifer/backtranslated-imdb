In New York, when a shy and lonely project manager design firm Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) on the subway, he invites her to date and have dinner with him. Jenny immediately falls in love with him, they have sex, and she reveals her true identity to him, saying that it is a powerful superhero G-Girl. After meeting his colleague and friend Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris), the needy Jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and Matt follows the advice of his best friend, Vaughn Haige (Rhine Wilson) and resets it, breaking her heart. Jenny turns Matt's life into hell, while he has an affair with Hanna. However, the sworn enemy of G-Girl and former high school favorite Jenny, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), proposes Matt to lure Jenny to strip her superpowers. <br /> <br /> «My Super Ex-Girlfriend» perfectly silly and ridiculous. This romantic comedy-adventure have a lot of fun and very interesting. Luke Wilson as big an idiot, Anna Faris is very sexy, as usual, and Uma Thurman large as a crazy neurotic superhero-like Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" and Evelyn Draper in «Play Misty For Me». . My vote is seven <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Minha Super Ex-Namorada" ( "My Super Ex-Girlfriend")
