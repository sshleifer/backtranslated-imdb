The Power of Kangwon Province is director Hong Sang-soo second effort to function well and much of what he began in his previous film returns in this film, including several related to the narrative (in this case, two), and stories about distressed or anxious attitude, as well as strong dose of irony. <br /> <br /> One thing that is clearly reduced from its previous work flights of fancy, which included elements of surrealism. However, this film also contains one point, which strikes unreal contrast relative to the other, and a realistic image of the found therein. Two story follows a young woman who goes on a journey in Kangwon province with his friends, only to find himself drawn to the stranger, the second of a man who also goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with his friend and struggles with his relationship troubles. <br /> <br /> Again, Hong shows a deep understanding of irony and of the shortcomings of human nature, and I still do not think he quite unsympathetic when it comes to his character, drawing just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony. I think I think I liked about Hong films is that they just feel so real, especially complex and contentious. Not to say that everyone is a hypocrite or suffer from confusing the senses, but rather that the characters and the actors present he feel fully developed and believable. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast-moving film. There's a lot of long and, like the previous film, things do not always connect right away so patience really paid off, and in a strange way. There does not seem any element of the film, which is not intentionally placed in the film, and it made me a little hyper-aware of the variety of seemingly superfluous characters as they get drawn into the mixture as the film progresses. <, Br /> <br /> Power of a great movie, which was able to give a level of personal emotion, regret, longing in the story that underlines the irony and the fallacy of human decision-making. It's quite difficult to keep the balance, and it's amazing how Hong manages to pull it twice in a row. Technical production values ​​have gotten much better since the first film and the trend has been steady and clear. This film does not pack the same emotional jolt that the first does, but wins in guaranteed research and refinement really helps tighten overall vision. Large viewing for lovers of art cinema. 8/10.
