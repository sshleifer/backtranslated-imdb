This is a great Swedish film .. it was the first Swedish film I've seen .. it's just .. and deeply that the great combination!. <br /> <br /> Nyqvist did a great job as well-known leader who is committed to peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was great, as it is inspiring friend to help him lead and never give up. <br /> <br /> The fight between the conductor and a hypocrite priest who lost his battle with Michael, when his wife confronted him and defends the noble cause Michael to help his hometown to find their own world of music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the ending .. this was not so good, but it has a deep meaning.
