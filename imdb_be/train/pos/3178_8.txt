The film «Cross Eyed» Adam Jones pushes the viewer to the redemption of the trip, as the protagonist takes the control of the wheel and sets his life in order. Adam Jones has found creative and refreshing way to empower its character and actualize what is most important. These truths are obvious for both characters and audience, as you laugh and gag in the credits with them. Simple but attractive settings \ suits keep you guessing about what you'll see next. You can not help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this film. I can not wait for his sophomore effort. It's only a matter of time before Jones strikes again. Bravo!
