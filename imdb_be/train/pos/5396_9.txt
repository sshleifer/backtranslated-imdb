Simple, meaningful and provides emotional punch. I regularly traipse through the dim short films, and it's always nice to come across something that is simple and enlightened message, without pretending or self-indulgent directors. <br /> <br /> The boy in the school must attend classes when his friend playing truant and given the most important lesson of his life, only to find that if you do not have enough copies to go around, he must share with the school bully. <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films involving children, or cast these children hold their own, and it's true. The soundtrack perfectly complements the emotion of the piece and the climax of the film works well.
