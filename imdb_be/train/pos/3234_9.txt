I thought it was very clever film. I was very pleased and really could not "ask for more. I actually owned this film, because I did not return it to someone ... What should I do, but I really want to keep him because of how much I enjoyed it. In addition, the fact I do not have too many foreign films, and this is the first. Now, I personally love the Finnish material so that certainly adds to how much I enjoyed it. But in general, it is worth watching. However, if you do not as a whole, trying to understand Finnish or read the subtitles a little, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for sure.
