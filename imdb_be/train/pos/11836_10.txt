This animated film is a masterpiece! Narration, music, animation and story, where everything is perfect. My girlfriend and I saw him again the second time, and we got a deeper understanding of it. We invited a couple of friends to see the Spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot. When I asked them to come to see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but then they realized that it was more than that. I love Esperance, Spirit, rain, and Lil Â»Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Chase Kony, who smiles a lot in Dances with Wolves. Spirit has a deep symbolic meaning and metaphor, which I found to be empowering and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I saw the Spirit for the third time, and I want to see him again. I enjoyed the "Spirit", because it is extremely portrayal of American Indians is a realistic, dignified and non-stereotypical, unlike the movie "The Road to El Dorado", which was a total farce, because it represented the American Indian and disrespectful stereotypical image. Dreamworks but redeemed himself by making a great film Ghost, which I found to be acceptable! I hope they continue to make great animated films like Ghost, and I would like to see a sequel or spin-offs in the Spirit, when he was done with respect and without stereotypes of American Indians. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend it to others who have an open mind, to go and pay to see the spirit: prairie.
