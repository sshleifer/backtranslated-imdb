When looking for a low budget film, I know what to expect. I expect that their actions are not to be as good (budget reasons), I expect that the lighting is not to be as good (budget reasons), I expect that the sound is not so good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget films as a big budget movie !!! I'm the director, so I understand the budgetary constraints on a low budget film. Theft places, arrows, etc. ... the list goes on and on. I do not want to say that all the action was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza good. Raul Martinez is a natural. Not sold on Charles Washington yet. It should be understood that each row does not matter, some of them throw line. I say, when the film makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave him 8. I would like to see what happens next. Much work Quiroz brothers!
