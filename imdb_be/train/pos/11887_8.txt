It is projected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. Projected losses are greater in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where one can expect 55 million additional deaths. Besides the grim statistics of personal stories that we rarely hear about. Christophe Honoré describes one of the most moving in the Close to Leo, the production of a film for French television in the series, with regard to the issues facing young people. Although fictional, it is a situation that, unfortunately, all too often -. diagnostic effect of HIV infection on loving knit family <br /> <br /> If the twenty-one-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) says his parents and brothers teenagers, Tristan (Rodolfo Poli) and Pierrot (Jérémie Lippmann) that he has AIDS, family destroyed. Taking care of their youth, they decided to include information on his younger brother, 12-year-old Marseille (Yannis Lespert), but he overhears the conversation and begins to pout and act erratically. When Leo travels to Paris for treatment, it takes Marcel to him, but the boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth. Leo tells him that he is sick and Marcel sad, but to accept. If it brings together Marseille meet some ex-gay friend, but the tension between them boils on the surface, setting the stage for a riveting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I felt the scene in bed with the physical contact between the brothers, I feel that sincerity Close to Leo and brilliant performances Lespert and Mignard more than tip the scales in their favor. Seeing events unfold from the perspective of a young boy gives the film authenticity, that reminded me of the movie Leolo Quebec and Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Unlike some American movies, who dance around the anguish of AIDS, Near Leo tells the bitter truth, but it does so in a way that is gentle and surprisingly real.
