I saw this series when it first came out in 70s.i was 14 years old and I watched it in my best friends house, my dad did not want to look it.it became a weekly ritual every Sunday, and as anyone will tell you two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary film in an almost religious silence must mean that it was something special. <br /> <br /> broad scope of events of World War 2 makes heavy object document.so manufacturer broke it on what they consider the most significant key events and devoted one episode each.some episodes covered long periods, such as the "wolf pack ", which covers almost all the six years of the battle of Stalingrad was a battle Atlantic.while one episode to her. <br /> <br /> This film could not be made today, quite simply because the majority of respondents are dead.the list of important players who are giving a wonderful insight into the thinking of the time. Anthony Eden, Foreign Minister Carl donnitz, h Lead from the submarine, Albert Speer, the architect of the animal is sure, then minister for armaments Hitler.in one of the later episodes, we see Traudl Jung, Hitler's secretary, who was with him in the bunker, and it was her that he dictated his last will and testament, she left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and fled across the Russian lines.these and many others play an important role in the realism of the events portrayed. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism it is that the series of code breakers of Bletchley Park is not included, but the revelation of its part in the war appeared only after the series was made so I can not blame creator programs. <br /> <br /> opening titles and music are gorgeous, and the story of Laurence Olivier gives natural gravity scenario. <br /> <br /> Best documentary series ever made? without doubt.unmissable
