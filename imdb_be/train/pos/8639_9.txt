I must begin to apologize, because I thought that the first 75-80% of the film was hilarious. This is mainly due to the performance of Brad Pitt. Spot on. <br /> <br /> To act all participants was quite good, but Brad stole the film. The atmosphere was perfect in every way. I'm not a huge fan Pitt, but this has to be one of his best roles ever. <br /> <br /> Brutal, honest, gritty. All good words to describe this film. <br /> <br /> I read the previous review and the man said that the justification of violence early is not explained. This is due, but, fortunately, it is not necessary to go into details, to get their point across. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave it a 9 because every bar scene 1 or 2 was effective. I believe that the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this film. Underestimated.
