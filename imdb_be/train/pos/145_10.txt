Sequel to "The Kingdom" is a bloody, and even more twisted. I saw only half (I was exhausted and could not sit through 5 1/2 hours), but I liked what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated children, fishing rod ... it has it all! If you have a strong stomach, and how strange a movie is for you. <br /> <br /> In addition, you do not need to see Part 1, to understand it ... you'll see it! <, Br /> <br /> anyone knows, when Great Britain 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Browsing through these marathons of movies in the theater tiring. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there probably will not be "The Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Järegård (Sig) died a year after it was filmed. But you never know!
