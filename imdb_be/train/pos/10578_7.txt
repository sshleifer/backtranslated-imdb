"Parade ramp flooded with light" is just one of several strange spirited musicals that Warner Bros. production in the early 1930s to prevent depression. «42nd Street» and a series Golddiggers were also made during this period, and they have made literally millions of Americans forget their problems for a while, and enjoy. <br /> <br /> While most of the films produced were great talents Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only Foolight Parade was incomparable James Cagney. Almost ten years before his most famous musical «Yankee Doodle Dandy». Here he dances in the fact that most of the original dance styles with his hands, as a rule, descended on his side, and his legs are doing all kinds of undulations and kicks. It is easy to see that he was pleased with himself, and it makes us enjoy it more. <br /> <br /> While almost all the musical sequences appear at the end of the film, they are well worth the wait. I believe that this film was made just before installing the production codes, so some of the costumes and scenes a little risky. But it's all in fun. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that the plot of the movie, just know that there are a lot of laughs and a great cast. Besides those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is in its excited better here. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
