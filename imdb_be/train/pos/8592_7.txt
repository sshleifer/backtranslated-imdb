Well suited for evening entertainment - but the story was unconvincing. Harrison's affair with the first lady was unreal and immaterial; The President was cardboard expression. And who were the real villains anyway? Nothing has been developed or explained sufficiently. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or as mixed in a mole. Villains were nameless and undeveloped, so that you have never experienced participation in the conspiracy. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland have made every effort to inject some reality into the story - the pursuit and confrontation was good. But Kim Besinzher and Eva Longoria were both incredible in their roles, Basinger was not enough character and can in no way Longoria was a Secret Service agent. This could be a very good film, but somehow I missed way too many questions unanswered. Disappointing on the whole, despite some very good scenes. And they use "The West Wing" set for the White House scenes? - I'm waiting for CJ and Charlie will appear!
