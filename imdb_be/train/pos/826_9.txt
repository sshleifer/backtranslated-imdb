I'm tired of people whining about Ewoks! However, they are not the best thing that ever happened in Star Wars, but they happen, so deal with it! In addition, they are cute, and I do not care if they are on the market. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This film always leaves me in tears. This is perfect. End can not be better. I'm happy for the ghost threat, because suddenly throw the focus throughout the history of Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed in the end - it would have been too unsettled in any other way. So those of you who complain that Vader's helmet was removed, take the time to think about it. This is very effective. Vader, the man who was hiding behind the mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick kind of person. He's not quite a car - it is vulnerable <br /> <br /> I do not know how the casting director would pick up such good actors in New Hope .. They do everything so well. They believable characters. Hamill does an excellent job with its dramatic character development. Fischer does an excellent job of being a woman role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba, even when many others have failed!). Harrison Ford - say more <br /> <br /> music again brilliantly ?. It is so very touching and there, if you can choose a character theme in different parts of the movie. Best menopause, when Luke yells "Nooo!" And jumps out to fight with his father in the final battle. John Williams is not nothing but a genius! What a strange man! <br /> <br /> Even in the film is so much more sense to me because of Episode I. I can not wait to finally see it in theaters (CAN WAIT ???) and then watch the original trilogy again . <br /> <br /> Bravo!
