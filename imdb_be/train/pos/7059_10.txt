I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I've seen on the Internet, I thought that Cinderella 2 (and 3) very cute and funny sequel to all - children and adults ... I, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also believe this is a very informative movie, it shows the lessons being true to yourself and following your heart. I think he has a great animation, and voice casting was very good; lyrics by Brooke Allison too. Since this film has been divided into three Flashbacks / History, has a favorite of the three, it is the story of when Jacques mouse became a man during the day, thanks to the good fairy and her magic.
