Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, along with Jennifer Aniston, to combine one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (in late May) and good improvement in the past Curry crazy and personally forgetable roles in the comedies of the past. With a little softened Kerry tricks yet to zap and crackle of his old self, Carrey powerfully carries this film to the height of laughter, as well as some dramatic, tearful darkest moments. Elements of real acting ability Jim continue to emerge in this film. These lovely summer entertainment hit most of the buttons, including the dramatic elements with the silly moments that fit perfectly with this scenario. Although still lacking in perfectly polished ensemble comedy / drama, Bruce, Almightly credit for that big date movie together with hard and soft message of spiritual cynicism and parody, which retains its good-natured taste. Eight out of ten stars.
