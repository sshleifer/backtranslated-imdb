A lot has been said about this film, and I would like to join those who have praised it. This is a very unique film, which uses elements of various genres: dramas, comedies, gangster film, so as not to stain it. At points you just laugh at other points you feel for the characters, whose mistakes and failures you look. Genius Saba can be noted in respect of certain film sequences. Firstly, where the three of them chasing each other have an erotic dream about the day the young woman, they just passed on the street. This sequence is nicely done and shows the symbols of all three runners very well. It's sexy and funny at the same time. Another example of the genius of Saba is part of the film where the runners are tired. The first of these, a typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for someone else again, and you see that they are dancing with each other and in the next shot he dances himself, deeply moving. All runners get to that point where they think there is something back they lost, or are on their way again. And in one part of the film, they stopped chasing each other, running in line, just laughing.So here all this beauty and ludicrousness of what we call life, we can show that Sub throughout the film. His characters are not able to (they are after all?), But it does not deprive them of dignity. "Monday" and "The Postman Blues", which makes the validity of Saba claims that he is a genius. Go watch them! <br /> <br />
