/ * Minor spoilers * / <br /> <br /> Way back to the Evangelion was made to Hideaki Anno was an idol and a household name for many fans of anime and Gainax reached fanfavorite status, Gunbuster was done. Only with Wings Honneamise Gainax made at the time, and the famous shorts Otakon or known, Gunbuster had some tough acts to follow. It does not make it easier on yourself by choosing a genre that has made countless times before, space opera. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Gainax has decided to put him in a six-part OAV (on the video) series. This allows the series to have a larger volume than would be possible if it was made into a film. It also allows him to become too boring and too long, with a lot of pointless battles and the filler along the way. In addition, they made some effort to stay away from the Space opera mechanics test, which is used in the Gundam or Macross, and many other popular space opera. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the show starts quite easy, with Norik in the Graduate School of Okinawa for mechapiloting. Norik is the daughter of a respected commander, who was killed in action, when she was a small child. This makes her life at the Academy is rather difficult, as some of her classmates begin to suspect that Noricum help the professor. The first episode is quite a lot of comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school. Things change quickly, when the threat of alien invasion is declared, and Norik and Kazuo (the best girl in the class) are chosen so as to help raise a fleet of. <br /> <br /> The average weight Gunbuster leaves our women's role in space, focusing both on the personal dramas and action. A couple more characters are entered, and the last part of Noricum addicted again. In addition, the alien threat is becoming more inevitable every minute, and Gunbuster, the last hope of mankind, represented. Smart as a writer Okada was, he turned on the principles of extension of time to liven things up a bit. In short, time moves more slowly for those who travel at light speed. This means that Norik may be part of a war that took almost a century to complete. In addition, the dramatic aspect of this is magnified when Noricum again see his friends after returning to base, who are aged considerably longer than hers. Science can not be perfect, but it is presented in a rather plausible, even some science SD theatrical shorts between scenes where Norik, Kadumim and their coach to give a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series. <, Br /> <br /> animation series made in the 80s, of course, good. Design retro 80s style, of course, but it does have it's charm. Animation quite freely and character design is good, although the costumes do betray <br /> <br /> Some fanservisa delighted Gainax later exploit to the fullest. The rotating throughout the show is pretty cool also Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machines, strong and broad. The last episode was completely done in black and white. While it is commonly believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for reasons of budget, it gives a completely different atmosphere in the series, which fits perfect for the last part. <br /> <br /> music is very typical space opera Fair. Too bombastic in places, very general, and certainly not worth buying. He comes to the series for the most part, but it can be quite annoying at times. Tanaka is not very well-known composer and the only respectable series he worked in Dragon Half. If you think, 80s anime music, you will know what to expect. <br /> <br /> In the course of the series, the focus is slowly shifting from a drama to a space opera in an epic battle, but in a way the audience can hardly notice it. Step by step, the drama will soften, and the battle will be the front row. Neither aspect is not completely left out, though. On the latest episode in sight, Norik and the team fighting for the continued existence of the human race, and the last battle in sight, some of the questions submitted to the classroom, on the situation of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go, to ensure self-preservation. Despite the fact that they never answered later, they still represent an interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic, with a good, but a predictable ending, although not all the endings should contain many strange twists, of course. Again, this corresponds to the series. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster may sound like the average space opera anime on the ground, with the alien invasion, massive battles, and some personal drama, and for the most part, it is. But it is done exceptionally well for a change. Instead of going on a constant mixture of the former elements, the length of six episodes, Gunbuster presents us with the transition from small-scale to large-scale drama of epic heroism. Along the way we meet some different interesting and well fleshly form characters that relationship varies greatly due to the time dilation effects. The show is very tightly written, although it is usually stumble in some spots. Overly dramatic manifestations and cheese too attack bags can be easily avoided. In general, Gunbuster trip takes you on a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It may not break the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least bend them slightly. Very nice anime classic, but not without flaws. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
