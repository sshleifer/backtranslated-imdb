For people of a certain age, W.W. II was the defining moment of their lives, and all that followed never be compared. As the film opens, recently widowed, but still living woman (Judy Dench) hear a street musician boldly trying to play the classic song, "Stardust." <br /> <br /> It reminds her recollection of when she played in almost all girls band that entertained between bombing raids during the war. Drummer Patrick (Ian Holm), happily avoided the draft and enjoyed at home. <br /> <br /> Patrick and Dench landmark meet and decide together a group that takes them to a series of mini-adventures. Despite the ups and downs, the band reunited and does make a successful reappearance. <br /> <br /> The film is written and elegantly understated, with excellent performances from all participants. The characters are well developed and all the people who will not abandon life, despite his age. And there's that glorious old swing! <br /> <br /> This is not pontification Steven Spielberg, and serious film, however. The war touched everyone and the lesson is not forgotten in the film that is not afraid to entertain as it teaches.
