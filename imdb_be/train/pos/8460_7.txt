Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate that for me Gundam and anime in general. However, after watching their predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I believe wing to be Gundam Lite <br /> <br /> The characters :. Aspect long held Gundam, to have their characters stay out of difficulties and to grow in maturity. This does not happen in the wing. Hiro is a bump in the beginning, and he is the leader at the end. Individuals do not change, growth is never achieved. Best character Zechs, which for all intents and purposes, a hero for much of the series. But then a series of betraying him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason <br /> <br /> Mecha :. The wing has a large costume design. The Gundams super cool, with Epyon be my favorite. I even see some of OZ costume designs to be on par with some of the classic Zeon suits. But the sweet costume design is not quite record a series of unfortunate characters <br /> <br /> Conclusion :. In the end, the wings have a cool fight scenes, although permeated processed animation, but the plot and the character of the small development. Nice, but does not move as the previous Gundam picnics.
