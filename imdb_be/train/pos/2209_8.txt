In my opinion, this is a very good celebrity sketch show. I loved to see Greg Kinnear as a host. There are many reasons why I said that. Although, Hal Sparks was a good host, I sometimes want to Greg Kinnear left. If you ask me, it seems that no one is left out of the TV show throughout its run more. Nevertheless, I enjoyed seeing the different hosts and other people Spoofing celebrities. If you ask me, it was pretty darn funny. Before we wrap this up, I have to say that I like to miss this show. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this show for all you die-hard fans of sketch show. Do you really enjoy it.
