Men of Honor has many great aspects to it. Good action sequences, a lot of "feel good" stage, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the film is a great effect. Basically, Robert De Niro. History of the People of Honor focuses on Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first African American deep-sea diver in the Navy. It chronicles his struggle with the rough being poor farmers to get into a diving school and beyond. It's a good story, but it seems to me that this has been done many times before. Man, against all odds, do not give up until they achieve their goals they have established many years ago for some sentimental reasons. This can happen, but a lot of faces in Brashear fight questionable film, including c.o. diving school of falsification of his final test. However, all that is on the scene when Robert De Niro finally included in the film. Deniro plays an important Sunday Mater, who is a professor in the school of diving Brashear visited. Once Deniro comes down to it this atmosphere of extreme arrogance, that you can not hate you if you have an incredible wilpower. Before the film ends, Deniro highlights several performances that would have you laughing at how cool it is, but you are too stunned at the way he beats them. In the end, you have to question some of the aspects of the film, but to recognize that, if this were all true, it would be you slumber is his place in the first twenty minutes.
