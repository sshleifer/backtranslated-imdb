I first saw the Ice Age in Subiaco box office when it was released back in '02. I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. It was some kind of heat. <br /> <br /> We had it on video for years, and no matter how many times you see, it never gets boring. This is due to the one element that makes it different from all other 3D-animation, made at the time - the characters have no special "home" that they leave. They are nomads, and it's really refreshing and uplifting to watch. <br /> <br /> In addition, each individual mark on the surface, appear to be merely tolerated each other, but in fact they are all good friends. As well, all the characters have their charms (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth magic into his annoying, it is sweet and naive sort of way. Manny perfect in his depression, reclusive character, and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> Another great point about the film the beauty of animation. All the environment and characters were initially modeled clay, giving the film artistic edge. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feeling of the film is that the floor is very little affected. There are almost no female characters, but you do not really understand that at that time, after you watch it a few times, and even then it has little effect on how you view the movie. In this regard, there is also no mention of the nuclear family, it would be really miserable in the atmosphere as the ice age. <br /> <br /> In general, Ice Age is a great film, and is a proof of how much effort was put into 3D-animation before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles was released.
