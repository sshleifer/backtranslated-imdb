Greetings from this Portuguese Man :) <br /> <br /> I think The Sopranos is one of the best ever production, it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it is difficult to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fit on paper, like a glove! I would like the Sopranos would never finish at all. It's great! This should be a subject in school :) I've seen The Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to be awakened until the episode ends, so now I have bought all of the episodes on DVD and I watch all the episodes at home before and after lunch, and I become addicted, like I did with Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best in the history of the series made for television. The argument as a beautiful and wonderful actors. Congratulations for this work. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my English. Thanks for reading.
