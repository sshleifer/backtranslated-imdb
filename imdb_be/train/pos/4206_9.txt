Skip McCoy is three times lost pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he chooses candy purse on the subway train. What he does not realize that Kendo holds a secret microfilm, microfilm, which is of great interest to many many organizations. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller handled exceptional drama among fallen underworld of New York City. Communist spies and shady government operatives all mix together to make a Pickup on South Street riveting review of the first minute to the last. Based around the story Dwight Taylor called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller captured this adaptation with a chunky political agenda, something that many feel at the time ran out to do, but focus only on their anti-communist tendency makes it a great disservice. <, Br /> <br /> Digging a little deeper, and you will find both intriguing character, as any that fullerenes aims, the main character is a hero for one play, a rogue and a shallow man, his heroic Sun is born out of love for their country, they are born with it a huge persistent veins. This is a great achievement that Fuller intended to one of the best anti-heroes of the '50s, and I'm sure he was very grateful for the execution Widmark as the McCoy, all grin and cold heart, his interaction with the beautiful Jean Peters as candy is fine, and this heart of the film. However, Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter, who takes on the acting awards, its MOU strong and as shabby as the surrounding characters, but there are tired warm her Ritter passes majestically. <br /> <br /> This is a B movie in the texture, but the film and on the performance, the Pickup on South Street is a real stylish and entertaining film, which is the best of his most intriguing director. 9/10
