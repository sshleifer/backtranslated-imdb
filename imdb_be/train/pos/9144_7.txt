Ok, so this may not be the award-winning "Film of the Year" film type (except for the brilliant soundtrack that I think has won several awards), but it's really a great film about «The Kid» (Prince / O (take your pick) and happening around him, who live in Minneapolis, playing my music. music is absolutely gorgeous, in my opinion, you should have this soundtrack, it really is a classic and misses eighties sounds and feel in a great way. and the film played a good story, it worth seeing again and again, espeically if you like a prince / O (I ablyu) course.
