We must not lose this film is one of the biggest I've ever seen. Jean-Pierre Leo strange (more than usual), and the film is one of the most memorable fashion Nouvel. Eustache is no longer on this earth, we just have this black-and-white images to remember one of the biggest and most subvalued French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I will never forget it. <br /> <br /> P.S:. Sorry for the english ...
