For all the reviewers on this page, I have to say that this film worth seeing. So it was done in 1972, so. Fashion in the film was exactly the same fashion of his time. People who do not learn the culture of decades will think that this film is a cheese ball. Compared with the current series of 'backward' (which made for our time right now) it looks cheezy. However, only part of the cheezy fashion film, which was again over 30 years in the past. BUT. The message that is sent in this film is very powerful, and carefully preserved. There is just so much to say, but I refuse to talk. (Because of the fear to spoil it) So come out and see this movie! If you do not like the message that it sends, then you have issues that need some attention!
