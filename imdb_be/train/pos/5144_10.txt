This is a very strange movie unlike anything done in the West at that time. With its turbulent emotions and vision networks, frightening dreams and images, its effect as a nice and anxious. Actors choreograph a dance, you act. It contains only a dream sequence, I know that actually resembles a nightmare (sorry, Daly supporter).
