I rented this movie when it came out on video tape and liked. I was able to purchase it on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it several times since then. I would have to agree with others when they said Indian summer was a nostalgic film. When I look at it, I wish I could be 10-14 times. I think that's why we all love the film to some extent. We all sometimes wish we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Would not it be nice to have all of your friends / parents be young again? In order not to have to worry about their work, being a father, etc ... ??? I know that I would go to the De Lorean and go back in time. While I enjoyed the movie very much my favorite film of the camp constantly, although this Meatballs with Bill Murray. I wish they could do the Indian summer version of it.
