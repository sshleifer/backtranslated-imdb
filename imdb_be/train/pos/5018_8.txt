If you're like me, then you will love this great majority of adolescents movie.i think there is a prank / book love / High School USA / shout / calender girl / crybaby / all the big movies set in the 50s and latitude early 60s, and it has a wonderful soundtrack.not as many songs as some of these types of movies, but still great.it all so very funny sometimes, and has a great love interest.all young cast are great .i wish there were more like this wonderful movies.my favorite movie of all time back in the future when Artio McFly return to gosu 1955 well in these remarkable films, he remains in Fobello 50s (in the early 60 years), there are some movies of this type is better than this, but not much.
