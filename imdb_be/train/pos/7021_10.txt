I had the pleasure to attend the show of the Pacific and Eddy over the weekend at the International Festival in Santa Barbara Film Festival. The film caught my attention some time ago, when I came across an article about it in the magazine Jalouse. It seemed interesting at the time, but not too exciting. Anyway, I saw him in the festival program and decided to check it out. All I can say is that I was speechless when the ending credits started to roll. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films that I've seen in a while. The direction of photography, art, acting, and especially the direction was seamless and flawless. Nothing is "written" for you in this movie, and really makes you think. The fact that the vast majority of films today does just the opposite. Dialogue carefully and, although this scenario is not wall to wall chatter characters word is very deliberate and meaningful. <br /> <br /> It is definitely one of those movies that deserves a second viewing, and the more you see it, the more things you will notice. This is a very layered and intelligent film. Not sure what, when and where he plays again, but definitely a must see for film enthusiasts.
