Passions are high and some women try to disguise themselves as men in order to get into the game. <br /> <br /> Women who were caught (Game Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayeste Iran Aida Sadeqi, Golnas Farman and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained for prosecution provided, funny and light to look into the practices of that country, and most likely, all the Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who guarded and transported them as towns and villages, and the father, who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments, we thought about why they have such unwritten rules. <br /> <br /> This is mainly about the paternalistic society which feels that it needs to save the women from the crude behavior of this man. Instead of educating the male population, they deny the privileges and rights of women. <br /> <br /> Seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of Iranian society, it nos surprise this film does not get any backlash Iran. But Panahi has a winner on its hands for those who can see.
