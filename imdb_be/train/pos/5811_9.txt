Only 9/10 from me, a perfect ten would be if there was more story to the film, but nevertheless Lunokhod to this day remains a fun celebration of music, dance and entertainment. Starting with the installation of video clips from Jackson's long career, he reminded the audience why he is often regarded as the "King of Pop". From his stroke, "I want you back" to "We are the World" multi-award charity record for Africa. After this kind of short film, although lackluster in the Oscar winning script, however, it provides a fantastic entertainment and drama to audiences. Ending with a perfect (sexy!) Version «Come Together». Something the whole family can watch and enjoy.
