"The Big Goodbye" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case, Captain Picard posing as a private investigator Dixon Hill. This episodes creates a standard template that is repeated several times in the ANP, as well as DS 9 and Voyager.

These holodeck "games", usually used for rest and reflect the personal interests of the members of the crew. Therefore the technical aspect is always neglected, and from this point of view, history never sound (but did Star Trek has never been a technical and scientific point of him, I mean, except for some utopian concept?). <br /> <br /> Â«big farewell" shows relaxed Patrick Stewart, Makfaddno that hardly ever looked better in an episode of Star Trek (at least early) and the data have some great scenes, too (although I believe that hard to believe that pulling the plug in a lamp would really surprised him from the wall, for what he has done research on this period and its customs). Wesley continues to rotate in a peaceful Trekkies potential killer (why did not they take his holodeck and let the bandits to kill him?) But all in all this his satisfaction ...
