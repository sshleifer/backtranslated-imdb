This is the best Chinese film I've ever seen, and, in my opinion, much better than the hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: It's a beautiful love story, action, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most surprising thing is that it really is a success in all of this! <br /> <br /> This film definitely makes it my top 5, and should be enjoyable for every movie lover. The action sequences are traditional unrealistic jumps and even fly, but the way it is shot is different from the Hero of style and a lot of flying always looks great and, as a rule, even makes sense (ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> See this movie you will not regret it. 10/10
