I saw this wonderful product, and I'm wondering if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the wife of a blacksmith, I am not sure of the name of his character. I went to BYU with her and lost contact with her, her maiden name was Kim, Luke and I am wondering if anyone has any information about it. It is not listed in the credits. This production was outstanding, Tear-Jerker on all accounts, all perfectly valid. I believe that I do not even want to put it into the general category of "action", more like a "painting with a sense of strange events that led to the discovery of heaven for this final image" ..... something like that. If anyone has worked with Kim or a website or something please let me know !!! It was fantastic in his role, incidentally .... Thank you, Melissa Thorne
