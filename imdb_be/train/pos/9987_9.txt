I was pleasantly surprised by the story because I am going through something similar with my, with my own parents actually linked. It's so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing once was alive and warm. And then there are mistakes they made and have to live. I loved the work of Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne who? It is fantastic! A real find. There is probably the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, but nothing has been shown - it was just so beautifully done. In general, the appearance of the film was stunning, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser very very good in this picture, he humanizes man spiraling downward. I liked how the director approached the life of this woman, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to catch us, but not enough to get caught.
