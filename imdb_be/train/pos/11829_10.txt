I was watching "Dick Tracy" for many years, and as a result it has become an important part of my life - it's happened to me in my childhood, and I saw him quite often seeing it now, as an adult, he is still a very good movie. - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood About the only thing we can say is an Oscar nomination Pacino received -.. except that it is rarely discussed and have not done a lot of fuss when it came out <br /> <br /> Pacino OTC top, but to good effect, as it is clear, I am having a lot of fun. Beatty large as Dick Tracy and Rear camera manages to capture the atmosphere of film noir comic book is better than any other film, maybe I have ever seen. Just look at a scene from the movie is breathtaking. Lighting, velvety overtones and smog / smoke combine to create a great effect. <br /> <br /> there are some really funny cameos including one Dustin Hoffman as the «Mumbles», and I do not think there are any disadvantages at all in terms of the action - even mandatory for the child's character is much better than expected, <br /> <br /> as a whole, really great movie, which became Mr. ie realized over the years since its release and is incredibly undervalued only 5.7. / 10 in average of IMDb. Critics are very positive (check rottentomatoes.com) and after watching the film once again it is not difficult to understand why. - this is a great example of capturing the essence of the comic book, from the style to the eccentricity <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
