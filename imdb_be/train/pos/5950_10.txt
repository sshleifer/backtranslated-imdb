This movie is great. The plot is very true book, which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The film starts from the scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of children under the name "if you stub your toe on the moon," That reminds me of High Hopes Sinatra song, it's fun and inspiring. Great music around, and my favorite song by the King, Hank (Bing Crosby) and Sir «dangling» Sagamore. Overall a great family film, or even a great date movie. This is a film that you can watch over and over again. Princess Rhonda Fleming played great. I love this film !! If you like Danny Kaye in the Court Jester, then you will definitely like this movie.
