For those of you who think that only anime giant reptiles raped schoolgirls, think again. There is a completely different side of the Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of these shows. This sweet-natured story about a boy with a gift to make delicious bread. His universe is the creation of Japanese bread, which may correspond to a well-known European breads. Show how stupid as they come, and I am sure that a non-Japanese audience will miss a lot of jokes. But it's still very nice to look at because of the complete innocent vibe of the show. <br /> <br /> In a world Yakitate! it is not uncommon for people to see how they just orgasm after eating bread. Bread and hallucinations may provide the consumer with a wide variety of superpowers, from time travel to swim like a fish. This amazing aspect makes it one of the least predictable and funniest show I have seen in a while.
