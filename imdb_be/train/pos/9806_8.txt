I agree that the capital should be on DVD. I was watching the show just by chance in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial sector to change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role he was. I can not believe that the show only lasted 13 episodes. I loved William Armstrong as one striking the magic of Hudson in the series. If they broadcast the show in the New York area, it was always late at night or on the weekend times. Show less than an hour long. I felt that this show has gone longer, but changes in the casting in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I did not care about Sylvia, but missed the actress Julia Phillips Lane in the previous season. I felt that this show is in danger and he often worked. He showed the Americans, who love and prefer to live in London. American heroes were not arrogant or trying to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize the actor, instead of doing them all the Briton. I loved to watch Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt that this show should last longer. I felt sometimes that previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred throwing in New York, and it would be a hit in America.
