House of the Spirits is a fascinating story of a family affair, the South American politicians and super-natural forces. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring novel by Isabel Allende to life with all his passion and suspense. This, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and matures very believable, and Meryl Streep in the role of Clara keeps it tender, loving warmth throughout his relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas to make a beautiful pair of fighting for the adoption of a family in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as well as sister Esteban gives a very touching performance. Countryside Portugal is a reasonable substitute for the non-tropical Latin American countries. Setting home of Clara and Esteban Ranch are effective and period American cars add beautiful post-war atmosphere.
