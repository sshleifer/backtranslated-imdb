The sad story of the downed pilot B-17. Brady shot down over occupied territory. Local ranchers continued his mercy and protection at the expense of their own lives. I've never heard about this film, and he hooked me for two hours. After the movie ended, I'm glad I took the time. This is a story told to explain the expression Brady faces at the beginning of the film.
