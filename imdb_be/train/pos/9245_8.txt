Jean Harlow and Clark Gable had a great team on the screen, and it may be their best film together. <br /> <br /> So, Hold Your Man can be cheesy and predictable, but it's not something that I love cinema. I love to see, Harlow and Gable together, and in this film it just fine. It is obvious that they really enjoyed working together, and this is part of what makes it such a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> The witty dialogue, a great script and attention to detail are the other things that make it such a good movie. I loved this movie the first time I saw him, and at each subsequent viewing, I always notice at least one new item. For me this is a sign of a great film. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and the script better than most films of this period of time (in the early 30's). I love classic movies, but I recognize that most of them are just average, and sometimes do not hold my interest. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> It has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a "pre-Code" movie. (Hays Code was enforced only in a year after not Hold Your Man.) This film could not be made under the code. Well, it could be done, but it would be a different story. Thankfully, the code was not enforced until 1934. Otherwise, we would not have missed out on this gem.
