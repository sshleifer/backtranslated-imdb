Well, for starters, it was actually the most elegant Clausen film on that date. <br /> <br /> A person always makes sense for the characters with a slice of humor to it, but I think he's in this movie unparrallel adds dimension to something that he has done before. His work - very black n 'white words - was adopted by a broad, but not critical, that the audience, and we've always admired his sense of humor and his ability to mix it up with the problems of man and give the audience a clear way to know what he has to say. <br /> <br /> in the Â«Villa Paranoia, but for the first time, he surprised the invisible wisdom and respect for minorities. Not only ethnic, but also ordinary people, which you tend to forget is shown in Jutland. - in the "country" - it's about the eternal problem of the lack of love, but in close and sometimes brutal manner that keeps you looking and keeps you focused and on top of that he is. he manages to play a ****** d! true to ***** d, who wants the right, but has no idea how to get there, and why people suffer. Gorka. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best films I've seen this year, and I very much ahead of his next.
