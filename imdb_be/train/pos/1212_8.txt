Care Bears Movie 2: The New Generation is not a bad film. In fact, I like it very much. Yes, I admit that the dialogue and the story is banal little understatement at times. But Darkheart, while very, very dark is quite convincing villain werewolf, and Hadley Kay did an excellent job of voicing it. Speaking of voice, it was great, nothing wrong with it at all. Colorful animation and some visual effects, especially in the beginning were breathtaking. The songs and score beautiful, especially growing and Forever Young, the past has always been my favorite of the two. Care Bears, which I love, adorable, and human children are well done too. And the ending is a real sentimental. In general, harmless kiddie fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
