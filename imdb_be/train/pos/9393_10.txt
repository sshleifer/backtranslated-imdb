Some of the movies that you just know what you're going to love from the first seconds. This is one of those films. Tracing it roots "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 40s - it's a great example of a modern film noir in the 90s. Nick Cage plays "down on its success," the main character, who becomes entangled in a murder plot husband-wife - and his success goes from bad to worse, even worse, as he tries and tries to get away from people, cities, violence and the threat of Red Rock West. Many twists and turns, great performances of Cage, Hopper and Walsh, hypnotic slide guitar background music, and seamlessly directing make it a real joy. Favorite line: If the cell is looking at an empty track of gas in the car to get a one-off, shakes his head and says: Â«F *** my life story."
