There were some great moments of reality in there showing contemporary life (not only in Japan but also around the world). It shows how stuffy ones culture can be, and wanting to escape from the mold created it for you. <br /> <br /> dance was simply a means of saying "do what you love, even if it is against the rules," Billy Elliot Rather, I would say. I enjoyed this film as well. <br /> <br /> humor was timely, touching moments and feel so real, you can feel the awkwardness between Sugiyama and his wife, tantrums in the ballroom. I loved Aoki - he is and what his wig and a surplus on the dance floor I just howl <br /> <br /> The actors all did an excellent job, the story was well written !. I watched it a second time and caught some small nuances that I missed on first viewing. Good fun!
