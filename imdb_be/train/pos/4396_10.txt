I really enjoyed the parts that are included in the script. <br /> <br /> Rhys Meyers (typo) and Jewel was outstanding in its support role. As Jeffrey Wright. Toby McGuire gave, as a penalty, productive work as usual drew when he had to amputate the arm of her best friend, knowing that he would die without the procedure. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail, with good dialect training to catch the Southern accent very well. <br /> <br /> Why is this film was shelved promoters Hollywood I can only imagine. I have a strong suspicion. What makes it all the more attractive to me. I gave a dozen DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> Completely ignore the film. Rent or buy it and give it your attention for a couple of hours, then judge.
