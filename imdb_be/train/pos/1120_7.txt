Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name, which was released in 1994. But it's Shallow Grave is a worthy addition to the 80-backwoods slasher. <br /> <br /> The story goes = 4 sorority girls from convent life planning spring break in Florida, but plans on hold when one human witness killing a local woman, and when he realizes what he has seen, well, let's just say that it becomes a deadly game of cat-and-mouse, and things get worse when he is the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shallow Grave in my opinion, one of the most pleasant slashers, released in the 80s, especially in the late 80's, which was once an interesting split went down, it was one of the few who do not use and the film must be better known, it is a pity that it is not. this is one film that really confounds the stereotypes (just trying to guess who will be the final girl - I have it completely wrong). Principle cast all lovely, and it's one of those movies that you kind of hope that they are, you, of course, they do not. This, combined with the splendor of the first half hour, hour banks of the film (in a good way) with some flashes of real nastiness (second murder gives a real shake-up) and unexpected sleaziness (even if I did not expect not a high budget thriller that topless scene where a woman strangled with her own bra (accompanied by hysterical religious radio), the film by the end of the 80s). <br /> <br /> There are one or two bad things about this film, not bad only minor, as a sub-plot with two teenagers who do not go anywhere, and in the final, which was stupid and plus the inability of the Deputy to follow the logic. There is no sharp implements in Shallow Grave, but, in my opinion, at least, this slasher film through. The scenes where the girls hunted the woods for malicious Sheriff stressful and exciting. <br /> <br /> On the whole, a very pleasant and decent slasher with large projections on all four main girls and that crazy sheriff.
