This film is an excellent example of excellent narrator. Action is excellent. History inspires, without being overly manipulative or fake. There were a couple of points where they are likely to make people a little more good or bad than they actually were, but given that it's a Hollywood movie, they showed remarkable restraint. There was not a single explosion is shown in the film, despite the fact that they had one more opportunity. The film, while having a disturbing part, was not made in an action movie. History, therefore, made to focus on an unusual person at the usual time, unfortunately. Well done!
