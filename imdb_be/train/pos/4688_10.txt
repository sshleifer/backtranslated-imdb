I showed it to my 6th grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it. I loved him, too. History of termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing. There is a deep acting, and they all play their part well. The battle between the two cold-blooded titans really classic frames. <br /> <br /> Alan Ruth made some incredible camera work, and it must be won Best Documentary Oscar. Copy I have not Orson Welles tells his (Derek Jacobi), and it is not called "Mysterious Castles of Clay," just "clay castles." It makes me think that this should be done with Wells added star power and push Oscar. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to find this VHS recently, and now my child's favorite movie. They brought him to the last family gathering instead of a Disney movie. If you can find this movie, you are really lucky.
