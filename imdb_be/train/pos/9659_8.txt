"Almost nothing" is a beautifully observed portrait of a young French gay experience. Rejecting both stereotypes and preaching, it's weird naturalistic film, superbly acted, shot with a sense for the seaside town where the action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. If there is something almost too realistic, as there is little in the way of the traditional story, but scenes from the life. But the absence of the traditional dramatic tension counts less than it could have in the world, so thinly drawn. "Almost nothing," may not be the most exciting movie ever made; but its just humanism serve him well in comparison with preconceived festive or fanatical views, which often Maras treatment of this topic. Worth watching.
