In 90 minutes of experience, it is not up to standard 'Drive "and the actors clearly learned the trade na` Who am I?" The Academy, while the sequence is not, as a rule, is not better than the excellent Mark Dacascos beat them up. However, those who used `Drive», (and I thought it was great!), No doubt, will enjoy this, too. You certainly will not rewind to the beginning and watch it all over again, but you are sure to be poured back some of the scenes for a long time. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to see that art as fight choreography still practiced, even if not in Hong Kong, and I would like to see what these guys could do with budgets, time and respect for, the submission of such Yuen Woo-Ping and Corey Yuen Gui. If you sit through the first half hour i do not go crazy with the brutal dialogue, then you are in for a treat. Bosch is great and can really bust a move with some wonderful acrobatics, kicks and an easy feat. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to be within 500 miles of copies, and then track it down and watch it. This is not Shakespeare. In fact, it is less eloquent than Coolio in `China Strike Force», but you'd be surprised how moves on the screen and the pain felt by the stunt team - (I'm sure that there is no safe way to directly land on your head or be forced to head butt a wooden roof on the racing car!). <br /> <br />
