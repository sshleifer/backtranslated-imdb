See you show people, my impression of silent comedy, in fact farce, and only a farce. I could not imagine how the screen comedy could be possible without significant reliance on the spoken word or the numerous omissions. But this is a clever film proved me wrong. Davis, in my opinion, was probably the greatest comedienne to come to Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy in the first place because the manner of Davis and facial expressions remind me about it before, that I wonder if Davis was not one of the main influences Boll. It comes from the 21-year-old, who had never seen a silent comedy, and I must say that no matter how many links a particular period, you actually get (I did not, perhaps), you will not miss this movie. You'll probably even laugh more than you would in most Talkie comedies. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but is easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
