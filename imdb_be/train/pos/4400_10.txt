The star of the film script. Attention to detail for the period in clothing, language, social norms (we do not hurt a woman) and different policies. This is a reminder of Kosovo today. Thin part in the scenes there for the attentive viewer and the choreography of the action sequences is excellent. Perhaps this film is close to the bone of reality in order to earn the support that should have received. This is similar to the rise of violence staircase with a well paced pause of peace and tranquility between each step. Great movie ....
