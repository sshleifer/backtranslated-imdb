I first saw this movie when it was originally released. I was about 9 years old. old and I found this film to be very exciting and very scary, and unlike any other film I've seen so far <br /> <br /> The main schedule :. The expedition sent from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a large mainsequence star in the constellation Aquila, to find out what happened to a colony of settlers who landed twenty years ago, and has not been heard since then <br /> <br /> THEME :. unequal civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remnants of highly developed alien civilization, Krell-200,000 years removed. The "seed" the destruction of a civilization is transferred to another, not knowing in the first place. The theme of this film is very good against evil. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie with my brother, when he came out initially. I was just a boy and a tiger scene really scares me, as did the action scenes with an unseen force Being. I was also struck by how real things looked in the film. <br /> <br /> What really captures my attention, as an adult, although it is true of the film "forbidden knowledge", and how it will be if we do (if ever) come into contact with advanced (alien) civilization significantly more advanced than we are now. The advanced technology and accountability seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work for themselves, to acquire knowledge, together with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This, in my opinion, the big moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I learned in graduate school that "knowledge is power", at best, in fact, is not correct! Knowledge of the "potential" power depending on how it is applied (... if it is used at all.) [This is not what you know, but how you use what you know!] <br /> < br /> in general, the impact of this film may well be implemented sometime in Humanity own future. This knowledge alone is not enough, we need to need to have the wisdom, knowledge depends on whether or not to control their own destiny, or we will end up like Krell in the movie just winked out. <br /> <br /> thank you very much to everyone who responded to an earlier version of this article with comments and amendments, all of them very much appreciated !! I hope that you, as entertained by the story as well as I have been over the past 40-plus years .... <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 out of 10 stars
