After Deliverance seen films such as Pulp Fiction did not seem so extreme. Maybe by today's standards of blood and bullets do not seem so keen, but if you think it was 1972, and that the film has a truly sinister core, it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I started to watch this movie entirely nothing seemed unusual until I hit the "Duel banjo" scene. In this scene, the brutality and the edge of the film is really visible. When I looked at Drew (Ronny Cox, RoboCop) go head to head with, it would seem, retarted young boy it really shows how nervous these films can get. If you think that a child has a small banjo, which he could have probably made by hand, in comparison with a good way to guitar Drew, you actually find out how much of its territory four. <br /> <br /> as the plot is not very plausible, and never extends past its limits. But what really distinguishes this film, about four business people who get more than they bargained for in a canoe, that director John Boorman (Excalibur) breaks all the characters from the simple caricatures or stereotypes. As the film goes I really cared in the full horror and suspense all four men, and that with them will be. <br /> <br /> To act universally wonderful. With Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) leads a great cast. Jon Voight does, probably, the most difficult in this film, and that makes its transformation from a warrior family man is very plausible. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the beginning, Voight character is transformed for the film. Ned Beatty (Life) as well in an extremely difficult role, come for a hillbilly raped, while Ronny Cox becomes believable performance. <br /> <br /> One thing that really made this movie is powerful to me that the thieves were scared as any I have ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert Coward "Cowboy" was beautiful and very scary as knotweed years. <br /> <br /> In general, Deliverance was excellent, and I suggest it to anyone, for people with a weak stomach, and children, with the exception of. 10/10. Watch this movie.
