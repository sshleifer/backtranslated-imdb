This is a great film about the struggle of Mormons and their final settlement in the Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and end are particularly strong, and the message is one we all need to be reminded of - God does not speak, but he communicates, if only we would listen. As I write this in the midst of the horrors that take place in New Orleans and the surrounding area because of Katrina, I was particularly touched by the Mormons to leave everything behind and move on after Joseph Smith was killed. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, and yet they could not. Fighting Mormons cross the country, the value of life, the severity they suffered really impressive, demonstrating its great power. As for the actual Mormon beliefs, it's not much left in, and polygamy is mentioned, but not a central element of the film at all. <br /> <br /> Throw-notch, although others have commented on to learn more about real characters and can say exactly how that image was. But as an actor, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Donlevi, John Carradine, Jane Darwell all are doing fine with the script they were given. <br /> <br /> Although the film could easily have stood on its own (and, of course, does today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the plaster to get the crowd to the theaters to see a film about the Mormons. Catering perfectly beautiful as the young Mormons, and Darnell, and Zina, Sun Mormons, but remain with the family after her father was killed. The power is not a lot to do by the end of the film when it has a large stage and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of filming) is even smaller, although they make an excellent pair. Their fate remains unclear with regard to its transformation, and makes one wonder about polygamy in their case. You can not beat no one for eye candy, though.
