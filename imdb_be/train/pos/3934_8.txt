Young Mr.Lincoln poetic, beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history. Henry Fonda was a difficult task to reflect a mythical figure and at the same time make it quite human for people to take care of. This is perhaps the best actors performance.Watch, he single-handedly stops the violence-mob.Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer woman.Most last part of the movie is played in the courtroom, and there is only negative thing I can tell movie.Most characters from the judge to give the audience so much folksy humorous lines that distracts from the serious trial which is to hand.But I was used to it, because humor is a trademark of Ford , support is often Ward Bond and Donald Meek very well.
