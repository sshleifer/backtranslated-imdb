I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are still talking about this movie! Obviously, this film is not so bad, or people do not even bother to talk about it. Personally, I liked this movie immensely, and so far! I think that this film is not for everyone, but it is, of course, affect the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> As for those who think that this film is "overvalued" or "shot down" ... Well, we have just the movie-going public, to thank for that! lol * You see, this is not criticism / article writers that make the movie "huge" or "HIT" with a total film publicity. People make the film a huge success. On the Titanic, everyone was thrilled. Let's face it, a film like this has never been done before. At least, not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship is actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron calculate the actual draft of the ship in the film with a real sink on that fateful day in April 1912 Even the silverware for the good use of matched! <br /> <br /> Give this film a break you guys! Critics think that this film will sink a great time! If this film does come out, and people began to hear oral (which is the best form of advertising you type), it was a good / decent / film worth seeing, everything began to flock to the theaters of the crowd to see this movie ... no once, not twice, but can be 3 times more! So I really did not want to say that this film was "overhyped" ... at least, not as an outgrowth from the MATRIX or rebooted Hulk now "overhyped." ha! Critics did not even think that the Titanic is enough money to cover a huge budget Cameron film it took to make this mammoth film. Money, however, films made sure 200 million budget and more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. However, this film may not be for everyone. Not to say that this film sucks just because of the romance, though! This is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Not liking the movie just because it has a novel in him! The story was sweet. Dialogue could be better, but let's face it ... the real star of the film is not Leo and Kate ... it was that the ship Gigantic! I think that all the actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet has done an excellent job. It's not shooting a better job (I've seen much better to work with both of them), but it was not the worst I've seen on screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
