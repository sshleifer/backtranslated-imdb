This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and loved it, but this film is applied to all the books glorified. Action is fantastic, especially from Jon Voight, who plays Mr. President, a very evil character. This film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout, until the end, where everything is pulled together for a great ending. I also love how it was sent, flashing back and forth between the modern and the stories of Stanley ancestors. The story was written Seyker, yes, but it seems to me that this story made for the film, and Andrew Davis does a great job directing it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves good films.
