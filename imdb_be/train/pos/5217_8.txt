I caught this movie on cable late at night and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine the reason for this film was not better known because the subject is very disturbing. But if you can handle the topic of sexual violence, it is well acted, and very disturbing interesting film. And Richard Gere and Danes are very good at it. And although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart, the film goes out of its way to be tough either (for example, 8 mm, for example). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a serial killer and the type of suspense films.
