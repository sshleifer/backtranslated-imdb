1958 did not see this film in a very long time, and was very fond of Kim Novak plays the role of Gil Holroyd, which is actually a witch, and her aunt is named Quinn Holroyd, who is also a witch and Gillian also have a brother sorcerer named Nick played by Jack Lemmon. If Gillian sets eye on Shep Henderson (James Stewart), who is engaged to the girl he was going to marry; Gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and change their minds about his prospective bride, and then it becomes very full of lust and falling in love with Jillian. The story says that a witch can not fall in love, blush or cry, and this is starting to prove a big problem between Gillian and Shep, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided that they should do something about this situation. Great film to watch again and again, and a great classic film in 1958.
