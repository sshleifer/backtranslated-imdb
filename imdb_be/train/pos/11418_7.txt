I first saw this film at the time of the course and the International Film. I am a "non-traditional" students, and perhaps for reasons of past years or wisdom accrued, appreciated slowly, reflecting Shagan narrative film. Languid with the heat and dust of the dry towers, deep psychological story has a lot of multi-layered symbolism and joint inversion of the theme is the "other" in the ground that no one understands. understanding that comes a lot of unresolved memory and subjectivity outsider. Made nearly 20 years ago, he is also a pioneer in the genre of many other international films exploring themes colonists colonized spaces, ignorant to the nuances of the culture in which they entered. Much more generous shot --- and largely financed --- work that had been done, because they reflect the same themes: Indochina, Nowhere two that compared in Africa may make Chocolat seems pale and sad . It has no action of adrenaline and extreme violence. Struggle is a mental, emotional and subtle. But as they say, it's a great film, worth watching.
