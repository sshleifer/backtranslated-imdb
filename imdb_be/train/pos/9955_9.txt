I am seen this movie twice in the local screening and really loved it. I work in the community Jane Finch and feel the film does capture some of the essence and flavor of the community - grit, determination, wealth, creativity, your faceness despair dose. Drawing up of the dialogue and the action is solid, and I found myself really drawn into the story of a young woman's paradise, as it has struggled to pursue their goals and not to lose ourselves in the process. Large sequences of dance and not just the body that move smoothly and with electricity, but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well. All the characters are entirely multi-dimensional - not entirely good or bad, and the women characters are perfectly strong. This film, which has a strong heartbeat and notes unbridled spirit of youth, hip-hop and communities like Jane Finch.
