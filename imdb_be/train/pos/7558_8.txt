This episode of the first season of a little edge toward the floor debate with all the bending angle.I imagine it would be a considerable amount of editing before it was done to appease the censor. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written and direction is complemented by excellent acting. (Nicholas Lea makes his debut in the X-Files, although not as Krycek agent, but as a victim called Michael) I especially enjoyed growing up and the very ending. <br /> <br /> it is different, but enjoyable.Ignore any bad reviews you can hear.Watch it for yourself and then make a guess
