I would first of all say that once I remember seeing this film in my early childhood, I could not read the subtitles, and I thought that Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really love this concept. If you are not able, at least partially suspend your adult skepticism and take your inner Seven your old one, you can avoid this movie. Nevertheless, just 137 minute version on DVD watched restored, I must say that I enjoyed it, although not as much as when I was seven (I remembered the end). <br /> <br /> There are aspects of the film that are worthy of criticism, the first 15 minutes and last 15 minutes, both have some really comic moments, my favorite to be the contrast between scenes played out in the last 10 minutes a curious choice of background music (listening to texts). <br /> <br /> For the militants have a lot of attention to the personal stories of some of the soldiers and the social dynamics of the team, as the stress of travel in time prevails. After the end of the movie, I thought it was a good thing, when I was seven, although the "relationship" guff was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For the militants have also many encouraging bloody action, especially some epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of warriors Shogun era. The filmmakers have achieved that so many deaths as possible in the bloody and lets face it, with a sense of humor. I thought it was a beautiful aspect of the film, when I was a kid, and I'm not ashamed to say that I still have. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that modern day soldiers generally don "t spend a movie going on eggshells, trying to avoid changes in the space-time continuum, they have heavy-caliber machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, tank and the helicopter, and they are obsessed with making their feudal Japan. What I'd like to think any avid user IMDb would have shoes. <br /> <br /> In short movies worth watching, it makes the viewer feel sorry that no more films made with a similar premise, and at the same time offers some hefty hints why the film as GI Samurai is so unique.
