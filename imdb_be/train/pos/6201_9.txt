Henry Fool Hal Hartley was a masterpiece of independent cinema and, of course, his best work. He has a great depth of character, delicate, complex dialogue, and great emotional ending that fascinates. I remember pausing several times during my first viewing, to absorb what I saw and feel. Henry Fool was full movie from beginning to end, and does not need in the future. <br /> <br /> So I was surprised when I heard about Fay Grim. Fay was not one of the main characters of the first film, and it seemed like there are concerns the introduction of real-world arrogance and ignorance of his brother, Simon, to be forced to deal with as it matures. In his own film, of Fay matures itself, although its persistence takes a very different way. Simon went from almost autistic isolation on just a few, introverted genius. Fay begins his journey as an adult, immature, quite normal, a spoiled child and a response by pressing ridiculous circumstances, becoming a mature, quite normal, an experienced adult who does not have any advantages. She has to deal with problems like anyone does, strongly, a little thought and weary contempt. While Simon has learned to control his mind, Fay learn to control his emotion. <br /> <br /> The film contains a number of elements fondly remembered his prequel, but differs significantly in tone for most of the film. Henry showed fool you sharp, boring, ignorant world, which contrasts with the inner passion and creativity of Simon. In Fay Grim, living world, crazy, emotional place, which shows the folly of her young life, and in contrast separates the inner wise woman who has not been previously developed or grown her as a weak mother. <br /> <br /> The film consists of two parts, the first dealing with the beginning of the fight Fei and subsequent solidification of the authoritarian hostility, and the second dealing with her fight to soften just enough to restore Henry. First, Henry Fool fans may be wondering how the film can even be considered a continuation of, and thinking that it is sacrilegious to stick with such an intense movie Spy Game tricks and physical comedy. But this is where the subtlety lies Fay Grim. Continuation of the trip Fey, and, as I have already said, it has to find a healthy life-giving in the chaos, not creative chaos in the degree of order. Posey beautiful actress who captures the language of Hal Hartley in cheek humor is wonderful. Elina Lovenson possibly outshines its emotional attachment to the role, allowing Parker to play as a straight man and the comic against lively scene as a comedy going on around her. <br /> <br /> With the arrival of Henry in the picture, the movie begins to take a sobering turn. Hal Hartley films all play, and every game is to come full circle. In the end, you have shown recently developed Fey character and integrity are the descendants of his time with intensive fatal Henry, whose piercing honesty and a unique passion ignites a spark in anyone he meets. <br /> <br /> Fay Grim is a great movie that does not exceed Henry Fool, but shows through Hela range that the nuances of his art are proof of his genius. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I think that anyone who has this film not only missed the point by a mile (and especially the subtlety in the actor Parker Posey), but it might not be very interested in the film Henry Fool .
