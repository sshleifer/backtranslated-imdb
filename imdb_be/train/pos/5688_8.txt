Opening credits: big. Music: just for this movie. Operator :. Launched to great effect <br /> <br /> The harrowing turmoil in train a sunken road. It's as may become out of control, some life. «Wonderland» reflects the wildness medication (and its consequences) not as a deviation from the norm, but it shows how this is really happening in our society. This is better than the image of the other group of wild -Manson's-, because all the movies Manson, book, etc. focus so much insane mind of Manson, not the total picture of cheap fame and chance, which is so common nowadays. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "method of action" for the film, watch Kilmer in the movie. It shows how the "method" can be riveting in the right role. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are successful in increasing the "out of control" to the level of an art form, not just for the sake of giving us a cheap thrill.
