This is a very rare film, and probably the least known of Shirley Temple, it is not, for whatever reason, it collections.The, for some reason, probably because it does not have a happy ending, unlike all her other films.Its is also not a musical, although she does strap with a song called "the world owes me living'.The film was made in 1934 and was originally in black and white, I have a version in color and on VHS, I would say that they We did a fine job as the color looks realistic, unlike I would say colourised films of Laurel and Hardy, who dreadful.The film is good for your age and history are not dated at all, I'm surprised that no one has tried to do remake.At time movie bit Talky as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard, seems to really have pulled out, in some scenes, they seem to take a fifteen minutes to say what they might say in five.Although entirely be afraid of, because this movie has some really good points in it, especially if {Jerry} Ga ry Cooper steals the necklace and hides him in suspense teddy bear.The Shirley and slowly build up to his actions, {while his daughter sings audience and in the other room} very well directed.Gary Caroles nervous and facial expressions when they are put under control and very good adjustability all this is a good movie from the beginning of the 30s, to take it for his age.
