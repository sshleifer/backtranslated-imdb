This unusual film that tricks you constantly. This seems to be moving towards a clich√© at several points, and then something amazing that will actually shudders. It would give too much to say much more, but stick to the film, and you will be richly rewarded. William Haines absolutely wonderful - he, of course, the star that deserves to be re-discovered. Gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford strange - there's even a scene where Haines chest rubs Pickford (in Pickford has a cold). Both actors play in this sub-text subtlely and with great depth of emotion, so that there are moments that are very touching. And I never thought that I could get so caught in a football match, like I did in this movie - and I do not even know the rules! Also a great son of Francis X. Bushman Ralph as Haynes competitor for the girls (yes, this is not a gay movie). Excellent silent classic - a fine example of twentieth-commercial cinema the edge.
