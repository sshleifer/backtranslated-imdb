So when musicals were not showcase for choreographers, we had a wonderful films such as this. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of how Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was glad to finally see this movie. Not really a mixture of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American vaudeville humor, farce Sun witty banter, a collision with a British sense of humor Wodehouse. But overall, the American style of banter makes American characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures. <br /> <br /> Some inventive performances for dance numbers, including an excellent platform with rotating floors and a curved mirror, more than make for the lack of Busby Berkeley dance number at the top. They seem much more realistic, if you could ever imagine, people start to sing and dance as realistic. <br /> <br /> Lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore not damage the film, instead they allow the different dynamics of the character to appear. It is also good to have a wise cracking, stubborn love interest. Instead we have a gentle persistent love interest, much more in line with the young aristocratic women Wodehouses.
