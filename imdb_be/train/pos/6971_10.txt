Of course, the average «Sci-Fi» Battle Star Gallactica fans will hate it. This kind of makes me happy. I do not love those cheese sci-fi shows, especially Battle-star Gallactica, and that's why I like this show. <br /> <br /> The show's creators have received a lot of heat for creating this (SCI -fi unconventional way) and it was worth it. I read on the wiki that they would like to appeal to everyone, including women and not just sci-fi nerds. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most promising show, as Lost. He is the most interesting, intelligent and deepest scenario any show at the time, and it's really unique. <br /> <br /> What I love most about the show is that it seems to be exhausted as a great anime! Of young teenagers running around shooting guns, and to a very well-balanced and complex scenario, the robot that reminds me of something that has come from Japan, except for a slightly better (most anime too confusing).
