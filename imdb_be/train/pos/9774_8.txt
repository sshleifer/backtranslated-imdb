This movie has its ups and downs, but I do good things in this film is very much outweighs the evil ... <br /> <br /> What's so good about the film does occasionally dialogue, sound, lighting (I'm the only one who noticed, both sets were lit was an amateur, and acting .... <br /> <br /> What are very good very original story, a very intense atmosphere, gore factor, which is very high, and the effects of which are made in the highest degree . <br /> <br /> So, definitely worth a look, or maybe even a must-see for all you horror and blood in ilnikav ....
