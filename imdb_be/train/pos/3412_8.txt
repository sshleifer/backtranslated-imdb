DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serres, a cruel story about the ill person. A doctor who treats a patient in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate for the non-existent. Nevertheless, he preys on the weakest among the population. Imagery and cinematography is fine, and give additional terrible feeling to this complex history. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, and calculating killer. The film certainly will not be soon forgotten by the audience. Prestigiousness g Serrault, for its cooling. image
