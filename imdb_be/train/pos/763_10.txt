This film has changed all that for me ... I heard the break and hip-hop, but never seen it done professionally (hey, I was a 11-year-old child from Holland!) When I saw the film, it all changed. I am actively involved in the hip hop movement in our city, and began to write lyrics break. <br /> <br /> To date, I still consider this film to be a personal favorite. Of course, filming and "cinematic" value may not be as significant. But who cares, when the wide-angle shot was taken bad, if you could see the microphone hanging over someone? This is what he does for you personally that matters ...
