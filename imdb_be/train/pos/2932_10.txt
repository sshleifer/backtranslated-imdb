I've seen my fair share of comedy and facing the films, but this one is so original, so fresh, it will make you wonder why you ever went right pass it to the video store. Murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes, but it's too funny to pass. If only one film can be this funny. it should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy" Murphy is a comic genius in this film and make you say, "this is the guy who made Dr. doulittle! Â»He talkes about ice cream man throwing shoe mother, his aunt with a mustache, racism, and everything you could think of, and those you can not. Please, if you ever see one comedy in your life it is, if all the films may be delirious.
