With critically injured Tony in a coma, two things happen: Tony is behaving lives seller treats business convention, while his family and friends are going through hell, trying to cope with the possible loss of a great man. Dream sequences are straight out of the old series Dark Zone, and Tony finds himself transformed into an average Joe trying to cope with the missing wallet and mixed up identically during a business trip over rough terrain. His intonation like blazer- and wearing khaki schnook more middle America and less Italian gangster with his Joisey. Pleasant to the touch. Shockingly long-haired, hippie nutty AJ (which Paulie calls a "Van Helsing" at one point) has a good scene with him comatose old. The best moment is big boys trying to talk about life without Tony, who immediately falls into a territorial dispute. Vito gets off the line a new dead Gene opportunity to visit the cabinet so that is interesting in light of what we are going to learn about the Vita.
