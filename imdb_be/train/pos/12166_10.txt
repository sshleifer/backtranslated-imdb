Very strange and compelling film. It is a very uncomfortable and tightly wound to the person who is trying to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraising / seller. The director was able to capture very unnerving tone that really served the story well. Original and alarming, and find a lot of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence at the test site, which really stood out and made me laugh out loud, that's not what I as often as I should. One of the most memorable films I've seen in a long time. I did not leave my mind, and I look forward to further efforts Bronstein. Fantastic performances all around. Simple line, "I really appreciate it." Now sign for me.
