This film was a great band adult actors with a cast of young actors who are going to be in the movie for a long time, if there is any justice. Directing and editing was great. I can look at the book, it is adapted, it must be great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson was a blast to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis did not see enough, but it was fun when they were on the screen. Children in the camp could not be better. (As I said, I liked it!)
