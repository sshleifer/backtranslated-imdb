good day. I just watched the film earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. I'm a history teacher who has wayyyyy too much time on my hands. I need a life. I found a film that contains a surprising similarity with Brokeback Mountain. I also found that I look a lot like Jean Lafitte, if he were white. Also, my favorite line in the whole movie was from Mr. drinking - "This kid can shoot the eye chipmunk from 300 yards away !!" Oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British come, and one drummer, who was so devoted to his work, and he drummed to death, as if the drum will put an end to war in general .... but it will not. Well that's all I wanted to say about this film. OH, one more rabid brown thing..bonnie physco bipolar mood swings BEEYOTCH. that's all.
