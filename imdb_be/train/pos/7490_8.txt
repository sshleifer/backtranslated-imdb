Until today, I had never seen this film. It was filmed on the set of The Old Dark House and Frankenstein and touches a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats suck the blood of people. <br /> <br /> To tell him a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and throw that will not go away, Etuill, Dwight Frye, Fay Wray, and Melvyn Douglas plays a character named Brettschnieder, which is of interest to me so that the mother's maiden name. <br /> <br /> My great grandmother a carefully modulated film that is unknown and witty one liners that slowly builds to its short running time, just wandering around, when about ten minutes before the end they realized that they had a limited time to wrap everything up. From that moment on its straight run to the finish with very little pleasure, which preceded the end. <br /> <br /> Maltin IMDb list and time of 71 minutes and shorter alert prints. The trouble is that IMDb, and Maltin could be wrong, and in this case I think they have been a source I trust more, says the full stroke is 67 minutes (Overlook Film Encyclopedia) quibble about this, I know that's crazy 'yatstva, but since most of the publications that are available tend to work about 60-63 minutes, the amount of the missing material is much less than if it is only 67 minutes long. Personally, I think it will not matter that much, since it is not more than five minutes, and I doubt very much that it will make or break a film. <br /> <br /> Whatever the work, if you like creaky old movies, do, by all means do, watch this movie, his large, dark and stormy night film.
