Firstly, if you want to look at it, be sure to watch UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that have been tampered with because of censorship), it is of great importance. This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who was 14 years of forced prostitution of her own father. When her father died suddenly, she is able to go out on their own. After reading about the philosophy of Nietzsche to life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants, and leaves them in ruins and desperate for love. Throughout the film it is becoming increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder she has any sense of morality left in general. In general, Baby Face is very shocking movie with blatant sexual content, that most people would not expect to see in black and white film. Although no sex acts are not explicitly specified on the screen, it is quite obvious what's going on outside the chamber. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching this film very much, and I believe most of today's viewers will get at least some pleasure when, especially from the shock value of the film. I think watching this, that the former seemed a little slow on the side, but I think that most of the films for the first time it is to see them. In fact, I think that almost all the films I've seen, made from the beginning of the 30s there were some minor problems or stimulate some parts just not quite right "flow". It was probably just the craft of filmmaking was not quite perfected yet ?? it would take only a few more years. Compare film since 1939 and compare it with the beginning of the 30's movie, and I think you'll see what I mean <br /> <br /> Once again, I am very happy that I was able to watch the original cut-out . it really makes a big difference. In addition, any fans of John Wayne will be surprised to see him in the film, before it was known in an unusual role.
