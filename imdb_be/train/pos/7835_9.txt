I saw this movie last night at a special theater with an indication in Nuremberg, and it was perfect. I have to admit that the original music composition cello and percussion / xylophone player affected the mood of the film, but the film also had the power in his portrayal of the tragic saga of the Nibelungs. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent films or Nibelungs, I highly recommend this film. The costumes were fantastic and creative sets were lush and exotic, and the effect was dramatic and spectacular (as is typical for the silent film "tragedy") Unfortunately, I have not seen the first part of the film of the duo, which deals with Siegfried. The history of the second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Scandinavian version of the story) begins to plan his revenge against his brothers <br /> <br /> Also, I watched this movie in German. I am a native English speaker and have a basic knowledge of the German language. It was hard to read? Subtitles (what do you call that a silent movie?) First, because of the old-style German script, so I suggest that if you look in German, you make sure that you can distinguish your "DK", " e "and« S », located in the old scenario. :)
