I rank this the best of Zorro chapterplays.The exciting musical score adds a punch in a spectacular display play.There great supporting cast and a mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter.Reed Hadley does an excellent job as Don Diego and his alter-ego Zorro. last, but certainly not least, it is a great directorial team and Whitney English.
