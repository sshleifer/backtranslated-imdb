Carter Wong plays a noble hero on a quest for healing book that leads him looking for the ultimate revenge! Walking is good in this movie and there's a lot of action scenes to keep the film going. Flying Guillotine look evil and villain has no problem using them. Although the story is not strong, the effect of fun and attracts you to the very end (which I felt I could have been continued). <br /> <br /> mannerisms and dark, that's fine Alla Skool kung fu !!
