Because musicals are both out of fashion and incredibly expensive to do everything without the talent necessary to make a contract to the studio, I doubt we'll ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything else was in place, it is no coincidence that no Hollywood studio entirely to the task of trying to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was Mario Lanza contract. No one could do it, I doubt whether he will ever be tried again. <br /> <br /> And what is. I think he Enrico Caruso would have been pleased how his singing draw on the screen. For his tenor was his life, his reason for being on earth. <br /> <br /> To say that freedom were taken from his life should be modest. Caruso, as a man who reflected it was a man of large appetites, but with much more self-discipline. He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two illegitimate sons, who are not in this movie. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought. He showed in the studio sometime in the end of his life. In fact, he began to write directly on the border of the last century and, together with the Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor did the recording industry that it has become. <br /> <br /> If Caruso and McCormack were at their height, you were practically inherited a ticket to see one of them play live. But many immigrants of Italian and Irish families had a gramophone and record three or any of these people. That's why both became legends, they are. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film does have some nicely staged opera arias made by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he could become if he had to stick to the discipline Caruso Opera. Large Caruso won an Oscar for sound and nominated for costumes and set design. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped popularize film with RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, we could not get the actual pronunciation of the album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotny, too. <br /> <br /> While Blythe sang in the film, Lanza was a big hit with record fine night, the further helps to promote The Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, it's not. If you are looking for a great artist singing at the peak of his career, what you should not miss the Great Caruso.
