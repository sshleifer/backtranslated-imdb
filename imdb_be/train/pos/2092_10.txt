I watched this film with some interest. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer earned her an Oscar. I walked away from the film thinking YES! Seeing Muni in only one film, where he was quite unnatural, I was expecting the same type of performance here. I happily refuted. While some may criticize him too childish and stereotypical ideas just in Hollywood Asians, I thought he was just as right. Keye Luke, when he was given the opportunity to play a leading role, may have played it in much the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed with the camera work and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the sacking of the palace, where on-Lan was once a slave. Graphic and gloomy atmosphere shooting and drought have made this epic completely unlike the other at the same time, when he was all sparkle and shine. I was watching this movie from beginning to end is captured. I can not say the same for "epic" now.
