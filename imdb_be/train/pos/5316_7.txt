This is the second film that I've seen I'm going Lupine as a director after the 53 th years of hitchhiking. I think that this one was the best movie that one. This is a girl who is going to get married, and then she was raped and does not like everyone is watching and talking about it so that it runs and and take the family. I think that the review Maltin is right to give him only 2 and 1/2 stars.
