Bacall's doing well here - especially considering that it was only her second film. This one is often overshadowed because falls between 2 great success: "To Have and Have Not" (1944) and "The Big SleepÂ» (1945), both of which paired her Humphrey Bogart. Of course this one is not up to par in other films, but I think that through no fault of her own. I think there was some miscasting how it reflects the British upper crust lady. No accent at all. I think all the strange accents were distracted - Boyer was not, of course, not Spaniards. It was hard to keep straight which country people were. <br /> <br /> I really liked the black-and-white cinematography. Humor is used a great influence, - I particularly liked the fog scene. Lighting is also doing a great job, adding to the intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is simply magnificent. Boyer just does not fit into the romantic lead role of man for me - so he and Bacall time was a bit strange. Not great chemistry - and certainly not retractable and Bacall magic. But I still really like this picture. There is a lot of stress, and it is moving quite well. I must say that I found the murder of the little girl's pretty bold for this period film. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre as the supporting cast are allocated. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely criminal and evil in her image. Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji goes after opening it as a child murderer is quite disturbing. Lorre is also doing very well in his slimy, snakes Conteras picture - a sloppy coward to the end. Bendrix Wanda also doing very well by drawing the child Else - especially considering that this is her first picture, and she was only 16 at the time (although it looks much younger). It turns out later she married Auie Murphy, who was short, stormy marriage.
