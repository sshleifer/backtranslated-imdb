I saw this movie in the theater, and was very impressed by it. Again, it was when Claire Danes was a good actress, but not stupid, arrogant Hollywood Re- bitch she is today. Anyway, this film really struck me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful friendship movie. How far do you really go for your best friend? I was moved to tears at the end of the day, and still tear up when I watch it now (I'm the owner). I remember, as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and sobbed her how much I loved her. This is a great movie to watch with your best friend. However, we are prepared for it almost certainly later, when she turns to you and asks if you want to do something like that for her ....
