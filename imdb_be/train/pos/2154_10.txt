I saw this film many, many times and I never get tired of it. This is a classic in every sense of the word. The film is hysterically funny, and yet quite touching all at the same time. For those of you who is a supporter of "subtitles" or foreign film in general, open your mind. This is a great film for the "novice", because the story is so interesting. Do not get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and this is what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it's just a big laugh in one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters, I've ever seen!) <br /> <br /> I can not even think about this film without a smile !! I love it ... and I think that most people are too.
