Nominal E (contains violence). <br /> <br /> I am the original Spiderman game for the PC for a few years now.I have not yet been broken, because in Windows XP, there is a glitch on one level, I can not beat due to it.So be prevented if you have XP.But for those who does not XP give this game try.Its clean fun family game with action and it is perfect for any spiderman fan.In spiderman games you play and you take different criminals who commit crimes.Spiderman fun game, and I recommend it to any fan or spider father wants to have fun, clean game for their children. <br /> <br /> 8/10
