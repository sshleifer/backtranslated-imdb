Rookie kept me smiling from start to finish. Dennis Quaid plays the role to perfection. The little boy who plays his son was fantastic. This father-son film to remember he did. Posts are good. Follow your dreams. Otherwise, in the pursuit of the procedure as long as you try. The excitement is palpable. I think that this film will be a classic.
