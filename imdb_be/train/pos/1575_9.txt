Van Trotta film Rosenstrasse best film I've seen in recent years. I'm really not interested in films with the historical past, but with this she won her interest so far !! <br /> <br /> only annoying thing about the movie was the scene in New York, and I was impressed with "trying to be as American as possible" ... I think that it is absolutely not. <br /> <br /> scenes back really hit my heart. German actress Riemann fully deserved her award. it is one of the most impressive actress I've ever seen. in the future I will see more of her films. a great success for me that I come from the German-speaking =), and only in the course of the year with us, so as soon as I got back, I'll buy some of Rome DVDs. <br /> <br /> it all out there who have not seen this movie yet: watch this !!! I think it would be too long to describe what it's still about, especially all the flashes and switches back again difficult to explain, but simply watcxh it, you'll spicy !!!!!!!
