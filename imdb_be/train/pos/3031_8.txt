It might be better if it was directed at someone with more experience. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it's not great work of cinematic art. <br /> <br /> It is, however, a beautiful film. I loved it, as local channels are used to show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the past century. Some pretty bad movies have been made of his novels and short stories. (Many people like «The Fallen Idol», but I'm not one of them. I think I've seen «Brighton Rock» once many years ago, and liked it, but maybe I just thought Romance). This superbly cast. Charles Boyer does not, it is true, as the Spanish came across. But he seems to have the perfect temperament of the character - a tired, cautious, careful. Lauren Bacall is attractive as a British girl who falls in love with him. But supporting players are the best: Katina Paxinou fine. Her performance slightly Grand Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we first met, when he gives a lesson Boyer Esperanto as a universal language, perfectly. - as always <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart. She comes across as a precocious early adolescent. The character wants to be helpful. She does her best. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film highly. Not without reservations. A clause in the first place, it's a little phlegmatic. But the story and the action can hardly be improved.
