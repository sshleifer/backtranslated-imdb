Excellent little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis .... As for the people ripping the pillows and the aura of lurking fear. Also, unfortunately, the end that comes out of nowhere, because, apparently, the filmmaker has lost interest in the movie, or perhaps because, as the picture B it must fit into the slot.
