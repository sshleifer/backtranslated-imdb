There are a number of things that are not right, but it is not so important as what happened to whom and when is still in dispute. The most blatant freedom of the facts, I think, when they start to play Kaiserkeller Bruno Koschmidder in the year, when in fact they played in Indra and later moved to Kaiserkeller. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20, the film was biased in favor of the version of Pete Best, but if it is a story consultant, I believe, what he calls the shots. I also agree with Semprinni, that records Pete Best played on the last word on the subject of why he was fired. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is not as lavish as the later production of the film «Backbeat», I like this film because it is more accurate, because it is the best script with deeper characteristic <br /> <br /> There are many in the film, which is very significant. - such as Brian Epstein is trying to hide the fact that he was "eccentric-beat", only to find out that the group knew that he was gay all along. Little touches like the group meets in a café and order "cornflakes mints milking." My favorite scene that has some bassis in fact, where the audition Sutcliffe just bought a bass, but can not play, so he stands with his back to the manager and trying to pretend, but comes across. It's rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> Well worth watching.
