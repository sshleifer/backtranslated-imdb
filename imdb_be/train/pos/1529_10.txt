Diagnosis Murder is one of the few programs I regularly watch on TV at the moment. The way all the main characters have to do something in every episode makes it so, in contrast to today's show, where they focus on 1 or 2 people per episode and the rest pushed aside. The brain works as the lead brand so vague that you never know what he thinks, and if you think you do, you are wrong. <br /> <br /> Diagnosis Murder solved diverse range of issues, not only in the cases, but in each of the characters in his personal life. Everything from racism and adoption, terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> As for the fact that for the elderly? I'm 24 !! I do not think I can be classified as old again. <br /> <br /> I just want to know if they will release all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC), so I can watch them all in order. They seem to be doing it with a lot of other programs of the same ages, so they can hurry it up a bit!
