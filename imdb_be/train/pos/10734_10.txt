WOW! <br /> <br /> This film is the best living testimony, I think what happened on 9-11-01 in New York, compared with this for anything the mainstream media. <br /> <br /> Those outputs can only show you what happened on the street. This film shows what happened on the INSIDE. <br /> <br /> It starts with a focus on the debut New York fireman, waiting for several weeks for the first big fire, he will be called upon to fight. Subject abruptly turns to the only existing footage first plane on HIT towers. Then you were given a front row seat as firefighters rush to the scene in the lobby of Tower One. <br /> <br /> In the minutes preceding the crash of the second plane, and a further decline in Tower Two, you see the firefighters who respond to the alarming sound of people landing above the lobby. It is a sight not soon forget. <br /> <br /> heart-rending, tear-jerking, and very convincing from the first minute to the last, "9/11" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentaries ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
