"It's all up to you, Ed?" "Now you can play this game." The next day, my father left his mother, he took me to see this movie with my new girlfriend, on the opening day in the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood . I was only fourteen years old. I was not even entirely sure what I saw, but I will never forget, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> Looking at it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me thrills. <br /> <br /> My father was a huge Burt Reynolds fan, thus the reason for almost an hour to stand in line to see what was to be a "fighter." I saw two films on the dome to the "Grand Prix" and "Song of Norway." Well, it's not exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shell-shocked. <br /> <br /> But even at such a tender age, I appreciated the artistry ... and after looking again today, I'm surprised that I was still standing after a witness to this highly disturbing, but very well crafted film . <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that it was a traumatic experience for fourteen years, even kiss your first girlfriend. I do not blame my father to take me, but it was a little more for a child to witness. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing, but I am still very impressed with the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds as an absolute miracle, like all principles ... Billy Reddny how inbred guitar surprise, Ronnie Cox as scared of insurance agents ... everyone is doing an excellent job. The sound quality is second to none, from the chirping of birds ticking clock. In photography, cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this remarkable film is the first course. <br /> <br /> Moral of the issues raised, from murder to sexual assailant consequences of the struggle with the murder of a person, we remain deeply today as they did when this novel the film was released. A classic sequence trying to survive in the wilderness after the deal with the unexpected cruelty are life-changing. These four men, urban people are suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined, to raise the bar on action to horror. <br /> <br /> This is the classic, to be sure. And the phrase "you have a pretty mouth" has been quoted endlessly, with Saturday Night Live, to an untrained comments around the water-cooler at work, this film is without a doubt, a large part of our society of pop culture ... as well as "make my day "or" I'll be back "I never was. <br /> <br /> So what do you do if you found your friend sexually assaulted at gun mountaineers are far from the steering wheel of your life in the city, a comfortable bed, a wife and children? And if you have taken action, Burt Reynolds did (and I would have done the same thing), you have to bury the body under the soon-to-be-lake, or to appear in court and take your chances? The bottom line: Getting delivers. You can take that to the bank. If this film does not get under your skin, then you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you've seen it before, take it back and ask yourself the question above. <br /> <br /> my favorite part of the film remains the same: Ed unable to kill a deer ... something changes. Life is unpredictable and this fact can change a person. And I think that's what this film is all about Jon Voight, in particular, as Ed, gives you better performance here. And it remains one of the most talented actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to a very underrated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt's Pearl Harbor, its action raises the film to another level. Climbing the rocks at dusk, embarrassed and decided to do it properly it must be seen to be believed. I guarantee your heart rate will be elevated to a new level. <br /> <br /> brisk pace, tense, taut and tightly drawn as a string, banjo, this morality play that asks questions that remain today. Times change, but our choice, as human beings do not have. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
