I have to see the movie "On Thin Ice" on television in India .. I have to say that the movie was really well done, and really ran a chill on the back .. basic story makes me wonder what makes some users decide to move on, where, others are still dependent ... <br /> <br /> However, I felt that Diane Keaton was at its best ... the scene where she has a craving, and starts rummaging through her house for cocaine .. . was the best ... the two boys are good, and Linda Boyd also revealed that she is a good actress .... script well sp Blenheim as the cinematography and direction and casting .. <br /> <br /> must watch movie for all .....
