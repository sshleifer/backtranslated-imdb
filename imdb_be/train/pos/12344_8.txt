Sea Watch was made from an original script by Akira Kurosawa, and it's really juicy and warm film. Watching it will be nice! <br /> <br /> Kei godfather, as a director, of course, is not old, but eternal master (especially mass scenes early in the film some hardcore action), but the general mood and the scenery is very pleasant. Another thing that is missing here :. Kurosawa has always managed to characters so much more than what they actually show and do <br /> <br /> It is possible that his magic on the set during filming; and just maybe, this scenario was not all the way to a couple more. <br /> <br /> Maybe we just skip the eye masters. <br /> <br /> This is one beautiful and sweet film, but this is not Kurosawa. To wait for what may well be a very foolish ...
