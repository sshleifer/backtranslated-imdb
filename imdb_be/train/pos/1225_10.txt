Does anyone know where I can get a copy of this movie? !! I was looking for ways for too long, someone help! Back in 1997, my girlfriend and I were more in this film based on Long Island, and we never actually see it. :( <br /> <br /> I was hoping that I could find a copy of something like that I can finally check it out and share it with the girls! There's someone out there who knows where you can get a copy of this so I can stop driving yourself crazy? (besides, it does not matter if it is in the VHS format, I'm still in the ice itself.) If you or someone you know, a copy of this film, please help, I would be willing to pay for a good copy of it!
