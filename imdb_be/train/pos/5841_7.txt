The history of peace-loving farmers and townspeople, who are fighting for land, water, law and order, as well as the respect and the final conquest of the long-rooted animal interests and their mercenaries have been designed better in the earlier (Shane) and probably later films as well. There are some good scenes and the overall plan of the story, eliminating frustrating end, well satisfied. Law and order and religion have established roots in the city, but the old order of drive cattle, cowboys and Gunslingers still around as well. The clash takes place in two well-placed ambush scene where city dwellers go straight into the trap. Granger, a former shooter, plays the guy who avoided the townspeople themselves, who need his expertise with a gun.
