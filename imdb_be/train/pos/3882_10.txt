I watched the tape, rewind it immediately watched it again and laugh twice as hard. I highly recommend this tape for those who hated to, but uncomfortable transvestites. This shows that transvestism is a feature, not all of its creatures. Comedy is not a question. This man is brilliant. All the comics should seek a level of candor, intelligence and talent.
