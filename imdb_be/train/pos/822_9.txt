The last film of the saga of Lucas is a lavish, spectacular views of the product. It is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it's a step up from episode IV (and only a notch below the episodes III and V). In fact, I think this is the third best film in 6 parts of the saga. As I understand it, it's still an interesting film pompous. This is not a movie with a beginning, culmination and ending; The mechanism of the film is only one goal in his mind: to bring to the closing of the Lucas universe. There is air Finally attached to all this that makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. In addition, it is very fun. New characters are introduced and old face new and unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual), a large comic. Leia and Solo is the perfect romantic duet, and Luke has a lot of character to identify. Again, this is (Vader) Luke internal conflict, giving the saga of its foundation. Lucas aggressive representation is still very obvious, and the film's theme of loyalty, hope and redemption strongly resonate. I am glad that Lucas finally gave up the idea to do an episode VII, VIII and IX, to that because this film is a great bookend to a long, exciting and entertaining saga. Nha perfect film, but in the best of fun matinee style.
