Professor Janos Movement (Boris Karloff) finds Radium X - a powerful force that will be used for atomic energy. Unfortunately, the movement was contaminated with radium and glows in the dark - and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felix Bennett (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote - but the movement starts to go crazy because of the radium and antidotes, and sets out to kill everyone he felt wronged him <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid and. "The effects" that make Karloff glow in the dark are ridiculous, but it's still a fun chiller. It moves fast, has some great atmosphere (note the "house" movement and the film begins on a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. There is also a good effect on Franic Drake (as wife ANR) and Violet Kemble Cooper (his mother). So it's fine, but only a step lower than all other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is too far-fetched for me to swallow. However, I did so. I give it a 7.
