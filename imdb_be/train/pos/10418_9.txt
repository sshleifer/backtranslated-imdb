The history boy The Thief of Bagdad (as it was once written) attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, which starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering "The Thief of Bagdad" is less than the larger, more recent attempts. The best, however, is the 1940 version, which at the time was a strange, fascinating arsenal of high-quality special effects. These effects are still working their charm. <br /> <br /> At least six directors listed for technicolor film, which starred Saba as a boy thief, Abu, John Justin as dreamily in love deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as a beautiful princess asks Ahmad and pursued evil Vizier, Jafar, played by Conrad Veidt ominous. A giant genie skillfully acted Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad Jafar treacherously overthrown, and if later arrested this treacherous serpent, he and the boy, Abu, suffer that fate is clearly incapacitating. Ahmad Abu is blind and becomes a nice dog. Their adventures through the brightly decorated Hollywood backlots fun, but the special effects make this film work. <br /> <br /> The two men were responsible for everything from magic flying carpet to a giant genie who comes out of the bottle with a tornado-like vortex of black: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, by the way, did the special effects for the film version in 1961. The two men had a long and distinguished career in the field of technical wizardry.) <br /> <br /> Duprez is extremely cute, there is little called suras' oznae action. Ahmad Justin driven projects, but the dreamy romanticism untouched erotic impulses. Sab really central actor in many scenes, and he is very good. For the film, designed for children and adults, there is a fair amount of violence, but a bloodless kind. However, I do not think that someone under eight must see "The Thief of Bagdad". <br /> <br /> This film makes periodic appearances on television, but today my teenage son, and I saw it in the theater with very few young people present. It was great to see the computer drugged child-friendly society in answer to the cheers and applause of the special effects that must seem primitive to them. <br /> <br /> «The Thief of Bagdad" is the pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when a strong production values ​​often result in stable attractive and important release. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
