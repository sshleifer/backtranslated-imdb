Julia Ross (Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary to a wealthy family of Hughes, to get over her boyfriend left her. Almost immediately, she drugs and was sent to the family estate in Cornwall. When she wakes up, they keep telling her that she was Marion Hughes was mentally ill and to keep her locked up ... but why? You probably guessed why, but would not mind, because it is a pleasure. <br /> <br /> Along with "narrow facet" and the "face behind the mask" is one of the best B pictures taken ever. (B pictures are low-budget pictures made fast with low budget and without any major stars). It is as long as it is needed (only 65 minutes), well-directed, fast paced and exciting. He stumbles only at the end, which I found a little too far-fetched to buy. <br /> <br /> Foch (good actress) just OK in the lead, but Dame May Witty large and George Macready excellent (and scary) as the villains. Well worth catching. A great example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget.
