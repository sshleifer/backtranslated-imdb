Chuck Jones «Hare air conditioning" is a fast paced, often hilarious cartoon. Spot Bugs Bunny against surprising, yellow-skinned manager store apartments, which wants to be stuffed, "Hare-conditioned" to make full use of its multi-purpose installation. The chase takes Bugs and his pursuer by a variety of agencies, which leads to inspired gag, in which they quickly get out of different parts to wear any clothing associated with that part of the store. This is a great gag fabricated, however, a truly inspired sequence involving lifts in which the bug disguised as a lifter, tricks Store Manager inexorably getting on or off the elevators at the time. This brilliant climactic part of a kit, which, unfortunately, is not very funny inferior final gag. By that time, however, "Hara conditions" made his mark as one of the greatest movie car chases, invading with wild abandon. As Bugs becomes more refined in some other cartoons of this period, «Hare conditioned" showed that he can still be as attractive as the more anarchic character.
