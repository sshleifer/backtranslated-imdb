If there is one genre that I've never been a fan of this biopic. Always misleading, full of false information, dramatize the scene, and deceit all around, biopics almost never done right. Even in the hands of really talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on the screen. Skeptiscism ranks deception most biographical films that make their way to the big screen and Notorious Bettie Page is no different. Some critics and viewers objected Gretchen Mol, given the role of Betty Page, not to mention that it is no longer a celebrity and was not a chop to pieces. I never doubted, Mol can handle portion, since, but I never expected the wind as far from its fulfillment, as I was watching the movie only hours ago. Mol provides Knockout Oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950 charming girl who, after being in the early life of abuse (painted subtlety and tastefully done something few directors probably do) unwittingly becomes one of the most talked about models of all time , The picture covers a lot of ground in his 90 minutes of operating time even in spite of not less than three story, there is a feeling that there may be a small part missing from the history. Director / co-author of Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner fantastic scenario marred only too harsh and not as clear as it should be the crown. However, we must pay tribute to the two ladies to create almost perfect biopic, which manages to pay tribute to both its subject and decades it emulates a virtuoso. Come Oscar time, Mol, Harron and Turner should receive nominations. Doubt it will happen, but certainly not three women more worthy of them. 9/10
