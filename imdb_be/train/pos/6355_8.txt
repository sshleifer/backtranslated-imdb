I've loved, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," when it was released, and I still love it now, after 5 years. Nevertheless, many people do not seem to agree with my opinion, and this film never received a lot of love in the time it came out. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film and over-the-top mannerisms, but that she, too, is the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All the sets, costumes and characters are made great by-the-top in a fun way, never gets really makes fun. It is visually exciting movie to watch. This campy film-making at its best! Director Ron Howard really surprised with this merry little Christmas movies. <br /> <br /> The main reason why the film works and why it is so fun to watch Jim Carrey as the Grinch. It really carries the film with its good and fun role. He certainly helped convincing make-up, which also won an Academy Award. Of course, if you are Jim Carrey hater you should not even think about watching this movie. This film is really his film, and he makes it all work so much fun to watch. Other funny and memorable role played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The film has good morale, but it's a little juicy me. Maybe it's because I am Dutch, and we do not celebrate Christmas, that with enthusiasm and high here as in the United States or England. For me, the film was just fun and interesting, and the fighting spirit just left me pretty cold, to be honest. <br /> <br /> Score James Horner good and fun, even if it's your average everyday Horner material, it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to do some work. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas scene of entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
