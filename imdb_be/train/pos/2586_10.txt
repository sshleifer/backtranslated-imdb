The characters were lively and interesting, the plot was going fine, pyro effects were skillfully made, and it takes the basic story of a love triangle, and throwing in a science fiction element to it. I could identify with many of the characters and their motivations have made a logical rational sense in the framework of history. <br /> <br /> camcorder work was great, the sound is clear and precise, well-selected background music for effect, fire singing good talented memorable quirks sets brilliantly handled, and the special effects are made with the experienced talent. <br /> <br /> I am a bit puzzled as a whole mini-carnival in the parking lot a lot of chain store can be powered from a wall outlet lamppost. It seems impossible, to say the least. The fight between the two brothers closer to the end of the film was brilliant, though. With Jim Varney in the non-clown role was an excellent touch as well as the role played poluseroznuyu Carny very well.
