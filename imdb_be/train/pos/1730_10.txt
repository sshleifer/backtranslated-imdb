This quiet unsung gem tells the true story of the escape of prisoners of war during the Second World War. Performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. Dialogue and brilliant ring very accurately. In fact, an unusual all-around puts the authenticity of this one head and shoulders above most of the war epic.
