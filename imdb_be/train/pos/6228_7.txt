Another fun, witty, frothy musical with RKO Astaire and Rogers, following the Navy is a charming film. Although it lacks the great tunes released SWNG TIME (though finite number of "face the music and dance" is one of the best teams and rightfully so), it is very nice, as these two may not actually do anything wrong with the 1930s. Once again, the plot is easy and forgettable, but watching Fred and Ginger dancing together existing sky. These two are transported more romance and magic in the dance than many couples in the film makes an enormous love scene. While there is a better Fred and Ginger musicals, this is certainly a must-see.
