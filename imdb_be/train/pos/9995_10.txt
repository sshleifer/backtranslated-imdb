This kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine on the fire, with his feet up. It does not require much brain power to adhere to, so it is very good after a long day. I would say that this is very unrealistic - if you expect something serious, then do not worry, but it's very funny. Just the idea that the businessman will go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while, and then actually have fun ... I would definitely recommend it.
