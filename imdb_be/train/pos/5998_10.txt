The Cure strange film ... So suspenseful just so REAL! I was lucky enough to catch the show «The Cure» in New York, it is the prime minister, and it is completely blew me away! I also heard that he had received an award from this particular festival, and it is certainly deserved. The first thing that struck me was the cinema. Eric Zhiavon did an amazing job. shooting style halfway love scene in the movie was amazing. Love scene was necessary in this film, and Jafri got the point across, but also save the scene nicely. Giovon Jafri and make an excellent creative team, and they definitely need to work together on future projects. Narration Judy Mayer was so surreal, but at the same time heartbreaking, it made me feel what I felt the protagonist. I am a very tough critic, but I must say, The Cure is one of my favorite films..JUST LOVE IT! If you have not seen yet, check it out!
