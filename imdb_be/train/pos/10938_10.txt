Rarely have I ever come across a film so full that I have to talk about it right away. This movie is definitely one of the best entertainment available and very specifically. I happened to see the dubbed version, but I'm on my way right now to grab the DVD re-release of the original Chinese dialogue. However, overwriting will not interfere with, and sometimes provided some seriously funny humor: "Poison Clan rocking the world !!!Â» <br /> <br /> the story remains true to the Chinese methods of intrigue, suspense and interpersonal relationships. We can expect twists and turns as the identity of 5 of poisons found and expert pace. <br /> <br /> martial arts fight choreography in its class, and must be seen to be believed. It's like watching real animals are fighting with each other, but interpreted from their secret forms of martial arts. This level of skill among the cast is unsurpassed in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> The combination provides a significant dose of old Chinese culture, and I would recommend it only on the basis of a genuine intention of the film to tell the story of martial arts and craftsmanship. ... Of course, if you just want to see people showered each other with crude forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
