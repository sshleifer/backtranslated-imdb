Before I see on this film, I see a lot of comments that everyone has a wonderful view of the film is good or bad ... <br /> <br /> What I really want to point out, it acts on the name of Woody Harrelson he can not be in many parts of the film, but if he is, or even the intro, I was amazed, Will Smith and Woody Harrelson, "message", they tried to create and maybe slip the entire area up to the end does not understand what's going on . <br /> <br /> I'm not very sentimental person, I believe that a good deal should not be remorse or pity behind it. But the act to show redemption, there is not a lot of films that can in my view to show it. This is one of them, he can. <br /> <br /> I agree with one person who commented about this film is shown acts of "suicide" is a fall, but I do not think this is a "message" movie trying to send, but the "victim". A bit to the extreme, but it's a message, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This film has potential. Act it is worth every penny, the script is incredible. from a person who does not like to watch movies drama ... If you like drama this should go look.
