I watched the movie in the preview, and I really loved it. The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious. Another highlight of the film, of course, the music, which I hope will be released in the near future. I recommend it to anyone who loves British humor, and especially for all musicians. Come and see. That's fine.
