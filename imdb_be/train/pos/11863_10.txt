Perhaps this may be the best film ever made, and if it is not, of course, one of those who burned to your students as the fact that Brian De Palma provides here a large piece of cinematic art. Firstly there is the director-touch Brian De Palma, who once again it can be one of the best directors ever shows have an excellent performance by Al Pacino, who delivers the immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana), there are many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (one of the saw, the one in which Tony is sitting in the bathtub, which is as big as the living rooms of most people), there are many excellent one-liners (count how many times the word "f * ck "are used), there are wonderful little details (Pan American is the ball that screams "your world") or large discomusic by Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be said to be that it is not the sublime here, and it can easily be found with "The Godfather", "good guys" and the "white hot", one of the best gangstermovies ever!
