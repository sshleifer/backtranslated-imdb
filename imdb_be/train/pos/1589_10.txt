I love this show. I watch all the replays of every day, although I have seen all of them, like 6 times each. <br /> <br /> This is about two sisters Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), living in New York. Holly goes to live with the shaft, when their father was transferred to Japan. Val has a perfect life, she has a boyfriend and perfect apartment in the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The exhibition mainly shows all problems and Vall Hall pass. the main problem is the guys, but also about responsibility and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly 16 in total while the free spirit Val complete opposite. It is organized must have a plan to do something like a person. <br /> <br /> The other characters Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
