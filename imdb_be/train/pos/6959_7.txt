Well, it's a film, Ivan Reitman. With rare exceptions, Ivan likes to have fun. His films are usually not "deep", but they are often quite entertaining. My Super Ex-Girlfriend I was surprised that I laughed more than I thought I would. Uma Thurman just grand, and I love her paintings. I like Luke Wilson as well, and Raine Wilson was right tone. Do not take yourself seriously, the film is over the top and not very unique, and not to go where no one has trod .... this is a good hire, though, probably, the OK movie date, especially if you have a headache and do not want to strain your brain. This escapist fun, and there's nothing wrong. If you erase the "super girl" things, you stay with a story about the relationship, and the relationship soured. It's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. And in the end, the characters looking for love. Not all of them take to be "dumped" as well as they could .... a piece of life with a twist.
