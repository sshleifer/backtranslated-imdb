Yes, it's a low budget. Yes, this is one of the earliest films kendo, but it may have its funny! John Candy is not so far away from their SCTV days in the "Warriors", and it shows. If you do not crack when Candy is trying to help the boy with his groceries, being handcuffed fugitive cohort during sex with his girlfriend door only apartments, separating them (huh?, Watch the movie!), Or the path Euguene Levy (creator of Kong Fu Yu) He is talking to his mother on the phone, or just countless facial expressions that only Candy could give you better check your pulse! If you like John Candy with «Only The Lonely» it may not be a movie that I would advise you to look at, but if you enjoy SCTV days John Candy, this film is a must see!
