I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever, as if not the best of the three Lion King movie! In the film, Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they came from, and having a fitting problem with the use of others, such as Timon problem arose with another dig tunnels Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa's journey away in search of a place of dreams and find him, and soon he and Simba that they raise, but they will soon have to choose between their place of dreams or help Simba face his evil uncle Scar and declare his rights as the Lion King Rock of honor! Filled with great new characters, as Ma Timon (in Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max, because he was very funney and was voiced by comedian Jerry Stiller funney father of Ben Stiller. Disney was smart enough to throw Stiller in this role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, and music history and Lion King 1 1/2, in my opinion, the best of any sequel better than the Pride Simba, although I admit that I really like that one too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a big Disney sequel whole family can enjoy! He has a good history and very funney! 10 out of 10!
