This is in my top list of favorite movies! This is a fantastic and insightful film. It was historically interesting and fun to watch! I thought that the actions of Emily Blunt was fantastic, and Rupert Friend Albert was fantastic, the best actor was elected Albert. The costumes were great, and the settings and scenes, such as the Opera House, were strange and detailed. I just loved it, all of it! I loved the childhood scene was she goes "mocks" John Conroy. And where her mother says that she has to go up the stairs with an adult. Once the authors have done it! They have created this fantastic script! <br /> <br /> He thoroughly deserves the awards that they have received. (Oscar and BAFTA Extreme Sandy Powell, costume design. And the BAFTA for best makeup and hair, Oscar to the best achievement in art direction, best achievement in costume, Best Achievement in makeup.
