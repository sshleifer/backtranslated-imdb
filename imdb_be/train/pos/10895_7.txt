Surviving Christmas surprisingly funny movie, especially given the bad publicity when it was first released. Ben Affleck's funny how disgusting millionaire who pays a family occupying his childhood home to his family for Christmas. It manages mind pampering family for Christmas cheer. I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (although I like Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he is well cast in the role. I would also like Christina Applegate, as the daughter of a family that can not stand Affleck's character in the first. Of course, you can see where the film will be, but you do not care. Do not pay attention to what the critics say, and to make this film because it's funnier than many Christmas movies.
