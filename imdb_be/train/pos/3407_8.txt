Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer gives a solid performance in this beautiful but empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Really great cinematography and sets, and a bottomless trunk and clothes Dietrich also fabulous. It looks great; Boyer looks young and trim. <br /> <br /> The history of women are looking for meaning and ex-priest seeks life seems rather callous, but is opposed to such unrealistic sets and the sky somehow works, given two stars, great Max Steiner score, and a good supporting cast. The film works as 76 minutes, and seems to be poorly edited, plus some characters simply are or disappear. <br /> <br /> Shildkraet funny how the Arab leadership, Aubrey Smith, the old priest, Lucile Watson abbess Tilly Losch dancer forecaster John Carradine, and Basil Rathbone played .... well, I'm not sure. He just goes out of the wilderness and ruins everything! As already mentioned, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich. I can not help but think that he would be fine. Boris sated role would suit a large Gilbert quite well. And after the success of Queen Christina (from Garbo), his career might have received in the right direction. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any other 30s Dietrich film made in color. It looks great and has some amazing things. My favorite Valentine as The Shiek-like outfit she is wearing by the pool. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is necessary to look at the beautiful scenery and the colors and the two biggest stars.
