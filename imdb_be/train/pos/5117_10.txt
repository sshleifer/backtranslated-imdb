Very few films have had an impact on American culture, like Urban Cowboy has. Thank God, it was temporary. But UC is almost in a class by itself, as one of those clicks, that if you are flipping channels at 3:00 am you just can not take your eyes off .... has the best three animals at home and stepping BTW, but it is next to point. I remember Urban Cowboy hit the theaters and Overnite honkytonks were open on every corner, people were sporting cowboy hats are fine loafers, and if you do not know how you two steps were considered a social moron! Personally, I think this is a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on the heels SatNiteFever. Who would drive ,. He's actually believable too. The soundtrack is awesome. Too bad Charlene Tilton of Dallas fame ruined TV career Jonny Lee reason that the guy was just stunning. The show stealer is Scott Glenn as a greaser former prisoner redneck cowboy. And I is not got nothing against ex-Greaser cowboys fraudsters floor it was just me, but I always envied that I feel that the greatest strength of the line all the time .... "Pack-on S * # t!" It seems like Clint "make my day." And watching him slap around Sissi closest I'll take care of my imagination since Julia Roberts ..... like I said, beautiful. 9/10
