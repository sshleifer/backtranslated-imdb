I saw this movie on cable, it was really funny, the main stereotype of police stereotype big bad guys, Jay Leno and Mr. mayagi with Karate Kid star in this comedy about a good prototype of the car. I compare this film Â«RUSH HOUR", in which the local police should partner with Asian police officer to resolve the case. The chase through the farmer's market in downtown Detroit brings back memories. Nice soundtrack, a good script, I give it a 10/10.
