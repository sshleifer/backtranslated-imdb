Great fun for adults and children, this film works on many levels: Everything from car accidents and cake in the face of some very good (but subtle) jokes for adults <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is. its lofty evil best as Cruella ( `call me Ella ') De Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years in the clinic of Dr. Pavlov Behavior modification is cured of her desire fur ?? even fur leather puppy she so much desired. It even has all of their fur coats, which are in an extraordinary castle dungeon she inhabits. <br /> <br /> But it would not be the video ?? Dalmatian "without equivocation and fraud Cruella, and you know that something has to change its behavior modification. And now she needs an extra pups (hence the 102 Dalmatians), to complete its nefarious scheme at this time. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd instantly appealing as a hero of the film, which starts `Second Chance» dog shelter. Although he was in 'Titanic' and in the TV version of last year (as Pip) with `Great Expectations I did not recognize him; Well, it was ?? Fifth Officer Lowe «in` Titanic" and I do not videl` Great expectations, so I was not very surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a fine turn as a furrier foot of Cruella. He poses the rack and in the most unusual and challenging fur clothes you've never seen ?? and it does it well. His "Wicked Witch of the West" honors cheerful. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny beautiful is not so evil henchman Cruella in ?? He was also ?? Alonzo, "the butler in Cruella, in` 101 Dalmatians, and you may also recognize him from usih` Black Adder» Brit-Coms. He plays his usual clumsy, kind, somewhat closer in nature to great effect. <br /> <br /> Oscar for the costumes, as a rule, are given for the totality of the costumes in the film. This is unfortunate, as the clothes worn by Glenn Close enough ?? This incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is released from the clinic behavior modification) and are worth more than-the-top character. Her clothes one deserves at least a nomination for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The animation has a special place in my heart ?? but comparing this film with the original animated film, like comparing apples to orangutans: this can not be done. Suffice it to say that the '102 Dalmatians, even better than the version filma` 101 Dalmatians, published in 1996. There is a lot to like here: from gags, dialogue and costumes for the cast - it is a good movie for the whole family.
