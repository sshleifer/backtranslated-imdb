This film is very funny and touching story of the children's home, which is in dire financial straits. If the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to step temporarily to conduct business. <br /> <br /> This is positively the best job that Leslie Nielsen had ever done. His idea in the movie to rent children immediately innovative, and its sales methods will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl is so sweet and cute in this movie, I know that I will never forget it, just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the film! <br /> <br /> This large family entertainment so rare these days. If you go a little saccharine images with a happy ending, go for it! I could watch it over and over again, and I often do! My only complaint about this film is that it's so hard to find a copy.
