it can not be peace and war, but the two NOMS Academy would not be laid if not genius, James Wong Howe ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that I 've fallen in love with a child and returned so without complaint. if you have any interest in the fact that it offers a fictitious or not, BB & C is a visual feast. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that this is his best work, I'm not an expert there for sure. but the look of this film is amazing. I love everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, cat, crazy hoo-d, retro-ness Center; but the way it was put on the film is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I even inconsistency noted on this page above, and "special effects", which seem to be so at present. all this creates a truly consistent world.
