In the early 1970s, many of us who took acid / hippy / alternative culture from the heart, he realized that the parent company does not change the way we thought it would be. For me, this film is defined voltage "Now what?" What a lot of people I knew felt at the time. Are we heading in the commune and to create our own vision of utopia, or we radicalization and bring about change? <br /> <br /> With useless gestures to the police, the radical rhetoric, music Pink Floyd, to love -Making and explosive image in the desert - so much there. It captures well a significant point in time.
