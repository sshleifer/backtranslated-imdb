This film was perfect. He was full of memorable images, good acting and touching subject. It would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental, but this feeling, this type of film is trying to achieve. I was fully involved in the story unfolding and presentation. There were a few bad shots, but the same can be expected in the religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can conjure there was not a ton of details. However, this film was not designed to explain every element of Joseph Smith's life, ministry, is happy contradictions, failures, etc.; it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights one of the most amazing and historical American religious leaders of all time.
