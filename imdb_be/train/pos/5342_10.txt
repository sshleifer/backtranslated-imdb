I was deeply moved by this film in many ways. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most valuable thing! Such a beautiful girl. Her acting was excellent as well. The truth of life and very human. Although I do not like the part where she was supposed to smoke; I hope it was just a fake Propyl. In any case, it was absolutely wonderful, and the story was very touching. I found myself immersed in the history and its character. <br /> <br /> It's quite interesting how I came to discover this film really is. I walked in the blockbuster, and I just happened to notice her pretty smiles on the cover, as I walked past. Fortunately, I looked in the downward direction, that this movie was! I thought to myself, "awe to look at it! So I picked it up and saw that this film has been described as such wonderful things as« A Little Gem ". I read the story on the back, and then thought, well, maybe I would see him at IMDb first, then go back and take it at a later time. I'm glad I did, because I, of course, would be missed. After searching for a movie with my friend, I I knew that I end up regretting not rent this film, so I went back to the spot where I originally found it and snapped it. <br /> <br /> It was been on my dresser for a week since school began for me this week, and I really had no time to watch it, but today was a great opportunity. I jumped him and was glued to beautiful cinematography, great accounts and to move a site from start to finish. I was so captivated and I must say that some of the nearly touched me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would like to highlight for the little boy in this film, Juan José Ballesta. He was excellent. In addition, the actor who played the father of Carol, whose name, unfortunately, is not listed on the website. His voice was so loving and gentle that I could really feel his love for Carol. Despite the fact that its appearance is not visible, I really felt his presence the character. <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. If you are a person who is moved by the action of light, but the emotional movies, then this is definitely the one for you.
