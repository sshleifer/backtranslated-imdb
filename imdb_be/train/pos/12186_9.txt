This is not so great, the film is considered by many people (including my late aunt, who said it was her favorite movie). But because of the best parts of the film noir, in particular, that the rightfully famous "fun house" finale, The Lady from Shanghai won the position values ​​from the real value is as a key to the saga of failure Orson Welles punish Hollywood. <br /> <br /> By 1946, Wells' position as a figure of Hollywood mixed. Citizen Kane was not recognized as a great film since it has been observed, both because of the way he was attacked in the press Hirst and Hollywood insiders themselves. Trying to Wells in total control (direction and production and actions) with his films seemed to threaten the entire system. His best work during this period, as Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre, allegedly shot by Robert Stevenson, but in fact shot largely (with the blessing of Stevenson) from Wells. But the credit went to Stevenson. Only a stranger, the film benefits from the post-war interest in the refugees of Nazi war criminals have profited. For five years in Hollywood is just a great record. <br /> <br /> Wells returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to recover their critical faculties of its production all over the world in 80 days. But despite the help of Mike Todd, and Cole Porter, it forms the value musical was a flop. His accident occurred at precisely the same time that his wife, Rita Hayworth was on the rise with her image GILDA. . Thus, the marriage takes place on the rocks, as well as <br /> <br /> Wells had to earn money - its Broadway production led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his share of the possible movie rights to the worldwide Todd (which he eventually RUE), and he sold the idea of ​​a film about Landry's career to Charlie Chaplin, which was to be sent to it (and who turned him in Monsieur Verdoux) . <br /> <br /> The story goes that Wells, the tax bill of $ 10,000.00 to worry about being called Cohn and offered to make a film with Rita for a down payment. Cohn was willing to do it, but, of course, I said that the film was. It was a wise question. Wells was a phone booth in New York at the pharmacy, which was the book department. He grabbed a book called The Lady from Shanghai, and raved that it was a great thriller. Once convinced Wells usually insightful Con that Wells knew he says. Cohn said he would look at getting the rights and Wells sent him an advance payment in the amount of $ 10,000.00. After Cohn hung up Wells bought the book and read it - and found it was really very bad. He spent his time rewriting the script and treatment, which will increase the character of Rita Elsa Bannister. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is an interesting story. Michael O'Hara sailor / Loader. He saves Elsa Bannister, when it seems to attack the bandits in the park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) crippled criminal attorney with a good reputation. She convinces him to hire Michael as skipper of their yacht. Cruise also contains sinister partner George Bannister Grisby (Glenn Anders) and one Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia), which happens to be a detective hired to watch Elsa Bannister. . If they are Michael and Elsa try to find time together, but Broome or Grisby continues to appear <br /> <br /> Grisby Michael makes an offer - he wants (for reasons related to its so-called fatalistic vision of modern society) to get out of it, pretending to be dead. According Grisby (story here becomes turbid), it can still collect his life insurance (although the dead?) And use it to run the South Seas. He will pay $ 10,000.00 to Michael if he would pretend to shoot Grisby. This includes actually signed a document admitting to murder (Michael does not understand that this recognition will wipe the need to produce the corpse, when all other data indicate that Grisby, probably dead). <br /> <br /> With the course Grisby killed, and Michael was arrested for murder and Broome (removed from Michael's gun). Michael Bannister tried to protect him, and discovers that he is making a second rate job, because he wants Michael to be convicted. Michael is convinced that Bannister is the actual killer, and can be avoided only to the jury's verdict. He stamped and deposited in a deserted carnival, and this leads to the known sequence of "fun house" and the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> This is terribly confusing movie (as I have already said) This does not mean that we should not see - it's visually striking. Witness the battle between Michael and the police in the room the judge to the jury, where he knocks usher in a bookcase judges, broken glass. Or a reasonable use of photography to capture Hayworth to dive off a cliff, affects lewd binoculars Grisby in. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, particularly Sloane (perhaps the best role fine actor in the film). Glenn Anders was the lead performer Broadway. He seldom films to The Lady from Shanghai, and his slimy Grisby unforgettable. Ted De Corsia also doing very well with Broome -. Detective who really seeking their own interests, its own funds <br /> <br /> As for Hayworth, she turns into a spectacle that was unlike most, it has been done before (Blood and Sand, tales Manhattan and strawberry BLOND exceptions), and is a memorable siren. Wells O'Hara is very unusual for a character actor - nice but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe that he secretly wants to believe. It is not KANE, AMBERSOMS, Othello, Touch of Evil, or CALLS TO MIDNIGHT is, but it's a good movie for all of this.
