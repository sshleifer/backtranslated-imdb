He ran from 1959-1973. He was more than a long life, which is saying a lot for this series. It is also that it has survived the changes in fashion and taste of the 50s, the psychedelic '60s and is still popular in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I remember repeating this series. This is a good combination of all the elements of the story, the actors and the performances that made him exceptional. Lorne Greene was his defining iconic character of the series. His appeal was intergenerational. All members of the family can enjoy it. It is a balanced moral violence, humor with seriousness. cartoon series was made as a result of this in his action. The shame is that the series does not repeat, and many of them will not know its value.
