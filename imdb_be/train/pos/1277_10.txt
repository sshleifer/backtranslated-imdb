I think this film is one of the best things about Mike Hammer, in compliance with Biff Elliot final Mike Hammer. Scenario Harry Essex beautiful and contains many improvements on the novel by Spillane in. Its direction is strong and imaginative, and he makes excellent use of light and shadow. The camera work is top-notch, John Alton, as the score of Franz Waxman. The cast includes many experienced players as well as Peggy Castle in his memorable work as Charlotte Manning. In general, this is one of the best private eye films ever made. Biff Elliot and Haary Essex had to get more opportunities. I have always valued this film.
