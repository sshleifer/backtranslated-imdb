I watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning, when I was asleep. This in itself is an indication that the film Deliverance was spelling cover. I think that Bormann did an excellent job in directing this film. How artfully has been done at the beginning of the scene with the mountain folk and dueling banjos. He showed so well, and in the early stages, as inherently protected and simply people the area were. Case in point - near the end of "duel" bungee games boy smiling (loved the banjo), but if Drew tried to shake hands with the boy after the "duel", the child was too reticent to answer. River trip will never leave you bored, for sure. Rape scene was brutal, but it is necessary to show that the group was against this wilderness region of Georgia. I think after a traumatic shock Beatty was well done. Some say that he was very much dependent on the ordeal. I disagree - if you really paid attention, that he is not responsible for all actions immediately following, in which Reynolds put an arrow through the attacker and they expelled the toothless guy. This is confusing, when Ed killed the other guy later, on a cliff top. It almost seemed that the arrow was shot while Ed curled and waiting to die, but then realizes he shot the arrow before finally come into force. <br /> <br /> In any case, a great movie, and I was wavering between 8 and 9 in my voice, but after reading the posts from angry voters, who gave him a "1", I gave him a "10". The reasoning of this individual seemed to be based on personal preferences rather than from an objective point of view, and his voice was clearly non-correlation of attempts to downgrade.
