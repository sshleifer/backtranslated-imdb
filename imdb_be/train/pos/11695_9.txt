This is such a great film! Nha given the low rating here. I really have no idea where that came from, they should discuss other film then. Because I absolutely loved it and found it to be a bit of a hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> This story was so original and charming .. I really can not think of anything bad to say about it. Maybe it should be "," type of thing, "" but I've seen it with my sister and my mother, and we all have made. <br /> <br /> The action was also very good, and it is difficult to make a film like this. But I found all the characters are very intriguing and helpful. <br /> <br /> I have always loved to Dougray Scott, and found that his new 'dark' 'role is very interesting. It's really awfully hard to get me as a bad guy, but I absolutely had no problems with it at this time. Especially, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama, which also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this movie, no question about that! Anyone who wants to see the film with 80% of bloodshed, have to go rent something else though .. But I believe that the name is sort of gives that away. This is a story of love, did not drink 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of five stars !!! Good job !!! <br /> <br /> xxx Enjoy!
