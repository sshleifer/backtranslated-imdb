Thanks to Kevin Smith, a bunch of scum running around saying that the return of the Jedi is not suitable, because it is really fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets involved! This makes it bad! Mark did not like Return of the Jedi, until someone in the film Kevin Smith made a negative comment about it. Now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease that you mention it, as you like. This film is so much better than anything Kevin Smith never even considered that the creation of frightened my mind that people even think about his denunciation. This movie is a lot of fun! It's as strange as I can remember a time when I was six! Enjoy this film for what it is, and stop stealing opinions Kevin Smith! It's not right! <br /> <br /> And it's Ewok song in the end led! I bet you people even do not use Â«EWOKS: The Battle for Endor" !!!! I'm going to set you all on fire!
