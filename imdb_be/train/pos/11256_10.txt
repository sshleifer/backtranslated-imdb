Without a doubt, the best of the novels of John Le Carré, elegantly transformed into a classic film. Performances Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rüdiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus Czech Controller Intelligence), Ray McAnally (Magnus cheater's father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, the teacher Magnus, the believer and the British regulator) , together with the other characters, so perfect, and of course, the person in charge of casting should have been given the award. Even small details such as the Major Membury, performed to perfection. He talks a lot about the strength of the performances, and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one can not help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than Jack Brotherhood and slimy Grant Lederer US intelligence, I read the book again at least a dozen, and watched the movie almost as many times, and still fascinated by both. If I had one book to take to a desert island, A Perfect Spy is choice above all others.
