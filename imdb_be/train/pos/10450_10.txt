It was by chance that I was scanning the TV channels and found this wonderful film about two wonderful people who are attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgins, as an approach to one another. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" 01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV Series (Nicole). It Goals and the guy will warm your very heart and soul and make you think, deep in your past relationship and you really want to you to follow your heart strings with a guy or galami you are deeply loved and lost track of over the years. Jesse and Celine there is a lot of talk, and deep eye contact with large magnetic explosions between the two of them. I look forward to a sequel to this film in 2004, and if you've seen this film, you will feel the same way.
