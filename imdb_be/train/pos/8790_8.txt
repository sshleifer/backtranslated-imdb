Hilarious film. I saw this film in 2002, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival, and laughed from beginning to end. Action was thin, but very funny. I'm not sure, "real world" impact, we do not get that here, but the film holds no understanding of the show. Heather B steals every scene she's in, especially if they operate with its rare talkative red roles. Highly recommended. I would like to see this released on video / DVD for some time in the future.
