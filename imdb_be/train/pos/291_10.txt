Zombie Chronicles is not something to shout about, it's not winning film, but it's entertaining B-movie directed by Brad Sykes, who led the Blood Camp, which was another entertaining low-budget film. Acts badly, as most cheaply made movies, but that's what makes it more interesting, zombie makeup cool and are particularly effective with the budget, gore is also a large and complete, the movie sort of version Zombie Kazak out of the basement, so we get two stories about zombies meeting in the forest, fun stories and make leave you guessing, especially in the first story. Zombie Chronicles is much better than some of the films low budget zombie out there, if you like low budget B-movies or cheap to make a zombie ~ d then click to check the zombie ~ d Chronicle.
