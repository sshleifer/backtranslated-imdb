This is a great drama, and a nice change of pace from today's more caring and high-profile films. This is another solid-based-on-a-true store that still means that a lot of this could be done for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I do not know, but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story about a young man, still in the fifties, which gets interested in rocket and wants to enter into this field instead of working in the mines as well as all the others, including his father, making this city in West Virginia. The big problem is the conflict it causes between a boy and his father, who I think was exaggerated. I would like to have a little less tension between them. <br /> <br /> The young man, a boy, played by Jake Zhillenhol, one of his first tasks staring, I think. He's cute, like his school buddies here. It's nice to see the beautiful children in modern cinema. Two other key actors in the film are Chris Cooper (dad) and Laura Dern (toddler teacher who constantly encourages him.) <br /> <br /> Cinematography decent soundtrack 1950s interesting to hear. Once again I would like to see more of this kind, made films today.
