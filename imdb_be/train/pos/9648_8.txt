I liked this movie a lot. Story bounces back and forth, very little, and not so easy to follow. There is no resolution of the story at all, and you are left wondering what really happened. Since I love this kind of movie that I enjoyed it. I especially like the "acquaintance" scene between the boys and I were involved in their lives. And, of course, any film with bare Staphane Rideau get a couple of extra points. ;-)
