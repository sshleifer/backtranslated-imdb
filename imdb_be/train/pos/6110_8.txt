As «My Sassy Girl», the film is based on a true story, posted on the Internet, but this is where the similarity ends. History, as a rule, this rebellious boy named Ji-hoon (Kwon Sang Woo), who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hired a tutor named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from a poor but is the same age as he. Add to that some of the obstacles, martial arts (the bandits always after Ji-Hoon revenge), despised, gangster love a girl who, after him, his penchant for lessons ditches, and you all can guess the whole story. I have already said that this is a romantic comedy? This movie has some good action scenes, great visual humor and a lot of sperm, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, who bring a lot of energy to the story. Romantic elements also work for this reason. And I must say that I want a girlfriend Kim Ha Nuel, than this girl with «My Sassy Girl» (personality-wise, at least). She has some audacity, but it's more on the cute, sweet, good-hearted way. Symbols have mostly cute (so you could say that it was less a hill to climb than «My Sassy Girl» - an obstacle that has worked for this film to his credit), and the film is quite clever and interesting most of the way, the history of the distortions, though, about 2/3 of the way (which is walking through the familiar, standard rate, which is actually nothing happens interesting), but towards the end, he again raises slightly. In general, fun, cute movie. 8/10
