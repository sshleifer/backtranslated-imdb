There are no posts. A lot of symbolism. No dark undercurrents.Just beautiful melange of music, nostalgia and good fun to put Gether people who, obviously, had a great time doing it. It is a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage at the mill of the studios. Of course nothing incomparable Judi Dench worth watching. And the brilliant jazz singing Cleo Laine is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as late as Ella. It goes to my movie shelf to pull out again at any time I feel the need to experience the warm and rich in good-natured laugh. Just a great movie!
