I have long been waiting for this movie since I saw the trailer, which made him look like a political drama starring three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And even if it was directed by Harold Becker, who made a rough job, he and Pacino made to combine the sea of ​​love, which is among the best of each of their works. But intervention on some level (to begin with, a few scenes in the original trailer Sun appear in the film) and the change in tone (these trailers make it look like a thriller) do it, while watchable, nowhere near as it could have been . <br /> <br /> which is very bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was a lot of potential here to be a film about how the government can still be useful, despite the corruption and make difficult the statement that corruption, rather than the usual good guys against the bad guys. And a good effect here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances of his career. But Fonda is lost in her role, having nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central storyline, when he turns into a thriller, the film loses its way in a short time restores in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls down completely, eventually. I wanted to like this more, but no.
