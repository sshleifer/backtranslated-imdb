The film was shown at a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this movie, I did not think about this wonderful series. I believe that it was surprisingly good early 40's horror flick, with very strange good sound and image for 67-year-old public domain horror movie. I really enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his strange staff, including his wife, which requires fluid from the glands of young prospective brides, old witch and her two strange sons, one giant idiot, another funny dwarf (Angelo Rossitto with one thousand nine hundred thirty-two for freaks). I also enjoyed the bold young woman reporter who is some kind of stereotype, but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent film this story, even funny and incredibly for the film. I do not want to spoil any of the film, so go out and rent it out, or, better yet, buy it for a couple of bucks.
