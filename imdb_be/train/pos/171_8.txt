I totally disagree with those who would dismiss this movie as a "just" entertainment. Set immediately after the reckless, roaring 20s, in the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance in his heart collateral cautionary tale, with a clear message about how best to get through these difficult times. But it is fast-paced and tightly plotted film is far from dreary morality tale. <br /> <br /> In the 30s, Hollywood was churning out talent and a captivating * * instructive audience pleaser after another, all without spending a frame of film. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of the four films *, Harry Beaumont, directed in 1931 - nearly 80 minutes long, but his characters are well developed, his story never seems rushed, and, despite the many twists in the plot, the audience is never left behind. <br /> <br /> with the sole exception of Lester Vail as the love interest sluggish Bob Townsend, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. Noteworthy are William Bakewell brother Crawford, Cliff Edwards (best known as the voice of Zhimini Cricket) as a reporter Bert Scranton, and Clark Gable in the early supporting role of a gangster Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> But this is a film by Joan Crawford, and she absolutely shines in it. Made when she was only 27, it is less known version Crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with its future work. However, here is proof that long before she took home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, an amazing actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by myself. <br /> <br /> Rating: eight out of ten
