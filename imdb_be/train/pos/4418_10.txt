I saw it at the festival Hawaii Film, where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q & A afterwards. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe that this is the first time the director and all the kudos for Harvey Keitel once again ventured in and out on a limb for the script, which he liked. <br /> <br /> Of course, reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, he tells the story of a young director at the turn of the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect this will be a film about the revolution, it is a political position wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the directors obvious love for film history (most "Bicycle Thief" tribute ") and some bizarre scenes that work with our be pretentious. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
