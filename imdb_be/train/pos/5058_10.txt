There should be more movies about our Native Americans. Especially it seems to me that using actual real Native Americans, it would be correct. I know it's Archie Belaney, who played Pierce Brosnan he has done an excellent job of portraying that character, because he was an Englishman. But my suggestion to Hollywood to put more American Indians in the role, and never use anyone else. Sioux Nation was put on the back burner for too long. Their poverty is a disgrace to our country. It is my firm belief that our country must return the Black Hills to the Sioux. We ask Israel to return the land to the Arabs, but we make no effort to do the same thing, that we should be ashamed of yourself. We must practice what we preach!
