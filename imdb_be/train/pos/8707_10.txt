"Swordsman" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I have ever seen. The film's title may be translated into English as "Swordsman." The protagonist (Sasha) was born with a special talent: he can protect himself with an extremely sharp sword that comes out from under the skin in the arm. On the first side, he may seem like another silly superhero of mindless film about unreal events and feelings. But this is not about Swordsman. He can hardly be called an anti-hero. I think he's just a man who lost his claim in his life and faith in goodness, justice and love. In his life he had never met anyone who could understand and love it (except for the mother). His every move is stained with blood; He takes revenge on all of his gift, which was anathema to him. And then he meets her. It does not need explanations and misinterpretations. She loves him for what he is. She did not care what he did. The fact that he is close to her is much more important than anything else. But soon she discovers his secret: he killed two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her on her eyes. Even after she could not avoid her feelings. They try to run, but it's a deer to hide. Finally, they have a serious car accident. He is in a cell; she is in a mental hospital. They know nothing about each other, but she believed that he would save her. He is crowned with a lot of obstacles, but finally finds her. They flee again, but they are not invincible. She was wounded, she needs a rest, but the police almost catch them. He does not know what to do, they are driven into a corner, and then begins his sword to cut down trees, the helicopter around them, but there is no need, because it is already dead in his hands, and he is a lonely man in the world again.
