Can such ambient production failed its main objective, which was to properly adapt the novel Allende? Obviously, yes. Bille August turned make superficial shallow film where the main elements of the South American psychoactive represented simply as side effects, resulting in a total of inconsistency. I can not believe that the whole crew, who could not understand the book! There is, of course, the technical quality of the film, and I think that the actors have done all that they had in their hands, but something is missing. And this is something very important.
