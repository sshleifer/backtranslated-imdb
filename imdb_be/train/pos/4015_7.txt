One of the most satisfying Western all'Italiana, Johnny Yuma has the freshness of many WAI did during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or unusual, intelligent cinema. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is, in many respects, not very original, but it is not really considered against him. movie's success depends on how well it meets the expectations of the audience, and also provides a bizarre variation of the expected elements. Previously pleasant experiences restored, but with a thin (or main) swirls that provide continuing interest. Workmanship is also obviously important. Tired of the new tire will be less successful than a genuine attempt to entertain and move the audience. <br /> <br /> Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma successfully. There are numerous reprises elements from previous films. Installing a hard, semi-feudal twilight twisted world, shared many of the best "gothic families" westerns made 1964-1968, such as Tempo di massacre (1966). The site is a combination of basic Fistful of Dollars (1964) and the story of Ringo movies, is not really surprising as screenwriter Fendiando Di Leo was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best writers in the popular movie out of Cinecitta in 1960, the year 70s, and his work helped to provide many thematic continuity and coherence to the genre (along with several other individuals in several different circles of actors, directors, and writers). The plot ZPP, the protagonist arrives in town, heats the tense situation, and then subjected to a death followed by resurrection (in some movies as Quella sporca Storia NEL West (1968), he quite literally crucified). Catholic tone to the narrative and symbolism is intriguing, especially considering the implicit populist / socialist leanings are obvious filmmakers and their films. Ringo story developed more fully screenwriter Ernest Gastaldi in a series of films starring Giuliano Gemma, selfish hero chooses the public interest above its own through the relationship with a member of the community (with a healthy feature of ironic ambiguity). <br /> <br /> relations between Carradine and Johnny obviously based on the fact that Manco / Mortimer from a handful of dollars (1965). The two exchange arms belts scene provides a reasonable dialogue and understanding between them. Many films, including Da Uomo in Uomo (1968) or El Chuncho, Qui√©n SABE? (1967), use this link between the older and younger man (father / son, elder / younger brother, Anglo advisor / competition and peasant revolution) as a center speaker in the story. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is the focus on deception and disorientation, labyrinths and mirrors, which are repeated for the best early WAI. Canons and Pueblo Almera become literally mazes through which the protagonist and the antagonist of the game by sliding game cat and mouse. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI is a director Romolo Guerriri use of visual / psychological space with an agreement with intelligent script mechanisms to direct the plot. The dialogue has never been very important for the WAI and often absurd illegible (I think there are exceptions, such as the cynical comments in the Django (1966) or Faccia /> The psychological depth of character is created Faccia (1967). <br /> <br almost entirely through sign system, this comparison, and a description of the general situation of the narrative. look at how the presence of the death of Samantha felt during the stage of grinding ?? look from the roof, or on the background of the action. or as Johnny bands Samantha and Pedro them security and confidence in their own power through their secret the invasion of their ranches, hotels, even sleeping (This, again, is a theme with STD). And finally, notice how there is an emphasis on the search for information. How many elements, it borrowed from the RFP, which was ultimately based on a hard-boiled mystery Red Harvest novel. it is through casual contact, like posters, snatches of conversation, looking from the windows, the clock on the left in DUS tonnes or mistaken identity and movement through the ripples created by the actions of Peter and Samantha in the surreal and the absurd reality, narrative Nails forward to this conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film was recorded in this time for what were perceived as excesses in the family. Of course, these movies were a little tougher than many American westerns. What was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which he was assigned, which is to say that it is not violence, but this is what changed. Johnny Yuma different and interesting in its use and portrayal of violence, and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What I personally find most interesting about most of this genre link it provides an anonymous, anonymous audience in Italy and Spain, to which these recurrent narrative held some value and interest. The artifact may not have intrinsic value in and of itself ?? Some silicon debitage from prehistoric site, the fragment jug ceramics, rot or rust and the skin piece metal ?? but a reference to some nameless presence, life, which were significant, simply because they exist. While Johnny Yuma has an intrinsic value, much of it should be of interest to me in this regard, and mystery. <br /> <br /> The best spaghetti westerns list http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Middle EA http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> For fanatics only (the lower part of the trunk) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849890
