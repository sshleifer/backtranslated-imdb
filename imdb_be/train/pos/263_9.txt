It was a strong Poirot / Suchet, select the television mystery. Symbols were bright and well acted. The plot and the main system - student hostel-- were excellent. Zhepp was nothing special, but it does not distract from the story for me. One important point is not recognized by many observers Poirot good action or a good reference. I also think that they are quite harsh in their judgments some Poirot mysteries. Finally, I read several novels Christie - one recent years-- and it's annoying that many viewers are upset about the changes from the novel. Please, the audience, consider what is presented to you on film, rather than what you think you should be there. Nevertheless, Poirot mystery vary in quality, but not as much as reviewers and evaluators would have you believe. With the special exception of the Five Little Pigs, which was incredible in the plot, character and theme, the longer movies Poirot is neither a good or a bad thing. For the record, I've seen all the movies longer Poirot / Suchet. Finally, the films without lemon, Hastings, and / or Zheppa are neither good nor bad because of their absence. There presence, however, either intrusive (almost always with Zheppoy) or do not have a relationship with Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
