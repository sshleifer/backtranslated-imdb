«Someones at the door." OHHH, How I miss this show so bad .. but we are fortunate to now the "Invasion". Thank you, Sean Cassidy. American Gothic, all.If if I had to choose one thing I liked best about the show, it should be his "not predictable storylines." My favorite actor Lucas Black .. I love that Southern accent. I bought the DVD as soon as possible, and my children fans. There are several hot steam claim scene. Some of them Devilish too. Thus, if the kiddos will look, you can edit (FastForward / skip). It has humor, the Jos Wheedon level that lacks so much of the show. Adult wit and adult situations, which are treated with finese. The DVD has some additional, but I want it a lot more. If you want to get excited and enjoy a great show, come see «American Gothic»!
