stone comedy. Many laugh out loud moments, shop and pub scene had me belly- laugh uncontrollably. Symbols are known and there is a good dialogue - I know people like that! Humor surprisingly gentle and film (it may seem strange) puts me in mind of Ealing comedies. It is a quaint little movie with a lot of details. This, of course, takes a lot of views. I watched it a few times (I showed all my friends!) And look for something new each time - a bit of dialogue, something visual that I took earlier. I could get really picky and find a couple of flaws in the film, but I'm not going to, because in general it is a lot of fun, feel good film that is really worth seeing, and some with a sense of humor, must have. This is a movie that will find his friend, and I hope there is a lot of them there. Oh .... and it has a wonderful soundtrack.
