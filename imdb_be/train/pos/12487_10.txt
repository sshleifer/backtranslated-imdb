Dark Remains a home run simply and clearly. The film is full of terrible visuals and panic that would make the most seasoned horror veteran to jump straight from there place. Staircase scene in particular, these guys are good. Despite the fact that they were not working on a huge budget, everything looks good, and the actors come later. Dark Remains is one of these interpret endings that may be negative for some, but I believe that it makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson spot on as the couple is trying to restore the sad lives there, but some of the side characters, the sheriff did not convince me. They are not all that important anyway. Dark Remains give a perfect ten rating for the fact that even more terrible than any recent studio Ghost Story / Japanese remake.
