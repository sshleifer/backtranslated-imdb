There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies could act, given ownership; she is beautiful in comedic roles. William Haines could act, and you can see why it was one of the most popular leading men of the screen. (As long as the potential scandal did not make it out of business). <br /> <br /> The history of a little corny, but treated so beautiful that you do not notice. King Vidor direction is one of the main reasons for this. Producer? Boy genius Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> It's about making the film, and you can see the process, as was done in 1928, cameras, sets, actors and directors direction emoting. You can see the (briefly) some of the top stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin makes a turn, like ourselves, seeking an autograph. You will also catch glimpses of Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor, and many others who otherwise just names and old photos. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you're not a fan of Silents, take the time to catch the movie, if you can. It's really an amazing journey back in time.
