I first saw this film at the Berlin Film Festival, and I have never seen Hong Kong movies. I felt like sitting in a roller coaster: the action was so fast, and not one sad moment throughout the film. It has martial arts, love, special effects and fantastic story. My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinking, singing and fight for themselves - one of the many scenes that highlight unusual musical side of the film. This film is a definite must !!
