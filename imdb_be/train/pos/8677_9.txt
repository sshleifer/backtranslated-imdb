This film seems to be well remembered as the time Tom and Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things idyllic for a time, but, as expected, it turns sour. Probably the most memorable moment was an endless battle with the pipe, a frying pan and a baseball bat, that two plus Butch dog engaged at the beginning and end of a short. I enjoyed one pile, and you should try to catch it on Cartoon Network.
