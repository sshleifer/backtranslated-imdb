Initially, I caught it in 1996 in his one-week run at the movie theater. I was under the impression from him, and my feelings have not changed much. <br /> <br /> A documentary on the notorious Edward D. Wood Jr. covers his life and cinema. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. They include: Vampires, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interview mixed with clips from movies or some amazing recreation. This is interesting (several), but whether it was really necessary? I have seen all the films of Wood's, and they are terrible. Wood ambition, but little talent to carry them out. I would not say that it was the worst director ever, but it's there. Do we really need to dock at a very mediocre film-maker? I really like the fact that they did not try to make wood to be somehow sacred. More than a few of the respondents (especially Lugosi Jr.) pretty much hated this man, and it comes through loud and clear. In addition, they completely ignore their films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. Nevertheless, it is interesting, if you're a fan of Wood. Most of the interviews appear vampires (who vomits individually Wood) and Dolores Fuller (a long time friend).
