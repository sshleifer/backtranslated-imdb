Another detailed work on this subject, Dr. Dwivedi takes us back to the previous distributed Punjab. Dr. Dwivedi has chosen a difficult subject for his debut film. He has worked on all the meticulous detail to bring the story to life. The treatment of the subject is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that we were not in the region during this time, the scenery and the costumes look real. Unlike most of the films made in the section, this one focuses entirely on the gory details of violence, in order to attract the audience, but also on its implications. Characters come to life. Prayyanshu Chatterji has produced impressive results. Manoj Bazhpai made his heart shows the plight of guilt-ridden man. The rest of the cast did a good job too.
