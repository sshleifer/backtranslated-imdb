Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 film Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, much more human and emotional release. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egotist, who takes other people's emotions as a matter of course, and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, the best, and in many ways, only one of David. Penelope Cruz playing Sofia Serrano, the girlfriend of Brian, who had accompanied him to the party on the occasion of the birth of David. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, sometimes David bed buddy. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, psychologist David interviewing. All of their interaction and the impact of them, make Vanilla Sky is one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made. I will not explain more than a plot, because it is much more convincing than the less you know. Ignore all the people who call this film too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be embarrassed. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best films ever made.
