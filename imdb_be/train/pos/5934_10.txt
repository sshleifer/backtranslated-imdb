Sorry to say that I have no idea what makes Hollywood. Of course, give us films like Batman begins. Oh, by the way of Hollywood, I think they can cover a story in a movie about Batman, but please do not entertain us, what we really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting more. I looked around to see where he went. It was like a horrible joke. Graphics, which is a good storyline seemed solid and he had all the attributes of a great movie. Unfortunately, this does not happen now. For producers, directors and actors all, great job, but I hate you for what is to me. You left me wanting more.
