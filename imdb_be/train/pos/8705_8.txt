Despite the name, Swordsman, and DVD covers (action / herioc poses Swordsman), it's not a super hero movie. <br /> <br /> (minor spoilers) It follows the story of Sasha, The Sword Bearer, who cursed having pushed his sword arm. Cool you say, but no, this is real life. If you had this power, as a child can you control it, if, say, in front of a crazy person, or when the guy your mother beats her. And if you do not control it, how do you deal with being a two-time killer at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> In fact, where Sasha, when we meet him. Wandering aimlessly after a murder (as well as Bout de Souffle). Then he will meet with Kate and the pair fall in love immediately, providing Alexander with the real reason to live and try to change his ways. However, his past is still chasing him, in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> That is in fact the story, and there is little or no action on the screen, even though many, when offered. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike the movie "super hero" of many of Hollywood, we get very little back story, no bad guy (not counting himself Swordsman) abuts has a lot of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> worth checking out if you can find it.
