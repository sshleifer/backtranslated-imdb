How nice to have a movie the whole family can watch together. Josie Bisset and Rob Estes (who married in real life) play a couple to get married in Las Vegas on a whim, and then not only to break the news to your children, but then try to combine their respective households (each of them has two boys and two girls) into a whole family. It turns out that when the group, which includes four teenagers, two Preteens and two younger children, makes us think first of all, if it can ever truly happy for Carrie and Jim. Fights between children (and a little love between the two of them) makes one wonder when one will ever be able to get along. More interesting than the Brady Bunch, it is quite a nice way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a feel good movie for all ages.
