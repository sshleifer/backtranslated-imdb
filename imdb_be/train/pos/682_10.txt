This is one of my favorite movies, and while it may move too slowly for some, it is worth a look. Corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) to drag the case with the participation of the "city" the natives, and this is no ordinary case. Well, the man has died, but this was no ordinary murder. There was also greater than average rainfall in recent times, and the atmosphere most of the film somewhat claustrophobic and oppressive. Natives of harboring a secret and refuse to let it slip. It has much in common with white people make assumptions about "City" against the "tribal" natives, and, of course, not in a big city or will not practice tribal ways. Uh-huh. Chamberlain feels strange dreams, and he somehow the key to what is happening, but no matter how many times I've seen it, I can not fully understand the exact connection. This is a very horrible and terrible film, and is an excellent example of the ability of Peter Weir, to create tension out of nothing. The ending is a bit ambiguous, but I take it in the literal sense, it is the easiest way and the most terrible. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
