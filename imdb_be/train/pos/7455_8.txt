Gogol always go down in history as one of your most legendary games in VG history. They no doubt. But this game, though very different, may quite possibly be the champion of the modern Bond, one time. <br /> <br /> This is not the communication game is based on material from another medium. It was a completely new; game scenario. Which even had its own song! (Would not bond without it, ha ha!) The game was excellent, and if you're a fan of Bond games or movies, but you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In contrast to some / most of the games, the actors portrayed their character itself, as opposed to fictional creatures to play with. What makes it more cinematic look. With so Â«bond'-skilled storyline, you feel like you're in the game for as long as you get lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> The pleasant in all aspects, from beginning to end. Even after the passage of the games there is still a lot remains to be done. With a system of ranking and Unlockables must be achieved, as well as its multi-mission, this game is released. Despite a rather old game in years. It is still a good game that you can pick up and play, if you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life. Even now, just thinking about it, I got a song stuck in my head. Such a large cast and well written plot. <br /> <br /> The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if they were actors before you, and every bit as entertaining as the game itself. Superbly made, in true fashion communication. What can only be called Awesome, Totally Fine. <br /> <br /> I have to go throw this game now. If you have not played yet, you are missing out!
