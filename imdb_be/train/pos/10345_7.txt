The only review of this film, as this date is really Gromit star and the movie itself. I usually like to read user comments, to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from the film, I do not know much about. It's sad when there are so many comments a particular tile, because when there is only one review and unfairly attacking the film and the actor, you do not get an idea of ​​what to expect. I read the review before watching this title and I do not know where all the poison for this film and the stars came from. Douglas and Blondel were both very talented and attractive people tend to be delivered, even if the material was not the biggest. I found the film and the performances fun and enjoyable. This is not one of the greatest classics of all time, but a pleasant and amusing diversion, much more than you can expect in most contemporary films. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
