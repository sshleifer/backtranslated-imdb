I first saw this film when I was a freshman in high school, and the film stuck with me over the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or the movie, or even a few bad dialogue and action, we are talking about educational purposes and for the message that is most important. It's not a sin to have a child, if you are a teenager and still in high school, and it's actually not bad, either, but it is a problem. Tons of girls I knew that all of them have children, and I believe that they have never watched this wonderful movie, and if they did, they clearly have not received a message for all of this. It is a question not risk, if you are in a sexual relationship. Any girl can become pregnant the first time. This is not a myth. You do not have to spend on your dream, but they should take precedence in your future because you have a child to think about the first <br /> <br /> This film has a clear message behind it :. JUST SAY NO!
