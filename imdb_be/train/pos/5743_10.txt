I loved this movie! It was all I could do not to break down in tears while watching, but it is really very uplifting. I was amazed by the performance of Ray Liotta, but especially the talent of Tom Hals, showing the twin brother Ray, who mentally slow due to the tragic and terrible childhood experiences. But the character of Tom, even heartbreaking, does not know self-pity and so full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss !!
