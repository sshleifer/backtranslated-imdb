I really enjoyed this episode. Seeing flashes, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (even though all he did swim) did my eyes widened. To see most of the founders of the Justice League is trying to bring down Lex Luthor is what I have been waiting for. It sounds a little off topic, but do live action Justice League of the show, of course, do I have a reason to shove everything I normally do for a week in the sewers only watch one episode. It's a thrill I got from watching this episode. I wish they made this episode a little bit longer, like two o'clock special because I felt that one hour of the Justice League was not enough. Now, before I bore you (if I'm not with my incoherent) I just want to say, of Smallville cool again. It's kind of lost his touch when the show began focusing on Lana. But I am sure that the authors simply fall back into the loop hole. :( So enjoy this episode. Who knows when another good friend is going to go. Catch it again this Thursday, Feb. 22 if you missed the first airing.
