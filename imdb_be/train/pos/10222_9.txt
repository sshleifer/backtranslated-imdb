It is unlikely that the duo Mostel and Team Harry Belifont to give us some interesting performances and the subject in The Angel Levine. This is an interesting twist on the theme of this wonderful life. <br /> <br /> Zero married to progress Kaminsky and two of them belong to a special class of elderly Jewish poor in New York. Mostel previously tailor and proud of their profession, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky mostly bedridden. It boils down to applying for benefits. In desperation, like Jimmy Stewart, he calls out to God for help. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe if he got someone like Henry Travers things might work differently, but even Stewart trouble recognizing Travers. But Travers was one thing going for him, he was more than 100 years of this deadly coils and all of its connection with the earth's things disappeared. God sent Mostel something quite different from the recently deceased Harry Belifont who had at least been given some basic training for the Angels before being given the task. <br /> <br /> Belafonte is not accepted, he passed from life, he still has a lot of questions. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know that he had passed on, hit by a car at the beginning of the film. You put your problems and questions Mostel and you have a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel can not believe the black Jew named Levin. <br /> <br /> It was a farewell speech at the Polish / Jewish actress Ida Kaminska, received a nomination for Best Actress in a store a few years ago on the main street. Other prominent role here is that the Irish actor Maile O'Shea plays a good Jewish doctor. Remembering O'Shea Irish accent from the verdict, I was very surprised to see and hear him make a part of the doctor. <br /> <br /> The Angel Levine raise some interesting and exciting questions of faith and race in this society, he brought you to a stellar cast and, of course, created by the famous writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure to catch it when broadcasting.
