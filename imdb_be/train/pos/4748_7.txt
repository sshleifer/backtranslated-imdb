History would never win awards, but it's not what it's about ... the script was just interesting and disturbing enough to make room for an incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Who needs a story of a struggle like this? In fact, it's worth watching just for this reason. If you can cope with baked blood, of which there are many ... none of them did not sufficiently realistic to be tough to watch. I gave it a 7.
