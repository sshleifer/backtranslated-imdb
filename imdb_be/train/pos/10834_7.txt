I did not come «Still Crazy» with any real expectation. Just another rock and painting, I realized ... good nostalgia for baby boomers. This film is partly, but much more. Brian Gibson, director, previously helmets biography of Tina Turner, and is very successful in his style. I believe it is fitting that it was his last film. <br /> <br /> The cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in the role of team leader. The actor, who became director Bruce Robinson appears as an unnecessary guitarist. He does a good job, despite the fact that he has not appeared in a film since the late 70s. If you are looking for a touching and funny movie (with some great songs), you found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 10
