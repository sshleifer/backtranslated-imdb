I bought this game on impulse buying from Walmart. I am glad that I did. It was very interesting to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought the schedule was the best I have ever seen in a movie / game adaptations. The level of the bonus is very difficult! Sniper one, I think it was too hard, it made me so excited, I have not played the game for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind, or life, to cope with it. <br /> <br /> The only thing I would change was the update system. I did not notice any difference from un-modernized modernized equipment, such as a purchase upgrade armor, it does not seem to make armor stronger or more toppings on my life meter. I really liked the Q helicopter. I think the developers have done a good job.
