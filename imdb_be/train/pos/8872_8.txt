This is the first movie that I saw John the Singleton, and he is a very good director. The film begins with a bunch of freshmen come, and it shows what happens to some of them. Omar Epps plays the star of the track with a partial scholarship and hard to keep up with his work. He was friends with Ice Cube and being acquainted Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson rich girl who is raped by date and become friends with Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian, and not sure where to go. Michael Rapoport is a guy from Idaho, who falls in with a group of neo-Nazis and their leader, Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science, who is trying to help them. This is a great movie, and it is a pity that the studio had to make a few cuts in the film.
