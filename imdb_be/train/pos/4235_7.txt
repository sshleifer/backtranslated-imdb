.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappoints me !!!! Whatever happened to the old Burton, who read «The Dark Knight Returns» Frank Miller as research for its preparation to direct Batman back in 1988-89? Judging by her Burton examined the book nor the film, because he got it all wrong! This movie sucks! It's not as good as the original, and it does not deal with the same topic as the original. If you want a good movie to watch original monkey. <br /> <br /> ** to **** stars
