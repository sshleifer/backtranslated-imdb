Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a person who devotes his time to find the missing children. If beautiful Kee Nang {} Charlotte Lewis enters his life, she tells him that he is the chosen one and he must find a golden child. Skeptical and operated exclusively lust and intrigue, Jarrell is involved, not realizing that he was going to go on a fantastic journey, one that includes hazard and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> golden child product of its time? I mean, Eddie Murphy, and the popularity of The Golden Child only the end of the 1980s, the audience?. For I remember vividly how the movie was entertaining the people still in this decade, this box office of $ 79817937, which makes it the 8th biggest earner in 1986, but with the 80s faded from memory, she began to thing to deny Eddie Murphy comedy honors pictures that they actually had once been. Golden child not more than 80 photos taken by Murphy as market places and Beverly Hills, but when reviewing a movie recently, I personally believe that it contains a Murphy on his jokers, quipping and charming best!, Seriously !. <, Br /> <br /> profiting from the formula of action fantasy that has been restored and the pace-Vedeno on Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, Golden baby gets all the genre buttons. Beautiful girl, daring reluctant hero with the sharpness in his arsenal excellent villain {Charles Dance as the English language I could kiss him myself}, excellent color and cute baby with mystical powers, the movie is just asking you to take part in the entertainment, not to dissect and distracted their value as a skull fantasy paintings. Yes CGI daemon looks creaky, and the genre had a much better picture of the 80's, 90's and beyond, but in fact, if you agree with the shameful ranking, here, on this site, you can just take this genre a little too seriously, seriously. 7/10
