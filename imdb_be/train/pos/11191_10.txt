It's scary and rather bloody adaptation of the great novel by Stephen King has excellent central performances Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who sadly died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some really disgusting effects.Director gore Mary Lambert has a great sense of visual style, and managed to make this one of the few options for work King, who not only worth seeing, but really unnerving.The way zombie baby Gage (Miko Hughes later in "New nightmare") is equally noteworthy is the fact that It could easily have been smehatvor nye character made threatening and spooky.As for people who believe that this one does not look terribly alone in the dark (in the end, with a squeamish girlfriend) and I guarantee you that, "Pet Sematary" you crawl out.Some horror movies like this or "Chain Texas Saw MassacreÂ» should not be observed in group.Recommended for horror fans!
