This is a film that is not the primary market will probably never be able to access as it is certainly not easy to give the viewer to watch. A story about Spike and his troubled friend Heaton not quite Friday night film as it has its own unique edge, and I found that it was interesting. There are moments of brilliance given that the film was made on such a low budget, for example, when Spike inhaled aerosol. However, I do not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and to be honest, it made me spend most of the film trying to work it out. And I do not like the fact that most of the film is spent from two friends to talk and not a lot of "action". This short film, which is difficult to see, and this is what makes it attractive.
