If it was originally aired in 1984, my wife and I signed up for our first VHS recorder. I still do, that the aging of the tape, which I try to see every year. It was a year of the birth of my first child, and seeing A Christmas Carol in this incarnation evokes fond memories of happy times - many hours of which were spent in the movie plays in the background. I finally broke down this year and ordered a DVD, prompted me to take the time to write this brief reaction to the film. Charles Dickens story is captured in an outstanding fashion here. George C. Scott is absolutely amazing and very believable as Scrooge. The supporting cast is equally spectacular. This, in my opinion, perfect production. Little details add a lot of fun. The game "comparison" Scrooge's nephew and wife play with your party guests a neat point. (I have since recreated it from my high school English students as a respite from the work in the classroom!) Frankly, I can think of several ways to entertain yourself during the holidays I like more than to indulge in the production of the CBS, which was originally sponsored by IBM . (Incidentally, it is interesting to see the old tape from the original advertising IBM ..., that shows how computers have evolved in the 21 years is amazing how things have changed.!) Result: A Christmas Carol timeless story, and this rendition timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, everyone!
