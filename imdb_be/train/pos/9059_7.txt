It's a good movie, a good family movie to watch if you have nothing better to do. If you expect this film to be word for word from the book, you will be very disappointed. I was a little disappointed because I read the book several times, when I was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> This is a new child in the city named Billy. He makes a bet with the school bully and the rate did not like the most interest. Billy must eat 10 worms in one day or bully wins. <br /> <br /> actions in order, probably the worst part of the film. Starring kid over exaggerate on many things. They think it's the apocalypse, when Billy eats worms. Hell Eisenberg did an excellent job, though. <br /> <br /> The story line is good, like in the movies, but it sucks as the adaptation of the book. I was able to watch this movie, despite the time .... sometimes. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a good family film with some weak points. I rate this film 7/10.
