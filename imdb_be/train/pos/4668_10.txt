This film is now displayed on the digital TV at least once a month, I watched it a dozen or more times, and it never ceases to please me. If it was tomorrow I would watch it again. Such artistry, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians acting profession can create, helped in no small measure to the highest carrier trio of Karl Malden, Newhart and Robert Morley. Not forgetting others in minor roles. <br /> <br /> It's just a fairy tale, just said, from the former prisoner in an attractive embezzlers, struggling and success with the then "new age technology", that is, computers and stay defeat in the process. Even if it's a bit (tongue in cheek) implausible, even incredible, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no swearing, and best of all not a horrible mode of action that is so prevalent today. This lesson of contemporary filmmakers on how to make a great show with, and almost nothing ... except for outstanding talent.
