Good character development in a rather cool environment. Being a man, I'm probably not qualified to fully understand it, but they do a good job of making restrictive Victorian media from the beginning. It is not as bleak as it was in reality, and the treatment of women is likely to be even tougher. What makes it go great chemistry among the protagonists. Each of them has its own "thing" that they deal with. Once they get out of the rain and to escape from the web, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I liked about this movie is that it did not go on a cheap comedy, when it could have. He did not try to drive the lesson for us. People who seem completely baseless really well-developed people who get to see the light. I had a small problem with Alfred Molina's character, which is what enlightenment is so fast, but in this world, it had to happen. It works well all around something positive, that occur in the lives of some pretty good people.
