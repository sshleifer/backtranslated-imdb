This "Hidden Fortress" is Kurosawa, who are most dear to me. I do not hand out 10's, like candy, but it certainly deserves it, if anything. Despite the fact that it is quite a long time (like all of Kurosawa are largely), he agreed with the problem, what mistakes I have with most of his films; The storyline is often too loose and slowly evolves, it contains scenes that are not necessary or just lenghtened too much without any real purpose to the story line or character descriptions. Delivered Dodes'ka-den me the same experience that, for example, "The Hidden Fortress" made; despite its length, there was not one minute, I'd cut. <br /> <br /> It is also very unusual Kurosawa film in a sense, it has no storyline, but a lot of small independent stories that are based more to the description of the character than plot, unlike any other-Kurosawa film that I've seen so far. It also relies more on dialogue, which he uses brilliantly (especially in stories between father and son are planning their "new home"). <br /> <br /> However, what makes this masterpiece is an object as tragic as it is able to be described as humane and sympathetic, not pointing the finger at anyone at any time. From the beginning to the end it provides all the emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
