Earlier, I wrote that I loved "Titanic", shouted at the end of his (many times), and I'm a guy in his 60s. I am also wondering why this great film, which has received so many awards and applauded so many critics, received only a 7.0 rating on imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at the breakdown of user ratings. While 29.0% of the vote gave him a rating of 10, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating. This is 10.7% of the users of these irrational IMDb, essentially pulled overall rating to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed it very unusual nature of the voting (a sudden surge of 1 ratings, with 10 high-ranking, falling only gradually, and then suddenly turn back and jump at a level 1 rating) to only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I am determined enough chat to see the banter of young people (young people, mostly) that degrade it to the left and right. They absolutely hate a person, and they will not have any role in giving him any credit in "Titanic." (To answer one another user: I am not talking about those who just do not really like the movie that much, and gave him 5 or 6, etc. Each person has, and is entitled to his / her own taste. but no one can convince me that IMDB rating of only 7.0 in general for the "Titanic", reached to this level by using an excessive amount of ridiculous 1 estimates a fair reflection of the overall picture of the movement). <br /> <br /> Let me demonstrate his point by comparing a user template IMDB vote "Titanic" to 5 randomly selected box office and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will have to prove their point of view). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was pulled from theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and ratings IMDB voters were: 23.2% 10 9.2% estimates and estimates of 1 (total score 6,1) "Big. Top Pee-you "(1988) received 4.3% and 10 evaluations rating 1 9.9% (total score 4,5)." Cat People "(1982) received 6.1% and 10 evaluations rated 2.6% 1 (general assessment 5,8). "Blind Date" (1987) received 3.0% 10 2.8% evaluations and ratings 1 (overall evaluation 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) was 4.4% 10 (overall rating of 5.2) estimates and 3.7% 1 ratings. What all these films have in common with "Titanic"? All percentages of 1 Lower ratings !!!! In addition to "Titanic", and none of this bitch has always been appointed to the SINGLE AWARD. Again, the "Titanic" was 10.7% 1 ratings! Compare this with other 5 movies that I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Could it be some kind of explanation, but hate to Leo factor? <br /> <br />
