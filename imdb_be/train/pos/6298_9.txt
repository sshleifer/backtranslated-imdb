Great fun. I went with 8 members to view a preview of the film. We came to see the different one, but after 10 minutes wondering what the devil we were at this time the joke was funny, and they were funny throughout the film. In the first part you just keep asking yourself is «malinski» and other "Bellini" (there are many other examples of the lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they get funnier and funnier. In search of malinski all the main characters are introduced first even wackier, than the other. Up to half of the film was over, we did not even know the name of this film, because there was no opening credits, and we went to this sneak preview, but we are sure that a good time. The house has been loaded (approx. 250), and I think that about half of them do not like it, and the other half liked the film. If you like weird comic films with great dialogue, you will love it. In addition to Clooney, the film deserves a much better rating than 5,6 IMDB it has at the time I write this, but if a public procurement have seen it, I am sure that it will go up. 7.0 wisely, I think I would give it an 8 out of 10 (10 of 10, after a few beers) <br /> <br />
