The King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is amazingly beautiful and deeply moving film. The owner of 16 awards worldwide, this film is based on a true story focuses on Van Bianlian, street performer in the 1930s, China, which is growing older, but does not have an heir to pass on his art opera face changing. He has a unique talent to quickly change the mask by, and no one knows how he does it. He has a burning desire to have a grandson, as his art is a family heirloom that can be passed on only male heir. Then we go to the street, and sees that people sell their children, because they can not afford to take care of them: some even ask to take their daughter for free, because the daughter is not necessary in this society. History Van Bianlian goes on. <br /> <br /> The film was so amazingly well, the action was amazing, and the questions were so strict and tackle well. There is gender inequality and depressing that in this time and place, no one wants to a little girl. It is also interesting to note that the famous opera actor who always plays a woman, and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a person who dresses as a woman, and while it is a well known and respected, he considers himself somewhat low, half woman . As we go further into the film, face issues of human trafficking and the demand and therefore the absence of a possible solution to this, brutality and corruption in the army and police, as well as the helplessness and lack of power of any person can face him because of unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> It is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Van Bianlian, represents another excellent performance,
