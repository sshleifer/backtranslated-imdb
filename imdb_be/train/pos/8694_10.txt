It was in 1988 when I saw "Ronnie and Nancy Show» for the first time (on the Austrian television). At that time I was a very big fan of spitting (because, when he won a bronze rose Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course, I recorded everything on tape the show and watched it over and over again - especially «The Ronnie and Nancy Show». I remember the scene when Ronnie was standing in front of a picture of Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said to myself, "I need a shave." ! Or the most fun of all, when he was playing ball with his dog - and vice versa <br /> <br /> It's such a shame that the spitting image appears to sink into oblivion; it was one of the most fantastic and the most intelligent of the TV show ever. Compared with other transmissions satirical it was definitely the best. <br /> <br /> Well, it took almost 20 years since then, and I would like to see the show again. You can buy from someone ... somewhere?
