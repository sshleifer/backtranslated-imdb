I love the new episodes with CJ and his grandfather - I liked the story with Kate falls on the principal. I want to find out what's going on with Rory and Kerry and Bridget and family next. I think CJ is very funny, and I love the scene with his grandfather. I've always loved James Garner in all that he does, and this is the merit of his actions, I never think of it as James Garner or Rockford in this series and fully believe in him as a dad Keith. This family is so real and funny. It was terribly boring, when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey dead, but, as in real life, these things happen, and as it was written in the series and had to deal with was funny and sad, and always very sensitively and with love He engaged. But overall a very fun show with lots of laughter and fun.
