Which is an exciting movie. Even if it is not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was an exciting portrait of a rogue in his element. And this kind of psychology students of the film could learn to identify compulsive liars. <br /> <br /> author of forbidden love, Norma, was exposed as a fraud in the media, but this step is really to give her ample opportunity to clear his name. <br /> <br /> But in the turns it takes a documentary across the country. What woman patient! I loved this movie. I have not read the book, and only heard good reviews and went to see it on a sad rainy day. Travel this film takes you on this clever, interesting and completely addictive.
