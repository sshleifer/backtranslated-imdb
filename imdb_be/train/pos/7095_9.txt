stunning full-length adaptation of Terry Gilliam's short film with Chris marker LA Jet√©e hallucinogenic full of surprises, but still touches your heart thanks to a superb cast. Gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works from a script by David and Janet Peoples play with his head in the same way as it does with a bad James Cole (Willis in his most Steve McQueen as - better than McQueen, even), and the time-traveling convict from the future who literally did not know whether he is or is going as a team of scientists continues to send him back to those times, trying to prevent the plague in 1995, which is deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Willis then justifiably Oscar nominated Brad Pitt, and Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist to give some of the best performances of his career. Even the score of tango in the style of Paul Buckmaster is intrusive. This one is a no-miss!
