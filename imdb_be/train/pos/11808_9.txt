At one end of the eighties Warren Beatty has created and starred in the epic Reds competent on the basis of the Soviet Union, seen through the eyes Iconoclastic radical John Reed. It was a deep film as entertainment and communications submitted to the all-star cast. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy, that does not pretend to be anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it under tons of make-up. <, Br /> <br /> it's like red and Dick Tracy may come from the same person says a lot about the band, the man has as a player. In this film, Beatty was able to get all the well-known cartoon characters from the strip and place them in a single original scenario. <br /> <br /> Top city gangster Big Boy Caprice takes a step to really eliminate competition. The film begins with his lips rubbing with minions Manlis shooting style Valentine Massacre, and then LIPS very trap for cement overcoat. But moving Caprice to make him a target for Tracy. <br /> <br /> At the same time the third mysterious and faceless individual looks at himself topple Caprice. Will our hero will understand this thicket of crime? <br /> <br /> The spirit of fun this film is really contagious. If people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R. G. Armstrong get yourself look outrageous fictional cartoon creations bands author Chester Gould, and then indulge in exercises thread of a large piece of ham, you have to love this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but none of these guys would have, it's just that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets most of the time on the screen. Only Beatty plays it perfectly straight, the rest all seem to play with him. Dick Tracy won an Oscar for Best Art & scenography, Best Song Written Sondheim and introduced Madonna, sooner or later. The fact that he was even able to get someone like Sondheim to write the score for the film only shows Sondheim wanted to get in on the fun. As for Madonna, the Material Girl does more than hold her own with all those acting heavyweights as club torch singer Breathless Mahoney. <br /> <br /> Prior to this film, Dick Tracy movies were doomed to The drawings and worse as Saturday afternoon serials. The only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza broadcast is made for radio of the armed forces during the Second World War, which was blamed. Can you believe mold as Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, and the Andrews Sisters? Try to find a record of this gem. HN <br /> <br /> Prior to this classic comics Warren Beatty on the big screen will do nicely.
