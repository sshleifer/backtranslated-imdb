The previous reviewer has said, it is true. I saw him once, was fascinated to see it a second time, when he was re-broadcast for a week or two of the first airing. I still remember some of the scenes. Installation is a discovery of the 20th century, war is mentioned in the title of World War I. One of the scenes were set in the women-only section of public space, which was an interesting historical note. At that time, when one of the first women touching each one of my moments of time great movie. I do not think it as a "gay film," it's an interesting period and tender love story, where two major cases, women. I would like to see this movie again; I would buy this if it ever came out on DVD.
