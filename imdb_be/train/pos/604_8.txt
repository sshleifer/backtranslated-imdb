When approaching its centennial, Saur has moved an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create the quintessential love song to his homeland. Twelve "impressions" entourage presented without the story in the frozen environment that allows the capacity of each room to explode before Saura's camera. The creative use of large apartments and mirrors, moving around the set, in combination with screens, shades, fire, rain, and rear-projection great add dramatic effects of a diverse selection of songs, dances and instrumental performance. Albeniz photos appear throughout the program by connecting the passion of music to his great Creator. Sauro covers all Spanish on the stage with the beautiful elegance of older flamenco dancers in traditional costumes children happily dancing with their teachers.
