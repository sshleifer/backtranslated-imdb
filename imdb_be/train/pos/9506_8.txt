Sober, reflective piece, a little miniature, which thrives in the lush humane iconic sequence that goes beyond a simple dramatization of the screen. This quiet little story will keep you happy - if you do not have too many problems with the different Spanish accents from Mexico and Peru, and a more accurate use of the Iberian Peninsula Marisa Paredes! Garc√≠adiego executed a perfect adaptation of the novel: even the great maestro Garcia Marquez should be proud of their excellent work. And hats off to Ripshteyna who so ably coordinated efforts in the gem, ruby, and so gracefully, so elegant, so sensitive, so touching ..... <br /> <br /> El Coronel - Fernando Lujan - waiting, to get his pension, while he continues to live in his dilapidated housing timber deep in the Colombian jungle (but filmed in a different location, rather than in Colombia) with his fighting cocks and his wife (in this order?). And that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> But, oh, so much more .... This film Rhapsody. <br /> <br /> I have to see this little piece of poetry again as quickly as possible. Worth the high side of the 8 out of 10, which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> This is not a light commercial Hollywood material.
