I thought it was absolutely charming movie centering around the life of Mary-Kate and Ashley characters Sam and Emma Stanton! They both try to do so themselves and their parents happy, but; Unfortunately, this simply is not so easy for them, in fact! I thought it was absolutely charming and sweet movie, and if you are a true fan of these wonderful young women, I am sure you will agree with me here! If you have not seen this movie yet then I say you really missed out; a great time, and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now! This film is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
