Now this is something that should be a family movie! There are a few movies in recent years, which have been focused on the family or the children who are really worthy of the public view; but this is one of them. All my family came from the film, awe, entertained, dazzled, and happy. We continue to quote a little joke on him here and there. Kids loved it and so did we (hubbie and I 36 and 32, respectively)! <br /> <br /> In addition to its beautiful and amazing character animation (small as they may be, and imaginary, since they) are very well developed. There is not one of them that you can not empathize. Persons bringing these little creatures to life is well cast vocal abilities, combined with the skill and artistry of some of the best animators of Disney. This is a film worthy of Walt Disney himself. I think that Mr. Disney wholeheartedly approve of this new movie ... Flick, Dot and their fellow group of small heroes can become as popular as Mickey and Mini in our time. <br /> <br /> This is one family leaves the theater wants to see again .. and buy to have on video or DVD. I try to see him again .. to pick up what I may have missed the first time. (I have never seen my children so quickly and clearly identify with the characters and take up ... my daughter is still talking about a small «Dot»). <br /> <br /> This film is funny, touching, intelligent and great fun for the whole family!
