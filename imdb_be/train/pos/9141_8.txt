You can discuss the acting talent of Prince, or even the choice to parody his own life in this film. There is no debate about his musical talent, either then or now. He seems to have ghost-twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> Having survived the hype of this film (he graduated from high school in'85) I can tell you that there was nothing more at the time. By Tipper Gore (wife Ella) is trying to censor «Little Nikki» and everything else under the sun through the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) for each «Air Band" while posing as the prince, it was an absolute hot item po- for. in a few weeks, at least, the prince was more than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We are all waiting for the film and were Soooooo glad when his prime minister. He was not disappointed. everyone was caught. I was a drug addict MTV at the time (they actually played music all the time .... then) Prince played at least once or twice per hour. I must Qual fikavats this comment by saying that, at the time, my favorite was Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls, and others in the genre Punk / New Wave "Prince of Music at the time exceeded all types and styles One of the reasons that some of them at the moment, it seems so cheesy and confessed that it was SOOOOOOOO a great time. All the things that remind you of the 80s were emblematic then. it was the main and, it seems, as the cliché "is now. It became so popular that it became ridiculous. It's like advertising Rappine Granite hamburger Wendy. <br /> <br /> At present, it looks silly, because everyone was caught up in it (unfortunately, kind of like a fancy purple Macarena or something. Anyway, I hope this has given you all a little insight.
