I saw this big intense film today. His Richard Gere and the most important and the best job Claire Dane. Gere deserves an Oscar for his perfect image of man leads to early retirement as an administrator sex offender recorder. Claire Danes is riveting as a woman Gere handpicks replace him - the woman he is trying to teach all that he can, by examining one last case in which Gere character is convinced one of those whom he had charged to control may include a young girl hostage . Subject shocking sex offenders and those who follow them, but this film will not soon be forgotten. I know that I will pursue Gere way for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins serial killer has images of the screen image and scared me so engaged. The film begins with shocking statistics, so do not miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. best role Richard Gere bringing people can act. Danes can also how to do extremely well in this often complicated film. <br /> <br /> This is a daring film and multilayer Gere gives a deep sense of performance. Just give him the Oscar now ... he deserves it!
