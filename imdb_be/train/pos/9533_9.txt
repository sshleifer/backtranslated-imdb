It could not have been better. Severe restrictions on the expression of Mike Sullivan could not be depicted in any other form. Tom Hanks provides the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin emotional wheel drives; playing basic character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman gives one of the best performances of their characters for a long time. <br /> <br /> This film is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This father / son story, which is just not suitable for the role primarily uses two candidates. Mike Sullivan did not have a father, as a child, so that John Rooney took it. While a generous man, Mr. Rooney got involved in organized crime. Thus, Sullivan debt to be repaid only to involve himself in the business. Sullivan now has a wife and two children, and trying to keep your child safe, but at the same time to pay back your boss. Events follow will feel loyalty Sullivan and take the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> With a large adaptation of David I, the dialogue goes rare, but still very virtuous. The story is set in a beautiful 1930 sitting (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haigh), covered with a dark rainy (snow on the ground) appearance. Driving history, it is a great Irish by Thomas Newman, the settlement only when necessary. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical element in the film beautiful photo of Conrad L. Hall. This is one of the best film I've seen; I watch a lot of movies. The scene where Mike and Michael in the car, going to Chicago is very impressive. Shot begins on the front of the vehicle, showing Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. After dollys around to the side of the car to see Michael (Hoechlin) waking up and looking out his side window. As continues, this hand truck and dollys back, all the way around the car and shows the great stage of the 1930, in Chicago. <br /> <br /> With a great cast and crew, the principle of man creates unabashedly strange film. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his feature film debut in 1999 with the American beauty. (Bought him a variety of awards) to the American Beauty, Mendes worked as a director of the game for the British theater, but decided that he wants to move on to say that there was nothing new for him at the theater. With only two films, Sam Mendes said myself in my book as one of the great directors (The list of about twenty-five). <br /> <br /> The film highlights the brazen genre that has its hits and misses, and expresses this theme brilliantly. Photos, actors and phenomenal history. I'm still waiting Scorcesee Gangs of New York, but now, I am quite confident in saying that it is "the best film of the year". In view of this competition (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report) that's a strong statement.
