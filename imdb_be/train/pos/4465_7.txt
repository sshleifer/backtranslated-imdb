Anchors Aweigh is MGM musical entertainment that fans of the genre will enjoy, but I would not appreciate it there with classics like singing in the rain, or the band WAGON. It was the first of the three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra came together. Kelly and Sinatra playing Joe ~ d Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two men on vacation in Hollywood, who befriends a boy (Dean Stockwell), who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson) struggling actress who worked as an extra on the MGM. Although both boys initially attracted Grayson, she eventually voices advantages Joe, but Clarence later intercepts a waitress (Pamela Britton), who he learns from his hometown of Brooklyn. Paper thin plot leaves no room for several big musical numbers, including "We hate to leave," Joe and Clarence cry to his fellow sailors as they leave the ship; Hot colors are Grayson "Jalousie"; dreamy performance of Sinatra's "I fall in love too easily" (a number that unfortunately removed from some prints of the film), and "of Worry Song", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with animated Jerry the mouse Tom and Jerry glories, Kelly also makes an appearance Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet, ballet his rival pirate in the late pirate. Kelly is in top form here, in strong and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor, and love the shy nature of Sinatra is here, of course, sexy. Entertaining distraction for MGM musical factory fans.
