For Muslim women in West Africa, family life in the hands of the spouses can be very difficult. The community can not explicitly endorse such behavior, but not least, they can not yet be ready to see him as a criminal, an attitude which, of course, allows him to continue. Fortunately, an Cameroonian law promises equality for all, and this film is behind the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the Cameroonian legal system, since they are trying to get justice for a number of women and children. What sets (except surging central stories), despite the informal courts actually pragmatic progressive, if it actually bought. The program also offers a spectacular view of the entire Cameroonian lifestyle that (except for the terrible crimes committed in these cases) seems surprisingly emotional and joyful as compared to that used by the inhabitants of Europe and North America. And although I admit that this comment can betray naivet√© on my part, this attitude seems to be captured in a delightful pizhin-English language they speak. Overall, this is a great little film, and much more fun to watch than you can imagine.
