Go way back to the decade of the review page of the section, and work your way back. Go ahead; I'll be waiting. <br /> <br /> Ready? Well, then you've probably noticed the same trend that I have. You can quibble all day about the lame jokes, dating back to the time and obviously derivative of the plot points in "chip Bogus", but this film seems to be one of those "hate me, love me later," the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's biggest problem is that the original did not apply to those 80 children who followed, as a rule, and considered themselves to be at the forefront of fashion. This worked fine for the original, but apparently exploded in 1991, if there is no independent unrespecting slacker would be caught dead wearing nothing but flannel or admitting he liked anything about the '80s, Ted put :. "Dude, that's quite a deep pit. Do you want to play 20 questions? »<br /> <br /> They say that nostalgia is a 20-year cycles, and it certainly seems to be the case here. Here in 2010, the use of those who grew up with Cyndi Lauper and Megadeth are beginning to look back to evaluate some of the key films that (like it or not) of us who we are. If you are one of those who looks at «Bogus", as if it was out of date ( «Fa G!") Robbery, you lose a point and is likely to grow facial hair for six years, to wear flannel and looking, like you just crawled out of bed. <br /> <br /> self-referencing in its origins (Star Trek episode "and during travel to a telephone booth), B & T makes no attempt to hide his love of the creators for respect. Quentin Tarantino, who? I'm not saying "Bogus" is «True Love», but I think it should be clear what it is: a fun snapshot of our society at the time, to child psychology, Ritalin, anti-tobacco ads, terrorist paranoia and distribution media fear mongering. <br /> <br /> So, for all you B & T contempt there ... Turn off the Screaming Trees CD, get the hair out of your face, go to the beach and light. Narcissistic depression and intellectual longing SO corporate.
