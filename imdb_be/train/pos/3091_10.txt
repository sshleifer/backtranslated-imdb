This show is totally worth watching. This is the best acting talent I've seen in a very long time. The premise of the show is a unique and fresh (I believe that executives at ABC are not also used that as there was no other reality show). However, the show was true with cute characters and wonderful stories. I'm probably not in the age group they expect to enjoy the show, as I am in my forties, but many of my friends also loved it (in the late 30's - mid 40's) and die because of the quality shows of talented actors. I do not think that this show had plenty of time to get the audience. I think that this show given more time would make it very well. ABC still just does not show the real potential of a real chance. With so many shows we have given chance after chance and not nearly worth it! They should give a real chance to show the quality and time to really push and get the audience. I really liked the characters and looking forward to watching each episode. I watched the episodes on ABC, and the video show is getting better and better. Although I think they owe us another episode (number 13?). We want to see what we can! ABC shelling email and letter and see if you can save the show from extinction. It certainly worked Jerico. Some things are just worth saving, and this show is definitely one of them. SIGN UP ONLINE Petition to ABC AT: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
