I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and it stuck in my head ever since. It stars two fascinating characters that unfortunately mediocre documentary. To get the true story of Beales, I had to wade through all the bonus material and commentary on the DVD, and search the web. <br /> <br /> While Maysles and their supporters (not to mention Edith themselves Eddie) bristles on the assumption that this film is exploitative, it's operation in the truest sense of the word. Very little effort to explain each of the Beales, or how they came to the condition that they are in - the Maysles approach, it seems, simply turn on the camera and wait for Edith and Eddy to say something outrageous. Sound, even on the Criterion reissue of the poor and hard to follow. While I appreciate this film I was made a few early in the history of documentary film, it is ironic to compare it far exceeds Series Herald river (!) On the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients in the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island in 1972, four years before as the shot Gray gardens. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase a review in New York, there are many things, Edith and Edite needed in their lives, and the documentary was not one of them. <br /> <br /> As Edith and Eddy thing I kept thinking while watching the movie was "where the hell their family"? They live in a dangerous, harmful, dangerous conditions. How is it that Jackie About, married one of the richest men in the world (or a rich family Bouvier themselves) could not afford to get Edith and Eddy decent house? Or at least hire a part-time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on both of them? It is a shame and lasting disgrace for the whole family Buviya. <br /> <br /> While this review may sound negative, I would strongly recommend Gray Gardens for those who love documentaries. Maybe someday someone will come and make a documentary about this documentary - bringing in a rich history (and afterstory) in Beales and all sub Hamptons society in the 1970s.
