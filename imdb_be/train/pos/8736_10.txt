You marvel at the incredibly complex computer animation and new, probably will not wear down in the first, second or third viewing, but you? You will be drawn into the characters that are so simple, but it is interesting that you can find yourself really caring for them in unexpected ways that may or may not make you feel a bit like a child from the environment. <br /> <br /> Disney continues to firmly hold the title of "the greatest animation in the world", with «A Bug? with Life ", standing as one of his greatest achievements. One of the innovative application is an "out-takes" added to the end of the film. The DVD has two sets these out-takes where I? M said the VHS cassette has one alternate version of the tape. The DVD also has a "Game Jerry? C ", which is a lovely little PIXAR short, who was also shown the film in theaters. <br /> <br /> It is definitely superior to film insects compared with Dreamworks? «Antz», which in all fairness is pretty good, but it lacks something in the animation and development of the plot and characters. If you look at both films star voice, "Antz" is largely covered with big name "Movie" stars with a few friends, "the TV" star votes, where "error? S Life "on the contrary, loaded with" TV "stars Kevin Spacey as soon allocated an exception. But the difference is as different and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks can? T be blamed or surprised, though, if you go head to head with Disney, you have your work cut out for you. this kind of film that almost makes me wish I had kids to share it with. Don? t think for a second that this is just a film for children, though.
