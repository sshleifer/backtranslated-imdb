Life begins an excellent pro-code film featuring some of the best times. It is located in the maternity ward of the hospital, in particular, in the room for women, is expected to have problems. As an old woman, a tough single mother (Glenda Farrell), a fragile young woman, Italian, and the main character (Loretta Young), who spends 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second aching to know that everything will be okay. Alyn MacMahone plays a nurse who performs his job. <br /> <br /> This film is very interesting and entertaining. It's not terribly shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such abandoned property on the silver screen. Action is brilliant around. Loretta Young gorgeous here in its heyday. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and sincere as can be. His innocence reminds Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell as big as ever, one of the main pre-codes and for a good reason.
