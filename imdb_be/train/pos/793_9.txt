I really really enjoyed this movie. (That's why it surprised me that he had received such a low grade from many users on this site!) I'm not saying that this is a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night. It's funny, bitter, and great stories about the ups and downs of female friendship that lasts through difficult times and the bad things that a woman friend, as a rule, do to a friend! (FES to the lady, we've all been there!), Bill Paterson bright as Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andy McDowell argues that it may be a good actress when the role is correct, and she puts her mind to it. (And indeed, there is a better "bridal escape" that I have ever seen or dreamed of in this film ... more courage than anyone I've ever known!) You'll laugh, you'll cry --- ignore any marketing company and how this film is a marketing .... a hidden gem, which was supposed to make a ton of cash. (Now I have to look around to get a copy!)
