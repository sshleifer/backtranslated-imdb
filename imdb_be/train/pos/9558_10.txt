So I consider myself a pretty big scene in the anime, with very few shows, I just will not look. <br /> <br /> This show, however, I would recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> It may be the most original series to date, is, with me just about everything I could ask for. A side story, so to speak, of unconditional love, will not be allowed to, comedy very open, and very well put together voice-actors (both Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> If the sun for a very fun aspect to it, it would be just another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, I noticed a "love it or hate it", very few people I saw, introduced in this series will end up with a dislike to him. <br /> <br /> The original in the core, everything you could ask for in a day, bet the house on this series. I am ready to assure you that you will enjoy it.
