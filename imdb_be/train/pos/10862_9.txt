Election Chinese black film, or triads in this case. Every two years, elections are held to decide on a new leader, and at first seems to be a toss up between the Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or, as I know him, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who was a judge in full contact!). Although once wins Locke, Big D refuses to accept the selection and go to that length it can be recognized as the new leader. Unlike other Asian film I watch discriminating gangster, this one is not a fighter. She It has its bloody moments when it is necessary, as in Goodfellas, but it's basically just very effective drama. There are a lot of characters that are really hard to follow, but I think the game in the madness of it all a bit. 100-year-old stick, which is a symbol of power I mentioned earlier, changing hands several times before things will calm down. and while it may seem that the film ends on 65 or 70 minutes, there are a couple of big surprises waiting. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and a kind of an anchor picture. <br /> <br /> The election was rewarded in the last year, the Hong Kong film Awards, winning best actor (Tony Leung), best film, best rezhyso p (Johnny To, who made heroic trio !!), and Best Screenplay. It also had a nominee for cinematography, editing, estimation of the film (which I loved) and three existing performances (including Yam).
