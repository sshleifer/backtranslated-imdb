Although I am not a big fan of musicals, I loved the movie Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, because they are so much fun. Of course, they can be a bit formulaic, but even if you know it will happen, they are still very nice to look at. However, despite this, I was a little disappointed in this outing. In part, this was because the film is not perfect supporting cast, as you saw in the TOP HAT or dance. Without Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore, the film seems to be a bit lacking - especially in the "fun" department. Silly antics of the supporting actors gave the charm of other films that you just do not get with FOLLOW fleet. In addition, unlike the conventional character played by Astaire, it is one more leap - his thick head of Rogers gets into trouble again and again. And as a result, it is much more difficult to love him and want to see them get together at the end of the film. In addition, although the music of Irving Berlin songs just does not seem as memorable. In fact, none of the songs were not all that special, and I can not think of any of them, even though I had just seen the movie. Although this is still cute and worth of film, it simply lacks the luster and magic of some of his other films. Good, but far from great.
