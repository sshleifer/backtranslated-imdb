After reading the book Diamond, I was a little disappointed in the series, but in general, it is quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is reassuring to know that "soldiers culture" works hard, seeing the "attack" to "Western civilization" under every rug. <br /> <br /> diamond bit didactic? Of course. Like many scientists, he sees his theory as the most important ever. He uses the phrase "weapons, germs and steel", it would seem, at every opportunity during the series. We get it, after the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> diamond bit simpler (in the series)? Of course. Part of the Spaniards in South America, especially funny, condensing some very long, complicated history up to the "pox, swords and horses", summing up all the conquest of South America approximately 15 minutes. But the essence remains in effect - these things, and actually contribute (but not completely determined) causes the Spaniard's success against the established culture <br /> <br /> Is he preached * against * Western civilization, in any case, .? No. Not a word. Nya to my ear. All that he says that luck plays a big role in determining which crops have progressed more quickly * nya * that luck is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that the evaluation of your own sense of superiority, this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all of the factors than the impact as a society of success or failure, this series is a useful interpretation of historical facts.
