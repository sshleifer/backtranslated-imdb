I would like to say that this is the first quality of a romantic comedy I have ever seen. he had a deep and although you knew from the beginning who's going to end up together it was still tight and wait. the idea that maybe they would not get together ... it's an indie film after all. this movie was well written, directed and acted. dancing on the side of the road scenes were great.
