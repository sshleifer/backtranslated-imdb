Seeing as Kiefer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of television, it was a foregone conclusion, I was going to go to the movies and spend $ 15 on it. I also think that this applies to the fans of Eva Longoria. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the leak, which is planning a Secret Service agent to kill the president. As the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is highly decorated with Pete (Michael Douglas). Calling innocence, Pete goes to entertainment, fluent style, to seek the truth. <br /> <br /> This is a solid, but certainly not impressive. A decent cast, a decent story, but it left me feeling a bit empty, but you could certainly do a lot worse.
