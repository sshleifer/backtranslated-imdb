I saw the SP when it was first released, and found it a major disappointment. Her script, it seemed forced and arch and too fakey 60s. This policy is too upfront and funny. And let's face it, I was still under the spell of love known as bloated: and I still have not completely shaken him. Who is "love" is twisted with all kinds of nostalgia and it is, oh well. ,, Advances me! <br /> <br /> But time is on time and were good to LSD and time have been a teacher for me. I again this film every ten years, and it just gets better and better with age. And IP is its own "experience" and only really associated with BlowUp by its creator, the late, great Mr. Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I had the great good fortune to see absolutely pristine print, projected onto its right size (huge), restored the Italian government cultural institution, who knows the good work of art when they see and know the importance of maintaining a Beauty stuff in good shape. I still remember the gasps from the audience when the first shot of the Valley of Death appeared. It was like a thousand volts visual shock Antonioni's deliberately delivered to awaken us to a new level of consciousness. Indeed, that follows from this point is a completely different genus 'place'. <br /> <br /> What is surprising to me how the film comes into its own. <br /> <br /> I remember the second time I saw it --- in the early 80's --- I began to feel an attachment to the whole film and Daria and Mark in particular. Whereas before these two, it seemed as blatant a shadow version of Olivia and Leonardo Zefferelli in (read: Romeo and Juliet), they now had to deal with me --- especially the girl in her persistent SLO-motion-Eck. It-took-it time. ,, live. Everything, everything dies around her. <br /> <br /> After an exciting day of theater has become a reality quickly erase my new found "pleasure". Breaks shoulder laid, a large gray 80s whispered, "But this hippie fantasy --- let» <br /> <br /> The strength of Antonioni's vision was, I realized, had worked himself inside the FIRST time I have, so I replied "80 "with" Hugo "and guarded my" love "secretly, powerfully and jealously. <br /> <br /> But this, this is what good art does, he lives within you, and if you want it to have its way, and "likes" you back: secretly jealous and domineering. And you get "changed». <br /> <br /> He was excited to see that the Turner Classic Movies has decided to show the SP in its lineup in March. Undoubtedly, IP should be seen on a giant screen so that it does can take you to their constructed environment. But, hey, sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved in a newspaper photograph is not better than no glimpse at all. <br /> <br /> today, the reality hit, SP was mysteriously withdrawn and replaced whiney antics ALICE restaurant. <br /> <br /> So, it is still too "hard", too "disturbing", and "What»? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's that, like all good art, it lives, all dying around him. <br /> <br /> World.
