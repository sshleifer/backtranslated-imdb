I had no idea what the film was about, or did not even know it existed until about 1 month ago, when I came across when I was looking for other movies that watched Dominic Monaghan. I thought that this film was a strange insight into the mind of any ties and the fact that his / her mind can go through in a few hours they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep, it was an interesting movie and a significant often plays Dom ....... I believe that even if the film you can not buy anywhere (well, I've never seen it anywhere), you should see if you ever get a chance, so it really makes you think about the people around us, who can not sleep and suffer night after night could not sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep each night, so all in all it was an interesting movie the good stuff.
