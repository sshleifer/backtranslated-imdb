This is one of the best films I've seen in years! I am not a supporter of Gwyneth Paltrow, but she's fine as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming as the perfect Reverand Elton and Emma Thompson's sister, Sophie, hysteria, Miss Bates. And check out the magnificent North as Mr. Knightley; What a gentleman! Who says you need to sex and violence in movies, to do it well never saw Emma. I think that is what makes it different from many others. - is a cool <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that you can watch the whole family, or looking for romance for yourself, look no further. Emma this film. With beautiful environment, beautiful costumes and outstanding actor (did I mention the magnificent North?), Emma is an excellent ten!
