The documentary begins in 1986 in New York, where black and Latino drag queens hold "balls." That's where they put on, but they love to strut their stuff in front of the audience and vote. We get to know many of the members and see how they stick together and support each other. As one person says to another - "You have three hits against you - you're black, gay and a transvestite." These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only at balls. There they can be whoever and whatever they want, and will be taken. Then cut the film three years later (1989), and you can see how things have changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> Sounds depressing, but it is not. Most of the people surveyed actually very funny and get a lot of humor of these situations. They are well aware of their position in society and take it with humor - just as they should. We find out they all live in "houses" run by a variety of "mother" and all help each other. sense of community in this film is fascinating <br /> <br /> If this film was released in 1990, it has been controversial. - and a great success. He won Best Documentary awards at numerous festivals - but was never even nominated for an Oscar. Their reason was "Black and Latino uterus entirely material resistance Academy". Fascinating is not it? Homophobia and racism together. <br /> <br /> I saw today, it's still a great film - and part of the period. It's just not like that more - Nude they show no longer exists. The balls are still held, but not in the spirit, we see here. In addition, the resistance is becoming more "accepted" in society (for better or worse). And I heard as overdone home. It's kind of sad. I would like to know where these characters now - I know that two of them died of AIDS, but I have no idea about the others. And what happened to that 13-year-old and 15-year-old show? <br /> <br /> However, it is one of a kind documentary - exciting, funny and riveting. I must see all the way! 10. Where a particular DVD ???
