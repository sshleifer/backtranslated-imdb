If this film was made a few years later, I would have given it a lower score. However, for 1909, it was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today. Just do not try to compare this silent film to later Silents - the industry has changed so radically that shorts the first decade of the 20th century, did not look at all like the films made in the 1910s and beyond. <br /> <br /> This movie length of 11 minutes (on average for most of the film at that time), and is a version of the story of Edgar Allen, The Cask of Amontillado. Although many of them are familiar with the story, I will not go into details on how I do not want to spoil the movie. Just enough to say that this is a very terrible !!
