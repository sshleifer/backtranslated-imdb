This collection of eleven short stories in one film is a great idea, and presents some great segments, but also some disappointing surprises. On the basis of the tragic events of September 11, 2001 in the United States, eleven Directors were asked to express their attitude to the American tragedy. As a result, most of them not only the individual sympathies to the American people, but, mainly, to the intolerance of the world with different cultures and people. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (UK) is the best segment on September 11, 1973 in Chile when the democratic government of Salvador Allende was destroyed by the dictator Augusto Pinochet, with US support. <br /> <br /> Other Great segments are one of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), indicating intolerance in the world, and the number of victims made by the US government in different countries in modern history; and one of Mira Nair (India), featuring the true story of injustice and prejudice against Pakistanis family, whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the United States when he was actually a hero. <br /> <br /> Some interesting segments: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows the child innocent Afghans refugees are preparing harmless refuge from the bombs, while their teacher is trying to explain to them what had happened on the other side of the globe; romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a couple in New York the next World Trade Center; Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) shows the consequences of the war in a small place and lonely widows protest; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life goes on; Imamura and history, is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no holy war, but sadness and shame. <br /> <br /> The segment Idris Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) is very naive, but draw creepy bad weather this African country. <br /> <br /> segment Amos Gital (Israel) is very sad and manipulative, featuring more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> segment Gonzalez Inarritu very disappointing ,. terrible, without inspiration and, of course, the worst one <br /> <br /> My vote is seven <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :.
