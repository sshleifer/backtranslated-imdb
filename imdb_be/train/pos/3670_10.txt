I rented this movie on DVD, not knowing what to expect. - and I'm going to study film production in Canada of all places, I will certainly bring it to the classroom <br /> <br /> The story centered around probably the most unlucky team of the film in the history of the film, brilliantly written and very talented actors manage to deliver a pun on time. <br /> <br /> If you just can not laugh during the "Hollywood North", I propose to see a psychiatrist at once - you can have serious problems <br /> <br /> In addition, a great script, I also noticed that the great chemistry between the actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine -.?, where they are really just acting, Jennifer Tilly (playing funny bad actress) and Martin Landau, also made a very sharp but funny performance <br /> <br. /> Great film, even better pronunciation.
