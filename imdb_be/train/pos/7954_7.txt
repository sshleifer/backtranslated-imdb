Big voices, many adventures and clever dialogue make it a very good film. Adding a "character" in the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning, in particular, the relationship between the older man, a shadow, and the young Hellraiser, a chance. Earlier versions of this film could not give the animal any real identity or motive, doing exactly here. Sally Field is cute in anything, but really shines in this film, as the proud cat, Sassy. Great contrast between a cat and a dog outlook on life, and just the right amount of alcohol and warm Fuzzies make a plot and resolution is excellent. There's even inspiring evaluation and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for evenings only or with children. Hats off to Disney.
