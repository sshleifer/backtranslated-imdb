Watching the two brothers interact and feed off each other throughout the film makes me personally happy to live in the countryside, just as they did in the movie. I watched this movie countless times and have a book next to the Bible. After watching the film, I agree that this is one of the few films that make the book justice. I highly recommend to anyone that has a chance to go to Montana fish or to be outdoors, to do it. It's weird. I can not think of anyone else that could play a role better than Brad Pitt. Do yourself justice, and watch one of the best films in modern cinema era. Highly recommended and as a guide for fishing in Montana and Wyoming, Sun trying to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the film, because although it looks great on film, you do not have a clue about how a lot of practice and skill to fishing so at the really need. Thank you for listening watch this movie, please, if you want to get long-winded movie.
