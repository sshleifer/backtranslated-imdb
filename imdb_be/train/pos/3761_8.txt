Bill and Ted Bogus Journey is a continuation of Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. Their bogus journey successor almost immediately after the first movie, and doing just as good a job, if not better, to entertain the viewer. <br /> <br /> The plot of an evil man from the future trying to kill Bill and Ted with the help of evil robots that look just like Bill and Ted. After the robots kill Bill and Ted, they must compete with Death (death), and get your life back to normal. <br /> <br /> To act in the film at the highest level, and even thought it was a little strange at times, especially Bill and Ted's conversation, it's a great movie. Wannabe rockers sure did another great movie. Take it the next time your in a blockbuster!
