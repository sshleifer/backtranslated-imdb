Rain or shine on the street, you enter a movie house. It makes you happy. (If you do not come right.) The lights go out. You settle with ice cream bar. Mobile images will flash on the screen. Do you feel content. In the darkness, you're back at the beginning of time. Sitting by the fire ... looking at the modern version of the flickering flame 24 times per second, and sharing the joy of discovery of unknown twists and turns of the script with the rest of your clan / viewers. <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy with themselves, do not comment. (Long live the romantic comedy ...)
