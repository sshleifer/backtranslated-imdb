Nice to see Suraj Barjatya back to what he is best at.A story is woven around marriage.It feels good to the film, in which there is no scene in which you would not see his family. Although the story is simple and does not contain any new elements, you still love the movie, due to the presentations, speeches, and indeed throughout the treatment. Hats Off to Suraj .. The film that interaction leads to love. The image changes to the way of thinking, behaving, as soon as you have been doing very well. Director definitely gave it a lot of thought and actors made it perfection.Though film slowly, you do not mind, because you get a view so strongly associated with the history that you just want to continue to watch the joy of it again a couple of busy. As a typical Rajshree material, it has a lot of sentimental scenes that are very likely to make the audience burst into tears (especially for women). But if you come out of the cinema, you are very satisfied and feel that the ticket costs :-).
