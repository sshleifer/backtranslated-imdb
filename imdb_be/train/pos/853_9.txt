«The Matador» stars Pierce Brosnan as a burned killer. He went to James Bond in the seed, too hard, flashy clothes, gold chains and ugly hair. Our fights killer Julian Noble, in Mexico, trying to regain his composure. Stay at this lovely, down on his luck businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), he is also trying to regain its balance. Danny desperately trying to close the deal and get back to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with the good news. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright suddenly become friends. Wright urges Noble reveal some techniques he demonstrates to the bullfight. Noble ultimately aimed at his employer and shows in Denver. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Richard Shepard made a Q & A after this wonderful film at a film festival in Austin. Shepard is also down to its success. After suffering the loss of his agent, and the rejection of the recent scenarios, he decided to write a story, no one will buy and create a character, no one would want to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan restores its balance in this film. (Is there life after Bond!) It has a great instinct of self-deprecating comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay at the closing credits, to read what the filmmakers talk about the bullfight. I look forward to more projects of Richard Shepard.
