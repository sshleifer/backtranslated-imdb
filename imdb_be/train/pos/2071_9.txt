Cool Hood meets a small town sheriff and All-hell begins, but the nuts and bolts of the film to excite the car nut in all of us. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Casablanca, and not great literature, but it's a serious film about cars, a riot, and the genius that Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is and for what will Martin.
