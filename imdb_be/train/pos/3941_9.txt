Young Mr. Lincoln says the first film director / star collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember years ago, Fonda said that as a young actor, he was understandably nervous to play Abraham Lincoln and scared that he would not live up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford before the start of shooting to put him at ease by saying that he will not play Great Liberator, but prairie lawyer Jack-tion. This is solved Fonda cast headed by John Ford directed in the classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not a biopic Lincoln. It came earlier in the sound era with Walter Huston, and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey made the game winning the Pulitzer Prize, Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Messi is still the ultimate Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But, Ford said, the Fonda played Big liberator only a small town lawyer in Illinois. The film includes about 10 years of the early life of Abraham Lincoln. We see him in the office of the general store employee to get some legal books of immigrant pioneer family whose path he will cross again later in history. And his affair with Ann Rutledge with her early death, leaving Lincoln most melancholy creature. <br /> <br /> Fast forward about 10 years, and Lincoln is currently a practicing lawyer starts to get notified. He served several terms in the legislature, but he returned to private practice is not quite sure if the policy for it. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the action takes place. The two sons of the family, he was a law-book way back, when he was accused of murder. It offers, in order to protect them. And not just any murder, but one of the deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> In the course of fiction, but Gambit used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who played two sons based on a real case, Lincoln defended. I will not say more. <br /> <br /> In addition to performances, a large force of Young Mr. Lincoln the way John Ford captures the mood and atmosphere, and the installation of a small town in Illinois prairie in celebration of the fourth of July. It's almost like you're watching a newsreel. And the mood of the country itself, a young, energetic and growing. <br /> <br /> Supporters of John Ford's movies will recognize the two musical themes here that recur in later films. During a romantic interlude at the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore, who played Ann Rutledge music in the background, it is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And in dance, melody Excellent Susan Brown, who Fonda and Marjorie Weaver, who plays Mary Todd same one Fonda danced with Katie Downs to in My Darling Clementine in a dance to raise a church in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will always be a favorite subject of biographers and playwrights for two reasons, I think. First, he is the living embodiment of our own American mythology of the people who rise from the bottom to the top of the power through their own efforts. In fact, Mr. Young Lincoln very clearly shows the background Lincoln came. And secondly, the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history, and what he has done only good and moral decision to free the slaves during the Civil War, although some of the necessary political reasons. His murder has assured his place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition Fonda and others that I have mentioned particular praise must also go Color Fred, Jr. and Ward Bond, two city boors, color is the victim of the murder and Bond's chief prosecutor. Also Donald Meek as a prosecutor and Alice Brady in what turned out to be her last film as a pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice performance Spencer Charter, which specializes in the village characters as judges. <br /> <br /> For a film that captures the drama and romance of the time it is installed, you can not do better than Young Mr. Lincoln.
