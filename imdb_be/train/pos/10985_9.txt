I was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - a lot of parts GRAY garden is very funny and incredibly surreal - a documentary is not present, it does give Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the Doom city draws. I continued to focus on how these women (who are clinically well beyond eccentric) show their own humanity very strange way, and whether their retreat from the world wonder was caused by something of the stuffiness of life in an unreal blue-blood of the universe may some abuse, or perhaps just a string of disobedience and rebellion, went out of their control and took on its own. It may be one of the greatest ever movie that is coming dangerously close to the operation, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies doing their job, I continued to note such things as an empty bottle of gin in the rubble-strewn bedrooms, cats urinating on bed, raccoons, coming out of the holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly boring - like a child's birthday completely wrong. Very definitely worth a look, and search - you will never forget, but very disturbing.
