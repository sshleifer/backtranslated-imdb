Everything was better in the last few days. Even children's shows. And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily. At the time of writing this commentary I am fourteen years old, but even as a teenager, I can not resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who are really living under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock horde of playful and goofy creatures called Fraggles, living-odd in the rock. But they are not the only creatures. Rock is populated by many other species, such as the industrious Doozers and innumerable living plants. Beyond the rocks on one side of the living inventor scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later befriends Gobo Fraggle), on the other side of the family Gorgs-supposed leaders of the universe. Five basic Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (Arty and peaceful), Wembley (indecisive and each gobo), Boober (pessimistic inner god) and red (love anything to do with sports and general feistyness) get caught up in some strange situations, each episode at the same time to sing and dance their cares away. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock, definitely a family show graphics can have complex parts that children can not stick well, but song and dance, will keep their attention. The characters are strong and pleasant, their conflicts believable and Adventure Island. In Gorgs frightening, Doc and Sprocket instructive, Uncle Traveling Matt oars (segments 80y cards very!) And the final episode, Change of Address, really touching. Let's go down to Fraggle Rock again!
