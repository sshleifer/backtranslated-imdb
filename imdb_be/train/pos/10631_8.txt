This film was seen with his wife when she came to us was the discovery in 1978. In fact, we thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couples who have ever been married and had children. Obviously, we were wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect, and perhaps do not want to. But we both agreed that love anyway. <br /> <br /> And no, he never changed our sexual orientation. This kind of thing for Christian cranks. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we both had affairs, but never with the opposite sex. As we age, we stopped having extramarital affairs. <br /> <br /> This story is not far-fetched. However, the assumption that they were heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me. My wife and I slept together over the last 40 years. We're still gay. End of story.
