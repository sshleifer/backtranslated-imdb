Before regular comments, my main curiosity THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG that while there time work, published at IMDb 94 minutes, DVD from Wellspring Media in the United States runs 88 minutes. Any input on this is much appreciated! <br /> <br /> Two friends with a very unequal lives take on the adventurous road. What they wind in just the one accidental shooting of the girl and the two escape on foot in the countryside. Instead of just a big chase, the film is quite complicated and abnormal child Spike behaves inappropriately, and clutched his boombox, like a teddy bear. Some viewers may not love story based solely on the character of Spike, but without a bit of a disappointment added to the story, the film would be too easy. You will notice how more sustainable Heaton refers to Spike as "a great man", unlike Spike "child out of control 'attitude and behavior. To be honest, I also deteriorated ridiculous actions of Spike, especially spray can smell, but in a desperate situation, it is obviously one of his mentality to choose a temporary escape. But Heaton was there to keep things in check up until things get way over his head as well. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan, like Heaton is a miracle, and after a while I stopped to wonder why the hell did he want to pick up Spike from prison and continue the friendship, because of a great performance in Glenaan . In the end, there are many many reasons, during their start-up, it would be a good idea to simply destroy Heaton Spike and try to save himself. I believe Heaton felt protective older brother Spike, and loyalty between them is hard to break - until the situation is too desperate <br /> <br /> While some of cinema really frilly, he makes an offer. more flavor to the story, and not just take pictures of people who are going through the desert. Beautiful scenery, rain, gray skies and a huge offer a gloomy tone, which increases the sense of tragic circumstances. Price is unusual, as well as the use of Public Image Ltd. songs «This Is Not A Love Song» and as the name of the movie smart enough. <br /> <br /> In general, it is understandable if you do not care for is not love songs, as it focused on two opposite personalities running away from the other person's particular hunt them (by a cool, quiet David Bradley). This is not a big-budget action entertainment. For the rest of us who are looking for something minimal and dramatic, it is worth the time spent, and it offers some very tense moments that you hold your breath a little. <br /> <br /> I'm really enjoying the movies coming out of Scotland in recent years, with like this, Dog Soldiers, and a tattoo of the devil. I'm also a little grateful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, since the emphasis is sometimes at lightning speed and it is difficult for some viewers like me to understand. <br /> <br /> care, dark, and often stressful, IT IS NOT LOVE SONG very tragic yet exciting speaking. <br /> <br />
