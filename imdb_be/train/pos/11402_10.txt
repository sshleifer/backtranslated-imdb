I saw "American in Paris" in its first edition, when I was still in high school and fell in love with it moving straight ahead. I went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of how many times I've seen him since, like in the movies and on television. This makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs of the greatest popular composers of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and has the highest male (Gene Kelly) and a woman (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. The supporting cast Oscar Levant (as nimble as ever), Georges Guethary (for some reason it does not make more films?) And Foch (brilliant in unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. The final ballet, magnificently staged in the name of music, makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris and images of Impressionist and Post-Impressionists. All songs by Gershwin well organized, but the most memorable is "It's very clear» (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and «I Got Rhythm» (children Paris attached Gene Kelly in «Une Chanson AMERICAINE»), If you love Paris, see this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life to see it. But to see it!
