Casting Jack Cassidy, Ken Yefim was just shine. Cassidy personalized arrogance, confidence, charm and intelligence - all with an indulgent, evil little grin on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy, certainly the best killer (appearing three times) in the Columbo series. This is especially (and first) performance, my favorite episode of Columbo ever - hands down. Fresh faced Steven Spielberg did an amazing camera work (yes, there were a few shades of cameras on the actors at times), capturing the nuances and banter on different and interesting angles between Columbia and Franklin. In addition, panoramic and close in shots in Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin cabin house) were very impressive <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the episode, then you owe it to yourself to do so. - it is a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was very contagious. His death in 1976, aged 49 years old was really bored and really tragic - of course he had his best years ahead of him. Rest in Jack's world, you will live forever through your great work.
