This short trailer of the film is basically about Superman and Batman work together and forming difficult alliance.obviously, two characters have significantly different views on how to deal with the crime and that is punishment.it a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along.i INT will not go to the storyline here.but I get into the action that terrific.everyone well cast.the two actors playing Superman and Batman are well suited for their characters.the the filmmakers that made Batman: Dead End Grayson also this short fi lm.of three, I probably liked the least, but I still thought it was good done.for me, a better world is 7/10
