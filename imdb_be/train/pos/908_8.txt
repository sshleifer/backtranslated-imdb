I can not believe that at the moment the film is designed for 6.9. Anyway, this film was probably one of the most touching real Indian films I have ever seen. It was really nice to see a movie that featured a traditional family theater. As for the story, which I thought was great it was about Shahid Kapoor is set to be an arranged marriage with Amrita Rao. He is a kind of light-hearted kind of guy, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl, very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem, it forges, it seems, do not get as much attention as she does so, her aunt does not like Amrita enthusiastically. Amrita cares, because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was very touching to see that, while Amrita family was not as wealthy, perhaps, only the middle class the lower class, while the family of martyrs was rather upper class, they still belonged to his family with respect and did not even ask to put them down, that really hit a nerve with me. This is because I actually saw people being very rude to people who are not so well thought them below their standards, I feel very small. This film shows that Shaheed family was ready to look at the importance that Amrita and brought out a blind eye to the fact that it was not a rich business tycoons daughter or something. Overall, this film deserved 8/10 I want more and more of this kind of films have been made.
