I watched The Lion King several times that all of my friends put togther. Having a sister .. you know how it is. To date, I remember how the plot and line. After the lion king 2 came out I was like okay well let me see ... the second was much weaker ... then I saw an ad for Lion King 1 1/2 ... and I was like well there we are again, after viewing 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (for repetitevness) were broken. Really great and original storyline keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time. I noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comic moments, which will be applied ROFLMAO here 100%. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend looking cartoon.
