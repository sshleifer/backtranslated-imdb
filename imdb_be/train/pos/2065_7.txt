Fearing Symmetry pleasant episode with multiple faults. The first thing about this episode that it occurs near Mountain Home Air Force Base, in southwestern Idaho. The first season of "Deep Throat" occurs near the airbase Ellens, as well as in southwestern Idaho. I'm wondering if air bases are the same, but they decided to use a real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, zoo keeper, reminds me of a whimsical, old school teachers. They must have liked the children at one time, you just can not imagine how. Just as he had to care more for animals at one point. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt that it was a few inconsistencies. If the aliens so expertly kidnapped people and return them safely, why can not they put the animal back in the right place? And foreigners are only now there are problems that have returned the animal? I do not buy Mulder's theories about the problem with the space-time continuum. As if he is an expert on the subject. I also thought that the performance of both Jane Atkinson Willa Ambrose was not well done. In addition to these nitpicks, I still use this episode to the intriguing concept of aliens on collecting DNA animals as well as human DNA.
