Here Italy (I am writing from Venice). Why cancelated? ABC had to give him a chance to build an audience. Toss (w / Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Moynahan) is one of the best that I've seen lately. We need more shows like this makes the audience feel that they are smart people, not mindless drones. I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or the other station will pick it up.
