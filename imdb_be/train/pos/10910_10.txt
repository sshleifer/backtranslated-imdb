The most recommended masterpiece, not only for the main themes of the story, but for unmatchably brilliant and witty painting by Angelopoulos, not to mention the current giants Mastroianni and Moreau, and excellent game character by Ilyas Logothethis. Gregory Carr statement may seem overshadowed by his "hard" partners in the first position, but in fact it is perfectly plays his character, which is revealed in his last scene with the girl (Khrysikou) and human (Mastroianni), although it hinted in advance. (Thus, a spoiler.) <br /> <br /> Get your expectations right! This "art cinema" in what would be the meaning of this phrase has to offer, and demands attention. Not for recreation, but to view the artwork at the desired concentration as when reading a book or a concert. Because of the overall photographic style, recommended a large projection screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogues used sparingly. But the film includes -in addition to the standard Greek and English speaking- fragments spoken in Albanian, Kurdish and Turkish languages, which will be attractive to those who are fascinated by the beauty of hearing in different languages.
