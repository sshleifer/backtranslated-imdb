Father honor pleasant surprise: It's funny, witty and has a wonderful voice acting. Show of the Lion family, which acts as attracting Siegfried & Roy show. Indeed all of these are stereotypes, but that's what makes them so funny. FOTP Sun children's cartoon includes some crude humor for adults, but in a very gentle way. It is full of references popculture and celebrity cameos, and most of them are very well executed. I would say that I will give the show seven out of ten, because it is good well enough executed but not very original, I saw most of those patterns over and over again, even in the order!
