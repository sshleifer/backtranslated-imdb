I read the book, and I must say that this film remains true to form. I think this is the beginning of the psychological thriller Psycho in the same genre. Christina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead, and Burgess Meredith gives a fine actor as a neighbor. I saw this movie at least twice, and I think I'm going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection. Pausing just continues to build until the end of the climate, twist, you'll never see coming. If you like films like Signs and The Village, is worth the classic prelude. In addition, the interesting thing is that the actors in the movie, you would not recognize them if you have not read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach as big as a commercial director and Jeff Goldblum well as a photographer. There is also a Beverly D'Angelo, who is undervalued, but great.
