First of all, speaking as not a supporter of the genre, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is exciting, virtuoso, a great action movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is silly cartoon superhero malarky of things. <, Br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is complex, an important point about crime fighters become criminals themselves. No reference is made in the Abu Ghraib prison or the outrageous domestic assaults of the executive branch of the constitutional law, none is required. <br /> <br /> Thus, the last in a series of "Born" in the hands of Paul Greengrass (2004, "The Bourne Supremacy" and "United 93" last year), is a significant achievement, perhaps constrained, but actually has not decreased due to the inevitable excesses of the genre <br /> <br /> Â«Exciting" above is meant as a free and adjectives and descriptions of physical sensations:. more than an hour's drive from the first frame, the audience seemed to hold its breath, pushed back in his chair inexorable force, globe trot, very disturbing effect. There's no suspension, no change in the rhythm and attraction of the film, and yet it never becomes monotonous and tedious as some related music videos do after just a couple of minutes. <br /> <br /> Oliver Wood vhodova your face, cinematography makes the best of scenarios, Tony Gilroy between 1990 Ludlum novel (which is not summed up well against "the Bourne Identity," written ten years ago). <br /> <br /> Matt Damon once again, inevitably, the Bourne irreplaceable, deadly fantasy CIA agents, this time taking over the agency in search of his identity, his past, and so on mysterious agency program that turned him into a killing machine. Nothing like it quietly heroic Edward R. Murrow, Strathairn always-amazing entirely reverse senior official agencies besieged Born in an attempt to hide some illegal "takes no prisoners" policy and stringent procedures. <br /> <br /> Joan Allen plays what seems to be Good CPC vs. Bad One Strathairn in is Julia Stiles as an agent again coming to the aid of Born;. a combination of direction and Greengrass Stiles operating results in a strange influence on the main dumb character, its lack of communication and a puzzled expression more intriguing than E Dialogue. <br /> <br /> So well, "The Bourne Ultimatum" that he leaves the old one person-bit anti-world, this time extended to the ridiculous excesses, as Bourne defies geography constraints, time, gravity. . .. and physics as a whole (see if you can fly back to the car from the top of a building Why not -. it looks great) <br /> <br /> All of this "real world" magic - jumping from country to country seconds to arrive at some unknown place exactly how, when, and how to - ahead of a special effect and a superhero cartoon Mau improbability. And yet, only an ignorant pedant would "facts" interfere with entertainment based on ecstasy Born fantasy.
