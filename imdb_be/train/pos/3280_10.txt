I've only ever seen it once before, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago, and after watching, I think it's even better than I remembered it to be. <br /> <br /> PaperHOUSE much more than just a horror. It was such an amazing level of emotion and a great characteristic that runs through it. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really great here. It is such a pity that she had done nothing else, it was a beautiful actress as a whole. Her portrayal of emotions throughout the film was quite just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across, especially at the end, when she realized that, although he died, Mark, she knew that he would be fine. <br /> <br /> Some scenes made me jump (which is rare for me in modern horror films), especially the scene in the bathroom, the scene where Anne's father chased her with an awesome radio in the background and the bit where the legs come off from each and other scattered dust. <br /> <br /> In general, excellent and very moving film.
