I have never participated in a midnight screening of the film, before the "Dick Tracy" was released. <br /> <br /> I'm still "t-shirt card" I had to wear for admission to the show around here somewhere and, like this shirt, "Dick Tracy" stuck with me ever since. <br /> <br /> If you saw the movie, sharp visuals, bright primary colors and strong characters we have no doubt, have been engraved in your brain. It is a wonder to behold. <br /> <br /> As a director / star / co-author / producer, Beatty knows what works in the movies and shows are taking the usual American icon and restore it as a whole new era. Nevertheless established in the 30s, "Tracy" has a kind of timeless quality, like all good films do. I lost many times I watched "Tracy," and I still have to catch something new every time I. <br /> <br /> The rest are at the highest level, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (as a reminder of what he can do comedy with the best of them), even Madonna Breathless Mahoney is relevation that when the right environment, it can act (gasp!). <br /> <br /> But there are topics such as the need for affected families, faithful to himself, good and evil, even Machiavelli topics studied. Odd for a comic book movie, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> In general, the "Dick Tracy" is a classic for himself. Compared with other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. This is a good, strong film, which is independent from the blood, violence, foul language or nudity, to make his point. <br /> <br /> There's a lesson here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
