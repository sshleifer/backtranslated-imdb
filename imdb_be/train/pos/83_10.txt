A few years ago I commented on IMDB «The Real McCoys» TV series. Then I said, and I repeat now it was charming, funny and entertaining show, performed well with excellent characteristics. <br /> <br /> Recently, I saw on DVD four old episodes PLUS Reunion 2000 tilt Cathy Nolan, Tony Martinez. As another writer mentioned here, it is interesting that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Bow) is not refered, but maybe they can be found through the SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The reunion show was well done and gave us a lot of unknown insights into the show. One part of the inside information we got was sorry Do not throw Cathy Nolan shows in unpleasant contract dispute that left Luca "widow" in it in the last year, which was not very good. Nolan continued to do comedy bomb called "volley" of women nurses in the Pacific in World War II. Get it? Volley? No, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike running, obscene and violent TRASH on TV now, so undermining our values, «The Real McCoys" entertained decent value and excellent human beings. And I thank all the participants, including the author, Irving Pincus, for what brought him to my family. We never missed.
