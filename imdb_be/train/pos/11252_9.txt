This is my second time through for A Perfect Spy. I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it. I like it so far. It is natural that it gets compared to other large series in the Beeb Le Kare "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on the "game" to play spies; Perfect Spy gives us another now - what kind of person is a spy. There are a number of themes that these films share, along with others in the genre <br /> <br /> The ambiguity -. Moral, sexual, interpersonal - that creates a multi-dimensional space accurately against false inside VS. outside, love against liability. In a sense, these characters are happiest when they are treated most shabbily those whom they love and respect -. «Backstabbed» in its various nuances <br /> <br /> The theme of parents and parents-actors is also important, one of the most intriguing characters in A Perfect Spy Rick may substitute the father of the protagonist Magnus. Throughout history, he betrays and favors. Rogue, who always manages to climb back up the stairs, when he was overthrown, which seems to be immune to what others think about him, asked Magnus whenever they meet, "Do you love your old?" And never " Do not you love me? "Maybe it says it's somewhere else, but A Perfect Spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> another theme is that malignant. the nature of the business to turn the other - turn them against their own government, against their friends and associates to turn them against their own values ​​and convincingly Nij. In each of the films in Le Kare "I have seen, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Looking Glass War, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, People mercy and A Perfect Spy, turn and becomes the basis for the tragedy. <br /> <br /> And finally, not so much a theme in artistic style - in each of these films usually only have one shot gun, or maybe two shots bookending history of violence, torture, cruelty, always under the surface we see their results are not as streams.. blood or damp prison cells, but in the character objects Le Carre "to cling to as they steadily sucked into the swamp. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the aforementioned films, and you enjoy A Perfect Spy, you are in for a treat. I also recommend a series Sandbagger (Yorkshire TV), 2nd and 3rd seasons which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity. Ipcress File and burial in Berlin good, although light weight. For political intrigue to try very British coup, House of Cards and The Minister / Yes Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only Brit to set his hand to make the Three Kingdoms - it would be a film with intrigue and complexity.
