OK - how are 2 versions of this film. There were 2 people involved in the making - John Corti and Bill Couterie (George was just a producer - he really does not have any say so in the film - just help) - the most "adult" version of the Bill was made possible Couterie. John Corti does not like or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). Due Ladd films are going under, they did not advertise the film and threw all their advertising money for «The Right Stuff», hoping that he will pull them through; ... and it's not. Thus, this film never had a chance. If the "Double" has made this cable (HBO) - they showed a reel version of the Bill and John threatened to sue if it was shown to be more (you'll notice the "adult" version is not very long?). Showtime received a "clean" version. Version of the videotape and laser disc version approved by John (who has more power than the Bill). It is a pity, really, as the "adult" version is actually better and makes more sense. But it is very doubtful that he will never be released in this version on DVD (or any other contraband short format). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all of this information, as I used to be president twice Upon A Time Fan Club (still many items from the movie - used to have a letter-boxed version of the "adult" version, but it was stolen - only have partial HBO copy now). 8 stars to the "adult" version - 5 to a "pure" version. Any other questions, just ask.
