I'm a big fan of the classic movie, but I'm just getting in silent films. Many silent movies did not hold my attention, but to show people, it is a notable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines just fine in this picture. Davis, in particular, shows a wide range, as it is transformed from a small town girl giggling at the star that takes itself a little too seriously. <br /> <br /> show people fast paced film with a fantastic set of Kama some of the biggest stars of silent. The film captured my attention immediately, and I actually forgot that it was a silent film. (I know that does not make much sense, but that is what happened.) The actors are so adept at his craft that several dialogues need maps. <br /> <br /> Show people is a great introduction to silent films. This fast-paced, entertaining film with two of the best stars in the silent. Add satire of Hollywood and show people must be in the list of "must see" for all lovers of classic cinema.
