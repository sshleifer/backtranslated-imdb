If you like Cleese & all the humor of the British «Pythonesque» time, this little gem is absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe real treat! <br /> <br /> I've seen it with your friends on TV when it first came out, and formed part of our jokes of his classic quotes for 30 years, and will do forever! I have it on tape, and she always appreciated. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some commentators take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that at the moment only available in the US (NTSC of course), but not in the UK, where it should be an integral part of the history of British humor !!
