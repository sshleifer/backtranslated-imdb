I really liked this movie. Kurt manages to act without speaking, giving the points speak for themselves. It should not be wordy or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action. It is supported by a good cast of actors and settings, and can show us a more humane side of the soldiers, not getting to the saccharine.
