It is depressing to see where Jackie Chan ended. He used to be an irresistible hurricane strikes hands, feet and incredible stunts. To be fair, he is now in his fifties, and one would expect some slowdown. But with "Rush Hour 3", where he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker (of all people!) And then there's the «Kung Fu Panda», where he not only in the purely vocal role, but his character has almost no dialogue. .. say that Jackie Chan has seen better days, a colossal understatement. <br /> <br /> this time like this, when the only solution is to jump dusty old videotape and watch Jackie kick ass in his younger, fitter, Chris Tucker free days. <br /> <br /> Enter 'Police Story'. Jackie Chan plays Kar-Kui, a police officer, whose task is to protect the witness to a major trial. He faces resistance from both UNCO-operative witnesses and many killers, sent the crowd to silence them both. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, who cares? We do not watch Jackie Chan movies for the story. We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform amazing tricks and even punch and kick the whole lot of people who are less surprising than it is. <br /> <br /> And at this level, "Police Story" does not disappoint at all. There is a huge showdown at the mall at the end of which ends in a giant slide Jackie high voltage mirror. Seriously, if this kind of thing happened often, not a man will never need to persuade, to go shopping for clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also a comedy, most of which include Kar-Kui inadvertently frustrate May (Maggie Cheung) and his ever-suffering, apparently never just a friend. Humor as a whole rather unsubtle, but it works, so I do not complain. <br /> <br /> action is not too thin either. In fact, I'm not sure that there was something subtle about the "History of the police" at all. The director Jackie Chan (yes, he does it too), it is obvious It has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and he knows that while we are waiting for the next battle to start, the last thing we want to look for nuance and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> Thus, the "Police story" is a blast. As is the case with most of his films, the fact that Jackie is actually doing things that you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan really depends on speeding bus umbrella brand new "Wow" factor is added to the action.
