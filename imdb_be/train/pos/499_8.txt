Pilot Enterprise has one thing that was missing from the original Star Trek: Dose realistic, imperfect people. Utopians new generation of characters got tiring, they were so generous to be incredible. I also like the south of the story, that people are bitter towards the Vulcans. Its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs. It makes me looking forward to, when people have become the dominant race between them, although I do not think it will work within the time frame of the show. The only negatives that jumped at me was "quickly cut off the end of 2 hours' feeling of the end, which is common among many of the Trek shows. The second was a shameless digging for evaluation pair stupidly sex scenes. It was ridiculous, good science fiction show must be able to stand on its own, not trying to inflate the pre-teen audience with some skin. But it's not my job to make the show profitable, so oh well. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode does.
