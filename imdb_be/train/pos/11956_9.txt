I would say, some shades of Hitchcock's ... it's clearly better than the MMM, which is seen as guilty pleasure to some, if not most, Woody fans. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was first conceived as a murder mystery? Anyway, Woody relieve some relationship in the movie comedy with this. The plot twists and turns nice and tight. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some of the actors a little rushed to deliver their lines, but to stay. Scarlett Johansson is well cast in the role of Diane Keaton type, and there is never any awkward moments between her and much older than Woody. No one could not imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lim than Jackman.
