This movie was great and I would like to buy it.The boy goes with his grandfather, the young eagle to catch. boy must feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops. boy saves eagle from death and runs away from the eagle tribe.The helps feed him, catching a duck pond with a small boy to scare. Later, the boy shoots a deer, that bully child claimed, because their arrows were marked very closely the same. Just as long as they do not check the thickness of the red lines they determine who actually got deer. But it was unsuccessful because he did the other boys, even cruel to him, and he finally chased up on the rocks, but if you think he will fall off his pure love for eagle makes it a golden eagle with only kings as a reminder of who he was.Please, if anyone knows where I can buy this film let me know have not seen him for more than 30 years, but I still remember the details of movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
