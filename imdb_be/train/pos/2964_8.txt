BASEketball is a very funny film that delivers acting that makes the film a whole lot funnier comedy material, which is more than the crap in your pants funny, and a very good story, despite the fact that his classic loafers against the evil rich guy.The one and only thing I did not like about BASEketball, was that the child was not actually needed in the film, but if the child were not in the movie, some of the funniest scenes would not have existed.If you read any Reviews of the movie, to exclude all of them, because basically all reviewers I did not like it film.BASEketball is great comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 10.
