Occasionally I see a movie that I completely absorbed; this was one of them. It was a good acting, the dialogue, the story and the scenery was beautiful. I laughed many times, especially business scene with a touch of the kitchen. Slapstick comedy performed fool laborer I have one floor, but I admit that I'm a sucker for a farce. History had to deal with a group of people in their 30s who returns to the summer camp, which they visited 20 years ago. It was a farewell week of camping, a place will be permanently closed at the end of the season. As adult camp looked different, and they felt differently about it and with each other. I recommend this funny, moving film everything. <br /> <br />
