What can I say about the first movie ever? <br /> <br /> You can not assess it because it does not have to be interested. But if you have to evaluate it, you should give it a 10. It's amazing to see the moving images with the year 1895. It was one of the most important films in the history. I wonder how it must have been one of those who saw the first movie ever! <br /> <br />
