Well, this film probably deserves a 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for the "10" in order to help compensate for the wrong rating handful profane, who gave the film zero or 1 star views. Each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and prospects for talented filmmakers ... three of which went on to achieve considerable success in the big time Hollywood productions. Representation vary from rough until completely impressive, with notable turns by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Cove can be a great melodramatic as psychotic hypnotist with Bizarro strobe lamp, and peak in August, it seems, deliberately close to both unsuspecting victim laboratory. But in general, it does have some great laughs and some really scary moments. Definitely worth a look, so judge for yourself!
