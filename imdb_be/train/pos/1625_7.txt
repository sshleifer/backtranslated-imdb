Surprisingly good movie! He has quite a few good jokes through with the film. The only negative aspect is that some of the scenes are going to extremes to show how stupid the two main characters. We get it, dumb blonde, finished with it! <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit dodge called "corny." And boobies always a plus Altho movie for some strange reason does not play this card very Tho storyline introduces two black haired women, who behave like evil counter parts our two blondes. <br /> <br /> So all in all, a good movie to watch. I almost gave it 8/10, but let's not get crazy.
