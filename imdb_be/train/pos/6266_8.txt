This picture for me to count very high, so it is very nice and funny parody of alien invaders taking over the city, and many of his male folk. <br /> <br /> The town and ballplayers Dressed in-kind 1950s style and the whole movie is intentionally tacky and vulgar to him. Some scenes are funny, like the birth of the alien creatures. <br /> <br /> All the actors give full and serious performance that makes the film even funnier and special effects and aliens, at least, I think I deliberately third year, to add to the fun <br /> <br /> These types of films are often worthy of worship :. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
