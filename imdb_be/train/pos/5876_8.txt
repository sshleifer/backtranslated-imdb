Now, I really liked this movie, it was so funny.Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham is a brilliant actor, I think that after watching the film, they have to make many more films together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble, familiarity 3 women at the same time, but how he handles that when one goes out the door, and then the second was just so funny to see that he acted very well INT his film and I hope that he makes a great comedy like this one in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role very well, and he's so underrated, I am pleased that some of his amazing work got noticed but it is a really good actor, I just love John Hex Dupiya has a small role in this m film, and plays well. <br /> <br /> The Muse is very good, I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
