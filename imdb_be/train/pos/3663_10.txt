Perhaps the last film would be expected to come from De Sica and Davattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). This neo-realist fantasy, a kind of an oxymoron, really. Woman finds a baby in her cabbage and raises him as his own son. A few years later, the child is a boy (named Toto) and adoptive mother dies. He goes to the children's home, and when he finally turns 18, he leaves. Immediately, he felt that he had no home. Toto optimism, although not allow anything to get it. Man steals bag, and instead of being angry at him, Toto became his friend and goes and stays with him in a small slum. Toto takes some initiative and organize a lot of homeless people who live in the area, and they are building a better slums. Soon, the landlord is trying to sell this piece of land and slum-dwellers have to protect yourself. After many attempts, the owner installs the police force to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a full-fledged fantasy (he was a comedy / romance fiction in the style of Charlie Chaplin). This material is so strange and shocking, it's probably better for others to see it for yourself. It is quite strange and very funny. Any objections can be raised about the plot Miracle in Milan, definitely. Fellini and Visconti were heavily criticized when they started to move away from neorealism. I think I read it was widely criticized at the time of its release. At this point, however, it is so nice - I liked it very much. This may be my favorite films of De Sica, although Umberto D and Bicycle Thieves come very, very close. 10/10.
