Gone in 60 seconds very good action comedy film, which amounted to more than $ 100 million, but was blown up by most critics. I personally thought it was a great film. The story was plausible and has probobly the largest cast ever for this type of film including 3 Academy Awards Nicolas Cage, Robert Duvall and very hot anjolina Jolie. except a lame trick in the end, it's the perfect blend of comedy and drama activities. my assessment is **** (with ****)
