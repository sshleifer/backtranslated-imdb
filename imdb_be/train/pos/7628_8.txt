This film is one of those «WOW!» Films. Not because it is the biggest film of all time, but because I was surprised. Not only that, it is a film tanker, but it was Elvis. I can say with certainty how many imitators as there is only one Elvis, but I can say with confidence that Kurt Russell had come very close to the real thing. It was one of the biggest transformations I've ever seen. He made me believe it was really him. I do a lot about the life of Elvis learned from watching this movie. And failed TV portion of this will allow you to stray, it's actually a really fantastic film! And Kurt Russell might have been the twin of Elvis :)
