I've never seen a silent movie up to July 24, 2005 I have never seen a film with Mary Pickford in it. I have seen thousands of movies. Few of them are sleeping pills to me. I found the last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta), to be sleeping pills, so consider the source, as you read this. I began to look at Tessa storm is therefore strange to see who is the Mary Pickford, who attributes a lot to run Hollywood. I had no idea what I was in for. Two hours later, I was cut off from him, and I realized that I was watching one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, playing the role is perfect for her. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, they have never seen anyone that beautiful and clear before. You will have to see again and again. It is ideally suited for a girl, which is clear. It was a poor squatter, he could not speak the King in English, but you had to admire it. What movie ... time to start your movie collection Mary Pickford!
