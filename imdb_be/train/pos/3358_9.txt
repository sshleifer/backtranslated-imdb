First of all, for this film, I just one word: "Wow." This is probably one of the best films that affected me, from its history to its performance, so wonderfully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed by the latter, because he really brought a depth of character as it was a very difficult role. However, two of them formed a couple that did not surprise me, from the beginning to the end, showing the way of friendship filled with love that develops throughout the day, settled in the film. History takes some time to collapse, as the introduction of characters for a long time, but in the end we will be compensated with a wonderful story of love and humanity. If you have a chance to see it, because it's a film that will stay in your mind for a long time. It's amazing - 9/10.
