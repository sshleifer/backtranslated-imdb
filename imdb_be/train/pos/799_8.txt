He is the quintessential narcissist and the manipulator; in this case, drawing a lawyer (and killer) Tom drips. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Morris responsive as the victim, Ann Marie Fahey, but in the beginning it's a bit too much sacrifice. We regret the situation, but at the same time become a disgusting after watching his victimization of several other women (including Rachel Ward), as well. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is, where it is to actually get help with her self-esteem issues and dripping was actually killed her psychologist. Pretty hard to believe, but it was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> There is a cameo with Olympia Dukakis (excellent), as a mother dripped in. In general, an interesting story, because it is based on true murder, and you want to read a book Ann Rule, to get accurate data. 8/10.
