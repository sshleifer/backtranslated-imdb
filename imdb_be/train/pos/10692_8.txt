Well, funny, simple plot, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like a movie, it is). It was a good "car" for someone adept at comedy and drama, as there are elements of both. Romantic comedy, wrapped around two crime stories, great closing lines. Chaplin, very well here, was also good in another good, but unpopular romantic comedy ( "The Truth About Cats & Dogs"). Maybe they are too far-fetched. Ebert did not even leave a review for it. More "eccentric" comedy, obviously, were completely implausible ( "Raising Baby ~ d", etc.). If you've seen one incredible comedy, you've seen them all? Or, maybe, people are willing to move from the 1930s. Weird. Birthday girl I enjoyed this movie more than once. Nicole Kidman may be a "killer app" for home video.
