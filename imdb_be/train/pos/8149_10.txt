I first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it's still funny. I do not know if you need to understand HipHop in the 90s, but it helps if you do. In the 90s, when the NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal conflicts within groups and members, if they are separated by the path (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). Would also Wanna, available rapper, who are beginning to make a scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams of C & C Music Factory, and so on). This film ridicules all this in such a way that it seems as if it is actually a documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays the interviewer, who spent a year in the life of the fictional name of a rap group N.W.H. Members of the group are the Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / director), delicious taste (Larry B Scott / Revenge of the Nerds, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are up and coming rap group whose policy makes them controversial. What's good about it the film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of hip-hop industry in the 80s, and they were as he mocks him. But if you know, 80/90 rap, you know how much of this material is accurate. however, on its own, entirely hip-hop know, it's still funny funny movie. and is not the first you to all those who ask, and Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap I think the film too. This, in my opinion, just funny, and in some ways better than Spinal Tap. As Spinal Tap is a heavy metal, is fear of a black planet Rap. and songs with a hook as well. on DVD there is chalk full of extras include music videos with NWH as a group and as solo artists. Brilliant performances Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
