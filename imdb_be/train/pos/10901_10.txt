This is probably the best documentary I've seen in a very long time. John F. Kennedy was and still is a tragically beautiful enthusiasm. He has not only survived one of the most painful diseases out there, but he had used her beauty to show the world that there is life after death, and never give up reaching the people and spreading his love. Watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching. Listening to his smart-ass remarks and seeing his favorite gesture was friendly. And seeing him smile was indescribable. I feel blessed to have been able to be affected by this tiny giant. Please, if you ever have the opportunity to watch this movie - consider yourself lucky to have met John Kennedy.
