This film brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts knew exactly how to get to the hearts of the audience, directing this beautiful picture, where life is viewed through the mind and heart of Paulie. We find, from time to time, with sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie has a heart. I just could not stop the tears, in spite of the fact that the film has a happy ending. It's great, after thousands of movies that I've seen in my life, "Field" really touched me deeply. It is, after "The Ugly Duckling", then the second picture, which really turned me upside down.
