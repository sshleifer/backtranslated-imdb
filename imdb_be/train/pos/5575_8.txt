I was not expecting much from this, but I must admit that I was rolling on the floor laughing several times during the film. If you are not severely hurt in the first ten minutes, it could be the movie for you. The same, if you are the type that will enjoy watching Amanda Peet shuffling cards for one and a half hours. This, of course, not a landmark work of comedy, but given the low-budget indie genesis is masterful. In order to level the playing field for comparison, imagine all studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of 100 or so, and see what happens! Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network to seeing it through. I look forward to his next effort.
