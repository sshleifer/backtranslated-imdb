Given that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, which made me even more anxious to check out this film. I remember that he had been questioned on the "Jay Leno" and said that he turned down the role in the big budget Adam Sandler comedy «The Longest Yard», to be in this movie. So, obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he was acting chops. I'm not going overpraise Snoop for his work in "tenants." There are, of course, the best rapper / actors like Mos Def, who could do more with his role. But the fact is, Snoop made a "good" job. He can not seem to get rid of some of his trademark gestures and vocal inflections, but it is something that even Jack Nicholson has trouble doing. The fact is that I found it convincing in the role, and the tension between him and the character of Dylan McDermott captivating. McDermott, by the way, gives a better performance in the film, although his subtle actions are likely to be overshadowed by the not so subtle actions of the detective. Being a big reader and aspiring writer myself, I could not find the characters and plot several exciting. It really aggravate me as a detective character will constantly ask McDermott read his work, and to scold him for his criticism. But you know what? I am sure that many writers like that. His character was supposed to be spoiled, as McDermott, in his own way. My only mild criticism of the film will be his end. For some reason, it just felt too rushed for me, even though the resolution is, of course, made sense and was motivated by the characters rather than the plot.
