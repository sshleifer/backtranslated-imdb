I love Korean movies, because they have the opportunity to really (Quiet awful in fact) to capture real life. I tend to watch Korean movies just for that reason alone. I've seen this movie before other directors. The one closest to the feeling I got from this Oasis and another amazing film called This charming girl. <br /> <br /> However, the name of my resume should be in terms of Chrstian, so I'll just start doing that instead of just pouring it with praise. <br /> <br /> For the Sun Christian standpoint director Chang-dong Lee grabbed an unbiased and almost uncannily real image of the modern Protestant Church (regardless of denomination), warts and all, I have always waited for the Christian film that accurately reflects the dark corners of the Church's life . Since Christian films tend to speak in a language that is different in that they want to share their faith. Many films with religious undertones, although they have good motives, as a rule, a resonance Disney film or after the special school. They need to show life as it is. Real people curse lust real people, real people fall down. And while Christians believe that salvation is available to those who seek it, we are still challenged by the daily horrors of life. And the nature of Jeong Do It is a completely honest and almost brutal way of a woman who has found God, but because of the bitter realities of life, losing that love to him she had once been. She does not deny that God exists. It's just that she refuses to live with the thought that it is just a loving and forgiving God. <br /> <br /> It decently edge of morality and madness, her character asks questions that the mind of every religious or not. <br /> <br /> «If God is love, why does He allow such terrible things to happen?" This film does not answer, that's right. And I believe that the last 10 minutes of the film, although open to interpretation, leaving us with hope for the future of our protagonist and brings the idea of ​​"the secret of the sun" full circle. <br /> <br /> I do not believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or have been in any way tried and set out to be. There's a reason why he worked even more. It's real, it's honest. And due to the fact that today is the best summation of the real Christian life, I have seen on film.
