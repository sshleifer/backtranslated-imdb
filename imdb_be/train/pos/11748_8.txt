Stumbling. I must say at first I was a bit disappointed in the first few episodes, but faith in the show, and undeniable talent Abe Forsythe, I continued to watch. I can say with confidence, now I'm glad I did. History is developed well enough, and all the characters have a strong base, and most of them do not have any information available. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I can blame it on the production is somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation had character Lizzie. <br /> <br /> Some good action in combination with a stellar story does get this show over the line. Here's to hoping for another season!
