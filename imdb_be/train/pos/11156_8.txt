I usually do not like reality shows, especially those that benefit away «American Idol» Success "s. But this is one I can live. <br /> <br /> comedians from around the world to perform a short procedure to celebrity talent scouts, and if they like them, these guys will be sent to carry out the procedure for the real audience, then ten or twelve comics chosen so as to live in a house together and make «Survivor» competition in style, using comedy tactics. Then one will be determined like «Last Comic standing». I love to be a comedy, t ak this is one reality show have sharp my interests. There are usually some pretty funny comics elected until the end. He began his career such talents as Alonzo Boddna, Rahl mine and Josh Blue. <br /> <br / > My negative criticisms are the fact that there is a likelihood that many of these comics have been selected for their contribution to the reality show drama. at first, they lived together in the house, like "Big brother", but now they are finished with it thank God. <br /> <br /> And there are many comedians I felt were chosen not only because they are funny, but because of race, ethnicity, relationship, sex, etc., when other comics have clearly struck them. But overall, it's a well-made reality show, which are not two terms until now I thought that was an oxymoron.
