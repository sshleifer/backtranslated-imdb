My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in its 22 years of life, she saw nothing but the walls of our home and her school, which also deals with other children with disabilities. I was a byword among all, because my sister is disabled, and I still think to this day, no one is, and never will not give a damn about her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew that the Christie family is experiencing. but they were lucky. Christy was able to speak, he could talk, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can not speak and can not use their hands to do anything but grab things. but this film made me realize that there are other people in the world, like my sister, and the ending (speak the truth) made me cry. And I saw Shawshank !!! This movie is seriously underestimated, and he should not. This film tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking that you can not write well? This guy wrote his foot. thinking that you are not attractive? this guy was rejected by a large number of girls, due to his condition. not the fastest runner? Christy could not even get out <br /> <br /> My point :. Parents of young children, I invite your children to watch this movie with you, so that they will know the next time they see someone on the street, in a wheelchair, they do not look at them as they are foreigners. My sister received millions of views, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This movie will teach people that people who can not seem to "normal" people, too. 10/10
