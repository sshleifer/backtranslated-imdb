Only after I saw the film, the true sense of the magic of movies Walt Disney came up in me, and I realized that I was a long time ago that I saw the "real" magic in the film. <br /> <br /> the right mix of music, speech, and magical effects brings a sense of Disney again in your body. Very special things that I've seen, where no understanding of the effects in the film, began with the Disney logo turns into Cinderella's castle and ran like an old story tells the tale with his grandparents. <br /> <br /> magic returned to me. I rate this film 8 out of 10.
