I went to this movie waiting for intricate scary movie. What I got was a fright after fright. This is a horror movie on this kernel. It's not boring like other horror movies, where the haunted house is just ghosts and gore. This film does not even show you most of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept, which is not only for houses that would haunt him the one who enters the house. They become ghosts, no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms, etc. ... After reading some external reviews I am very surprised that the critics did not like this movie. I'll see him again this week, and I am delighted with it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars because this was what a horror film should be. It scared the s ** t to me.
