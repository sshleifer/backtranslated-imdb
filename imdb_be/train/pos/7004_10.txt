Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how he does it. I read books all the time, but if you have a movie with Will Smith, I'll watch. He has the rare gift of pulling you into the film and keeps you there. This film is one of the best films I've seen so far. I watched it on a Saturday, and I still can not get it out of my head. AMAZING and sad all at the same time. Thanks again to Will. You should watch this movie from beginning to end to understand each part of the film. You can not miss a thing. Make sure that you have plenty of napkins and your man / woman sitting next to you, so that you can cuddle. WELL worth the money that you will pay to see this .. do not wait until it comes on TV.
