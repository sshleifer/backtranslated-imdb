History Ms. Patty Duke about his life and struggle with manic depression was just like my life is a struggle. I saw myself playing as well as she did. I was so struck by the similarity of our lives, to include sexual violence that we both suffered as children. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when it was first held in 1990, and I loved this movie so much. Anyone who struggles with manic depression can get so much from this movie. Nothing about when he showed her the award or that they were in favor. This is not the issue here. The question is how Ms. Duke had the disease and fight to survive and overcome. Ms. Duke has much to be proud of its achievement in its struggle for survival of the disease that often leaves many victims without hope. <br /> <br /> If a person does not struggle with the disease personally they do not know the hell they have to live. The film was a success to me, because it showed the real problems, and as a person who is depressed and manic action. It was so real ... yes, yes, actually. It was like looking at yourself out there on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Ms. Patty Duke personally for having the courage to make the public aware of their disease. Bocka
