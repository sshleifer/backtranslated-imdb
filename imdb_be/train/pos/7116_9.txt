No one will argue that it's 1945 war film was a masterpiece. (Like any war film 1945 may be a masterpiece?) And yet it is an extremely effective retelling of a true story that Al-Schmidt, blinded to Guadalcanal as played by John Garfield, who spent days to wear a bandage to capture the nuances of the action of a blind man . Robert Medicines in the "helmet for a pillow," Schmidt denigrates popularity in favor of his partner trenches, who was killed, writing that "the country needs to be living heroes." <br /> <br /> Well, I believe that the country I made. And they had one here. There is a battle scene in the film is attached to the studio lot, lasting only ten minutes or so, and there is less than halfway through the film, instead of being stored for menopause, but it is the worst and the most realistic portrayal of men under fire, I remember seeing on the screen, including in "Saving Private Ryan." Men scream with fear, yelling at each other and to the enemy, and blood, and death, without the help of colors, stereo sound, squibs or gore. <br /> <br /> Just a technological point of view, the film is excellent. It's not just that we learn how a complex mechanism of 0.30 caliber, water-cooled Browning machine gun, or that he should be fired in a splash a few rounds, or that he was not waved around like a fire hose, as in many other war movies. Technical precision adds a riveting scene. The need to stick to short bursts of terrible, when dozens of shrieking enemies pouring across the river fifty feet with the sole purpose to destroy you and your two isolated companion confined to a small pistol laid. <br /> <br /> The representations are hard, if not bravado, including the ubiquitous support for the 1940s, John Rizhli and radiant, young Eleanor Parker. History framing love to spare, but it works, and ultimately quite touching. A strange dream sequence included. It is not Buñuel, but for routine 1945 film, it stands out the original and effective. <br /> <br /> Maltsev can be rewritten script, or it can be changed by someone else. He could use a trim, which could cause a much-needed ambiguity. However, there are strange verbal punctuation marks that have an amazing impact on the viewer - "Why does not God strike me dead," And, "In the eyes of Lee. Take out their eyes! "The depths of anguish a few banal words. And a surprising amount of bitterness manifested wounded veterans of the 1945 war film. <br /> <br /> Notes, which may seem false to modern audiences, but perhaps not: dated slang, which is hard to believe, many of today's children might think, in fact, did not say - "personal NHS ' "nonsense", "dig", "Gee", "you dumb coot", "woman", "swell guy" and "self-pity." Consider the historical context and to be good in our judgments. While some of this silly jargon were at the forefront. <br /> <br /> The real weaknesses? Wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about how much collective future they have also oversimply argument is solved with the conclusion along the lines of, "Just because you have a silver plate in his head does not mean that people will think that you are bad people ". There is sometimes the voice-over, silent prayers, which are both unnecessary and quite prosaic. "Please, God, let it come back to me," and so on. <br /> <br /> Well, the filmmakers worked within the limitations of his time. Maybe that's why the final fade to a shot of Independence Hall and inspire strains "great America" ​​swelling in the back. <br /> <br /> There is nothing it can not undo the dignity of the film, which are significant, in particular, the impact of this terrible battle scene. it's not on TV that often. If you there is a chance, be sure to catch it.
