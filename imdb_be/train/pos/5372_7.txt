With the first five short stroke Hammer "Hammer House of Horror" episodes of the series, this is the fifth episode of the beautiful name of "The House That Bled to Death", probably, the creepiest one. As a big fan of gothic horror films The Hammer Studios' for many years, I wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series recently. So far I've only seen the first five episodes, and I have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the number is as entertaining as the first five episodes, I'll be happy. While the second and third episodes were great to watch them unhealthy and brilliant dark sense of humor, this is the fifth entry is certainly one of the first five, which provides a real horror. The episode begins when the elderly man kills his wife from unknown reasons. Many years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move in the house with his young daughter, Sophie (Emma Ridley). Shortly after moving in, however, the family should know that there is something terribly wrong with the house, which seemed to be haunted ... The second episode was directed by Francis Megahy is much better than his mediocre appointment, Â«Growing Pains "(episode 4), and a rather unknown actors provide good performance. The film is also well done in terms of effects, cinematography and evaluation." The House that Bled to death "is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my colleagues Impact proponents wanted to see in the short Horror tale. The film delivery represents horrible atmosphere, panic and presents intelligent swirls, and suspense, and is very interesting from the start to the end. In general, it is highly recommended to fans Hammer.
