Gorgeous Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in great shape, the average age of a girl whose interest turns into magic in World War 11, England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was the age of 51 during the film, and it is just perfect for the part. She Jessica Fletcher again, but this time it's for the benefit or the child and for the mother of England during a time of great danger. <br /> <br /> The film is about the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson Professor magic in an attempt to get some information about witchcraft. These 3 little darlings, sent to live with the price in order to avoid explosions in London just fine in this wonderful film for all of us, regardless of age. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe is given so little to do in this endearing film. <br /> <br /> I really thought Ben Stiller film "Night at the Museum" at the end of the film, when the power comes to life to do battle with the Nazi invasion of the small British seaside town.
