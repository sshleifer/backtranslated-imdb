Do not believe all the negative reviews, this film gets. Yes, it is cheaply made. Thus, a clown blood. And, yes, the game is subpar actors. However, this is a textbook example of the early slasher flick, and if this is your "thing" (it's mine!) Then you will enjoy it. There are enough good aspects of this film more than compensate for the shortcomings. On the one hand, the price then unknown Christopher Young very terrible violence, and emphasizes fine. The ending of the desired break from the predictable optimistic endings of most films. And last but not least, the setting that made the film for me. The creators of this film could have done a much better job "spacing" set to make it more believable in a college dorm. However, if you can overlook this flaw, setting great. Four boards in a huge abandoned convicted building is just waiting to be torn down .... this reaks opportunities. While viewing, allow your imagination to do some work, and you can enjoy this film as much as I do.
