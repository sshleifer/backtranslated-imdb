I can not decide whether this is one of my favorite movies. This is a good thriller and has an emotional core, but still I can not decide. I definitely liked. This is the first film by Terry Gilliam, what I saw. My first impression? I worked until the very end, and it is not all that complex (to deceive). <br /> <br /> The film is set in the future. Man James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent from the future to get some information from the past (1996 specific). The virus has killed five billion people. It is sent from the future to get some information about it. In addition, it is called a psychiatrist participate Kathryn Railly. Love story beautifully drawn, and you can really feel the desire in the love and longing for a normal life. The free ends are connected in a very interesting way in the end. <br /> <br /> One thing I loved about this movie is that, unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the film does not prefer to make any tedious social commentary and focusing on this one guy and his desire for normal life. "You want to see the ocean, to be with her" particularly bitter line in the film. He chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the mind of man. Therefore, it is not entirely a post apocalyptic movie, but instead it can be described as a romantic science fiction film with themes that range from travel during blur reality and so on. This is what makes this film special film of the 1990s. The complex plot flows smoothly, without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> performance is very good. Bruce Willis surprised me here, he did not act another tough guy here, but he gave a good performance confused man who is in love. His despair in a certain sequence is drawn beautifully. I have to check his other films. Magnificent Madeleine Stowe totally fun to watch. Ever since I saw this film, I became so obsessed with it. She gave the performance of a woman who sympathizes with her patient, and finally falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is a real surprise, though, with its image of a crazy person by the name of Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar nominated performance rather strange, considering that he does not have many critics, who have a good word for him. <br /> <br /> At the end of a rather scary, and this is another reason to see the movie. The length and complexity is not such a big problem, because this movie is pretty fast moving and there is a sufficient number of incidents in order to keep people interested. And each case in this film makes sense, and there is nothing out there that is not necessary. <br /> <br /> A good thriller 10/10
