OK, so the Oscars seem to get exaggerated only a little more each year. I was rooting for "Gosford Park" to win (throw, Robert Altman deserved Oscar for years!). Nevertheless, I think it is time for African-American to win the Best Actress. Unlike the previous reviewer, the role of Halle Berry in "Monster's Ball" was much more original than Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I never would have thought to assign last for anything, especially in the year that he saw «Mulholland Dr.» <br /> <br /> Among the things that I predicted was the material of the September 11 attacks. I knew that they were going to say something about freedom. So much so. Robert Redford should know better. But, again, unlike the previous reviewer, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (among the latter was the hosts Bob Hope, for whom I have no respect); I liked its impact on John Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> So, while I would not give «A Beautiful Mind» Best Picture "at the 74th Annual Academy Award" is still pleased me (I must admit I enjoy the Oscars more than my own birthday). And the next day after my parents and I were hiking around the house Bandalier, New Mexico - it was spring break - I thought to myself that if Jim Broadbent won an Oscar, that most people look asked, "Jim, who ?! "I wonder whether or not Woody Allen never attend the Oscars again.
