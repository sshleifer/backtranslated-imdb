Man Tornado (1976) is in many ways better than its predecessor film. The director knew he had to work and catered towards Rudy Ray Moore limitations as an actor. This is an interesting film that is more technically sound and acted. Artists do not take themselves too seriously, and I think that at this time in earnest, and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems to be more relaxed in front of the camera and is not as tough as he was Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the film very much, and I highly recommend it. Just like his first film, it is served in relation to a specific audience (I doubt very much that Mr. Moore was trying to broaden its audience at this point in his career). Check it out! <br /> <br /> Highjly recommended.
