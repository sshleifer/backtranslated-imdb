Unfortunately, this movie never made it to DVD. I saw it when it was first released in theaters in 1983, and then again when VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a VHS copy of the flea market, I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana beautiful and a joy to behold. But then, the film takes you into an unreal world, where you have to think about their values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The film is about a lot of things. It is about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave them from developing capitalist scheme to get them into debt that they can never pay off. It is about how our economic system exploits us, forcing us into debt with credit cards, a mortgage and a car payment. This is an attempt to preserve the innocence that perhaps we never really had, and perhaps we can not really save. It's about good and evil and how sometimes it is difficult to distinguish one from another. This raises many questions, but does not answer. I sometimes think that it is good. For this reason, this film really worth saving and see.
