Magical in every way, this film is perfect if you are in the mood to feel good. If you like jazz, this is a must see. If you enjoy seeing attractive characters that make you smile, may bring a tear to the eye and shakes, as there is no tomorrow, this film is for you. If you are looking for an intense, deep, heavy piece of art to be dissected and analyzed, you may be better shelf with what Darren Aronofsky (in other words - the reviewer djjohn light, you do not know a good time when you see one!) My only complaint that the film was just too darn short. I think I'll just watch it a few more times to get plenty.
