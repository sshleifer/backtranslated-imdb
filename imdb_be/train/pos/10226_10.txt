I was about 7 when I saw the movie first. It was not so special then, but a few years later I saw him again, and this time he mocked a lot :) <br /> <br /> I think that the best part of the movie are: Yeti body language and "special effects "too. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, do not wait for the Hollywood blockbuster, even this film has been made with approx. $ 1,000 :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it.Movie and video versions, and (I do not think it was ever shown in cinemas) <br /> <br /> Watch it, enjoy by !!! Yeti forever !!!
