There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about the exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of the Twelve Monkeys. Gill (presumably) has prepared a long list (think about the plane of one of the Fifth Element) and gave it to Butch Bruce. It was called "Things that Bruce Willis Is If he acts." It ended with a simple message, saying: "Please do not do any of the above in my filmÂ» <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this film (defined true) .. Gil was not a hand in writing. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that these two factors played a huge role in the creation of unusual (if not commercial) success that Twelve Monkeys. <br /> <br /> Visually, Twelve Monkeys is all that we rightly expect from the film Gilliam. It is also full of surrealism and Gilliamesque general (but beautiful) strangeness. Gilliam is interested irregularly paid their audience. While the end of Twelve Monkeys will not surprise anyone who sat through the first real, borrow from Gil Kafka hours, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters to their fate. It is a journey, and the development of character, they are that concerned. <br /> <br /> I love movies Gilliam (Brazil, in particular). But they all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films almost always end up as a tangled mess (Brazil in particular). I still contend that Brazil is a tour de force Gilliam, but there is no doubt that the Twelve Monkeys is a breath of fresh air in a tightly drawing department. Style, content and form, seems to merge in a way, as a rule, is not visible from the ex-Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth of the above hearing, Gill also possible to obtain a first rate (very unusual) performance with a bald one. Bruce is great in this movie, like all actors, particularly suitable crazy - and very scary. - Brad Pitt <br /> <br /> It has been over ten years since the film was released. When I watched it again, I realized that it does not really aged. I have changed, of course. And it made me look at the film with fresh eyes. This seems to me to be a tribute to the film, which, at least in part, is about reflection in the mirror, change of perspective and absurd unidirectional travel during what we all do. The first film speed. 8/10.
