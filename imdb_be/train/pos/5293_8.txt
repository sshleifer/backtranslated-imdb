This is a very easy two-headed comedy about a beautiful family with a son named Pecker, because it uses Peck on his food. Packer likes to take all kinds of pictures of people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Md., And has managed to attract the attention of a group of photography lovers from New York. Packer has a lovely sister who is just nuts over sugar and is actually ADDICT, taking a spoon of sugar out of the bag. There are scenes of men showing off their lumps zhokee a grinding movement and gallons largely doing the same thing. It's pretty hard to keep your mind from the gutter with this film, but who cares, it's just a movie to give you a few laughs with a simple picture, taken in 1998.
