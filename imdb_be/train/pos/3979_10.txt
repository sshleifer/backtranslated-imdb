I would just like to all the supporters of this documentary to know that Martin Torgoff my uncle, and I'm so damn proud of it. This mini-series, shown on VH1 in a great look at the drug culture in the last 30 years, and my uncle worked very hard on him. The amount of time and effort that I watched as he put in this documentary and the book that started it all (can not find his way home) make it much better to watch it on TV. I know that he loves what he does and he does it well. His eloquence is mentioned in an interview that he made himself, and the amazing additions that he adds to the commentary. From music to videos and everything in between, it's a great documentary that really shows the drug culture experience through the eyes of someone who lived through it. I am grateful for any comments on this subject by those who used it (or did not) and would like to hear from the fans! Three cheers for Uncle Martin !!!
