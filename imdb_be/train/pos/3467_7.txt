I still wonder why I watched this movie. However, before I watched this movie, I did not know anything about practicly Beatles. I do not even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a lot of fans, with several albums, some people argue that the biggest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono and John was killed. <br /> <br /> In addition, VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV is. However, for some reason I decided to watch it, I do not expect much. Strange, but I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well in connection with a slight accent spoil. This is very important because John and Paul speak pretty much the entire movie, Allthough they are taken outside to explore more options and keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performaces, as a whole. <br /> <br /> The ending was also very clever. I enjoyed how the film gets you excited about SNL Performace, and then hits you on the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go and finish it on a good note. My favorite moment is probably touching scene on the roof. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. This is a very good way to settle your curiosity, what would happen if 6 years after the collapse of the floor just appeared on the verge of John. Which is probably the main reason for my viewing of the film, settling my curiosity about who actually were the Beatles and what might happen to them after the collapse.
