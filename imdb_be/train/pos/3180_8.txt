A friend gave me this DVD, which he received from the director of the festival, I think. I went to a warning that some of the technical aspects of the film were a little shaky, and that the letter was good, but not great. So perhaps it colored my opinion, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> standouts where actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, the kind of pathetic in a nice way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were wonderful as roommates who drive Ernie crazy. The bill character (Justin Lane), who spends much of the movie dressed as a panda was the most my favorite; he seemed the least-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate is so much I called the guy after watching a DVD. Actually kind of attractive, and very funny. Some of the other actors were good, some so-so, but none of them were bad. I also really liked vigilante duo. It is absurd and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I give this one high score, even if it does have some problems, because you can tell if you see that these people are cared for, and have decided to make the film his way. Well done Adam Jones and crew.
