This is the second child Burlesk short to be released and is probably one of the most popular, is a parody of 1926 silent film What Price Glory. <br /> <br /> I watched it, and I do not understand kiddie porn that asks. It's just a cute little movie. I have seen families shows that I grew up watching in the '80s and' 90s, which were little girls dressed more provocatively acting in "a mature manner. It was more provocative, because they were not wearing diapers. There's nothing provocative about the diaper, if you have one of these fetishes. (Just kidding) I've read that description of the film, and where it is said only a pedophile would enjoy watching it. It hurts. For me, when you look at it and worried about it, then maybe you should look into your own mind and try to figure out why it bothers you. This innocent film, which was made as a parody of another film. All films are parodies of the Blue Book, nothing more. Skits / jokes today are graphic and character are present almost pornographic scenes and pretty disgusting language. There should be even more terrible? I can watch those without problems, but sometimes they take the children's stories and turn them into the dirt on these parody. That is something that should get under the skin. Not that they babified (not a word, I know) adult movies in 1926, because we know how these pornographic films were silent, right? Not to mention the "Forbidden Hollywood films of the era of Pre-CodeÂ» is so vile and unclean. They would never do such a vile thing today? (Note the sarcasm)
