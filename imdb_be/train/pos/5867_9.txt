Jacknife masterpiece 80s. This is a film that breathes through the amazing action and a very interesting director's touch. The Jacknife, both amateur European and American cinema can find things related to. The script is very convincing and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris provides one of the great performances to date. He draws his alcoholic character perfectly makes us feel his broken heart in every line, in every movement. Robert De Niro makes us more time to think about it as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest, but also the most realistic performances of his career. Jacknife never gets boring, as he shows his characters clearly the nature of the typical elements of any typical Hollywood. After the war, none of the hero. Anyone who has lost, and this film is that simple truth. No one can fix their units after the war, as well as the heroes of this film. Jacknife of diseases of the soul, which creates war. Just a great movie.
