Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched together Â«C'eravamo Tanto Amati" on a summer night: we like, but we do not like it, we loved "special day." I believe that however quite underestimated: we often forget to remember it, perhaps because of his recent films have been disappointing. And so, last night, my mother and I sat on our couch to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, directing, cinematography, score and staging were sober and accurate, but what I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are both great actors and starred Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: Married fanatic Nazis, she has six children, but her husband wants to have another baby, to get the prize for large families. Gabriele just antifascist. They spend together is a special day that special day in 1938, when Hitler came to Rome visit Mussolini. I do not want to spoil more about the story: to go for this film!
