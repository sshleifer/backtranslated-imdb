The plot does not begin to describe the film: a man writes a movie, or, more precisely, * is * the movie. This is a completely self-referential to the fact that you think it's going to reach inside yourself, how a black hole. A writer writes something and it happens, or something happens, and he wrote about it. <br /> <br /> This is a very philosophical as «Waking Life», but a more Zen-oriented, and for that matter, much better, in my opinion. At one point there is a man-on-the street interviews, and then you see pictures of these people take off, and then you will find that their answers to the script when one keeps flubbing her lines. There is beautiful scenery and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it comes out on DVD, so I can watch it again more carefully. He is seen on Cinequest (as part of the Festival of San Jose, Calif film) on 2/25/2002.
