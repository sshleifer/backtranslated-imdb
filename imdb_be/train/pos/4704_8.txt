This movie is simply a lot of fun. I saw him a couple of times, but she always has something funny that I remember. Â«Duckies and bunnies" car scene is one of my favorites, and I am still quoting Morone version in some words! <br /> <br /> There are so many running jokes, it's weird. But I love Michael Keaton, anyway!
