This is such a fantastic film, a western about an independent person concerned (Jimmy Stewart), dating back to the Klondike gold. Along the way, he gets worried the local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, giving a surprisingly evil work), he fights back. McIntyre threatened that he would be a dead man if he ever returns to his city, which, unfortunately, the only way back to the States. The main piece of the history of the peaceful town of Klondike Dawson turned the time of the new residents of the city in McIntyre. Ruth Roman, for example, who came with Stuart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennan, who plays Stewart's best friend), building interior (Hollywood front for a brothel), and tries to start a restaurant of the city and hang-out place of business. It opens the way to McIntyre and his thugs to come up, too. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann, one of the peaks of the western genre, The Naked Spur. F Country just the tiniest bit less, and contains 99.9%, which made this film so special, without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. As Naked Spur, The Far edge of a beautiful, full-scale cinema. Beautiful landscape. Stewart gives one of his best performances (almost equal to its greatest success in 1954 the rear window). I believe that this could be considered a clich√©, as he begins a selfish alone and see how it kind of existence is played at the end. However, Stewart plays so damn well that he makes this character is very human. And maintains performance throughout fantastic. In addition to those I have already mentioned, the magical French actress Corina Calvet very well. And I have to highlight Walter Brennan as well. He seems to have specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touching, because it, firstly, the only character who is able to bring all of humanity into a cynical man. The script is very well written and is the direction manna flawlessly. Masterpiece. 10/10.
