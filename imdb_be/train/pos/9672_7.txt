I know, I know: this baby stuff. But I just love this kind of movie. Bird, who suffered many "failures" and still have not lost faith in humanity and his sense of humor. What is special about this film is that the main character Paulie -The parrot-, and it is not used as reinforcement in some desperate human actor. In addition, I like the plot: Paulie tells his lifestory a cleaner at the point it collapse. (By the way: the voice of Jay Mohr almost sounds like Joe Pesci in!). Cheech Marin And, of course, people humor me. Ever since I saw "up in smoke" I appreciated his naive way of execution, which makes a simple situation hilarious one .. I can not help it.
