I can not say how accurate the film follows the romance, sun reading a book, but as a watch in some six and a half hours, it's a good bet that most of the bases covered, or at least, we can say with a certain degree of confidence that it is not Reader's digest condensed version. <br /> <br /> production values ​​are high, and by the standards of other BBC classic series like Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We can believe London Dickens looked, sounded, and a lot of thought as it is. There are some rare small mistakes - some athlete pistol shooting with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820, or whenever it took place <br /> <br /> The current also is welcome .. Suzanne Burden polite and honest character, who quietly goes about doing good. It is also nice, in a constant way, her beauty in her compassionate nature does not in any coquetry. Denholm Elliot is her guardian (and more than that, as it turns out). The severity and Elliot are two of the very few characters who are good in the form of non-alloy. Another former sergeant forced to do evil to evil people. Another poor, helpless boy. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone could have written it. He has all the signs of Dickens - poverty, the tragic death of capitalism in the cheese, a generous rich guy in a closed house, hidden origin, shady motives, and impotence or open hatred of the justice system. Well, not the justice system as a whole, but in the office, which was obviously the court which decided the issues related to the distribution of property. (So ​​do I understand from Wikipedia). It has become so well known hard and slow, that he has been completely redesigned in England in 1973, twice the character Elliott describes him as "the curse." The most impressive scene includes money lender poison stealing retired soldiers in the gymnasium during the last fencing lesson. Sgt more masculine in the traditional sense, than any other male character I remember from Dickens. Apoplectic money lender and the landlord shouting threats from his seat and the sergeant turned to him and make a gentle exercise with a sword other, every advance that it is closer to his tormentor, while aloe face old lender shrinks back to its place. <br /> <br /> a few things missing. Dickens often will stick, at least one or two funny lines of dialogue. ( "Nonsense!" Or, "The law is an ass".) Not here. "Cold" is the correct name of the house. Secondly, there is practically no Weberian "ideal types" - not Mr. Micawber, or the Cunning Dodgers or Scrooges. In the third place, the atmosphere, the whole spirit of this relentlessly grim. One misfortune after another, as a rule, have to do with money or some disgraceful peccadillo from the past. <br /> <br /> Oh, my God, it's depressing. It is as if the author were venting spleen at all, he hated the world he knew. Poverty well. He knew poverty. But surprised that the office did Dickens to deserve this kind of treatment <br /> <br /> Maybe I should add that I have just watched the first episode of the series 2005 - and it's better two ways. There is more in the direction of the lightning, so the pace a little faster. And it Zharndisa against Zharndisa explained satisfactorily up to the front instead of hiding in the shadows as a mysterious "curse", so that the story easier to follow.
