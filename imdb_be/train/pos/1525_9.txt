Seeing version of Peter O'Toole recently, I was ready for awe smart letters in this release. Little time is spent fighting, which I prefer. Instead, we have shown all the many motives underlying both French and English (occupied Normandy) politicians and priests, who put her to death. Even the worst hypocrite of them all, the archbishop, leaves us with the thought that "Of course, she was innocent. The innocent have always had to suffer because of the strong ambitions. She had no idea that she does not speak, do not know about the consequences of blasphemy to go against the church. uneducated, she had no idea that the Church's position on such issues was even ". <br /> <br /> Preminzher was faithful to the myths surrounding her death, and I appreciated the preview on the tape, which showed flames .? short and burning her why they used the gas jets in the cinema, and 2 of them were stuffed with a sudden air pressure extinguished the interruption and the flames jumped right on it Fortunately for her, they do not need to repeat the shot as it was so realistic..: it burns !! Pretty traumatic introduction to Iowa girl to her new career action. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud performed admirably. It is an English politician who conducts the show. It is also the point that if you charge someone to death, you do not want to be around to see how they die. you can squeeze from your "duty" next time ... not that such sweets to disturb the soul of our potential president. We are Christians, even the most anti-Semitic have no problem with stepping on the Old Testament, when it comes to the death penalty, despite the fact that had to be overcome in the words of Jesus. Bring on public executions, as this little girl. The sense of smell burnt flesh can bring us respectable people in our souls feelings. <br /> <br /> The only little "pick" I have about this film is that we have not shown why the priest, who was so firmly urging her burning becomes so suddenly, so humble, down to the Var ' yatstva. There had to be more than an extension of his character, more dialogue - as a sudden "coming to his senses," it does not make sense <br /> <br /> And Graham Greene did it consciously or not, ul. Joan a little cocky upstart, you are almost, but not quite, happy she meets her payback. And when she turned down his life in prison, for some reason, I thought that Anne Sexton, a poet, who accused Sylvia Plath in "the theft of her death" when she committed suicide ... knowing this assurance of immortality action. You must be surprised !! <br /> <br /> If ever there was a good example of obsessive thinking and logic-tight compartments, it is one. St. Joan would be assigned a Buddhist and reassured "the voice in her head."
