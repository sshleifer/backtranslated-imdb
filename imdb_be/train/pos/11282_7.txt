. It was the second of a series of 6 "classic" Tarzan movies with Weissmuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane <br /> <br /> As usual, it was a great movie in the series; and perhaps it stands out as the "between" in the progression of the film, which could almost illustrate the development of the movie from the beginning of the 1930s to the 1940s. As such, she displayed a good pace, although not as good as these films. In addition, film less experienced than later Tarzan films in the series. Stem I saw uneven quality, which contains some granular scenery and some underexposed and juggling scene. Clear display later Tarzan films is absent here. On the other hand, there is one scene very early, in which jerky movements of the camera sometimes rustling in front of him, as the camera supports, pointing safari men forge ahead into the jungle, in fact almost in its modern style, and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, one interesting feature here was Jane almost fickleness and inconstancy, when she was undergoing Martin courtship. Kiss ?? and Jane is stunned, and partly guilty, the reaction ?? He predicts something with Jane we see in the future, and in these films. Compare, for example, in Tarzan finds a son! duplicitous actions Jane Tarzan deceiving and delivering boy in his family. Later, she confesses Tarzan, she was wrong. There is nothing so obvious, but we have Jane's "return" to Jane Parker of past years, and almost repented of a series of actions, stripping herself in evening dress, brought Martin and Harry, to entice her from Tarzan. <, Br /> <br /> have been a number of descriptions and sequences that are particularly struck me in this view. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the picture we get from the home life of Tarzan here, and later, the combination of sensual idyll with always immediate possibility of a violent death. It is for me a lot of experience at the core of Tarzan. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by some pretty harsh scenes even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a series of scenes that gave me special pleasure: Tarzan leading Elephant Valley Elephant Graveyard; Tarzan escape from a watery death, hippo, and then fed to the health of the monkeys; Cheetah is going to find Tarzan, Jane, and when other people are trapped at the foot of the slope; Cheetah, in particular, crossing the river on a log. The final battle scene of lions and savages on the ground and savages and apes in the trees. Jane, showing us that it is indeed in the world of Tarzan now, quickly showing her enterprising WOODCRAFT work to the line of fire to keep the lions away <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes magnificent :. Suddenly Tarzan on stage and threw a savage from the trees and take responsibility lions, elephant and calling for help! This is the final cry of Tarzan in triumph, holding a happy Jane in his arms, dancing and delighted Cheetah next to them, it's unforgettable picture really excellent summation of the history of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is another great classic movie Tarzan. I would recommend this film highly to anyone.
