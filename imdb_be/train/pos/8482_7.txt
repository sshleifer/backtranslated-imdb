This colossal deliriously vulgar stupid all-star revue extravaganza of all rights of early stars, Warner Bros could afford. ... and, like most other rarely seen films are actually made at the end of the 20s, an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the richness and youthfulness of this Roaring Twenties put the song and dance. SHOW show quite huge. Vaudeville act after the monologue after the tap after acrobat after the comedian after fan dance ukulele after fainting after Rin Tin Tin, introducing the "oriental Room" ...

So enthusiastic are potbellied chorus line and jumping teens en-ter-Tyne us that they almost push themselves repeatedly in the faces of joy and effort. Row after row of "Doll" characters hops past, and some even go out of the room.

Of course, I loved it, and had to watch the color of the final over and over again, and then invite friends and family to the screen for a few weeks in a row are dire and scare them individually and to lie on the interior in squealing in delight each and every cry their frightened reaction. So if you ... and be glad, that was the era when it was created just for fun and thrills. It's all so crazy.
