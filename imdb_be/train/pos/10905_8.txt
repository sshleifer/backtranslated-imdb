36-year-old John F. Kennedy, died in September 2003. It was a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB) - this meant that his skin had literally fallen off at the slightest touch, leaving his body was covered in painful sores and lead to a final fight against skin cancer. In recent months, Johnny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a movie, first broadcast in March that it was surging, confounding and zealously humorous story about a single man. Nha shying away from the harsh realities of the EB, the film was also a celebration of life lived to the fullest. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004. The boy, whose skin fell off became the most talked about documentary this year. It attracted nearly five million viewers, and after the public screening donated more than half a million pounds for charity in Jonny Debra. Jonny Kennedy Memorial Foundation was established to raise another half a million in order to ensure that John Kennedy has left one million pounds in inheritance.
