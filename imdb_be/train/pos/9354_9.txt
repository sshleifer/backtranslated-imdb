As someone who never condescend Adam Sandler in terms of talent, how to do it for him, and many comedians, like him, I went to Reign Over Me for a big movie, and not just because of its presence in the film but because I thought that it looks very good on the whole. Even those who already thought that Sandler can deliver effective performance of dramatic writing here, I was surprised at how fantastic he is in it. It will make you cry, especially in its deliberately sudden and unexpected monologue. What is surprising about his role in that is a sign, it is difficult to say that we have seen before. We saw a lot of emotionally scarred characters, a lot of people with learning difficulties, a lot of individuals, many hot artists selfish, but Sandler's Charlie Fineman any of them. It can have a taste of each of them in some way, but his character is really unpredictable, and completely individual. It is a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally from it and be pulled at all sides someone whose problems, thought provoking and quite different from most of the characters, like him. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle provides an interesting performance to another level. He's everyone. He is the most normal person in the world is possible, so you are unlikely to find many signs, like it either, or at least something that played the way he plays Alan Johnson, whose name is even located on the assembly line. Cheadle is brilliant that he funny, shake, smart and stupid way so many normal people. <br /> <br /> Other actors town actors and actresses who have hardly done anything in a while in the small but very colorful roles. Jada Pinkett Smith is too refined upper middle class wife, Donald Sutherland impatient, but surprisingly the judge, Robert Klein desensitized in-law Sandler. <br /> <br /> The script Mike Binder is very brilliant, because it says something profound about the virtues of communication in all its forms. It's much more subtle than, say, Babel, and is much closer to home perfectly. <br /> <br /> The camera is only interested in the reality of its images, in contrast to the simple style. This film struck me as a kind of sendback accumulating in the kitchen style of the 1970s. Cinema was grainy and unfastened, but it was his charm. It's not about bringing us to the camera and the light that would have diluted their stories with such. <br /> <br /> Music, which plays a major role in the film, and his name is very powerful. Close to the very beginning, you feel like you're in for another About Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine soundtrack kind, but soon you realize that you are in for more than that. In fact, the film is packed with a lot of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes. <br /> <br /> Deserted city is one of the main application is not only for society but also for the film. This shows that even the director Blankman capable of miracles.
