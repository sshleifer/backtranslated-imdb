I first discovered the Alexander Korda (1940) Fantasy, The Thief of Bagdad in the early 1950s for reissue billed as «The Wonder Show of the century!" Both Cord Technicolor films The Thief of Bagdad and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one of the program will never forget. Music Miklós Rózsa enhanced both films. Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! The Thief of Baghdad was on my list as the best science fiction film ever made. As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the color of the film is how it was originally presented in. True Technicolor ceded Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film as theater and video. But Eastman color prints were more in the nature pastel and muted dynamism of the original Technicolor. Issue laser discs of the name also has a pastel look to it - good, but not as it should be. Now comes M-G-M DVD (3 Dec 2002) edition. The Thief of Bagdad again has a lovely Technicolor look at it on DVD, which is nothing short of stunning !!! It was so interesting to see how it is once again that after watching the DVD once, I watched it a second time. The only "Advanced" is the Spanish dubbed version, subtitles in English and Spanish, and nicely done the original theatrical trailer. Thanks to M-G-M for this DVD release exceptions. Now we can only hope that the cords FOUR pearl and restored version Korda JUNGLE BOOK (replace bad public domain prints in circulation) will soon follow on DVD.
