Jason Bourne is sitting in a dusty room with blood on their hands, trying to understand what he had just done. Meanwhile, the head of the CIA in New York, describes the agency's response to what has just happened on screen. The American flag stands proudly in the center of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he says, it slips out of focus, as his plan turns to the morally questionable territory, as if he does not want to be associated with the course of the government's actions a person decides it is necessary to the interests of national security. <br /> <br /> This shot effectively captures the mood of the film. As well as drawing Bourne search to find out how he became Jason Bourne Ultimatum also study the human costs of measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security. <br /> <br /> In addition, probably the best movie you'll see in a movie this year. <br /> <br /> It's just so intense. Bourne says Simon Ross (Considine), "This is not some newspaper story, it's real," and in the audience, you almost believe him. Camera shake, but remains sufficiently stable for you to see everything and feel like you are there with the Bourne as he tries to escape from his pursuers, and performances are so good that these guys seem like they are symbols, they drawing, instead of just being actors who perform well written role. Scenes so cruelly growing and well placed that they seem to be instinctive instead planned to small movements; stunt-work is not that other, as strange. <br /> <br /> Walk incredible. He continues to move forward to a close, but not so quickly that it leaves you struggling to piece together the story; the script provides the necessary information as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next strenuous activities Set-pieces. Despite the fact that they are often simple (sequence of Waterloo, in fact, just watching the man on the phone man on the phone), they are loaded with such dramatic force that you can not take your eyes off them. The film is just focused on the power forward, you can not help being swept along by it. <br /> <br /> With its intense action of the standard provisions the parts brilliantly paced storyline, and reasonable review of decisions taken in the name of national security, a series of Bourne is one that accurately reflects the ambiguity of our times. Ultimatum is its peak.
