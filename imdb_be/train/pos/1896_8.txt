Arthur was always a personal film for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and help with the horse during the stable scene recently died. If you look quickly, you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Eikenberry in a conversation. Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, even though I actually know the real life of Arthur Bach. He was not as rich as Arthur, but spent 47 years of his life, mainly as a child. His parents strictly controlled his wallet, but his rent and utilities were paid in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent much of his time to get himself intoxicated by various spirits and make a public spectacle of himself, just as Dudley Moore does. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly Arthur why someone would bother him no wealth. But it's the other half of the equation. My friend was the most charming man when you meet him. In fact, it was almost a compulsion to be charming. He could not buy a newspaper or magazine, without trying to establish a certain level of relationship with the supplier. Throughout his life, he is the perfect guest participant. mota term that was in common use in the 19th century, will be applied to them. <br /> <br /> And that's what Dudley Moore, spendthrift. Unlike my friend John Gielgud Moore to clean up after them. This is a full time job, as we have seen demonstrated in Arthur. My friend also did not find Liza Minnelli, Liza Minnelli man actually, because he was gay. Nevertheless, the image of Moore's Arthur Bach deadly accurate and so real to me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, 20 mot century, forced to marry another trust fund baby into Eikenberry. Since it will not work for a living, the threat of being cut off is quite real to him. He has only his butler Hobson, played by John Gielgud and chauffeur Bitterman plays Ted Post pour it to the problem. We should all have such problems. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud in his life for nearly a century, of course, work better than Arthur in the film and actually Gielgud more prominently known for his stage. However, 1981 was the year the mood for an Oscar time. The Academy gave Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn an Oscar for On Golden Pond and Best Supporting Actor Gielgud Award mainly for a lifetime. This man was a strange, still in his craft almost to the end. <br /> <br /> So, Frank Graham, who has worked in movies and Jackie Weiss, a real real life Arthur, I dedicate this review.
