Ten of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces (I found only one Egyptian Unsatisfactory). Stragely, all but the Mexican director has decided to reflect the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, the Palestinians, the widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets revolution and the subsequent bloodshed, suicide bombings Israel suffered paranoia and will be prosecuted in the United States of American Muslims, old people living alone, and the consequences of world war II in the hearts of Asian soldiers. It may say something sad about the boundaries of empathy, in both directions: the directors might feel that Americans ignore the pain in the rest of the world, and only care about their tragedies, while they are actually doing the same thing with your shorts <. br /> <br /> Amazing myself, I found a piece of Sean Penn is one of the best in the collection, and *** *** SPOILER AHEAD I also believe that his image of Ernest Borgnine as mentally normal mired in old New York apartment going through the happiest moment of his life the widow, when the sun shines through the window after the WTC Â«collapsed with the path of the light," I believe that it can also be one of the crimes, as a general American audience will see it.
