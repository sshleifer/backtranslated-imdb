I never bothered to see this movie in theaters, but I remember hearing the name again and again. In the end I watched it this week, and that pleasure. For some reason, I expected that it was not very good, so I was quite surprised when I sat down and stuck with it, and then turned out to be fully extended. I have read many comments of other users, and it impressed me how much people talk about her fighting in the ring, but what was great about Diana that she is a real fighter in life. All she has to do is find a place where it is to be who she is, and the ring helps her get there. Very clever story, and I'm surprised that this is the first time in Rodriguez - what a great job she has done. Adrian and her coach were also very good. <br /> <br /> This film is a little rough around the edges, but it does not matter in the slightest. History, commitment and performance completely outweigh any disadvantages (which usually come from the indie movie anyway). Convincing image of a girl to find herself and her triumph over circumstances and knockout for Michelle Rodriguez!
