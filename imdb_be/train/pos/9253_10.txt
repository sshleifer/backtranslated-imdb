Well, the film is not quite "funny". <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit that not a few humorous lines, but certainly nothing to laugh out loud funny. For example: Right in front of the pair of sex scenes between Eleniak and one of its Kostars men PT handcuffs to the back of the bed, and he could not take off her shirt. Before leaving the room to get the key, he says to her: "Well, do not go anywhere." <br /> <br /> You see, with a sense of humor, but not funny. <br /> <br /> The story and acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Eleniak determined dwarfs. She's hot and sexy and there is really a twin scene with her, that one can not help but back and re-watch. <br /> <br /> There are also some other very sexy scene with her, and she has some very provocative line. <br /> <br /> In general, 5 stars. I would only give it three if not Eleniak.
