For those of you familiar with Jimmy Stewart, is one of his "smaller" films later in his career. And, while this is not a great film, compared with many other of his paintings, it is not bad and decent time passers - but not much more <br /> <br /> Kim Novak witch. in New York, and for some inexplicable reason, she decides fascinated poor Jimmy to get him to fall in love with her. With time, cold and off Mrs. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stuart - and, perhaps, in the book of rules of the witches, it is definitely NO, NOT !! <br /> <br /> The film is odd in his feelings about witches. They are neither a child nor sacrifice almighty diversity. Most of their magic is rather limited and meaningless (eg, Jack Lemmon, using his strength to turn the street lights). And it is very strange that witches all seem bohemians who hang out in the hip bars where you could find people wearing berets and listen to shitty jazz. Given that I think about jazz, he must really stink to be a witch in the world of this film! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is quite romantic and gently comic, but not what I would jump to watch. The acting is pretty good, but the script does not give enough feedback to make this exceptional film - in fact, I almost killed 6 film - it was very close.
