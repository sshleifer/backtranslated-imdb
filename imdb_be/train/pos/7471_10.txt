Despite the excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I expected to be disappointed by the film, because I heard that he did not receive good reviews. Nevertheless, I left the movie completely in awe of how well Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> It was not a bad game at all in the whole film, each character believable. Romantic moments between the character of Crusoe, David Aames and character Cruise Sofia are loose jerkingly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they are quick to be a couple in real life). <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky plot to embarrass you in the last third of the film, and there's very little chance you guess the ending. However, the ends tied to the end, leaving you with an amazing mixture of feelings, which consist of sadness, shock and empathy, David Aames. <br /> <br /> The film is intelligent, and you have to pay attention to everything. It is not so difficult, because it is likely that you will be fully retracted and the film does not take his eyes off the screen for one second. <br /> <br /> I usually leave the cinema Forgetting about the movie I just watch. But Vanilla Sky are still stored in my mind days after seeing it. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change from simple, small films.
