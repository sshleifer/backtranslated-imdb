if you have a chance to see this film really see it. it's pretty shocking in parts, and really makes you think about a lot of important issues, but it is not didactic. In my opinion, this is a work of art ... nice shot, good music of many styles, typically impressive level of acting that one has come to expect from the BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (billed as "NatalieÂ» Press) is convincing in her role as teen depression exploited male classmate. Celia Imrie has this beautiful soothing quality that gives the sometimes unnerving stability actions and viewing comfort in the knowledge that someone out there is actually "normal", but the real star, as always, Timothy Spall - surely one of the greatest actors of our time!
