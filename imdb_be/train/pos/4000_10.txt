Wow. I saw it last night, and I still have not recovered from that, how good it was. Each character felt so real (although most of them are small, selfish a ** hole) and bizarre story - middle-aged widow begins to fuck his daughter's boyfriend, shapeless - felt quite convincingly. The best performances all round, but hats off to Ann Reid and our friends in the North Daniel Craig (the latter met as the next David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> and directed by Roger Michell? This is so far from Notting Hill as possible. Thank God. <br /> <br /> See this movie !!!
