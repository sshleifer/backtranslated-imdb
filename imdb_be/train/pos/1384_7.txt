Also known as the "Water Lily", this film tells the story of two girls, as they fight their way into the world of love and sex. The story is told at a slow pace, and it works very well. This gives enough time and space to know the different characters and grow more attached to them. <br /> <br /> With the help of a small roll to put some extra pressure on people to play as they have more time on a normal, but people who play in this film handle it well. All quite plausible. The visual setting is large, especially underwater footage in the pool add a nice effect. <br /> <br /> Many films have been made on the same subject, although this one is above any of them. It pulls some "standard" pressure release methods with high hat and working on them. It's not bad, but not quite, but it's certainly not great either, and I feel I could have done better, if adopted, some that is less explored corners. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 synchronous swimmers
