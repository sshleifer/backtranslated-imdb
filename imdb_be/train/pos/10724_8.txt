This is one of those who feel good in the Saturday afternoon movie. It's right up there with other retro clicks as flight navigator. Just a cute movie with some fine comedy to lighten things up. And it is interesting to see how 20 years have changed the stars Kelly Preston and Leo Thompson. Not to mention the Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> I personally really love movies like this from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a good storyline. And I would not know, Mr. Phoenix was not I recently read loans. He was just a kid really, when he made this film. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was quite young budding actress then too. She and Leo did a great job in this film. I agree, this is not the caliber of film Oscar. But it is worth a look. Especially if you have children in, say, 8 to 11 year range. Or those who are interested in the space program.
