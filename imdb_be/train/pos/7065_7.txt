Cute film about three living sisters from Switzerland (often seen running around in appropriate costumes), who want to be parents together (I think my mother still carries a torch for the Pope) - so they set sail for New York, to stop his father married blonde gold digger he calls «Precious». Dad has not seen his daughter in ten years, they (strangely) did not mind, and thought it was amazing, and while Precious, it seems, is living mostly run by his domineering mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just He wants to see it as her daughter marries a rich man. Sisters get an idea of ​​pushing on the road drunk Precious Hungarian Count, deceiving two gold-digging women, thinking that he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of mistaken identity makes girls think Earl looks good, Ray Milland, that goes along with the scheme ", because he is in love with his sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This film is a pleasant, light snacks, read Barbara Kay comes across as sweet and beautiful, Ray Milland looks oh so young and beautiful here (although, unfortunately, is given little to do), Alice Brady is quite good as insidious mother - but it Durbin, a real charming and cute as a button plays the younger sister Penny, which is largely steals the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings a few songs throughout the film, but I really would like to see them feature her more in this. The plot in this film a bit silly, but nonetheless, I found the film to be entertaining and fun.
