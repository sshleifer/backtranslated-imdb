I work with children from 0 ?? 6 years old, and they all love Doodlebops. The Doodlebops energetic, lively and attractive. Once they begin to sing, "" We Doodlebops We Doodlebops We Doodlebops Oh Come and join in the fun, because we were laughing and we sing all day ", it is practically impossible not to join them in song. in Doodlebops takes the viewer into the world of color and fun. Each show adventure, the Doodlebops not try to change the world with an instructive message, all they do is have fun, going through daily life problems that a small child can relate to. Doodlebops is a refreshing, high alternative courses of action for the regular children's television programs.
