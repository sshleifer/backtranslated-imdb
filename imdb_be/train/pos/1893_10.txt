While it is certainly politically incorrect to be entertained drunk, there is such a charm picture Dudley Walls attractive magnificent Arthur Bach, one can not help but feel in this unique and beautiful nature. How can you not be entertained by this infectious laugh and giggle and utter stupidity. Although I do not actually advocate of Liza Minnelli, she was really beautiful, like Linda Marolla, and I could not imagine anyone else in this role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the movie and won an Oscar. The rest of the cast is also nice and large motif "The theme of Arthur", wow. Indeed it was one of the best comedies of the 1980s. Great movies better with every viewing, and in the case of "Arthur."
