You know, like Star Trek supporters flocked to all Star Trek movies, even the very poor? Why? In order to see their heroes in action once again. That's how I feel Doc Savage. I am a fanatic of the main character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in the adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the film has only added to this feeling of anticipation. Then they decided to cheat sheet elements from a number of Doc adventure and throw them into this one movie, resulting in several disordered film. There's a lot of promise here, bred a series of unsuccessful elections (music, elements of the "camp", etc.) But the spirit of the Dock is, and this is something that those of us familiar with the Doc and his crew to respond to, so, in my long-winded way that I'm trying to say that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should be. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters have to check this film only to become familiar with the hero, who provided the inspiration for all.
