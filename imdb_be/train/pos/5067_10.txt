Here on IMDb.com I read an opinion that the Great Gray Owl is better character Pierce Brosnan always satisfied. I do not know when it was better or worse than the role, I do not support it, but this one was truly exceptional <br /> <br /> Another thing -. Impressive hands of the director. I give my respect. Tranquility, beauty and spirit of the desert was really illustrated exlusively, I have never met such a proximity is in any film before <br /> <br /> Another thing stayed in my head after the movie. - this is a movie, the closest to the original book, and the atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay my respect to the original Great Gray Owl.
