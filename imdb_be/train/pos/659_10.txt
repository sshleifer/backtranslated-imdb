One of the last classic of the French New Wave. For directions, Eustache cineast pulled from the simplicity of the movie at the beginning of the century; for the story, Eustace drew on the sufferings of his own complicated personal lives. So many things that can be said about this film - Supervisory brilliant; self-indulgent debts; sometimes cheerful; emotionally draining ... etc .. In my mind, regardless of the complaints that can be lodged against this film is easily clouded by numerous strengths. Each student film, writer or just someone who wants to deal with the 3-hour film without sharp cuts, no music video overstyling, Sun soap operas as the plot twists and turns, and not banal dialogue should make it a point to see this film. Everything has to be admired: writing (short, smart, surprisingly funny), acting (each, simply, perfect in their roles), but simply the direction of (the viewer feels like an outsider in the film) make this film memorable. This is definitely a film that stays with you.
