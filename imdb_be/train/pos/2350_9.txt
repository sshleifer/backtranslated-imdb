For example, I shamelessly enjoyed every episode of Pushing Daisies this season, and I hope that the writers' strike will not be tough to put an end to the beginning of a very good show. Ned, a pie maker who has a restaurant in the city center and has a secret talent. Emerson is a private investigator with their own unique eccentricities, like his love of knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is just dead, but longer-nya-a childhood friend and sunny location Neda life. Olive is jealous, but good-hearted waitress. Oh, and to add a dog. Jim Dale brings together all the characters, along with his beautiful story shows. Chuck, Ned and Emerson, along with olive and sometimes dogs solve many murder mystery with a special gift Ned bringing dead people back to life. Show funny, clean and romantic in a very sweet and good-natured way, and I recommend it to everyone.
