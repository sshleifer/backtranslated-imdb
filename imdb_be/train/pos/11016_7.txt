Good action show, but nothing new. This one took place in the mountains, which have shown some interesting scenery and such. One person takes on a group of mercenaries lead flies, and he kicks butt. It could be called "Rambo is sent to the Rockies," this was what Pat. He had a very effective scene right on the first film, which was to me cringing in horror. Not a bad picture, but just the same old, this same old.
