I've heard some not so good things about this film, and probably saw the low rate here IMDb, which is why I avoided it. Today they showed, Vanilla Sky on TV, and I did not have anything better to do ... and, as it turned out, I would be hard to find anything better to do. Vanilla Sky frightening, sad and touching film, in fact one of the best I've seen in a while. I was amazed at how I suffered playing. It's hard to explain, but in the movie of your feelings about the characters and your perception of what's going to change, and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me because it is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend everyone to see this movie. No matter what you've heard about it.
