Halloween John Carpenter's horror masterpiece quite frankly. He tells an immortal story of escaped mental patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to chase and kill a group of nannies. <br /> <br /> It was the first, and without doubt the best in the Halloween series, Carpenter shows great restraint in the story pacing very slowly and build a charming character; unusual for a horror picture. <br /> <br /> Even more unusual is the non-existence of the blood and blood, and yet it remains the most terrifying Halloween today. Get it! <br /> <br /> Halloween film debut marked by Jamie Lee Curtis and defining a point at the end of a great career in Pleasence. A true classic.
