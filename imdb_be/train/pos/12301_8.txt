It's kind of crazy, but I taped from TCM as this German version of the MGM "Anna Christie," and the English ... but I have to see this first, "because I have heard that many people thought that it was better than in English. <br /> <br /> seeing no other, I can not compare them, but in any case it's a great early Talkie, a representation of the direct-from-the center of Garbo. She looks very beautiful in the film, her face shines everywhere, especially cameramen William Daniels gets this beautiful close-up of it. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film seems to be different from the regular MGM material placed on that era, it is very similar to French or German expressionist films of the thirties, and it was aimed at a large French director, Mr. Jacques Feyder, who directed Garbo 1929 «The Kiss». <br /> <br /> Theo Shall perfectly and gives a plausible job absolutelly loved Anna, on a hard-boiled, hard, sailor, which just a kid in the human body. Hans Zhankermann also gives a very clear idea of ​​how alcoholic father and Anne Salka Viertel as well as good old cheap woman. <br /> <br /> In all enough experience, because it is the only film where you can listen to Garbo speak a foreign language ... 'because all the other films she made at any Swedish or German, were at the time silent. <br /> <br /> A serious gesture.
