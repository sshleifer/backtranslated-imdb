Although initially reluctant to jump on the bandwagon to watch «LOST», I accidentally caught an episode early in the season 1 ?? one of the polar bear ?? and it was my attention until now. The show, that is. Nha polar bear. Since bears (heh) with me while I throw so awkward, half-coherent praise as I can muster. <br /> <br /> «Lost» takes the simple idea of ​​a passenger flight, full of people, broken down on a deserted island, and gradually add extraordinary depth of his background, examining each character deeply and firmly ?? what makes them who they are? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island on which they are twisted acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they are running away from something (Sawyer and Kate among others) or in contact with spirituality (Locke, Claire), but «Lost "and zooms in on the island and mysterious horror that he was at home ... and they all seem to be strangely connected. <br /> <br /> While television actor is not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities, most of the cast of "losing" really spectacular actors for their parts, projection heart and humor in their speeches. There are also many EyeCandy, but as a rule, not a Hollywood type of plastic, as well as most of the TV show. The characters all feel very real, and they are extremely attractive look. Their interaction is rarely predictable victims juiciness, small arguments or cheese melodrama (although annoyingly they secretly) ?? these people in the first place trying to survive, and that the relationship is considered secondary to the action. The realism of these characters make it easy to have a good story sculptural. <br /> <br /> This is the story ... Imagine a tree as a site template, the industry as a story (in this case, one branch for each sign) ?? well, Lost adds branches to each branch, and then a small branch of the bars, as well as other storylines. If you have a brother / sister of one of the main characters in flashbacks, you get your own story. If you DOG, you will have your own story. If the authors have not been able to weave them together into some glorious climax in the end, they are angry. I am more than a little worried there will be some disappointment excuse in this show, as I'm sure most people. <br /> <br /> But if we assume the writers really crank it, «Lost», perhaps the best show ever to hit television. <br /> <br /> 9/10
