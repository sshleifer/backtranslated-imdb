This has long been one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's novel with. Although it is certainly not in the same category as the exciting "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a gorgeous and relatively accurately televersion Austen novel - especially given its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the film is good, as unnecessary snobbery that Austin exhibits at the end of the story here is removed and replaced with someone more like the character of Emma in the rest of the book. I thought that the signs chosen to reflect the roles were well in demand. Kate Beckinsale is a fine line between effeminacy and social snob with grace completely lost in the '96 version of Gwyneth Paltrow. Thin blond strands Samantha Morton in accordance with its attitude and character as a Simper, accompanied by her role in previous characterizations replaced Harriet we know from the book. The role of knight in Mr. performed very well, in my opinion; As a serious and tender sympathy that the hero is depicted in the novel are present here in such a neglected, luxurious movie.
