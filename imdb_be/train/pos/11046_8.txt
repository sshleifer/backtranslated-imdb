Maléfique very interesting film. It nesvyatago alloy victories and failures. The central concept is great, three prisoners with fancy parties joined the fourth (that viewers identify with), and they are trying to escape from his cell, using a book of magic, which they found in the walls of the cells. <br /> <br /> atmosphere of good fabric, it reminds me of reading about the prison stay Edmond Dantes in the Chateau d'If (to the establishment of the Count of Monte Cristo). The director sets the feeling that the characters are tied to the cage, in particular the nature, we are for identification (Carrera - White collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but it obliquely suggested could be a scam). Once Carrera blurs when you exit the cell for exercise and has the cell door closed on him; We never leave the cage claustrophobia whole. There is also no shots from outside the prison cells, and the view through the bars tightly sunset over the total prison wall. Thus, even though the film seems very modern, it has a very old world feeling of confinement. <br /> <br /> The characters intriguing. We have Marcus, violent pre-operative transsexual who plays abusive mother to Pâquerette (French for Daisy) is long overdue young man. Pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful, and unfortunately, this included his sister, so his current plight (I love this comment on the internalization of very primitive). Lassalle is closed, he had an elderly man for brutally killed his wife. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​the film is that your desires will destroy you, and there is a ritual that goes with it. I think that's what bothers me most is to see people destroying themselves ritually. She has a real life ring to it. Quite simply the soundtrack support is good, every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by a dull sound of a gong. I actually hear the gong now every time when I'm doing something self-destructive. <br /> <br /> I think that one of the problems is that the story ends the signs do not really strengthen the message consistently, in particular, with Carrera as well as the concept of the book seems to change throughout the film, and not from the standpoint of consistent opening day. I also think that some of the images that we see a bit amateurish, more than the execution of the design, such as the famous "vagina eye," and sodomite with LaSalle, for me, completely hollow images. <br /> <br /> at the end of the movie it feels like the director in a hurry to get it out, and some things do not seem logical, for example, we were led to believe ineptly different things about the child in CARRERE. This does not change the fact, though what we have here is that rare bird, a "pure" horror movie. There's no scale or comedy genre segueing as Cube (1997 / Natali), an explicit film to compare it, is a common immersive experience where you feel like you are in a cell with the characters. This last remark I make that "pure" experience, I think this is something has already been mentioned, and that is quite a unanimous points. <br /> <br /> On a personal note my favorite part of the movie is, if Lassalle says about his past as a librarian. He vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sit in his usual place in the center of the room, where all the books are arranged in a circle around him. Books seem to be chanting to him that he would never withhold their knowledge. This encourages LaSalle crazy. It really is a problem with the violence of understanding and knowledge. This is what I was feeling. <br /> <br /> One last comment, that two of the comments received, pretty good on the blackboard confused character names. To make sure that Lassalle is a senior librarian character, simply click on Philippe Laudenbach page, and you will see that he was born in 1936.
