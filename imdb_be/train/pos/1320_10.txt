In the early and mid-1970s, Clifford Irving offered to write a definitive biography of Howard Hughes, claiming that spent months preparing for the book, which deals with an interview with the millionaire recluse. If all this turned out to be false, Irving was charged with perjury and spent several years behind bars (although always admits the results are accurate). Fast forward to the 20001, a few months before September 11, in a book called "Forbidden Love" (published in the US as Â«Honor Lost: Love and Death in modern Jordan"), a previously unknown author named Norma Khouri, the woman from Jordan, who reported on the death of the grace of the murder of her best friend Dali, due to the fact that Dahlia, from being a devout Muslim origin, met Christian people. This is the biography of Irving on Hughes has been featured as a potential cheating. Australian director, Anna Broynouski tries to delve into the quagmire that was Khoury attempts to clear himself from the lie (s). Over a period of 104 minutes, the film tries to find in Norma Khouri was telling the truth, or is it simply a compulsive liar, the agenda / her own vendetta?. Interview footage with those who know / knew it (including the ex-husband, her publisher, etc.) to tell his side of the story. This is a delicious, well-made documentary that managed to mark a lot of fingers as well as many potential culprits. A lot of the rating, but contains profanity distributed & re-enactment in a terrible murder scene, played for several times (but not nearly as graphic and anxiety as well as what could be seen in the latest saga of torture porn like Saw Part 84). Not a very good choice for children.
