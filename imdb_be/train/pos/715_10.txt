All the people who sit here and say that the weak link of this movie is the Ramones, probably say that Amadeus was ok, if not for that annoying harpsichordist. Rock 'n' Roll High School was centered around the Ramones. How can someone look at it and do not get hit with Joey Ramone eat bean sprouts wings in an attempt to keep him under the condition obviously wet blanket square daddy-o. Ms Trogar, the explosion of white mice, room patrols ... immediate classic. Nevermind the character Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the Ramones, you do not know, rock and roll and do not deserve to watch a film called School of Rock and Roll.
