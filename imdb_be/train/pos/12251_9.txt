It took me some time to see this version, unfortunately, I do not seem to be able to rent it out in the video store, the only other option, but I fell in love with her. I've always been borderline on the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, as they are not British, of course, have to put emphasis on, and well to me it does not seem natural. It seems to wear. Sorry, but I do not think that Tony and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there. I could not warm to any of the characters, but this version is no longer warming the heart and a human type I imagined to be Emma. This is definitely the version that I'll get back to today. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley not better looking, but he convincingly. I also like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I've never warmed to her in the film version, but it is better than is portrayed in this version. Think about it, (besides Mr. Knightley) all the characters played better and much less over the top. Unfortunately, both came out about the same time and version Paltrow received a lot of publicity. Sorry ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Beckinsale Well done! So if you're a fan of Jane Austen, do not forget to watch this.
