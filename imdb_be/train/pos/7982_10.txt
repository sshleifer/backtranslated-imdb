I am surprised that films like this can still be made. I watch all kinds of movies, all the time with my friends, and I can say that this is one of the best I have ever seen. I never thinked, that the film is 146 minutes can make me think about it further. <br /> <br /> Washington, charismatic and intense, as always, plays crisis, washed up ex-counterterrorism agent who delivered in the bottle. Once it is designed to protect young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redemptive arc push in the way only a beautiful little girl can provide. Inevitably, Pete is kidnapped by bandits and solve a crisis that most of Mexico must pay for daring to take the catalyst bear-gripping character. Yes, he was ... a man on fire. <br /> <br /> You should see this film.
