I read with great interest the only available comment made before me on this film, and I would first like to say that I understand the previous user's point of view, who commented that the film is very good: when viewed from the Israeli point of view, I can very well imagine that this film touches a very sensitive issue, and that the slightest detail can make a big difference to the viewer, which is more or less directly related to the events depicted in the film. What I would like to say that the "distortion" was shown at the film festival in Geneva in November 2005 (Festival "Cinéma tout écran"), where he won the audience ( "Grand Prix du public'in France). For what concerns me, I liked it "nerve cell" work g-Bouzaglo, which, in my opinion, portrayed atmosphere of extreme tension and anxiety in the film is very good, and I think that the majority of Swiss viewers appreciate it in the movies. This view, however, it may seem very "foreign" to the Israeli audience, but not surprisingly, when it comes to the Swiss audience, because Switzerland is a country that has never been the subject of a terrorist attack. Therefore there is nothing surprising in the fact that the audience in Geneva to judge this film with much more "detached» perspective.I would also like to quote what Mr. Bouzaglo said when he gave an interview to Geneva (I translate from French ) '' after 50 years of his life here and after passing all this violence, we can ask ourselves if it is still possible to stay normal.We may sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide rather than continue to live. We are like the characters in my film, "" on the edge of the edge '. " This is the reason why private detective who somehow "" voyeur "" the happiest character in the film, because he makes a living thanks to the system, it uses this situation '' is, in fact, the main thing that I and the Swiss public, on I think, I said in this film, and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies in the characters in the film, which is a precedent reviewer noted, with great precision and humor. So, to summarize, other countries = different points of view, but I think it has something great, because it calms me for something that affects the future of cinema, that is to say that it is good and not be subject to a 'unique "with a" formatted "way of thinking.
