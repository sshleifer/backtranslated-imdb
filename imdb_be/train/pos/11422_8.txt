Chocolat Claire Denis beautiful, but the care film. The film is a very interesting look at the household European colonial family, who lives in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative look at the lives of many characters and their interactions. However, the development of these characters often annoyingly enough. For example, the central theme of the story is the inability of young France to form strong relationships with other people. Although this image is flawless, especially in the fact that Denis frames the story with scenes from France back to her childhood, the lack of a girl close to other characters in the film makes it difficult for the viewer to invest a lot of interest in its development (or lack thereof) as the main character. The overall stagnation of the development of the character of the film makes it difficult to engagement in free organized plot. The film raises a lot of tension between the characters, especially between Amy and the men in her life, but never completely solves this social friction, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The last few scenes are powerful but depressing. Work Dennis, of course, interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you are looking for a film of adventure or drama, Chocolat, certainly not the best choice.
