This film is excellent. It has always been and always will be. I mean really, it's better than a maid in love with the house. Walt is actually done it myself here. And the music! The dream is a wish your heart makes it beautiful! What else can I say other than amazing! I can not wait for the special edition comes out, it would be so cool! I can not wait to hear all deleted songs! This film is made so beautiful and smart! It's great. And what about the cute mice too! I know I keep saying the same thing over and over and over again, but hey, it's a great movie! Woods was spectacular in these wonderful beautiful beautiful movie
