I like Top Gun. He held my interest. Predictable plot, the development of a decent character and storyline. This is very similar to the High Noon in that city people seem weak and scared to become a villain. This movie has some of the qualities the actor, who did not actually get a chance to share their talents. In addition, some of the actors did not get credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a good-looking man in his youth. John Dehner, Rod Taylor outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did the best he could with the bad stuff. It's hard to imagine him as the shooter. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was nauseating character. She seemed flattered that two people may have fought for it. Ugh. Finally, as people can travel without luggage? Especially women.
