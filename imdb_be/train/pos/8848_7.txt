I watched this movie in a very strange way - I put it in my Netflix list and could not remember why (except that I knew that Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it). Since the film has no opening credits, I could not even remember who sent it. <br /> <br /> As my wife and I watched it, I turned to her for about 45 minutes and said, "You know, I want to decide what I hate this movie, but something about it just will not let me stop watching it. " Then there is an area of ​​about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie, which is really electrifying performances in the cast. <br /> <br /> It was only as the end credits, I realized that it was a Sidney Lumet movie. And I thought - wow. I am surprised that Lumet picked up on what was really dirty, petty little story about a really mean, broken people. But it's a testament to his talent, that I was wrong when I did not even realize it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really, really good in the movie. How terribly well. . Put against Capote, and I would say Oscar was for this film instead of <br /> <br /> I also highly recommend the narrative a special function with Lumet, Hoffman and Hawke's about making the film - it's entertaining and educational, with Hawke plays a student He wants to learn from the master's feet. Lumet defined teaches you the first rule of working with actors - kiss their asses permanently !! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of hard, melodramatic films that there are empty ciphers, when all is said and done. And there's an element of that in this movie - the actors that fill the air with sulfur explosions of emotion, and when the smoke clears there's nothing left. Nothing resonates at a deeper level <br /> <br /> But Lumet gave us Network and Twelve Angry Men - .. The films, each in their own way, were raised in the higher echelons of the cinema <br /> <br /> this film is not at this level. But there's something about it, persists. . And maybe enough <br /> <br /> My last comment about the comments - if you look at the number of comments about this little film here on IMDb - depth comments and intellect, and of CON - this is a very good sign, something special that happens with this film.
