The soap opera about a small town of a married woman (Kay Francis), who works at the local kiosk serves as a leading lady in her local Playhouse then, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When the well-known actor, ham, a chatterbox and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town, she visits him in his room, with his dreams of giving her advice to fame - he pretends that his valet, his "manager" tricking her, supposing it has everything you need, but the "experience" to become a big star. Her husband finds out and hole punch Man as a result of the sudden death of actor - which leads to the murder of even more unexpected: life in prison for the hubby. Next thing you know, she joined a traveling burlesque shows in the hope of one day making it to Broadway and make enough money to get the freedom of his person - all the while her baby is sleeping in the trunk <br /> <br / > In this film! has a pretty interesting story, well, a bit far-fetched, perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all * strongly * enhanced strong emotional performance of the Who Frances - it just makes the movie. Also helping is well done Minna Gombell acting in his role as "getting closer to forty," the old lady who works in a burlesque and friends Kay. Worth a look, especially for fans of Kay Francis.
