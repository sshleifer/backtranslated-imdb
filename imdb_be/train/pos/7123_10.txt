Sometimes I watch a movie, and I'm really impressed with this ?? and still it is not easy to explain why I liked that a lot. This mainly refers to the unusual film ?? those can hardly be compared with the others there. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of those special films. There is a lot of emotion in this film ?? and the action was so good that while watching the movie, I was crying and laughing, as the story went on. Young Nick Robinson ?? young boy (William) evacuated from London because of the air strikes there during World War II. . Mr. Tom played by John Thaw old leaving the village evacuated children were sent to the <br /> <br /> In the first volume refuses to accept any obligation - such as caring for a restless young boy ?? but takes as it remains without a choice. During his stay, Mr. Tom discovers how terrible life was for William ?? along with his mother sent his luggage belt and written instructions to the host of his son ?? do not hesitate to use it. This belt cellar in the field ?? should never be used in such a cruel way. Mr. Tom provides a real home for William, a boy and happy with his new life, he goes to school, making new friend and discovers hidden talents. All of the sudden sheets of William called the house in London with a letter mentioning that she was not feeling well ?? and it starts all over again ?? Only this time, it gets much worse ?? There are a lot of feelings you can experience in this film ?? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? and much more. Goodnight Mister Tom is another masterpiece of British cinema, comparable only with the other, such as Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot ?? if one is to compare. I really enjoyed watching and highly recommend it. Before I conclude this review, I would also like to acknowledge the great work of Thomas Orange as Zack ?? He reminded me of my friend from my childhood (:
