"American Gangster" genre is now subject to wear one that is all too often subjected to parody. In retrospect, the series is the culmination of the previous clich√© that has been used in its genre, fortunately, the authors nominated for this deficiency by creating a realism that has been applied to it. Soprano is an epic saga of crime, illustrating its content with psychological depth, which is characterized by subtle shades, humor and unvarnished violence. The main character, Tony Soprano is seen as a risky general Devoid of fear and moral values, and his crew, however, two other Tony Persona, which is an animal, and the other is a conflict with a sense of guilt and a scoundrel. Without any restrictions or contradictions, I still firmly believe that The Sopranos is the best acting ensemble of recent memory. All things considered, I could make a thoughtful statement about the series, but I will not. If ever there is a visual dictionary in the global search consumerism of these definitions is vital, mixed, ruthless, epic, extreme and treble shattered face will be smiling right at you.
