Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Oman (Zhasbir / Janice) are siblings were raised in incomplete families. Zhasbir (sister) growing in a rich environment, but this is not enough to cause her to reject her life and eventually join the hippie movement, which ultimately leads her to drugs. Prashant (Brother) on the other hand, grows in the less affluent surrounding medium but grows matured gentleman. History says Prashant is making efforts to save his little sister (who is constantly in trance) from enemy hippie environment. This film stands the test of time, noting that the cults and hippies groups are a place for those who give their lives when they should instead stand up and be counted in the face of adversity. Great songs in this film, that mean different things in different situations and for different people, and the director takes an awful feeling to it.
