It was one of the first terrible films I've ever seen ... I was about 5 at the time. It scared me good! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to look like a monster ... and my mom were very upset. She had to clear his eyes with alcohol and the next day my eyes smelled like DOUBLE MINT! Now it's a movie! Hey, for this time it was a great movie. It sits at the head of the laboratory countertop was real, it was then. And if your 5 is very scary! Kids now days are spoiled for special effects that show too much, and nothing is left to your imagination consciousness. Your mind can imagine things more frightening special effects! (IMO)
