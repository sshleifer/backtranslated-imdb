Spirit is a unique and original look to the western life from the point of view of a wild horse, and Native Americans. The film is about friendship and the danger that wild horse, Spirit, is faced in his life. <br /> <br /> It is very well made in the presentation, using technology available today to deliver stunning visual effects that are breathtaking in their depth and realism. <br /> <br /> music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams, and music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the hugely popular music since 1994 Disney hit, The Lion King. <, Br /> <br /> history is not very deep, but the fact that it is not so deep as some movies are not in my opinion detract from the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that I enjoyed the huge and suitable for the whole family. Not one to be missed. (10/10)
