This is the best mob movie ever made. She deserves more than what he got at the Oscars. Appointed to such things as his score, art direction, a supporting role (Newman), this film could easily have been nominated for best film, director (Mendes), actor (Hanks), Supporting Actor (Newman and law) and won! ! Hanks gives one of his best performances, and the baby, who played Michelle Jr. was so good that I'm surprised I did not see him in more films today. Critics do not give enough credit to this film. But in addition to incredible performances, another real star of this film is incredible music. This is by far the best result of the year. He was nominated but did not win. This is a great movie that everyone should be treated. My class-A +
