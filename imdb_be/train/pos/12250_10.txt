Kate Beckinsale dwarfs! Bravo! Too bad Knight ins't, how to look good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did an incredible job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emmas father. I love the end of the scene (which is in addition to the novel, but it is well written) when the crop and the Knights dinner with their workers and members of high society. Emma must show that it takes now. It is a modified female. It's too much too fast, but good. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays Emma former governess and confidant. She is beautiful. just as I could have imagined it. I believe that when the United Kingdom does Jane Austen ITS best. The American version of the English literature are made for money, but not for quality. See it!
