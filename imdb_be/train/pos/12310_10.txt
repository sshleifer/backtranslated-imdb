Just read the original story, which is written Ri in the 18th century. Strangely, the film despict original spirit is very good, although the plot was changed tremendously. Cinematic language, rhythm, special effect of all of Hollywood, but there are still the core of the Chinese. It's amazing how Hark Tsui managed to merge them together. The result is pure beauty.
