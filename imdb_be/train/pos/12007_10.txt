This is one of the most spiritual films I've ever seen. I led about 150 people in St. George, and we saw this film in the visiting center of the church of St. George .. No one had a dry eye in the audience. In addition, there were some non-religious and anti-Mormons are people in the audience, who felt the spirit of the film and were moved by the exciting music and the reconstruction of the history of the pioneers and the difficulties they face because of their beliefs. <, Br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who wants to learn more about Joseph and the difficulties the pioneers of the past. In the end, this is in addition to American history.
