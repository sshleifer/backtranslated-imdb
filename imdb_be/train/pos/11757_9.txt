Robin Williams and Kurt Russell are playing kids in their 30s, who put their marraiges in danger and decided (Russell somewhat reluctantly) to repeat their heartbreaking relationship with rival Bakersfield years after the fact. Williams is good, but Russell thins big as the legendary Taft defender Remo Hightower. Holly Palance doing a good and attractive turn as Williams' wife, who could live without revenge. The film is worth watching just to see the famed Remo in action. Highly recommended.
