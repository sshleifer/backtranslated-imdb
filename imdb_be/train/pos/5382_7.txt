After watching the series Next Action Star reality show, I was glad to see the movie winners at once. I was leery of such a showcase of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Billy Zane, of course, was his usual great self, but Karen and Sean stood beside him. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from competition) in their small roles. character Sean, not beaten, is persecuted, and his disappointment in the opening of the new rules in the game played well. Corinne walks a tightrope between her character well Sean Sympathies and only being in it for the money. I loved how the game was played right until the last second. And then beyond! Not a great movie, but a fascinating one all the way and a great showcase for two people, for their first time with a gate.
