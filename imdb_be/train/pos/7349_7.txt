Of course, if you read my review you have seen this film. "Raja Baba" is one of my favorite characters. I just like the concept of a spoiled child of the 24 * 7 slave on his motorcycle. Watch movies and imitate the characters, etc. etc. I love the scene when the cracks in the stone Kader Khans mouth while eating. In addition, where Shakti Kapoor tells the story of mundane affairs Raja Baba on the dining table and Govinda wearing "Dhara-poison" uniform make sentimental remarks. That's my favorite scene from the movie. «Achcha Pitaji the main Chalta Hoon» Chemical scene just between the two big Indian actors are doing a funny scene without dialogue. Its brilliant. This movie cat mouse. Just watching these actors, helping each other and still taking the scene from each other. Its general entertainment. If you want to Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry, it is necessary. I think RB is the sixth on my list by David Dhawan. "The suffering is not love», «Ankhein», «Shola or Shabnam", "Swarg", bullet 1 NO 'precedes this gem of the film. 7/10.
