This is one of the most shallow of episodes that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun. BUT, I rated this lighthearted approach, and it's really one of the best episodes to see on a purely entertaining level. Think about it - the crew members have a meeting with the White Rabbit and Alice in Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, knight on horseback, killing McCoy, as well as many other seemingly strange things that just do not make any sense at all until the very end. Despite the dangers, you just can not take it all very seriously - it's just too much fun, and the whole episode seems very surreal. Thus, on a purely non-aesthetic level, this is great stuff.
