Robot Jox tries his best, but in principle a number of fight scenes strung together - the robot against robot, man against man, man against woman. The room has the potential, but it seems that the script was not really given a couple of projects necessary. Nevertheless, it was pretty good for science fiction thriller. In part, this was because the script was Joe Haldeman. For those who are not familiar with the name, Haldeman wrote award science fiction novel «The Forever War.» He is considered one of the best power armor novels, right up there with Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Stickley in the "armor". And this film is really more like a giant power armor of the film, not giant robots. This is closer to what the fans want to instead of parody, which was Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers", which had only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based. <br /> <br /> Despite some speculation, it is really the ISN "t based on Homer's" Iliad ". A few names they all have in common. Achilles of his foot blown off by the robot did not have analogues in the Iliad, which do not include the death of Achilles. Achilles also had an ancient noble warrior. He was powerful, but also vindictive and petty. Even the Robot Jock killed in the first stage is not suitable. He was named Hercules, while the Greek Iliad came to Hercules. <br /> <br /> The effect was good enough for the time and budget. However, it was not comparable to the "Terminator 2" in a year, but this film is worth ten times as much. Stop the movement was almost as good as robotic walkers in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi." Moreover, in fact, than many Harryhausen animation, which is highly appreciated, but it is dated. <br /> <br /> Or does not bring much hope in it, and you probably will not be disappointed. It is better than many other low-budget films, and even some of the big-budget blockbuster imitators, who have the best effect, but much worse scenario.
