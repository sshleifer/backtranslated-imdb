Best of seven Sam Fuller films that I've seen (including Park Row, run shots, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this film) Pickup on South Street is considered one of the best noir . It represents Fuller in his most controlled. I love it when it gets out of control, of course, but almost everyone in Pickup perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals a microfilm, which was supposed to go to a communist spy. Jean Peters plays a woman who was carrying a movie for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters has to find WIDMARK and get it back. She finds it through an informer plays Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes the bias Peters (that and the fact that she knows that she is working on a communist, cold war stuff is really interesting). The love story is a little fast and not quite believable, but it is not so bad that it hurts the movie (unlike the previous film Fuller, Park Row). Widmark big. This must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career, I can say that for sure. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Its role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this movie, as touching as any you will find in the movies. I will never forget. 10/10.
