It's really a wonderful film with a revolutionary message (in form and substance) which should not be missed by any supporter of the French New Wave or underground film. There's a little opening or closing credits - we just fell into the world of consumerism, art, revolution and the youth. This film has little to do with documentary and more interesting in the game with our ideas of advertising and its relation to reality. Line real and not real cross so familiar with the films that discuss the documentary, but this time we're doing it for the sake of consumption and marketing, and not to describe reality.
