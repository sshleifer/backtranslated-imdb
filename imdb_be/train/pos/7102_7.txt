Other reviews here seem to think that this is a terrible movie. This is simply not true and a bit unfair. <br /> <br /> Acts of good quality and the direction of moving on with a decent turnover. I do not think there's anything wrong with Tarantino-Esquire interconnected stories together. Maybe it's just a new tool for directors to try. I thought it made the movie more interesting. There may be several elements necessary to delay the script, but it is about a single error I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives a great performance as Sylvio, Antonella Rios also is stunning and worth the price of admission alone.
