Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is a novice writer who is still looking for his big break. At the same time, he works as a consultant on the telephone psychic hot line in Manhattan. One day, unfortunately, his house burns down. Parker and his cat make it out alive, but now stuck with the difficult task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. Word comes to Parker that lady, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but will only accept a gay man. After Parker's right, but the price is right, he decides to pretend that he was gay. Samantha loved him from the beginning, and welcomes it as a new roommate. But poor Parker. Sam's a beautiful, smart, and very desirable. How could he save his true nature under control? Moreover, this is Sam is not successful businessman boyfriend anyway? This is a sweet, cute and humorous film with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Naturally, the story line is "how can I save this trick" scene with Sam Parker asks shampoo, shower or while she begged him to keep her in bed when she gets bad news. In addition, it is necessary for Parker, to make your own "fake" gay mate, Boris, when Sam insists on its fixation with a man whom she knows. Let's hope that the gay community does not find it too offensive, as this audience thought most of the questions were handled with sensitivity and subtlety. For a small-scale film and the costumes, sets and camera work were pretty good, too. So, if you love these funny stories about love, get it soon. Do you like what you see, I know it.
