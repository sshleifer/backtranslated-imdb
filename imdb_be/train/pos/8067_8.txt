Today, when someone mentions the name of Victor McLaglen answer is likely to be, "Who?" Or perhaps "Why?" Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won an Academy Award for Best Actor in the film that of poor, desperate man who is willing to sell his best friend for a "" in the cost of travel by bus in the United States. This is an interesting movie that shows how far even the most well-intentioned shnooks will only go for a few dollars. The film takes place in the British dominated Ireland and while the rest of the characters directly or indirectly, to fight for the political independence of Ireland, the nature of all Mr. McLaglen in Troubled get the money and get drunk. The movie makes you think, it is worth all the problems, because at that time as an activist trying to make a point, many others, not only do not care about political activity, they do not even know what the fuss is all about. The moral of this movie: look at the other, he can sell you for ten cents.
