What's in a name? If the name Jerry Bruckheimer expect it to be full of action. <br /> <br /> In the latter film, Bruckheimer producer in Gone in 60 seconds, it's all about nomenclature. With iconic nicknames like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and the idealized cars with names such as Diane, Sue and elusive Eleanor, it's just non-stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game. <br /> <br /> Do not deep script any means, but it is an excellent car to act as a Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, out of the car-theft retirement to save the life of his brother, stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A remake of 1974 cult hit, this movie can not be assigned to the same cult status, but it's interesting. <br /> <br /> It's amazing, but it is action that keeps you not look at the effect. Although loaded with stars, none of them has no standout performances, including a very weak performance by one of my favorite and I wish Giovanni Ribisi. Even Angelina Jolie, coming off his recent victory of the Oscar, it's just a sign of love interest with barely any screen time. <br /> <br /> Can a series of beautiful cars and car chase, they become involved in to make a great film? I think so. The film is a pleasure to watch and at least one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity, non-stop action and suspense exciting. Just be careful of other drivers who are fighting for pole, as you leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 5
