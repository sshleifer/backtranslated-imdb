Gus Van Sant has made some wonderful films. I'm really a fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can not help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book "Even Cowgirls miss" lost in translation to the big screen. One, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant incredible talent and visionaries tower. In the end, although this one does not work. <br /> <br /> It was not something that the characters were not well developed and the plot and the content does not come to life. It's just that our perception is much more powerful when reading a book like this. We were taken to another time and place, and we think the worst and / or best, and this adds to the overall book slides, she gently takes place in accordance with the accuracy of the author. Movies, however, can leave one with less imagination and emotions slides detracting from the overall experience. This is what I believe has happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest to read the book!
