Two sailors on the holiday - a womanizer Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and a shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet the beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There's more, but you probably guessed <br /> <br /> Stories (even for the 1940s music) is funny and everything is so beautiful and healthy. - bored pretty quickly. In addition, the film is too long. It is 140 minutes, and it's too much for such a stupid story. There are also some sad figures of Jose Icherbi and his orchestra. Nevertheless, it is worth catching. <br /> <br /> If Kelly dancing and singing Sinatra and Grayson it becomes magical. None of the songs are not particularly memorable, but Sinatra was such a beautiful voice, will not care. He was shot in Technicolor rich with all the gloss MGM had. Actions OK - Kelley excellent (though, seeing him as a womanizer is pushing it) and Sinatra just fine (although, seeing him as a shy guy pushed him too!). Grayson is not given anything to do, but it is incredibly beautiful to look at. Some footage from her literally breathless! There are many things here: Sinatra and Kelly dancing and singing great number; Sinatra sings anything; Grayson two songs and justly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry - animated mouse! Those making funny cameo too. In addition, there is a small Dean Stockwell, who steals every scene he is in. <br /> <br /> So it's too long, and the story just does not stand up, but it's still worth catching. It was a huge success in its day.
