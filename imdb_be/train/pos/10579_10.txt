Energetic young producer theatrical opening (those pageants, usually music, which often assumed the film in large theaters of bygone days) have to deal with crooked competition, unfair partners, infidelity lovers and amateur, to realize his dream of creating a writing. PARADE on the cast the limelight <br /> <br /> while very similar to other musical spectacular Warner, in particular Golddigger films, this film had a special appeal, none of the others was not Jimmy Cagney. He surprisingly, freely articulated and flexible, as well as agile as any cat - being in fact he imitates several times during the film. Cagney captures the audience's attention and never let go, powering the rapid-fire dialogue and hackneyed plot with his charisma and floating charm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast give their best as well. Joan Blondel is ideal as a smart mouth, generous blonde secretary, delighting Cagney (main quibble - why she did not give musical number). Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler again play lovers on stage and off; the fact that her singing abilities and effective bit on the lean side is compensated by her dancing; Powell still exudes a boyish enthusiasm for its unusual position as the second male role. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee, Hugh Herbert, and a lot of fun, as brothers-in-law, as the wily fool Cagney differently. Ruth Donnelly evaluation as a rich wife Kibby, a woman devoted to her handsome protege. hunted choreographer Frank McHugh is a suitable film to wit Cagney. Herman Bing is hilarious in his tiny scene as an arranger. Experts tarnish little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin & maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers. <br /> <br /> And, finally, there is a Busby Berkeley choreographed wonderful. His caramel associated with dance watered during the decade of the 1930s, was the supreme example of cinematic escapism, depression viewers would enjoy. A great joke about the works of Berkeley, of course, was that they were appointed as part of the plot to be stage settings. But no theater could not hold these products of fantasy wizard. They are excellent illustrations of the type of entertainment that is only made possible thanks to the cameras <br /> <br /> musical gifts Berkeley generally taken one of two different approaches, or the history of (often quite strange), told with song and dance. or stunning geometric construction amount eye candy showing rich chorus girl overhead carrier & romantic song. In a fit of extravagance Outre, light-flooded ramp Parade ends with three masterpieces Berkeley: `Honeymoon Hotel» and pre-production, the code telling the wedding night of the couple; `By the waterfall" - dozens clad females spray that swim and dive in ideal models and designs (look closely and you will see how the simultaneous effects have been achieved); and finally, `Shanghai Lil» - a fitting tribute to the talent as a Cagney and Berkeley.
