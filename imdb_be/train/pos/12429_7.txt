David Duchovny plays a leading role in this film.Now many people discover this fact did not even bother to look it.Very unfair to say least.David made a name for himself on the x-files and a decent actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Spiritual) is a drug addict doctor struck off for malpractice.By chance, he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.However ask the FBI to use Eugene to snare Blossom. Jolie was cast in the supporting role of the Clare-gangsters moll.She puts in a solid performance. Timothy Hutton plays Blossom beautiful and plunged deep into his character. Himself spiritually not as bad as many people think, and in the end I would rate it the work of his friend credible.His monotonous tone and present a straight face, but dosen't detract too much from the film
