Often labeled as a comedy, The Man in the White Suit outlining more than a laugh here and there. <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton eccentric inventor who did not get an opportunity to prosper their inventions into the world, because no one pays attention to it, he's just an odd ball items people of the place, as it were. After bluff their way into Birnley textile factory, he uses his laboratory, to achieve its goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wear, but should never be cleaned!. He first declared a genius, and those who ignore it for the first suddenly want a big piece of it, but then fatal harbingers of the industry raises its head to go bankrupt and recognition quickly turns into something much more terrible. <br /> <br /> So the film is very funny, in fact, some of the scenes of the dam is hilarious, but it's a satirical edge to the film, which lifts it way above the usual for me. Controversy over the appearance of technology is an important topic here, we want to inventions that save us fortune while closing branches ?, You only have to see what happened to the coal industry in the UK, to know that I d. Films of the decade very important point was made to mark the production of nuclear weapons has become more than just a rumor, science moves to a frighteningly new proportions. You will see this film and see a quick turn of events for the main character Stanley, the enemy character in one foul swoop, a victim of his own pursuit of better mankind !, It's a dark film should of been called The Man In The Black Suit. <br /> <br /> I really can not find anything wrong with this film, Roger MacDougall scenario, John Dighton, and director Alex Mackendrick can be taken today and it would not be such a place is the sharpness and the thought in mind it is. Sound and setting huge, seamless direction, tone shift cleverly processed Mackendrick. Some scenes just fine, one in particular, tugs at the heart strings and makes one think of some of the scenes of David Lynch's The Elephant Man, about 29 years later, and after all this fall events, the film still manages to take a wink as a genius, Alec Guinness gets to close the film to the audience to reflect not only the future of Stanley, but we are all in this fast-paced world. <br /> <br /> timeless masterpiece thematically and as a work of art, 10/10.
