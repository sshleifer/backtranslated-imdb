The second part (in fact, the episode 4-8) with the hit Danish TV series is slightly inferior to the first, but there are a lot of laughs and scares as well. At this time, Udo Kier plays two parts as a monster child and his demons, like his father. Other parts of the standout at this time are Dr. Søren Pilmark's Krogshoj, who must face the terrible vengeance Dr. Helmer, and once again, the patient Mrs. Drusse trying to unravel the mysteries of Miss Marple style. Cum on climax after the death of the leading actor Ernst-Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffs (Mrs. Drusse), you are wondering how they're ever going to be able to making Part III, but I hope that von Trier It gives it a shot. Unfortunately, of Morten of company Leffers, the Down's syndrome dishwasher # 2, died soon after, as well. Look Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo role. ***
