Visconti's first film has all his trademark visual style and impeccable technique, accompanied by compelling performances from Zhirotti ~ d as a handsome drifter and, best of all, Clara Calamai like a fairy possessed Giovanna. I remade several times as "The Postman Rings Twice," but never improved. I can not believe that this was the first film of this man! This shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of his career.
