I read that Jessie Matthews came over and turned down the starring role with Fred Astaire in the girl's in trouble. Jessie Matthews in his prime never left her side of the pond to make any American musical films. If they were united for this film he would be once in a lifetime event. <br /> <br /> It is a pity, because the girl is in trouble has everything else going for it. Fred Astaire, the story and adapted to the screen of the author Wodehouse resident, Burns and Allen for a comedy, and songs by Gershwin brothers. In response to a question posed Nice work if you can get it, there is not much you could ask for more for this film. <br /> <br /> In addition to leading lady. Although Ginger Rogers made several films of Fred Astaire, the girl is in trouble Aster single film made without Rogers while they were a team. Young Joan Fontaine was cast in the opposite Astaire. <br /> <br /> Her character does not have any bite, that part of the Ginger Rogers to make these films. All she has basically do is to act sweet and demure. In addition, she did not contribute musically. And if I had to evaluate all the dancing partners Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine will be released at the bottom. The poor woman just a terrible thing in looking for a room. <br /> <br /> If it appeared later in the musical with Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it is no coincidence that Fontaine is given nothing to do musicals. <br /> <br /> I have a version of it is painted one, and in this case I think it's really something good. Idyllic gorgeous green English countryside resident Wodehouse really brought this VHS copies. Especially in this issue I mentioned before with the aster and font, which takes place in the garden. <br /> <br /> Burns and Allen, on the other hand, like a pair of old vaudeville paratroopers complement Astaire in great style in the Stiff Upper Lip number surreal sequence of home entertainment has delivered amazing. <br /> <br /> resident aristocracy in Wodehouse runs the gamut from Constance Collier at its best, and strutting when Montagu Love as font parents as a good man in the film. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit with A Damsel in Distress is a foggy day, maybe the best known song of the British capital, as London Bridge is falling down. Done at best, a simple elegant style of Fred Astaire, this is one of those songs that will endure as long as London tolerate and even after. <br /> <br /> With views of the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, maid Rates distress as a classic, the classic account, classical dance, classical comedy. Who could ask for anything more?
