Take this film for what it is, and not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not epic, like the original, it is a popcorn thriller. Visually, it's unbelievable. Everything else was just OK. <br /> <br /> For what it is, I think the film is awesome, but I like all that Burton did. People need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world, b / c this film. It should not be a remake, and it is not. <br /> <br /> ending was cool. I took it as a parallel universe.
