This is one of the three 80-movie that I can think of is that there were, unfortunately, overlooked at the time, and, unfortunately, so far forget. One of the other House of clowns was directed by Victor Salva, the film terribly out due to legal / Salvia sexual problems. Still Closet Cameron, who strikes me as somewhat undervalued - not great but not as bad as the reviews I've seen. Paper House is worth your time, and I think this is one of the most silent movies that just stick in your mind for much longer than you might think. I mean, 10 years after I saw him, and I still have to give him some pause, while the fact that I could see 6 months ago went on the air.
