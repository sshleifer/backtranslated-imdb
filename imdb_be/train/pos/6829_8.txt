Gena Rowlands plays an actress who is losing his grip on reality, when she sees the death of her fan. It is becoming more mistakes from reality, and as a result of her emotional turmoil invade her work as an actress. In the sense that it breaks all the rules of action and improvises everything, but still manages to attract its audience makes the film interesting (if a little self-esteem) as parallels own struggle Cassavettes' as a filmmaker. There are so many ideas were thrown around, and as a result it becomes a little confused (I have yet to reflect the link between the dead fan and Rowlands, among many other things), but the way they are presented at their most raw form makes it consistently interesting and thought film. It would be great on a double bill with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
