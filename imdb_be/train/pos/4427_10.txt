Sogo Ishii took the old myth of Musashibo Bank and became its head, to produce a dark, bloody, fascinating and stunning film. Those who are not familiar with the descriptions do not need to be; story explains itself well as it goes forward. Well worth looking for, even if there is no English version of home video.
