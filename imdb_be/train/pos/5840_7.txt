While the premise of the movie pretty lame (Oli diagnosed with «hornophobia»), film expensive and a nice little movie. It's also a darn bit better than the films they go to do after this - probably because it was the last production of Hal Roach film Laurel and Hardy. In fact, it would not be a bad idea, do not see their latest films, as well as all chemicals are lost in these films, and the boys play their role purely for pathos - that true Laurel and Hardy movies will never do. They had a bit of an edge, that all subsequent films lack. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie's work at the factory horn. That sounds pretty funny, but it is not. Not surprisingly with all the racket, Ollie is going to a nervous breakdown, and had to take some time off from work. Doctor (James Finlayson - in his latest film with the team) recommends a sea voyage. However, they do not like swimming and Stan has an idea about how to rent a boat tied to dock station - then they can get the whole sea air they want without all the bother! Once they are on the boat, dangerous escaped criminal boards a boat, and they accidentally left in the sea. Fortunately, this part of the movie was really well paced to the end worked out very well. <br /> <br /> While not a big full-length Laurel and Hardy film, it was much better than many of them since he did not have the annoying and distracting musical numbers (eg, BROTHER or Babes In Toyland the devil). In addition, there is a decent amount of physical comedy - something you will not see almost no one after this film. This was partly due to the deteriorating health of boys (and increasing girth Olli) and part of it was due to the overall sluggishness of the later films.
