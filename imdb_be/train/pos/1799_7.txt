I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise make a great couple. This film is really funny, and I love the song. My favorite songs "You can not keep a good dog down," and the song about sharing, I think it's called "What's mine is yours." It was the last film with Bar√ßa, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie, but I find the voice of itching is so interesting to hear. While some of the scenes, I really found scary, I still find it hard to look at the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface scares the shit out of me. Other characters, such as The King Gator, I found very funny. The ending was beautiful, and it was really sad, made me cry a little. I give this film 7/10.
