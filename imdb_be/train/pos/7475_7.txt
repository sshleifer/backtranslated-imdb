After reading some very negative views on this film, I was not sure if I should shell out some money to take it off. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant surprise. I have not seen the original film, but when it is better than this, I would be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives good results as seemingly unstable David to convince me that he is more than a smile on his legs (only the third time in his career- other examples were magnolias and Born on the Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz a little easier, but it fills the requirements for the roles, as does Diaz. The only disappointment slightly BLAND Kurt Russell. In the film, however, it is not an actor, what is actually impresses- it in the film industry. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe in the lead role of the director in ensuring themselves a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick. The increasing insanity of the film perfectly executed Crowe (short sequence where the cruise passes through the empty pore area is incredibly effective). Soundtrack (distinguishing feature Crowe film) as elevated. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenge as a spectator. The plot does seem a little far-fetched, but the issues explored him infinitely negotiable. The film is not perfect, but a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe, and for those who grew up on a diet of Hollywood gloss, should be an eye-opener.
