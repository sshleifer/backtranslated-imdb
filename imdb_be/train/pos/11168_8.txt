It covers from the real-life exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in 1890 in New York, "Plantation" is a high energy and good-natured <br /> <br /> But keep in mind :. Casual racial epithets drain language Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper bit. The very first shot can be strange. This refers to the time it was installed, and this has been done time. And it also speaks about the diversity of the population in this neck of the woods. This, of course, adds to the flavor of the rough atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Beery, like Connors is full of thunder in the middle of action, loud throat goalkeeper salon with its own fire brigade. And he has a soft spot for malicious Orphan Cooper. Raft as Brody is slicker Connors, it is better to look the enemy in almost every endeavor. Brodie could never dare to turn down and loved the attention, bringing to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge (it is still debated whether actually jumped, he used a mannequin). <br /> <br /> Beery as a bombastic, as always with a put on an Irish-American accent. He's just kind of a rough character to attract the baby, the cat and the lady in distress. This is perhaps the most bustling Raft character ever played, and he even gets to throw in a little dancing (as well as lifting the legs). Again he leading lady bugs (lovely Fay Wray) for prostitutes. Cooper is as tough as any of them, though, he gets a chance to turn into tears. <br /> <br /> The highlight is not jump off a bridge, but no-holds-barred fistfight between Connors and Brodie that close, looks like a real fight between the principal. This one is sure that the bruises over ego.
