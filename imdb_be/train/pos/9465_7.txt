Steve Carell stars again in a light romantic movie of choice, family and pressure. By the looks of the cover story and the movie I expected flat out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Of course, the film was some comedy, but he felt much lighter drama Me and Steve Carell once again praised the performance. The film itself does solve the true observation, and it was a strong element I found. But the ending felt a little rushed and predictable. Through rolling out, cinematography was great, the action was great, and it delivered the message was clear, but still very important. Although, it comes down to the old, flat and predictable ending. I think that if the various options were made at the end of the film (perhaps for the worse, even), this film will get better advertising. Nevertheless funny film.
