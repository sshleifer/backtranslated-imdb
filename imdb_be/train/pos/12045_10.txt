I first saw this movie when I was a kid and this is the only time in my life that I can remember putting my hands on my face and eyes in horror at one particular scene. I remembered it from my monotonous disscusion friends and quickly bought it on video with a lot of hesitation I might add (to my surprise, I just found on the Internet in the United States, when it was made in England!) When I looked at it again my reaction and, to my surprise, it was almost the same, with the sheer terror and fear, and never has my heart beats as well. It is in my opinon the worst movie ever made, Hollywood movies seem tame by comparison and a little pony and Trap (shit), excuse the pun. What is surprising, though the strength of the film and to the university, viewed it with about twenty of my colleagues, I have never heard so many screams of boys as well! Even the kind of video brings the fear of God in me with this one particular scene, and left me feeling that I'll never walk alone again in the dark !!!!
