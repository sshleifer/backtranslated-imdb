This tangled de SIC delivers the goods. And he said: "The meek shall inherit the earth." This is a story about the classes on the surface, but in fact an allegory for all the homeless who inhabited Europe after the great war. They are homeless, but cheerful, for societies are too poor and selfish to care or recognize them, rugs for the Italian carpetbaggers. De Sica wanted to tell him, like a fairy tale, the story of Cinderella. I have not read the book, it is based on so I can not foresay, when Deus Ex Machina is a writer design or Vittorio. It begins with the words "One day ..." to illustrate the hard times of his story, as the story can be installed anywhere and everywhere. Caricature drawings of the aristocracy, which cut to the bone, capricious nature of homeless people, especially when they begin to provide their wishes and end straight out of the picture Spielberg makes it Boulange fun for everyone. The most accessible picture of De Sica is also one of his best. Refusing neo-realism, he always entertained between it and clean old-fashioned filmmaking, he creates a film that breaks the heart, and at the same time fills it sums the hope that one must continue to go out in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
