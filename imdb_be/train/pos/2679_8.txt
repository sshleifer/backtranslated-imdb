Delirious, not far from the site of at least the mood of the piece, and if it is more LSD inspired than the devil, we must remember that it was done! After an amazing opening SM (even that in itself is not what it seems) we come to the mild and dream or dreams or remember ??. Many literary and cinematic link and actually is a film Franco, who he praised Lang. Beautiful and charming story takes place at a slow pace, but there is a wealth within each pleat. Rare film languish inside. Old Jessica could do it when he tried. Thin central performances also including indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I have not even mentioned the place Lisbon - ah!
