Let's cut the long story short. I loved every minute of it. Generous imagination in the true style of Arabian-nights. There's also an evil wizard, pretty princess, gin and everyone lives happily ever after. Modern Hollywoond sure has a thing or two to learn from this classic. Only quibble: the special effects are quite dated (Saba liked a leg Gina, though!)
