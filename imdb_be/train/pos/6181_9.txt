Very nice movie, providing you know how to watch old musicals / mystery. He can not come close to Agatha Christie, or even lean man mystery as film noir, but it's much more interesting than your typical "boy meets girl" or "let's put on a show" backstage musical. In the musical, it's not Busby Berkeley or release unit, but it can enhance the classic "Cocktails for Two" and wonder "Sweet Marijuana". The film works in real time during the show on stage, opening night of "vanity", where the murder - and soon the other - found the scenes. the killer before the curtain falls found? Of course, but the search for fun, although somewhat predictable and overshadowed comic bursts (fortunately, in the form of a slender goddess chorus girls, Toby Wing). Stupid cop is just too stupid, a leading hero's just a little too cute, the leading lady a little too merciful, the bitchy prima bit too cynical and too selfless love Homeless, but as patterns go, they are pretty stylish. There's a bevy of truly beautiful chorus girls who are chosen is even better than girls, for Busby Berkeley musical of the same period, which sometimes tend to be a little on the plump side. Yes, this movie could be a lot better than it is, and the number of Duke Ellington is hard, but if you like to dive in the old movies, it would be extremely teases trip.
