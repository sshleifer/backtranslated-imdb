If any show in the last ten years, deserves a 10, this is a rare gem. This avoids back to a time when things were easier and more fun. Filled with heart and laughs, the show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly clothes were colorful, and even drugs are tolerated. Hair birds, music accompanied roller skates, and in the words of Merle Haggard, "a joint was a bad place to be." Take a trip to the great time in American history. Fall in love with the characters and feel good essence of a small town, where people were better with each other. This is a classic television as well as «Full House». Do not miss it, and always remember to "shake the groove thing !!!"
