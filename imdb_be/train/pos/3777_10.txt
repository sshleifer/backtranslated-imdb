Anyone who does not think that Bill and Ted Bogus Journey is one of the greatest films of all time needs their head checked. It is some way manages to be completely meaningless and easy task, but also scary, knowing and intelligent at the same time. One of those rare movies that actually improves on its predecessor, Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again. Notable highlights include a duel to the death and the ending, which is very "emotional". Keanu wants to forget all that garbage Matrix and go do what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
