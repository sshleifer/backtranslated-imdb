It's pretty CI film ... Yes, some of the lame and extremely comfortable, and the film does not justify the big star of the (AB, SD, Tanuzha). However, the actor who really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK). In the scene where he first meets the character Amitabh, I thought that a man who can just look at AB, keep looking and do not say a word, and still looks strong, is certainly a good actor. In fact, he showed himself worthy again in Sarkar, along with AB for the second time. This guy needs to get more roles, it is beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you've read any of the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the story, and I agree that the entry Akshaye Chana in Pakistan was too easy. And a small corner of love, which he shares with the "what's-her face" was completely unnecessary. But he's a pretty good actor (as seen in DCH), dat is cool to watch, always. and AB ... what can I say. I do not know when I'm a big fan in the world, but I know that I can definitely compete for a spot. <br /> <br /> An interesting hour, considering it Bollywood, a little inspired by Hollywood hits like «The Great Escape» and "Bridge on the River Kwai".
