I read a comment that called this film "trash" and "waste <br /> <br /> time." I think that this person got their political immortal pulled a little <br /> <br /> too much. <br /> <br /> I just hired a new criterion of DVD-s as yellow and blue. <br /> <br /> these films - though hardly great - at least become <br /> <br /> historical interest as a so-called "radical student <br /> <br /> political and social movement "late" 60s. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the picture, and their notorious reputation, I <br /> <br /> expecting some real porn (was not there.) There is a front <br /> <br /> nudity (including even Verboten frontal male nudity (automatic <br /> <br /> NC-17 - Orwellian-X) in the US, but I did not expect the film <br /> <br /> your face democratic socialism message. <br /> <br /> Although, as a rule, simply, I thought that it was an accident made <br /> <br /> its point well. both films were randomly laugh me <br /> <br /> and director's commentary made it clear there was sh mat <br /> <br /> parodies in the film. Especially osedly "pornographic" sex supp <br /> <br /> scene. The first such scene is very realistic. The lead pair <br /> <br /> bumbling, inept, funny and cute in her first scene of copulation <br /> <br /> second -. which caused the most complaints - forged <br /> <br /> cunnilingus and fellatio, and the last end of a vicious fight, <br /> <. br /> that believable. <br /> <br /> The extras include an informative introduction to the film, <br /> <br /> interviews with the original American distributor and his lawyer, <br /> <br /> excerpts from trial testimony in US and "diary" comments <br /> <br /> by the director on some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a film that "Blue Noses" let alone led to <br /> <br /> main "prurient interest, without social redemptive value" standard <br /> <br /> that fortunately, still stands. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in the quirks of history will find it has <br /> <br /> see.
