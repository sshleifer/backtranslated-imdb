Well, I would consider Police Story as one of the best film of Jackie Chan. Storyline, action scenes and stunt work perfectly. In this movie he played the role of Jackie police officer named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chang in some versions), which successfully arrested a crime lord. After the crime lord was freed due to lack of evidence, he is framed for the murder of a police officer Chan. In this regard, he was wanted by the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was secretary to Bishop crime, went to the mall and began to steal evidence of criminal offenses Lord from your computer and prepares to transfer them to Chan. However, the crime lord knew Salina downloaded it incriminating evidence and hired his followers to seize it. Later, Chang appeared on the scene and began to fight with all of the scrap by breaking them one by one. In the last scene, Chan was seen punching a crime lord. And finally, this is the best action and comedy. Each person must look. Highly recommended.
