Ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it has no land should not be looking for "Jean de FlorretteÂ». GOOD DAY! This film was made at random comedy act and does not include the land in any way shape or form. I would also like to remind you that these needs, if you're going to tear the shit out of this film, they do not seem to have enough points. This film clearly made for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor," which seems to me a bunch of crap grubby. The fact is, everyone has an opinion, and you have to be a little more grateful that some people a sense of humor can not be in accordance with your own before shooting his mouth off. <br /> <br /> Thankyou
