It was a great film that had a lot of issues are under. She dealt with the rascism and class. But it was also a message, knowing yourself and take responsibility for themselves. This film was very deep, he gave the message that you and only you can control your destiny. He also revealed that, knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you'll ever fit into society. What others think of you does not matter. I believe that this film has done an excellent job of showing it. Actors, I think, were able to convey each character perfectly. I just thought it was strange how deeply this film really was. At just sliding sight you do not see how deeply the film but upon further look, you see, emphasizing the importance of the film.
