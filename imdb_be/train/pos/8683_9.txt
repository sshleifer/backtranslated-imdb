"Death to borrow Hand" is one of the key early episodes «Columbo", which helped to define the show for the next thirty years. It marks the first of four performances of Roberta Culp (three as a murderer), he plays much the same role in each show. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp played Brimmer, head of a large private detective company, please investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate, Mr. Kennicut, deals. Despite the fact that she, Brimmer decides not to talk Kennicut, in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in exchange for pieces of information about the business partner of her husband. It does not react to the proposal, the argument follows, which is quickly becoming tough as Brimmer slaps her face. Because he wears a large ring, the impact knocked her down and kill her. <br /> <br /> There are some really priceless moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes where Columbo pretends to palm reading, although it is actually a ploy to open the form and size of the ring without Brimmer admit that he knows that the murderer wore a ring. Columbo Columbo being, it only shows that he knows when the time is right to turn the screws a little. Thus, it was originally part of goofily plays pretty simple person who gets excited "lifeline going along the embankment of the month," or some equally ridiculous fetish palm reading. <br /> <br /> Another beautiful scene when Brimmer Columbo tries to offer work for the firm, effectively bribe him to stop poking his nose around. Again, Columbo Sun shows that he knows what is happening, he pretends to be honored and excited by this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there's where Columbo says Kennicut, before Brimmer that he wants the killer could hear their conversation. He wants Brimmer hint that he has not directly accusing him, so he's pretty tough (but understandable in the circumstances) decides to play on Mindgames Brimmer to irritate him in panic and do something stupid. Which, of course, it does! All this time, the grieving Kennicut not aware of the subtext of the conversation. It is only towards the end that explains everything Columbo Kennicut (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I will not reveal how Columbo finally nails the killer explosion right, but let's just say that there are potatoes involved. .. <br /> <br /> And in fact, a very good episode, perhaps the best of the first series. If you liked this, then you will like «Double Exposure», too, also starring Robert Culp.
