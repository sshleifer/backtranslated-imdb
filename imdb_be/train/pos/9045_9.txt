There are a few small things that are worth noting about the scene early in the film, where Homer is watching try 6 December 1957 (at least, it used the video on the TV, he watched), which showed an attempt to launch Vangard, which failed. <br /> <br /> It is shown next to the reading or dictating a letter Dr. Von Braun offering condolences to the failure. <br /> <br /> Von Braun was the center of the Marshall Space Flight in Huntsville working for the army. Vanguard project was at the beginning of the NASA team that was the fact that it soon became Goddard Space Flight Center. <br /> <br /> In the army rushed Jupiter-C, which was essentially made by the United States V2 technology, but worked to start a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This error can be actually were made by Homer, because of the fame of von Braun, but his team is not their efforts fail. In fact, in Redstone based flew out of 52 and was the first US man rated booster used for the sub orbital flight of Shepard and Grissom. <br /> <br /> That's why this kind of a movie is as good as it is, we hope, will inspire people to read and identify these trifles bits, and in the process to see what has been done, and be inspired to do more .
