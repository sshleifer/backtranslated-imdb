Nevertheless, it works so well, especially with Peggy in the front seat. The film is ultimately very smart, plays well on transatlantic relations Pegg shares with his co-stars and the merger of the cross between high and low society -Life is good enough and fully refreshing in a storyline that, despite the predictability of some of the unique travel .

From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack all meshes nicely into what can only be described as an intelligent comedy.
