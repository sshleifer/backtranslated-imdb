From the first scene, I was very pleased. "I can say that this is going to be awesome!" I thought. The action was so good, I felt as if I was listening to these people's lives. The music was too exquisitely disturbing. The plot began with a sudden event, and then carried forward (felt) to some irrevocable fate. Build has been slow, but I personally like things at the time, as the voltage remains quiet on the road and not get derailed before it is ready to pay off. <br /> <br /> So all is going well, and then the fireworks started, and before you know it, the credits roll. "WHAT? !!!" All I and my companion movie night could say. If you understand the director's intentions, the blunt end of it makes sense (for those of you who have seen the film already, check out a very exciting and fun interview with Larry Fessenden in filmcritic.com), but I can not say it did not steal quite true. <br /> <br /> This could probably be solved with just ten minutes more material until the climax. In any case, this is very bad. These ten minutes could make all the difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write or make movies, you should be aware that processing the story arc with the correct time, an enormous pain in the ass, and I'm certainly not doing this criticism of every kind pedestal!) <br /> < br /> Wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece, which was given on before it was finished. But hay, I would take a weakened masterpiece in every day for more than a piece of dog poo productions overlapped with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days). <br /> <br /> One other comment, Some scenes monster left me confused if I should be scared or laugh. I do not know how to explain it, but he was clearly Monty Python feel about this monster in its more blatent «monster» form. Although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie - I did not know he was still working for me in some crooked way. I'll never look at deer antlers in the same way again! :)
