This film is visually stunning. Who cares if she can act or not. Each scene is a work of art, composed and captured John Derek. Places, scenery and costumes perfectly functioning, to pass on what is in the love story, which consists of beauty, youth and wealth. In a sense, I would like to see this film as a tribute to John and stories After Derek. And ... this comment would not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as his father, a teacher, a lover, a man and his image, man, we lost to a bygone era, when men were men. There are some of us who find value in strength and direction, wrapped in confidence, which contributes to a sense of trust, security and deterrence. Yes, they do not make people like this anymore! But, how often do you find women that are made as a fact Derek.
