Very funny east meets west film influenced by the closure of GM Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the growth and integration of Japanese automakers in the United States. Located in western Pennsylvania, it has great performance of Michael Keaton, Hedda Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
