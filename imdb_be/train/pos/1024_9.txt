I was not always a fan, but the show has grown on me. It was not until after the season 5, I began to see the richness of the show. They finally brought the search for Daniel Jackson for his wife to the end, and finally, most of the Go, Ould System Lords were killed by warring lords, SG-1 or more. <br /> <br /> Before the 5th season, Stargate SG-1, began to go out of fashion. With new writers and scrutiny by Produer Peter Deleuise, the show became more and more solid. <br /> <br /> Face obsolete as well. Colonel ONill was stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting accident O'Neill weapon, he decided to end his life by going to Abydos to face with Go'ould RA. Character offers little growth for any actor and the actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play it straight rising emotional barriers to protect themselves. allowing only his close friends in. <br /> <br /> Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter. She was a feminist at the edge, ready to fight anyone who would doubt its ability to do its job. Although this character had little space for growth, tapping did a great job focusing on strong Carter. She took the time to get a general idea about some of the things, Carter says, so that it can represent the character intelligently. <br /> <br /> Christopher Judge joined the cast playing the alien Teal'c. Teal'c an alien called Jaffa. Baby Go'ould (snake-like creatures) will embed themselves in Jaffa, until they have grown to the point where it will be inserted into another form of life. Jaffa will die. Teal'c was the first prime of Apophis's army. Knowing that Apophis was not a god as Go'ould kind, he realized that the genocide of their army was wreaking on the galaxy. Finally, having enough, he and Jack ONill freed his team with a lot of innocent people. Upon arrival to Earth, he realized that the Earth was a planet, he was looking for someone to help him fight the Go'ould. Christopher Judge did very little with the limited nature. Teal'c wise warrior, much of which he learned from his teacher was Master Bra'tac. The show would not be complete without a master Bra'tac played Tony Amandola. He is also a rock. Eventually, he became an adviser to the majority of SG-1, especially Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Don S. Davil was there from the beginning played Major General George Hammand. Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond makes him sympathetic and normal. It does the job, a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. You can tell that he is the anchor base. Simply put, I would die for that person. If you would not allow his superiors to provide troops to support the teams off world. He will go himself. He did not leave anyone behind. <br /> <br /> I have saved Dr. Daniel Jackson in the past, because this character is, I believe, has increased most of all he was ten or eleven years. When you select I do not think Shanks, the producer realized how strong would Shanks and now, when people are talking about Jackson, they do not talk about Spader, they talk about the shank. In the early years, the character of Jackson came as a whiner. That's why I probably was not a fan. How to insert the seasons, the character became stronger. It gave him confidence. In the end, as the season of 10, the character of Jackson has matured to such an extent that it became an independent sacrificing hero. He still controls a group ethic. He still leads in providing information that can move forward any mission. Acheaology, history, culture and intelligence are part of his being. He is determined. Although a man of peace, he had time to such an extent that, using his weapons may be the only way to resolve differences. <br /> <br /> Other characters include recently: Val Small Doran (Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder), the new leadership of SG-1. Both the actor came from a series called Farscape and why they were put together any bodies guess. I see a big difference between Mitchell and Crichton (Farscape character). Black character just from the wall. Definitely different from its soldier as a character Arina Soon.
