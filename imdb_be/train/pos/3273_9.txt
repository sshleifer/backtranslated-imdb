I give it 9 out of 10 only because I need to view it again, in a current frame of mind to have a fresh look. What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that blinded my mind and my eyes when I watched it. I would watch it every time it came on HBO back in the day (probably 1990 or so). I could even recorded, but that is already long gone, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote GreenCine, to try to get the title, they are currently not wear his time. I hope I can find it at your local video store. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend to give it a try, if you can find it somewhere. Interestingly, at least. If you enjoyed films such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or anything like enough, and along these lines, try this.
