Very well done and terrible horror film by poverty row film company China, which, as a rule, put really bad films like DEVIL BAT or flying serpent. German director expatriates WisBar makes a miracle with a small budget and a set of studio cover of marsh. Gaunt and disgusting Charles Middleton effective as a choker.
