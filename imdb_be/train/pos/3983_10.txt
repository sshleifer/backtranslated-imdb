It is worthy of his nomination for the prestigious Hollywood award, is an entertaining little gem with lots of Pizazz and some pleasant surprises. Incredibly funny scenes include fun to shoot (and re-shoot) from WW1 trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook both optimistic nya-whom and hapless McDoakes as a messenger Boyer / Coleman ?? all under the eye beads enthusiastically irascible Passion Ralph Sanford; lost McDoakes directed and guided again just surprised Jack Carson; Deputy Director Chandler rejoicing in McDoakes sent opportunity: "I'm going to be a director!Â» <br /> <br /> Ace comic O'Hanlon has a dual role, playing himself as a McDoakes plays McDoakes! Ironically, Richard L. Bare, who really plays itself in one or more other entries in the series, has rejected this possibility here. In real life, Bare is a youthful, six feet Rock Hudson look-alike, but here it reflects the veteran actor (more than 500 films!), Jack Mower.
