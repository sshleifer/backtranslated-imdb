I absolutely loved this film. I'm not even sure what exactly about this, but I think it was fine, and should be available for the DVD. Women were strangers and even organized enough to have a good time, they did a villa in Italy. Actors, in my opinion, has done an excellent job. The characters were all so different, and yet clever story that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship issues all at one time. It requires 10 lines, but I just can not think of anything to say, so I just talk until I get 10 rows. So sorry about that. What else can I say, maybe it's been a long time since I last saw him. I'm looking forward to see again, but it is not available.
