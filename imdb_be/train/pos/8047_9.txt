I stumbled on this film by chance and really enjoyed it. Busfield character is without redeeming qualities, and at one point, staring women Busfield and Meloni stars as they walk past ... take Meloni parade differ from Busfield years. Janel Malone is stunning ... It is very similar to Tea Leoni, but the main difference is that Janel can actually ACT. Some very good things in this movie and worth your attention, if it is on cable.
