Rated E <br /> <br /> I've never owned a Nintendo 64, but I played a lot of times.In my opinion, along with Conkers Bad Day Fur, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I played this game many times and it is good every time.If you have in N64 and does not have this game, you should try to find it.The original Super Mario Bros game was scrolling video game, but Super Mario 64 has a 3D-Mario in a good game 3D environment.The is a kind of strange, but there are many things that you can do in the game game.You like Super Mario and again you have to save Prince Su and 120 Power Stars from Bowzer.Now you can do it in 3D environment.Super Mario 64 is a lot of fun and a good game of N64, and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
