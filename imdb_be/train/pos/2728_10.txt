Simply one of the best ever! Richard Brooks' adaptation of non-fiction novel by Truman Capote really is an artistic achievement. Excellent black and white film (which should win an Oscar), a haunting account of Quincy Jones and great performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, strangely matched the killer. This film was 0 for 4 Oscars and was not even nominated for best film at the time as Dr. Doolittle was. Go figure it out! <br /> <br /> While you may not know the Clutter family, and you have in the book, it was a good decision to focus on Perry and Dick, and the process of tracking these guys down the pain staking John Forsythe is also impressive, as the Alvin Dewey. There's just no flaws in it. 10 out of 10. The best performance with Wilson = Scott R. Blake second place. It is highly recommended!
