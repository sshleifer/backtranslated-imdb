This is, without doubt, the greatest film ever made. It is almost incomprehensible, even with a large number of repeat screenings in an attempt to find out what exactly is going on. The film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers, commercials, contests person comes in the mail, as well as many other innovations. Also, what other films have cameos from Martin Luther King Jr.? To decrypt a movie director to track down a book called I Was Curious. It all becomes clear. This is a big and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking. Triumph. Now if only someone has released a version with subtitles in color * other * than white ... white subtitles are usually washed and become invisible.
