Arguing about «The Great Escape» I let my mind wander back to this little gem of a film of my childhood. I read and re-read an autobiographical novel in 1949, which inspired him, and when he went to a single movie (we never used this word when, in fact) in the city, which showed "foreign" films, I was first in line, to buy my ticket. <br /> <br /> as someone brought up on wartime newsreels and propaganda films during World War II, I had an avid interest in the study of the reality of this conflict, as reflected in the memories and stories of people who were there in person, This It applies later a keen desire for many years to buy any book on the subject, and eventually read equally compelling stories of Hans Helmut Kirsten and Erich Maria Remarque, which provided an even deeper sensuality. Version of the film, however, unlike this one is that they are rarely delivered goods. <br /> <br /> On Wednesday, the black-and-white film never served so well, as it was in those years. I've never seen any version of Technicolor war that seems as real as it makes deep chiaroscuros films as "wooden horse." If it is true that we are destined to always be a prisoner of our childhood images, I admit it freely. <br /> <br /> And never would still loves Leo Genn as a sign of the British war hero on film. Not even Sir Alec.
