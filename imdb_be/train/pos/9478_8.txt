This is a good little movie with a good story, which plays the most important role in the whole film. <br /> <br /> it's quite intriguing dramatic story, a romance also present in it. History talk slow, but it works very well for its accumulation. The characters are well and drew his actors well. I'm usually not too big a fan of Asian style of acting, but acting in this movie just fine. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is very different in approach and style from other genre films made in the West. In a sense, this film is more advanced since its approach than in the western films made in the same period. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to film its visual style would have been a little better. For the film, which is considered a kind of art-house cinema, this movie is certainly not lacking in some good looking sequences. Obviously, it was quite cheap movie to make, and it was done very generalized. Not that it's bad, it's just to prevent this film with a really clear themselves and shall be exalted above the genre. <br /> <br /> But oh well, this film is all about him a well-constructed stories and characters that are in it. In this regard, the film certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
