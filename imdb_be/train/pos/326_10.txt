«Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow "a lot of fun. As at least one other reviewer, I was, in many cases, to laugh. Yellow energetic, playful, self-awareness, explore. Do not wait Bergman here. This film is about young people in the early- to mid-60s in Sweden and the problems * read * the contradiction that the country and the world are facing. Sometimes yellow, it seems to be a serious socio-political documentary, with Lena, the main character, and other interviews of both ordinary people and politicians (such as Olaf Palme house). At other times, the yellow, seems to mock this kind of documentary. All this time, the yellow acts as a personal documentary explores the life of Lena - her family life, she loves her political views, her gaze on himself. It is a complete man ?? complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And it puts all this great additional aspect of the director, Sjoman, and his team are documenting themselves documenting Lena. That is, it gives yellow wings really for me. Not only do they suddenly appear in some very funny times, and in some fun ways to remind the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but their presence in itself is another layer of the film; they remove themselves shooting himself. I remember Bjork music video with the same quality ?? music video about creating a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration is more surprising and more cartoonish. I think Sjoman may have something similar in mind. While «Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow "may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly clever, witty, refreshing, ebullient, and real.
