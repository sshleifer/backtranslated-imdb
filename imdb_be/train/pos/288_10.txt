This movie was so great! I am a teenager and I, and my friends all love the series, so it just goes to show that these films draw attention to the all ages crowd. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in the movie, when Logan Bartholomew says: "rosy cheeks" when he talks about his little daughter. He's such a great actor, and Erin Cottrell. They pair so well and have such great chemistry! I very much hope that they can work together again. They are attractive people, and very good actors. I finally found the films that look good. Recently, it was difficult for me to find movies that are good and show good moral and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not cheese.
