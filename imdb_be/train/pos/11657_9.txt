The surprise nominee for Best Animated Feature race was at the Oscars. This is an Irish film by heart, but he was co-produced in Belgium and Brazil, with, I believe that the animators work in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique movies in recent years. Character design is a bit like the French animated film Persepolis by a couple of years ago, with a very simple character with thick black outlines. This film is not in black and white. Oh, no. What makes this movie great his use of color, but some of the most outrageous and memorable use of colors I've ever seen. The overall design of the paintings is also much more geometric, with characters that are mostly rectangles or ovals. Much of the film can be made to find a range of games - one of the main aspects of visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All these geometrical structure has a goal - a story about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on manuscripts (Book of Kells is present illuminated Bible film art based on drawings therein). The film's story is not particularly deep, but it is a very good fantasy tale. Brendan young boy in Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle, to keep the Viking. Newbie in Kells, Aiden's brother, Brendan inspired to take is shown. It also inspires him to do things like leave Kells and explore the nearby forest, where the nymph lives. Bruno Coulais provides fantastic value for money, almost as good as the one he made for Coraline, which I think is the best time of the year.
