John Cassavetes Opening Night "is a fantastic and exciting, fantastic, because he plays with the deepest fears we have in our minds, fascinating, because it never ceases to amaze us Due to the very large two-hour i twenty minutes, someone. appreciates the hero will not be able to look away from the screen <br /> <br /> In an unstable actress stories, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) is trying to put himself together for a game, fighting her demons. "Opening NightÂ» is not only a woman on the border disruption, but also about the complexity of life . Ktsorav theater and theater world All Cassavetes characters there are experienced people who know about the world of the theater, so half of the film takes place on the stage, or where performers do their job or in the wings, where the producers and writers and directors do their job <br /. > <br /> Cassavetes so severe his characters, it's unkindness addresses the audience, but the audience in the theater. because there is another audience in the movie theater, which does not know what is really going on, and laugh, because they I think that all the indicators. And it is, in fact, what it is; it's just that the audience in the theater does not get to see "behind the scenes" as we do. They do not feel the wealth Gena Rowlands', before it gets to this stage, but the most important thing; they do not know the reason why she acts the way she does. <br /> <br /> I always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with the actor. Myrtle (Rowland) said that she was an actress, and it's the only thing she knows how to do it; and I think that if I had a friend who was a professional performer, it would be very hard to tell when he is telling the truth, because I know that he's an actor, and he can fake anything at any time. Many things that make Myrtle during the horrific events of the film puts it through ?? We suspect if it is real; other characters are also suspect. <br /> <br /> There are a writer, Sarah (Joan Blondel), who can not understand why Myrtle did not understand the nature of it was written for her. There's also a director, Manny (Ben Gazzara), who can not accept the fact that his best actress can lose it; Producer David (Paul Stewart), who did not know where to stand and roles Myrtle Morris (Cassavetes himself), who can not cope with the love they have for each other. <br /> <br /> When she witnesses the death of a teenager, a fan; it all comes together, and affect the Myrtle, but no one knows when it is nonsense really. They do not say anything because they do not want to upset her, but the film is part of the subconscious state that accepts only Myrtle. From time to time, we can say that everyone has it. In these moments, brilliant script reflects Cassavetes frightening brutal honesty in the words the characters speak in the debate behind the scenes; not just what everyone said Myrtle, but also what she tells them. <br /> <br /> Here are people who are not afraid to speak their minds and constantly changing what they think, as a way to make a Cassavetes film, and in this aspect, the performance is more important than the "Shadows", because the characters involved in the overall picture; great story that comes out of the trivial. <br /> <br /> But in another aspect, the real way to make a movie, this film is no different from the "shadows." There's a wonderful thing the characters shoots the camera the way Al Ruban. If someone says, the camera does not focus on it, it shoots a man who listens; so we can see how he or she reacts to things, the other says. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes happy, sometimes devastated. <br /> <br /> Improvisation may still be there, although, among all these wonderful performances. Toward the end, there is an unexpected scene where Cassavetes and Rowlands start talking non-stop. whether it was homemade or not, it's not something that we have to wonder. We just have to look; and watch as they share life experiences and seeing the words come really alive in the conversation, which means a lot more than what it shows ?? It does not get more natural than that.
