Before watching this movie, I thought that this film will be as big as Flashpoint, because before you watch this movie Flashpoint was the last Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie that I watched before. As for the sex scenes are concerned, I was disappointed, I thought the sex scenes Dreamquest would be great as Flashpoint sex scenes, but I was disappointed. Besides sexual Asia Carrera scene, any sex scene in the movie does not make me feel great (you know what I mean). Big Jenna Jameson does not make these kinds of sexual scenes that she could. Felecia Stephanie Swift and both of these beautiful girls disappointed me, and also how the sex scenes are concerned. <br /> <br /> While his adult movies, but if you are on the side that the sex scenes factor, this film is very good. If the movie standards typical for adults concerned about this movie is definitely raised the standards of adult movies. Story, acting, direction, sets, makeup and other technical material of this film is really cool. The actors of this film did a really good effective, they all did a great job. Dreamquest defined raised the bar for quality adult films.
