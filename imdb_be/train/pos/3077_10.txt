I missed the entire season of the show and started to watch it on ABC's site during the summer of 2007 I absolutely mad about the show. I think that all the actors are excellent. This is one of my favorite shows ever. I just checked the ABC line of products for this fall and did not see it on the chart. It's really sad. I hope they bring it back ... maybe they wait until Moynahan do not have a child? Or is it just my wishful thinking? <br /> <br /> I've been reading some of the comments posted on the show and see so many glowing comments similar to mine. Of course, I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or, hopefully, another station will pick it up.
