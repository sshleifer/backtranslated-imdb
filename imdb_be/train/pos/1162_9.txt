Like most people, I saw Jason Priestley on TV, and I think he's great. But I did not know he had a sister! Justin Priestley just "us" as a neglected Velaus another woman. Good music, intrigue and death scene with Amanda revenge on abusive doctor who will stay with you for a few weeks. I'll leave it at that. Kudos.
