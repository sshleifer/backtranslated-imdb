Being half the Portuguese did not make me half-blind (neither half-biased) in the discussion of Portuguese films. Not that I do that very often anyway. But this film was such an adrenaline rush! Yes, that's right - it was mostly accurate as the story went / goes - but he pulled entirely strikes on venturing beyond the usual territory of the Portuguese-film: such things as using real places in the middle of traffic overloaded Lisbon and recruiting quite a crowd standing behind real crowd nearly 30 years ago. And God has made, they got it right! The OK, to sum up: very emotional, if you lived through it, but you will notice small improvements that could be made, and the story needs to be. If you just look casually, thank you for a good historical romp, with only the most recent kind of history and a little bit more thought-proving than usual. Even by European standards, yes.
