I've heard some friends one day say «Scarface sucks ... some idiot tried to make another Godfather set in the early 80s." Now, I usualy listen to idiots / watch CNN, so I decided that I would stay away from him. Then a friend of mine gave me the DVD and said, "This # 1 of pelicangs», confused I tried. This is the best movie ever made. This is more realistic than all this crap about the race of stolen vehicles, which are too expensive for someone in this area can afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) There is a sense of humor, though ... that is, in the light music and Pelicangs 80th . However, what is better than Al Pacino wielding in M203? I give it a *****, **** is ideal for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
