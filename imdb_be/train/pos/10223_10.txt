* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find sharp criticisms (valid dated dialogue incomprehensible plot) are unfounded. Belafonte big as Brandoesque, threatening, swearing spirit that must earn its wings, but really poorly equipped with his past life to do it. He learns too late as his hustling empty, materialistic life without love. Mostel is as big as a painful dying man with his wife Fanny. In spite of his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness does not allow him to accept (or believe) in the other. Two social worlds of the characters are alternately face and complement the other, resulting in a fun and touching boring. <br /> <br /> confuses the ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film. Looking everywhere Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he desperately reaching for him as if he was finally ready to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to finish his miracle (or restore the health of Fannie or faith in Mostel), so he never got his wings. Feather floats sardonically from Mostel hand, in a metaphor of life and man: it is too late, and you do not get a second chance. As "It's a Wonderful Life," this film is a magical, amazing, funny, but it is very tragic.
