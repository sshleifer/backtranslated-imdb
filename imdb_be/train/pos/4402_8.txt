After viewing all of Jesse James, Quantrill, jayhawkers etc. movies in the fifties, it's quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective of director Ang Lee. Scene of attack Lawrence, Kansas is awesome. Romance between Jewel and Tobey McGuire is one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as the bad guy. All the time this film makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters, who do not know when they are going to survive the next few hours. Definitely worth a look.
