Perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone. For some people the idea of ​​slowing down, reflecting and letting things happen at one time is a good description of his personal hell. For other approach as it tells about some deeper part of themselves they know there is some part of it for a long time in contact with. <br /> <br /> I believe that is a function of where I am in my own life these days, but I find myself in the camp of the latter group. I found that the meditative pace of the film is almost hypnotic, gently guiding me in some area of ​​almost mythological. This is really a story of travel, rich image distance of many of us have to go if we want to come full circle at the end of our days. <br /> <br /> Just as it was written presentation, Mr. Farnsworth Alvin Straight, although I'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of stunned grief and wise innocence, he conjured up for us. Knowing now that it really comes to terms with his own death, when he was sitting on the tractor seat that makes me wish I had the opportunity to spend time with him before he left. I hope he had a little glimpse of pleasure and truth he brought so many people, not just for the "action", but also to share his absolute humanity with such a rigid honesty. <br /> <br /> Given the realities of the manufacturing economy, I'm not sure that full credit was given to Mr. Lynch for the courage he has shown, letting the story unfold slowly. Extraneous production of films, I nevertheless understand that there are few areas of modern life, where the expression "time is money" so accurately descriptive. Going deep in our hearts entirely adventure that can be rushed, and to his credit, Mr. Lynch seems to have realized that he was not just telling a story - he invites his viewers to spend some time with his own mortality. Not an easy task, that. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the power of film to take will introduce you to some valuable part of yourself, you could do worse than spending a few hours with a simple story, and then give yourself some time for the next bit, just listening to his echoes in the small hours of the night.
