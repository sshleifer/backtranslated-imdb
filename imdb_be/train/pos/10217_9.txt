The thrill of a butterfly's wings in the Atlantic could unleash a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean. According to this theory (something to do with the theory of chaos, I'm not sure exactly how), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This little gem of a film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect each other's lives. (The theory of six degrees of partitions can also be used.) Each story is a bezel that is this film. Acts finely tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou, light), a network of believable stories, humor, just, and the audience leaves the theater nodding agree.
