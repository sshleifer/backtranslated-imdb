Take a pinch of GoodFellas, mix it with the godfather, add Roman mythology, and many low-grade comedy, and you have The Sopranos, about a mafia clan, which runs from the northern part of New Jersey. It is almost as interesting as the fight. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire James Gandolfini, Tony Soprano is very difficult, a psychopath with a rare glimpse of conscience. I also came to admire tÃ« contribution of people like gravel-voiced House Chianese as lost, but deadly Uncle Junior, grizzled Ceric as an eternally confused Paulie and very beautiful Edie Falco as a two-faced, hard as nails Carmel soprano. The violence is sudden and schedule, the body count rises steadily every season, but it's often the small things that are most important here. See Paulie and Tony's nephew Christopher (Imperioli late LAW & ORDER), as they get lost in the Pine Barrens and sit a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck, and is convinced that they had it.
