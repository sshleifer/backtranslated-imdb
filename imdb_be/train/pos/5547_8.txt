Ambusher swamp low-budget Chinese studio has been made and is certainly one of his best films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> A man who was hanged for a murder he did not commit a return as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him. It uses a rope to strangle his victims, and after several deaths, including those of an old man who works on a ferry through the swamp, he disappears. old grandson takes over the most steam, and falls in love with one of the local men, and they decide to get married. <br /> <br /> In this film there is a lot of hazy atmosphere that makes it very awful, too. <br /> <br /> Cast includes Rosemary La PLANCHE, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (flash Gordon) as a choker. <br /> <br /> Strangler swamp is a must for old horror fans like me. . Excellent <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
