This game is the best game of James Bond Bond I've played in my life, this is my favorite game of James Bond so far because: <br /> <br /> The mission in this game a lot of fun, they can be very difficult, which makes it more fun to play the mission has a lot of action, weapons you use are really good. Cars in this game are awesome mission car has a lot of action and very fun to play. Voice-over actors are very good, and it's great that Sean Connery makes the voice of James Bond's also a way to look relationship is really cool because it looks just like Sean Connery when he played James Bond in the movies, and the other character looks pretty much as well as to watch in the movies. The graphics are pretty good in this game James Bond. In addition, the game follows the movie very much, but not all, but most of the time he does it great. <br /> <br /> with a total score ********** ***** *****
