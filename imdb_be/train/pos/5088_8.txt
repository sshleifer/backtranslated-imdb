I've never had a premonition while watching the film that it was intended for an idiot box. I always thought it was a very good successful film of the late 90's. But after I saw on the Internet, what it meant for the TV, I was shocked, because for television movie, is absolutely fantastic! <br /> <br /> The fact is that most concerned me was the length. I felt that one-on-one combat scene was deleted as it was not needed. In addition, he began to pull through, as it seemed as if the adventure never ends. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, there is a strong, very interesting and fascinating story with great performances by all. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a little haggard. I also felt that Gogool, who looked dementia was a bit silly in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted with the beautiful scenery of Africa. In addition, the first half of the film would have made me give this film 9. However, its a great film for television. 8 of 10.
