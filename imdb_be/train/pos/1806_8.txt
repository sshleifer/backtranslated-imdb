I want children's films were still made in this way; dark and deep. It was (is) the development of character (and Charlie's is the epitome of the dynamic nature), the story progresses, the highest animation, emotional involvement and rational, Relatable and consistent theme. If not for a handful of songs and dances, you would never have thought that it was a film children, and that is why I give him such high praise. This movie is a great movie, not to mention the children's film. This brings me to the second point: this must be the darkest "children" a movie that I have seen in a while, it comes from the 22-year-old. I would be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 years are not completely afraid all the great deals in the second half, and some of the first half of the film, and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across (ala " jurassic Bark Â», for those of you who are supporters of" Futurama "), and this is what makes this film so well. Just because the film evokes emotions all over the place, we usually do not like to feel bad and to consider not doing the film itself is bad; in fact, it means that it is able to. Good funny movies need to make us laugh; good horror should make us afraid; good sad movies should make us bored. My point is, good films should MOVE you, not just to entertain; This film touched me. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is incredibly aggressive by today's standards for children's film and contains items which, by today's standards, it may not be suitable for some children. Parents, I would say that playing in the first place. I'm not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing, but I just saw this yesterday, and it was a surprise even for me.
