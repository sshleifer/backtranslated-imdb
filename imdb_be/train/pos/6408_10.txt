Classic Hollywood biopic better sense of the genre. Gooding & DeNiro both give impressive performances in the heart of the two designated roles, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent, with outstanding performances Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only "nit" I could choose what role Theron was unnecessary and distracting (not her performance, which was lovely, it's just that the film seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to accommodate its role .) <br /> <br /> In addition, the characterization of the dynamics of action and real-life stories are riveting and unforgettable. The evolution of the main characters, and how what they feel their evolving beings are uniquely characterized by the artists. Despite the extreme length of the film, Shagan remains unchanged throughout. Account is also stunning. <br /> <br /> We predicted that a Hollywood movie? You bet. So, Mike Lee addicts have to deduct a star, but everyone else should enjoy powerful.
