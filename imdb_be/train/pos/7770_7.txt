"Written on the Wind" by Douglas Sirk melodrama in. Sirko was rediscovered in the "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc .. that greeted him as the chief director - I think it's because of the complexity of his film - "Written on the Wind" offers a juicy color drawings and stunning designs but I ask myself whether it is enough to carry the movie? Which operates in the "Written by wind" varies from weak to fair (except for Robert Stack - it is convincing as a weak and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacall, as a rule, a powerful presence on the screen is miscast in this film. Dorothy Malone as the seductress, the carefree "femme fatale" is OK, but it does not have the strength for this role. Rock Hudson is effective but boring. <br /> <br /> The plot has very interesting ingredients. Protagonists: <br /> <br /> Hard patriarch <br /> <br /> his alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never liked disappointed father) <br /> <br /> his frustration and nymphomaniac daughter Marylee (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a woman of principles, a former secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought together with Kyle and love patriarch. <br /> <br /> The secrets behind the door, a love triangle, disappointment, fist, laughing, death, etc. - Well, when I read the summary of the story on the back of the DVD cover, I thought I was in for a treat. My mistake! Why? I'll try to explain: "It is written by the wind" takes on serious and trying to tell the dramatic story. As I have said previously in force, in general, is not good enough - the intensity is missing. There are many powerful scenes in the story, but the actors simply do an effective job. I think, perhaps, with Italian or Spanish actors these scenes would have been fully understood - they end up (for us) in the explosion of laughter or tears <br /> <br /> What do we keep this beautiful movie of Douglas. Sirk. it is not enough for me. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see «Aventurera».
