This is one of my favorite movies, and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (a mental list of the mind), only those on the same level with him are such films as The Lord of the Rings series, Gone and fly home. <br /> <br /> I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the beginning of the film she is a shy girl with a bit of odd background, which has a lot of friends that are boys than girls. It really sucks you in your life. I also, of course, can not fault any of the action hero, or anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> Football was fun to watch, even for someone like me who has no idea about the rules. The film is never boring. Romance is very nice and do not make me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Parents Jesse Indians and there are many picturesque Indian Convention throughout the film, providing a very interesting cultural insight, as well as everything else. The Indian people are also paddle! In fact, this coming of age film about choosing the path that you want and fight for it. <br /> <br /> Feel good comedies are my favorite movies of the genre thanks to this film. They are funny, they are refreshing and they make you feel good! ^ _ ~
