I think one of the reasons this movie was made ... and sent to us, the players who actually play all computer games Nancy Drew. There have been many movies lately based on video games, and I think this is one of them. <br /> <br /> So what this film does not match any books. But this is to follow the game. I buy and play every game Nancy Drew, as soon as it comes out. A game from HerInteractive for "girls who are not afraid of mice!" And some of these games actually won father Choice Awards Gold. They are not only fun, but you can learn a thing or two during the game. <br /> <br /> I took my two children move with me to see him, and they loved it! '10. old has already begun to play his first game in the Nancy Drew day before I took her to see the movie, and it was so much fun playing the game, I thought that she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was right ... it does not just love this movie, but I can not wait to get home to finish his first game and start another. <br /> <br /> My other daughter is only 7 steps, and she also loved the movie, but it's still a bit young and play a game yet, but she enjoys watching her sister play sometimes just to see what happens. <br /> <br /> Game is based for children 10 years old and older, all games are usually pretty reviews descent and are classified as adventure games. For more information about the games just check HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty good, and I'll buy it when it comes out on DVD.
