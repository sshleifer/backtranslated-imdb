Nick Cage Randall Raines, a former car thief who is forced out of retirement when he is forced to save the life of his brother, Kip (Giovanni Ribisi), if he screws up on the job, doing the work of his brothers of stealing 50 cars in one night. He has to get together with his old crew that he could trust to help him get it and get it bro with Dutch. But the police on him, so that he can get it? It was one of the big candidates to do the film again, as the original was far from a classic. And if you do not go into it much waiting, and turn thinking part of your brain, so you can ignore the plot hole ANSA just take the movie for what it is. You will eventually enjoy the ride. See it on a double bill with the "Fast and Furious" on the night of high jokes, just do not take the car for a spin right after it <br /> <br /> My Rank :.
