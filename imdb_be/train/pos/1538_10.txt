This is the best movie I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live just a few miles from the village were the story to take place, and I know how things work in this area in Sweden. The film tells the truth, believe me! He criticizes and appreciates life Dalarna and producer wants people who watch the movie will be more open minded and take better care of your closest friends and relatives. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village somewhere in Sweden (or another country), you will probably also recognize many of the film. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
