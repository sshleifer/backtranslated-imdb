I'll keep this fairly short. I believe that this is an unusual film. I see other reviewers who commented on the fact that it is badly written, poorly shot, has a terrible soundtrack and, worse, that it is not realistic in its portrayal of life. OK, so this may not be entirely true for its entire length, but this film carries a message of hope, some others seemed to have missed. I hope it's not too late to save people from the terrible things that go in so many lives. Gangland violence is real, is not it? That's right, no! This film carries an important social message that cynics might not like, but which, however, should be praised, not humiliated. I watched this movie with great pleasure, at least eight times, each time with the same pleasure every time with the feeling that, perhaps, the world can not be made better, and it is not beyond saving (rather than 2008 in any case). 9 out of 10 from me for it. This is almost perfect, in my opinion. JMV
