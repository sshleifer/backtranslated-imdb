Invisible Ray is a great manifestation of both the existing talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff pulls together a flawless performance as a surly and conflict scientist who seems to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relations with other people, even his wife. He was already a loner personality becomes unbearable when he becomes paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays a professional who is passionate about his work, but still finds time to maintain good relations with everyone, but still does not seem to have any real close friends. It was one of the few of its role as a good guy, and he's playing very well. It is difficult, however, to hear his accent and it is believed that he was French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film is that it was based on "junk science," but, in a sense, even pseudoscience does its job well. Since the idea and theory is completely stupid, they are "relevant" today as they were when the film was shot. And they also, as the forward reaching- and always will be. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie to watch over and over again. I've seen it maybe 5 times this weekend, and I could easily sit through it five more times. The current science and amazingly fun. I highly recommend it.
