I saw this film at the festival in BIFFF Brussel, Spring 2004 What a surprise! This German production, stylish and creative shocker, it's one of the worst I've seen Flick. Keep in mind: this is not a joke! Terrorizer It has a large cast of good actors (as an example: Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, nice production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of hard baked SFX blood, as the Italian horror movies in the eighties. Flesh ripped clean to the bone ... and the blood runs red ... it's wild heart stopper blow you ... and give you some dark dreams ... have to see !!
