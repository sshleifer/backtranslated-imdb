I sat down to watch this film with great excitement and a little hope. I do not think that would be for the film live up to its subject matter. But it absolutely did, and then some. Firstly, I must say that Jared Harris has done an extraordinary job as John Lennon. At times it seemed that Harris directions Lennon. The resemblance is often supernatural, and he clearly learned the manner of Lennon and vocal inflections. Aiden Quinn was quite good as McCartney, taking a striking resemblance to Macca, although he occasionally stumble over his Scouse accent. <br /> <br /> This work of fiction was well-written and well-aimed. It was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur looking through a keyhole in this reunion. a scene on the roof was especially touching as McCartney told Lennon that he had never heard, as a child - that he was a worthy and important, and it can never be his fault that he had been left by their parents. I also enjoyed the scene in the park, where a couple of them danced with absolute abandon reggae group <br /> <br /> May one complaint it would be: I am not sure that John was caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage of his life. He settled in its internal situation quite well, and he was in fact, as we know, very friendly when approached fans. Just a few years later, he was very friendly, when he was the first to come to his murderer's autograph on the day he was killed. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film served to stir up again the feelings that may have once again caught John lived a little longer. I am quite sure that the Beatles would come back together at some point. And I am quite sure that Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I'll watch it again and again. <br /> <br />
