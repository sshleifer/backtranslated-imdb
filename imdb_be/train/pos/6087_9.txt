I saw this movie in the first few weeks it was, (I do not remember exactly when.) I thought it was OK, the movie Ben Stiller. This film is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most jokes Ben Stiller, you have to think about them. Or, as I said, you have a good sense of humor. From a few people on this site, I saw that people did not have anything good to say about it, and he did not get a very good rating, but I would have given him more of this movie, I thought it was very good and had to get the best rating. Maybe this is not the film for you. I just give you my opinion of another person.
