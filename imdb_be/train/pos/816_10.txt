First, I would like to say that, while I know its share of star wars, I'm not a fanatic. I do not know how many chromosomes Wamp Rat has TK427 or extended family. what I know is this: Star Wars, all the movies (to a lesser extent, to 2-series, though), captured something magical. it's hard to say that the button found Lucas and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars more than a movie. it is an idea. <br /> <br /> How, you may ask? I will explain. Star Wars affect the most universal stereotypes, good against evil. it makes it so obvious, so deep that virtually anyone from anywhere can understand the environment. Episode VI is doing very well, making the epic struggle between the son and his father manipulated and used, but in the same, with the addition of a prequel, indicates a further hint history. Suddenly, it's Darth Vader on the front, and the audience understands that this is a story about Anakin, not just Luke. but even up to 1-3 was amazing depth of it all. it felt real, like a capsule from the sky fell on my knees Lucas, detailed historical account of a galaxy far, far away. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is definitely something much higher than normal, and I have to admit, every time I see them, in particular, this one, I feel very little. I feel as if I bumped into a world where good and evil are as clearly defined. I get a tingling feeling when I see them, a feeling that something, somehow, touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope for.
