At forty-something urban explorer / photos and a longtime fan of the original Kolchak: Night Stalker series since early childhood, one of the aspects that really has not been mentioned is the number of urban studies Karl nature began in the series. He always managed to get myself to a high of homelessness, sewer or tunnel after another. Armed only with his trusty flashlight (well, so he had a few outbreaks in the primitive monkey episode tunnel) and his camera, he never wore any other mechanism either to protect themselves or to make research easier. <br /> <br /> Like many here, I recently bought a DVD box set of two pilot films and TV episodes later, and slowly reviewing all shows. And though I remember seeing them in the early 70s when they first aired, it has more than 30 years have passed ... so many of them seem new again and again. Campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and very interesting. They just do not do things like that these days. Now it all regurgitated spin-off with predictable characters and graphics. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter was sitting down to watch the episodes with me and developed appreciation for them (she loves the genre). It gives me hope and faith of the series will lead to new generations of fans for years to come.
