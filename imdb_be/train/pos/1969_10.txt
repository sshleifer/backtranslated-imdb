Frankly, I do not understand why this film was so big "failure" in advertising. Sharon Stone, of course, has not lost its charm and the "touch", as "Basic Instinct". I voted this movie 10 and I'll tell you why: The game opens in London this time. London is a city where Catherine Tramell moved after the events in BI1. It is again the mastermind manipulator of his own class -unchallenged. She "tightening of your brain," as Katherine with such skill that in the end you are not quite sure who the real villain <br /> <br /> As for the technical part of the film :. The only real failure is the team of B-speed actors. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in a cast, compared with her and Michael Douglas, etc. in the first part. I also think that BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone was younger, but she was still quite stunning in its appearance and is only improved with respect to its charisma. Its B-Course "helpers" are not so bad, but I'd like some of the big names actors. <br /> <br /> I think there is a good improvement in the main plot. I think it is much better than many thriller dripping-mill Hollywood crap so easily distributes these days. The plot is large, easy to see, technically, you do not snore in half way through the film, and most importantly -The heather on.
