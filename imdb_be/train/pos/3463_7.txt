I'm a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatle is Paul and John is my least favorite. I already knew quite a bit about the music of the Beatles and the truth behind the collapse, as well as such things as the family of John Lennon and Paul's band Wings. I was interested to see how this film will handle the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the collapse. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this film. Although the history of fiction, many of the links that both musicians were used very accurate. Among them, as Yoko Ono will always be with John, where he had gone, the song Wings "Silly Love Songs» is a number one hit in that year and a concert on the roof of Apple, the studio playing music from the album «Let It Be». <, Br /> <br /> actors did a very good job in the game, John and Paul. Accents can be used, perhaps a little more work, but it seemed that they are a lot, I read the two ex-Beatles used to act as. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was. <br /> <br /> End at first disappointed me, but the more you think about it, the more you will appreciate it even more, it was like he really went into real life. They also show fantastic scenes from «Saturday Night Live», where The Beatles offered $ 3000 to perform at the show. (Compared with other $ 220 million had to offer them) Overall, I was not disappointed with this film. It really gives you more feel for why the Beatles broke up and why they never got back together.
