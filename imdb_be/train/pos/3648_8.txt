"Pandora's Clock" is to capture the unknown / thriller, it's a cross between a movie and a virus disaster movie. This film, which was broadcast in two parts on the NBC show in his debut in 1996, the flight of the aircraft, which is infected with a virus, when one of the passengers simply the occasion of this disease. The US government is a debate about whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while a pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and virus expert (Zuniga) trying to understand something, to avoid catastrophe. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and mini-series, but I liked it "Pandora's Clock." This is one heck of a thrill ride. Jane Leeves ( Â«Fraser" TV), Robert Loggia, and Edward Herrmann (as president) also stars. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
