If this had been done earlier in the Zatoichi series it might be one of the best. That's good enough, since most of them, but the plot and the characters seem to be too complex for the series at the moment. The situation is extremely intriguing: farmers in the province have two champions, friendly boss (at one time) and the philosopher-samurai, who begins his race Grange; how to break the usual local bandits who want to harvest, not because it increases their gambling revenues and their chance to pick up some of the land; their main or powerful ally apparent Puritan, which is death from alcohol and gambling, but secretly betrayed their perverted appetites. (It also reminds Dracula, like thieves in the later films Datoiti tend more and more to do.) These characters have enough sense, so they deserve to be set against Datoiti how it was done originally, but now he lost many of its nuances and changes in some characters, such as a good host and the evil man's sister Zatoichi killed, you need more time, the film has to give, so the story seems to be choppy as if some scenes are missing. In addition, the film shows the dignity of the majority of others in the series: a good effect, sometimes lyrical pictures, creating vivid, believable, and uniquely well-known landscape (the absence of which is clearly in a cameo scene where the director just skips it) and technical quality, which is masked by nature : in a variety of ingenious use of the limited sets, so the limitation does not seem to exist. And, of course, there is the leitmotif of the actor, whose presence, as well as its performance, does all the work. This must be one of the best incurred series in movie history.
