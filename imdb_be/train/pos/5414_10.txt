This happy go successes 1939 military thug based rather loosely on a memorable poems of Rudyard Kipling and his novel "Three Soldiers" qualifies as the first entertainment course on the British imperial army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant provides a chain of blows with his fists up bones than he in all his films combined. Located in faraway India, this six niggardly thread lives on the exploits of the three harsh British sergeants and their native water Gunga Din (Jaffe) unidirectional, who argue with the bloodthirsty cult of bloodthirsty Indians called strangulation. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant in "The Last Outpost"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar-winner Victor McLaglen with "The Informer"), and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., with "Dawn Patrol"), are a competitive trio carbide drinking, violent fights and hilarious alpha male whose years are going to be a fun story because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea business. Of course, cutter and assorted drum MacChesney scheme disrupt Ballentine plans. If their bosses order them back into action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote with «The Shejko Steps Out»), cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham, so that he can not accompany them and Ballantine have to replace it. Half the fun is observed by the principal trying to outwit each other, hating himself. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in great style, and part of how our heroes are caught with Thuggees army. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black-and-white movie.
