I really loved her, though, reading the reviews it was very disturbing me..But like anime fan art I can fully understand this perfect work of art, even if some of them were opposed to my crops and believes..But hey, it's the world of art. . !! beginning of the film is very strong, strange and difficult to understand confusing.it content that make me respect the one who made it.only someone who is very open-minded can make such bold film..it kids..even absolutely lovely and even characters adorable, but they go through some disturbing adventure that can not be erased (sorry if the spelling is wrong) with each memory ..
