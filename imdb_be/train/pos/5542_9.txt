Probably the best picture Producers Releasing Corp ever made, this little piece of horror attracts attention from first to last. Director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he wrote one and more importantly, he knows how to realize their full potential shock on the screen. Not only is the plot involving the characters and exciting painted, but the installation is absolutely out of this world! Almost all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of the grasping that distributed mist. This is a frightening atmosphere complemented by inventive direction WisBar and quite convincing speeches he made of all his players. Excellent Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal heroine, beautiful, energetic yet vulnerable. Robert Barrat not deliver his usual nya-nonsense, straight-down-the-line picture of the local leader, although it is hard to believe that personable, handsome guy who plays his son is not nothing but a later dullsville writer / director Blake Edwards.
