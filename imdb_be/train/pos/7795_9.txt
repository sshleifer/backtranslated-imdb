It will be a different kind of review. I have seen this film twice on TV, and I would like to have a copy, because it suggests that Panama City beach and in the winter time, my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie that I saw, Ashley Judd, and it was great and I enjoyed every other thing I saw her. Sundance reaction impressed me as well as the director, Victor Nunez, having directed and written several films about Florida. This film speaks to me, and I saw nothing with which to compare it. The plot says less than me around. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review.
