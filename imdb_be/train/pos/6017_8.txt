There is no way to resist, "Zabriskie Point" from a rational point of view and try to describe it using words and conventions, you would use for other films. This is because it is not a movie. This is the idea and the feeling that the filmmakers that somehow turned into an object as mundane as a film. What we do not see a sweep of the plot, but rather a sequence of events that we do not see in the movies every day, but already it seems to occur in the background, we are going to deliver, when we hear about a tragic event in the news or from friends . We see our concept of people abstraction entirely us- anyone we know, but we certainly heard about them in a book or on television or anywhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people arguing, driving, and inevitably, running away. Only an escape from what intangible- it is a collective situation and the cruelty that the weight of civilization allowed to exist, but laziness, or ... human nature. Located at the end of 1960s Los Angeles, our players are opposed to and in response to the self-inflicted misery of modern existence. These creatures are effectively blank slates that can display any indication, we can imagine, if we want to. Although the actions taken can be considered as a criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not the criminals. They are human beings who want to return to the familiar, without manufacturing of existence, is outside the normal life they experience every day. Not that they ever happy or sad, but they reach a type of self-actualization when they move on and off the suicide of modern life. They only reach the present life in the natural world, despite the fact that the next victim of modern existence. In the end, Â«Zabriski point" is the praise of the humanities passion for the natural world. Even in the most desolate pieces of land to succumb to our notions of progress, we lose our souls on the way to the death of the human spirit.
