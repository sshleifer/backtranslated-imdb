Red Rock West is one of those narrow noir thrillers we rarely see anymore. It is a well developed, well-acted and does not leave us free ends or unanswered questions, so typical in this genre. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage stars as Michael, an unemployed Texas bully, desperate enough work to drive up to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest in wine, but always on the dark side of fate. <br /> <br /> After failing to get a paid job, Michael stumbles into Red Rock Bar, where owner Wayne (JTWalsh) his mistakes for the assassin he called from Dallas, hired to do in his beautiful, but the death of his wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). <br /> <br /> Michael Wayne gives the necessary details and a down payment for getting a loose Susie. In the absence of intent on following through Michael takes the money, and then sets out to warn Suzanne her impending doom. He also sent a letter to the local sheriff, and exposing the plot splits. <br /> <br /> As fate would dictate, Michael is not going to get rid of the situation that easy. Leaving in the heavy rain, he runs down Suzannes lover. Of course, Michael is Michael, he takes him to a local hospital, where he discovered that he was also filmed. <br /> <br /> sheriff called and as luck would have it, Wayne and local law. Michael manages to escape, being adopted on this last trip, and then picked up by the real "Lyle from Dallas" played with murderous joy of quaint Dennis Hopper. Finding that they paratroopers brothers, Lyle argues that Michael joined him for a drink in, where else, Red Rock Bar. There's Wayne realizes his mistake, and soon he and Laila in hot pursuit of Michael, which falls readily into Suzannes waiting arms. <br /> <br /> As the pace picks up, we learn that Wayne and Suzanne really like armed robbers on Lama to several thefts of millions of dollars. Getting the money has now become the central focus of the film with a series of betrayals, double-crosses and murder. <br /> <br /> The film was very well chosen. Nicolas Cage, as a rule, low key, and Dennis Hopper Lara Flynn Bolye took their respective roles more than enough opportunities. The best performance was at the end of J.T. Walsh, who was menacing, without appearing to be. Walsh was a great character actor who left us too soon. <br /> <br /> Mark Reshoskys picture uses a plurality of unique angles that are added to the unknown and the development portion. The film was further enhanced by the taut directorial style of John Dahl, and rapid-fire editing Morris Chestnut.
