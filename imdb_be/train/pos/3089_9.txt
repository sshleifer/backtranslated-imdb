I'm hooked on it as apparently ABC has licensed the show Pearl TV in Hong Kong. He caught my surprise, as it was a break from listening to anything Chinese. But I started to get reeled in, the actors and storylines just enough NYC and thoughtful. Nothing too incredible, although I think it's very, very stereotypical of them write Damien as a potential black man with a letter !!!! This was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great, and I was sad to learn on IMDb, I can not look forward to watching the season 2, when I return to the United States. I'm just disappointed, like other commentators, it showed the prospects and the quality and taste. But just as it shows that the characters become closer to suggest it is probably more difficult for people to see, if you start to watch a few episodes. What it appears to be too late for the impatient networks.
