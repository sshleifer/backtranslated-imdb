I love movies that do not provide the typical "happy ending", and this is my main reason for my taste this film. Alice dirty (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale), arrested in Thailand for drug smuggling after an anonymous tip phoned to the Thai authorities. The film does a solid job keeping the audience guessing was involved (or) the girls, and Bill Pullman is ideal as a grubby lawyer. Jacqueline Kim turns into a terrific performance as its more kind, generous wife, Yong, who is also a lawyer. I want more girls are abused in prison, while another commentator has suggested, as I have heard that the Thai prison can be very hard. Where this film takes me, however, is its ending. Alice exposes itself offers 96 years in total, so that Darlene may be pardoned, and we (the audience) know that they are both to blame. Any film that defies my expectations ending win extra points with me, and it is well acted drama certainly deserves.
