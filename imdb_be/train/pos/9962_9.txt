I was a little scared to see this film because of its rates. But to live in Italy the title as it will never ever come across, and I like to move so much that I decided to give it a try. And I was surprised! History is different from every other dance movie I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just a "victory". This touching and well-written and well directed. Raya such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubted herself, she is so mature and focused and knowing her talent (and the fact that the talent Rutina Wesley, my jaw dropped to the final dance scene). The way she pursues her dreams and refuses to let anything stop her is to be honest, inspiring. In addition, the fact that she was not a typical super-hot chick (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes it very attractive and real. Seriously, why is this movie rated so low? You can understand, between the first 5 minutes, it's a good job. Really good actually. I even cried at the end of the film. And dance routines just sick.
