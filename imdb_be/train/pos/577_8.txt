This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times. He also won an Oscar for Best Cinematography, and deservedly so. I have a lot of movies in my collection of movies and a few more I saw, apart from them, and not many of them more beautiful, or even equally as beautifully shot, like this one. <br /> <br /> This is a unique and overall great movie. The cast is terrific, and do a great job in painting his characters. We follow his fate with devotion, and get very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn that about yourself and your life. I think a big part of this film for what it is, and how to present it. I heartily recommend
