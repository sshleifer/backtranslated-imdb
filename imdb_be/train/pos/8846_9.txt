I really liked the drama of Sidney Lumet. The best word I could think of to describe it with the insane. He throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and does not allow to breathe, while loans will not start to roll at the end. Believe me, this movie will keep you guessing all the way through. <br /> <br /> The story is very well developed and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complex type of stories Tarantino. Act all surprising of all findings and even small details, a great cast. I also loved the cinema, it gave him a real feeling as if it is an independent film. It was great. <br /> <br /> This film is excited, it is difficult i heartbreaking. It is almost difficult to watch, but you'll be glad you did.
