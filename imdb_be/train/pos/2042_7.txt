However, after a busy day, it slumbers and wakes up to find himself alone in the empty platform. As she races off to the situation, taking her from one complex to another meeting, however, she finds out about something far more pernicious and evil awaits her there. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the British film industry has really become one on its own, especially in the department of horror thriller, with films such as creep and successful 28 Days Later (it has strong echoes in parts.) from the point of the success that he had intended to do, Creep makes cleverly set up (especially at the beginning) terrible sense of isolation and intense fear. In a reasonable running time, it is also (albeit unintentionally, I suspect) it is possible to pay tribute to some of the pioneer high-concept horror films from the 70s, which rely on shock and fear through rolling out is not really too much focus on character development and such. <br /> <br /> With this weakness, some scenes are a bit predictable, but it's actually not be able to make it less scary or effective in any case. I'm not sure if the end had to do it off as some kind of morality, and it is not quite perfect, but it is certainly very effective and serve its primary function very well. ***
