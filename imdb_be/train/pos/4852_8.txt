Now it is one of the big is best, single role Jack Hulbert in 1931, is divided into two parts for the radio team Group wagon Askey & Murdoch. It has a large cast of great stature, who HAM game for all they're worth, especially Asuka, of course. Theatricality were provided Linden Travers, melodramatics Herbert Lomas and pragmatist Richard Murdoch. <br /> <br /> The group of rail passengers stranded on a deserted country site overnight to find more than they bargained for, ghost train, spectral porters, hairy sausages and Arthur tries to entertain them all. His quick wit with everything falls between the side splitting and eerie dim. If the formula works very well, but sometimes it becomes very contrived and forced to make the film seem more dated than that. But that damned treacherous fifth column - thank God every UK did not get any right now <br /> <br /> In the end, good harmless film, to welcome back to the TV screen, like an old friend, but if you are waiting for! be startled out of your trees, you'll probably be very disappointed!
