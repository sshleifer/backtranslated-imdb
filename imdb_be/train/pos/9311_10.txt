It was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is also the best film. Sci Fi original movie must be bad, that's what makes it fun! The line, "I like my meat well done dinosaur!" Probably the best quote ever! In addition, the plot sounds like something out of a pot-induced sleep. I can imagine it now, the authors of waking after a long night getting high and playing Dance Dance Revolution, and then put the ideas together for this: Space Marines received a strange planet, teeming with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it, to protect the scientific team studying the planet. Best idea ever! In fact, in fits full Sci Fi original movie checklist: weapons dinosaurs medieval times space travel horrible acts <br /> <br /> So watch this movie, but do not buy it.
