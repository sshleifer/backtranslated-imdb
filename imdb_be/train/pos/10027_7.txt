Of course, the Titanic was a good film, the first time you see it, but you really have to see it a second time, and your opinion of the film will be determined to change. The first time you see a movie that you can see the main love story and think: oh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one to think it is) is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, If this d ** n ship sink ??? And even that is not so impressive when you see it several times. Acting in this movie is not bad, but certainly not great either. I was glad that DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for this film, I mean, who does he think that he, Anthony Hopkins and Denzel Washington? He makes one half of a good movie, and will not make the film for less than $ 20 million. And then all will be surprised that there is hardly any films with him in this. But enough about, in my opinion, the worst character in the film. performance of Kate Winslet on the other hand, was great. I, too, tink, that is a very talented director to make a film of this scale together. There is another lesson about this film: there are too many love stories like this, the creators of the film should not try to add a lousy novel to every movie !!! Of the possible 100% I give this film is only 71%.
