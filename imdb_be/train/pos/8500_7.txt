Surprised to see a fairly low figure for this film. Just I saw this movie for the first time in 10 years, and was reminded why I like it. <br /> <br /> Come with me, children, at a time when Michael Keaton was a direct Comédie Man, and you might find joy in this film. This gentle comedy - view of Ron Howard specializes in - but if it's your thing, you should check it out. discreet charm Keaton just for this project. <br /> <br /> «Gung Ho" is a bit dated, since it takes place in the last stage before the global world economy that still mattered that the business was established in the country. Nevertheless, it delivers laughs, as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other to be of great benefit. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it, not remembering one scene in particular you very much, but that's because the entire film provides a slow but steady stream of laughter. It's like IV dig. And I mean that in a good way.
