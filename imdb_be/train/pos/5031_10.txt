This film is beautifully decorated! There are no disadvantages. Not in the development kit, lighting, sound, story. The script is an invitation to a challenging game where the participants are on a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton at its best in this role. His manner, an infection that is used in the tones of his voice has no miscue. Every shot well done! Surprises are rotated one by one, when the film reaches past its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it is a gem that has been very well polished. It is not a simple mind.
