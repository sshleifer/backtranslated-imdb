Tigerland follows the lives of a group recently trained people in the army who are called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this point, America knows that they are fighting a losing battle, and the director takes us through the 16mm portable documentary film life in a few recruits «Tigerland» training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> film more character study no real plot, but it focuses on the character keys Roland Boz, which is dissabordinate more intelligent person who only wants to escape from the camp. We have taken a few characters in the block waiting for stories to unfold. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly, about the army as a whole .. Great action, and very memorable. In addition, the use of film and director's style works so well, because it looks very much like the old film footage, you always see in relation to Vietnam. Its nice to see how the film shows that all the strife and problems were so great on the fight against this battle. Especially the scene where Boz goes on a training mission, where the instructor shows how to use the radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about the war in a nutshell ... and it's useless. <br /> <br /> fiction film. Not only of Vietnam but of who the individuals have to decide what is morally right, being "in the army." <br /> <br /> Grade 9 of 10.
