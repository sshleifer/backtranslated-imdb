I love this movie. I remember once when I was in 2nd grade, "my teacher showed us a 16 mm film reels. This film, however, can be a little intimidating for 2 classes, such as the place where the murder of Nancy and Bill to see the face Fezhin for the first time on the screen. One of my relatives is painful to see this film, because she studied it in the music room. If I was a teacher and could class of people who prepared this wonderful movie, I would give them A +.
