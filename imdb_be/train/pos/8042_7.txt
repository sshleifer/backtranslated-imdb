**** SPOILERS **** The film "The Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of the legendary Marine sniper Carlos «Gunny» Hathcock. Modest suave Mr. Rogers look-alike, who ran by as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed Vietcong and North Vietnamese military killed during his two tours in «Nam» .which shows how the death and efficient experienced military sniper is really there. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger cool and clam death as Sgt.Thomas Beckett, who is at the end of his career as the top US Marine sniper, but that later in the movie understands that life as a civilian the person would be pointless. There is nothing outside of it, to make him the skills he learned in the US Marine Corps, when he decides to become a mob hit-man. Backett reluctantly accepts his destiny as a professional killer life for his country. <br /> <br /> In the history of the movie "Sniper" is focused on Sgt.Beckett with the assistance of the former sharp shooting silver medalist and US government agent Richard Miller, Billy Zane, it goes deep into the Panamanian jungle. Two snipers to take out the rebel General Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa and Colombian drug kingpin Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, which maintains it in a planned military acceptance of the country. <br /> <br /> We see at the beginning of the movie Sgt. Beckett scale and take out the leader of the rebels, which I feel was the best scene in the "Sniper". For this shows step by step how to Sgt. Beckett with his spotter Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, doing his job. There's also a sub-plot that was later interrupted by the film of the rebel snipers DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who was persecuted and Beckett who later killed Papich, as they both are waiting to be canceled out of the jungle in a military helicopter. You would think that a deadly cat and mouse played out between the two, which would be the climax, when the movie ended, but Sgt. Beckett did not have any problems at all in control DeSilva at the beginning of the film with the help of unsuspecting Miller as bait. <br /> <br /> What hurts the film was the most ironically the last fifteen minutes or so, when the story went from one shot one kill Sniper Rambo movie on how ending with Sgt. Beckett and a beating agent Miller Rebel battalion with bullets flying in thick fog London. <br /> <br /> «Sniper" is still worth looking at what it tells the story of a man who until now did not actually extolled in films about war: the lone assassin who kills with precision and skill master cutter diamond or neurosurgeon made and who makes it in complete secrecy.
