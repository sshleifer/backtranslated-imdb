From the first scene you get a clue as to what might be happening here. It is becoming more evident as the story rolls. It works perfectly everywhere and these actors touch your soul. And even though I knew that was going to happen, I was very puzzled by the motive. I still wonder why Ben did what he did. We could see in his face "second thoughts", but in the end the victim appeared from his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and touching story, but it left me confused. Maybe it was the time of the film. I did like the movie, and Smith can destroy another good choice of film. This guy knows how to entertain the audience!
