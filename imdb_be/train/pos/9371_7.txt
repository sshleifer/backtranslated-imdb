One thing I always liked about Ladleh thrillers only if you think you have understood it, it goes in a completely different direction. There are so many twists and turns in this film, I had a sore neck from watching. <br /> <br /> One thing I also like about the director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that it can be depended on direct and, in this case, the record (with his brother Rick) a good story. <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage Dennis Hopper Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh in a cast and you have a story that will keep your interest, even if they play the characters, they all improved. Dahl seems to reveal the best in people, and it will keep you interested and guessing until the very end.
