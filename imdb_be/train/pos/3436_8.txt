Letters are not the destination end up in another world is found in the back rooms of the post office. Here, Alice can not find work in the hope of finding her lost father. What she does open it to torment the soul of his boss, Frank. Quiet little Aussie Flick, who came and went to the movies. Now you have found it in a deep dark corner video store, marred by fifty copies of this terrible film Godzilla. It's a shame, because it was satisfying film telling the story of the brave with strong simple images and effective performances of the two leads. This film succeeds where other dead letter office Flick Garry Marshall DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) failed, and moving closer to shine, sun turkey Kevin Costner, but POSTMAN He Jianjun (in 1995 - China).
