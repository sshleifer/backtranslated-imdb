Of course, it took 65 years after the last production Thalberg was filmed. But fellow IMDB, come to this movie is definitely one of the masterpieces of the 30s! It is 10. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie that I saw in New York's Museum of Modern Art, in 1970 (I was a teenager). Expensive looking yet with scenes such poverty, masterfully photographed, often exciting and always appealing to me, it was a film MGM-making at its best. That viewers feel when they flashed the locust attack, from one person to the destruction of the mansion, abject poverty, and then shine wealth. <br /> <br /> Last week, who watched the Academy Awards had the idea of ​​the "big" winner of the Oscar in attendance, Luise Rainer. How great to see an actress who may have delivered one of the most skilled, in the history of haunting performed by selecting to return to the celebration. <br /> <br /> So, it should not win last year (Great Ziegfeld), but do not blame Luise. Talkies was only ten years old when it was released, and her dialogue is limited. But as OLAN, its use of visual and vocal memorable. <br /> <br /> The large-scale and touching, what more could a movie lover wants!
