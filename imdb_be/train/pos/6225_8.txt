It was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the franchise Astaire-Rogers and is the largest expense and somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers performed by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and / or shared between the principal. As usual, the storyline should not delay us, but for the record it was based on the game, Shore Leave, which also served as the basis for the Broadway musical, Hit The Deck. Anyone who actually saw the Shore in the theater can be instantly confused, because they were created by the role played by Fred and Ginger for the film, but what is important, as always, music, lyrics and hoofing and it all with the right bottle. This deviation from the other titles in the franchise that 1) we see Astaire play the piano - in real life he was a pianist and wrote a few songs, one of which, I'm building up a horrible Let- down was Johnny Mercer lyric and spent a couple of weeks charts - and this is just one of a series in which he played the military, although the ex-hoofer, who enlisted in the Navy after the cast dancing partner ginger the story begins. He begins to perform a little-known but remarkable Berlin number, I'd rather keep the group, as well as on duetting I put all your eggs in one basket, but in the end the number is prophetic - in 1936 rumble of World War II are already being felt - Let's Face The Music And Dance, one of the most powerful ballads ever in the performance of the team. So if Randolph Scott, and a small wooden fish-out-of water without any horse or a six-gun within easy reach and Harriet Hilliard did not exactly set the screen on fire; we came to see Fred and Ginger, and the only question is whether they will deliver. Answer: In spades.
