A lot of hidden agenda. Pure SciFi. All the fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on television and was scared pretty bad. I was a kid :) <br /> <br /> original can be evaluated more in comparison with a new one that I've seen and forgotten. The original one, starring big movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), by far, the better, and only the version everyone should see. <br /> <br /> filmmaking dated, but FX is used to make Blob stands up to the test of time. I was convinced that the case is moving on its own accord. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
