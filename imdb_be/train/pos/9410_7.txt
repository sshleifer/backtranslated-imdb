I enjoyed this film. But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. It was interesting, sometimes, but really, it was not very funny. If I had expected it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the film, but by going in without any expectations, I found it to be enjoyable and interesting. Maybe it's because, as an engineer, I identified with the main character. I was less concerned with satire capital or work, and a lot more in the main story of a man who fights for his invention. A person who is less interested in the cash benefits of his invention, which he that come to fruit and put into production. He is absolutely heroic, if he refuses to take a lot of money and a hot woman in exchange for the suppression of his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have likened it to Jurassic Park; me, I compare his sources.
