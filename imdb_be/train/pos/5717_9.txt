Omigosh, it's seriously scary movie I have ever, ever seen. To say that I love horror movies, would be an understatement, and I've seen a handful of (considering the limited availability in New Zealand, it is quite a lot), but never before have I had to sleep with the light on ... yet I have not seen Grudge. <br /> <br /> Some might say that this is a rip off of the ring (as based on the Japanese horror film), and the like (yet different) story lines, but Grudge holds its own as a monster movie - seeing the movie, I even I cried at some point in the film <br /> <br /> act great, especially with the secondary characters. - Kadi Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she was fascinated by the man. Jason Behr real beauty, and William Mapother looks like he's having fun. However, while I do not normally advocate of Clea DuVall, it does not really seem to be in this movie. On the secondary characters, she probably had the most depth and the background, but it does not seem like it's all there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, it is about the same through all her films and the role is not she? Ghosts were really scary, cool music and sound effects (in particular, noise is when the character Kadi Strickland answered the phone in the apartment), the ending was too cool. <br /> <br /> Super highly recommended. 9/10
