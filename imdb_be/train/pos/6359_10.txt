If you went to this film to see some great presentations on the Academy Awards ... well..but, if you want to see a funny excellent adaptation of the old classics, you'll love it..Jim Carey was incredible as usual. The storyline was great, a few pieces are added as the history of the Grinch made it even better. Ron Howard never misses beat..But, although there were a few adults and comments added cleavage is supped to be a child or a family show. Try not to lose sight of what you're doing ..ela you really will not enjoy the movie ... and as for the comments about Ron Howard, trying to send the main picture of the motion and see how you do..its not just as it looks ...
