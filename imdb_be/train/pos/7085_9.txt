I just bought a DVD and I have to say that (after watching Brazil and fear Loathing in Las Vegas), Terry does it again. As well as a fan of the movie Monty Python, Terry Gilliam's genius should be through this science fiction thriller that Bruce Willis plays a prominent role, James Cole, as well as (possibly my favorite character) Brad Pitt, who played Madness Jefferey Goines. A must have for supporters of a science fiction movie or a fan of any type really, because it includes suspension, drama, action, etc. <br /> <br /> no way the plot, in the future, 1% of the world's population survives the disease, designed to destroy the human race, which is unleashed in the past, "Twelve Monkeys Army". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in 1996 (if the virus was unleashed) to learn about the disease, so scientists at the time, you can find a remedy. Before I go any further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals rule the world on the surface because of the disease that will kill people. In any case, when it is sent back in time, in fact, it goes back to 1990, where he was sent to a psychiatric hospital because of his retellings of virus people. During his stay he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who later is primarily responsible for destroying mankind. In addition, he meets a psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe), which eventually merged with Bruce to save the world (as she sees that he is right in his retelling), it goes back and forth from his time in the past and finally sent to 1996 where he was to question his own health, but then I will get out to show a disturbing end of a quarter of the film, and then builds a few shocking climax, where he tries to stop a person who has the virus (in not actually Brad Pitt) and instead shot the police, the killer escapes.
