Dumland focuses on one family's life (American?) ... parents; violent and indecent people who loves to fart and use foul language, and who has no redeeming qualities. mother; which seems to be a paranoid psychotic, never saying a lot. son; unknown annoying repetitive boy. Animation simple and crude, but makes the rooms of stories and characters. The episodes were originally only available on the web site davidlynch.com, but has now been released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on DVD, and a brief overview of the following: <br /> <br /> 1- Neighbor: We meet the next door neighbor and find out three things about him ... he's really good barn, he has only one arm, and he He likes to do naughty things with ducks <br /> <br /> 2- treadmill. We learn that his wife has an affinity for exercise, but her husband did not actually think it's a good idea. After all, exercise treadmill wins <br /> <br /> 3- Dr. :. The father has an accident with an outdoor live wire ... check-up pretty well (if not unconventional), but the diagnosis "you are quite normal" (but we knew that) <br /> <br /> 4- A Friend Visits: . After a dispute with the new clothes hoists, each visits (Believe it or not, he has one, but after we met him, we can understand why), there are no surprises when he says that his hobby <br /> <br /> 5 Get The Stick :. He meets another neighbor, it has a shelf jammed in his mouth (although we will never know how it got there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from the lips of his neighbor ends up being more difficult (and more) than expected ... but he wins in the end ... Jesus some people may be ungrateful !!! <br /> <br /> 6- My teeth are bleeding: This was my favorite episode ... and was also the most mind- numbingly repetitive and annoying (Hmm, that does that say about me ??). I do not know why his son teeth started bleeding, but believe me when I say that it was the lowest since the story plot. Which is an oxymoron, since history had no plot. But is there a funny end (including fly) !! <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After meeting with Bob's uncle, and his wife's uncle Bob, we get a clear feeling that the country is stupid gene pool is very shallow, Uncle Bob sickly guy (I will not go into detail so as not to to spoil it for you). Uncle Bob's wife wears the pants defined in my family ... and my father definitely ends on the side of her fist rich (and spend the rest of his visit huddled in a tree in the backyard). <br /> <br /> 8- ants: After the house gets drenched ants and shameful attempt beetle spreyte they go wrong ... he ends up spraying himself in the face with Turtles spray and begins to hallucinate. Ants put on a fabulous song and dance show ... it goes with the mind, trying to kill them, completed the body ... and lets just say the full plaster that ants get revenge in the end. <br /> <br /> As bad as these stories have something that kept me compelling to watch them. They give a further insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Maybe they were out for him to get rid of some of his violent thoughts ?? I actually laugh at many points within episodes. Many aspects of the absurdly funny !!
