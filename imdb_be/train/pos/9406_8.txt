Other commentators detail the plot and social parable and comments, as well as (or better), I could, but I would like to join my passion for this little gem of a film. He holds up very well, more than 50 years later, in each category - script, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it really is a classic kind. It was my first encounter with the "youngÂ» Alec Guinness, and this is evident from the first frame that made it so special to end up getting a knighthood. <br /> <br /> I just evaluate it, "8", because it is mostly pretty easy parable that explores human nature, but in fact it is not twisted; and because the plot takes the easy way out in the end, not really resolve conflicts between the inventor and the plant workers and industrialists that have plagued him throughout the city. In addition, a few minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the script - the wear is hardly ever a determining factor when buying new clothes (especially putting on clothes); children grow, people change their size, gain and lose weight, and follow the latest fashion all the time, and there are up to that time as weaving woven fabric. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would have made a fortune providing unbreakable material for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> However, this is a great movie. If you get a chance to see it on the classic movie channel, you have to.
