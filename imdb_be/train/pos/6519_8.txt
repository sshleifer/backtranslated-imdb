This film has big stars in their early years: Ingor Stevens has never looked cuter; Yul Brynner was very convincing Jean Lafitte, conflicting about his piracy and wanting to keep the United States neutral. Charlton Heston has done a very good job, as Andrew Jackson, but some things were a bit unnatural. This is a really good movie for the students to learn that part of our history, and it shows that all the happy ending does not include a lover get together with each other - sometimes more than a happy ending, they swim away and find a partner of similar origin, will be better understood them in the long run. I saw it every year, at least twice in the past 16 years; and although it's not the best movie I have ever seen, I love it every time!
