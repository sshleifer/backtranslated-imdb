Fast-paced, funny, sexy and exciting. Cagney always amazing. Blondel fascinates with its intelligence and energy. Obviously, this is a film on censorship insinuations in the script, costumes, and how they relate to each other. And bikinis were previously bikini! This is not no forbidden techniques of entertainment for everyone. I do not understand this question, John Garfield, though. Does it matter whether it is in this film? If he is, he screen is so short that it is mainly the support. You should watch it frame by frame to find it even if it is. I'm a big fan of Cagney's, but have never seen it before. I found it on Turner Classics. I found it a great crash. Relax and enjoy the ride!
