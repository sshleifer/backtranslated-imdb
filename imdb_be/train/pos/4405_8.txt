War Between the States was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of America; war, pit brother against brother and family against family and left scars that have not healed even today, and in all likelihood, never will be. And, as in any story of any war, without any historical significance is a personal discord for more conflict, which creates emotional impulse, which makes his participation. It is the human factor that makes the context necessary to give it a future, which is something that director Ang Lee delivers to `ride with the devil," the drama of the Civil War, in which he focuses on the personal suffering in a broader reflection of the very war and on the way manages to include a study of one of the bloodiest of the war leaders, the infamous raid on Lawrence, Kansas, for Quantrill and his raiders, he succeeds in presenting quite objectively with the Federal point-of-view. <br /> <br /> In 1863 the impact of the Union prevails in the state of Kansas, and even across the border into neighboring Missouri, those of the Federal addictions are more difficult to hold against the invading Northmen, especially without the aid, would be to consider any ` normal "Federal troops. And when things start to really heat up around their own city, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and Jake Rodel (Tobey Maguire) form a group of their own and join the fray, undermines the Union wherever possible. Jack Bull and Jake do not like war, and does not like to kill; but they stand behind what they think is right. <br /> <br /> There are others, however, even among his own people like a young Pete Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who will use the conflict as a means for personal gain, and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent due to excessive violence, perpetrated in many cases against innocent victims. And so, for Jack Bull and Jake, as well as many of the same as they are, it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral considerations will be very tested; the time during which their souls will be tempered in the blood. And they will have to go with the very devil himself, against seemingly insurmountable difficulties. <br /> <br /> As with all his films, the director Ang Lee is approaching its history through insightful, but a subtle study of traditions, cultural aspects and moral attitudes of people and the time it is shown. And in this, Lee provides his audience, at least some understanding of their subject that goes beyond the real story, and ultimately offers perhaps a better understanding of the motives that move their characters and the drama in which they are engaged . Whether it is traditional and customary practices that take into account the relationship between the father and his daughters ( `est.Po Man Woman"), class distinctions effects ( `Sense and Sensibility"), and the honor code that a warrior lives and dies ( `stolen tiger, Hidden dragon ") or moral ambiguity contributed to the lack of any of the foregoing (` The Ice Storm Â»), Lee poured their films with insight into the human condition, that take them to a higher level. This film is not an exception; and (as he does with all his films), Lee presents his story through breathtaking cinematography (in this film, Frederick Elmes, who also did 'Ice Storm' brilliantly), which, under his leadership, at least visual poetry. This is a special touch Lee, and it adds a thoughtful, reflective sense that the story he says that one of the elements that make his films so memorable. <br /> <br /> As Jake Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film, which contrasts so effectively with the maturity it transports later as the story develops, and his character with him. Most importantly, the Maguire convincing and believable reacts to events that unfold around him, which adds to the accuracy of the entire film and emphasizes the presentation of realism: his stoic acceptance of death and information about those 'killed' in the various clashes and battle; moral justification, to which those whom he meets a stick, even in these difficult times; betrayal, because of the nature of the conflict is almost a common phenomenon; and loyalty and belief to which he and his companions cling firmly. This is all that Maguire reaches through his work, and this is no small accomplishment. It is, however, kind of learning, low productivity, which is often taken for granted that the boring; It works as it deserves to be recognized, and should be recognized. <br /> <br /> Skeet Ulrich is effective as well as Jack Bull and Jewel (in her debut motion picture) is transformed into eye-catching performance as Sue Lee Shelley. This is Jeffrey Wright, however, who stands out in prominent supporting role as Daniel Holt and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who brings a chilling Christopher Walken as a threat to his role as Pete. In addition, in what amounts to a cameo (one scene), Mark Ruffalo leaves a lasting impression with very little time on the screen. <br /> <br /> supporting cast includes Jim Caviezel (John Black), Simon Baker (George Clyde), Tom Geary (Riley), Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), John Ales (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roedel) and Kathleen Warfel (Mrs. Chiles). The civil war will be forever open wound on the people; but we hope that time comes, it will be through objective thinking directors like Ang Lee and movies like 'ride with the devil ", which will ultimately help close the split and promote healing. In light of recent events, it is something that is imperative in the world. The film is a powerful tool; it may be instructive as well as entertaining, and possibly more in the future directors like Ang Lee, will encompass and encourage a sense of unity through a sensitive description of the events and relationships that make us what we are. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
