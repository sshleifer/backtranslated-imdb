I missed almost all of the first season, but if the others went to the show again, I began to watch. I ended up buying the entire first Itunes off season. Now it's one of my favorite sitcoms. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor got me rolling the whole time. David Spade's funny, but sometimes a little goes a long way to Russell. Other actors enjoy greater (but not saying that it does not add to the show). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. If you have not checked this one out, give it a try. If you can catch the episode where "Jeff" is a sperm bank, you will see how good this show is. <br /> <br /> I hope that this series has a long series.
