Royston Bob's weird, but great place. Characters would be just plain wrong, and too anxious, but fantastically brilliant writing means that it works, and it works very well. Most people will know others with a touch of some of the characters, but I hope that no one knows people with the extreme parties such as Tubbs and Edward, hating the unfamiliar local shop owners or pen obsessed with Pauline, who treats "sparingly waste" with great contempt .That was only a few strange inhabitants. Television work consists of the third series and a Christmas special. There are links to many horror films such as The Wicker Man. A more recent addition to the range of work the film Apocalypse League, Men of which I will not say much, but would highly recommend. Total in the league of gentlemen amusing comedy show with the genius of writing and a brilliant crazy characters. I would definitely say that it's worth watching, you will not regret it!
