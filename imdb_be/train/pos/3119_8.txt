"The Bourne Ultimatum" begins with irresponsibility in the middle of the chase and pulse-pounding fashion explode out as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely gorgeous) tracks down the mastermind behind the CIA Black Ops, who turned it into the perfect assassin in a last attempt to find out his true identity . Devastating ice Strathairn as "the man behind the curtain" is added to the warehouse returning regulars, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (does not exist). <br /> <br /> As with the second position in the series, I would like a shaky hand-held camera Paul Greengrass will keep static at least for a few minutes of inactivity. However, as they say, it is the perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of intimate scenes of hand-to-hand combat, and works equally well in the chase scenes, which are mainly on foot and on the roofs often with a bunch of cars -k. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is a constant globe-hopping and manipulation technology and communication, which seems to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. The Bourne films, seems to exist in some rough hyper-reality, which is full of technology-based magic. It makes no sense that everything seems to be just the right place at the right time, but if I'm damned if it is not a blast to watch them get there. <br /> <br /> In the absence of emotional and featuring Franka Potente, the authors try to establish some emotional bond between Damon and Stiles, but it is so empty face of an actress she would never lead to anything. Nevertheless, it can be forgiven, because in contrast to "identity" and "Excellence", the "Ultimatum" shows everything, and we finally learn the truth about the past, Bourne. This is an interesting and happy with the output series, and if they have any common sense, and Damon gets his wish, it would be the perfect ending.
