Not only is it the film shows a very tight story, but a hyper-stylized and extreme symbol of the country have human emotions in a very real world. Although this film is not ironic in general (thank God), small and thin ridicule that pepper piece hint of bitter truths of love and loss. with beautiful cinematography and the soundtrack straight out of the seventies, "I see there "this is a great indie film that does not lean and postmodern irony, if the deal with the troubles of love and the reality of human emotions. <, br /> <br /> The film begins with Billy's life is falling apart.
