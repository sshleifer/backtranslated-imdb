This film, in my opinion, it is, despite it lacks (I maintain that * some *), a stunning masterpiece and a great and glorious work of art. <br /> <br /> What Mr. baksheesh made here to create an entirely different film, and showed his enormous talent and versatility as a director of animated films. It does not get 1 / hundredth credit he deserves just for the preservation of the art of animation for adult audiences. If it were not for Mr. Bakshi, I do not believe that the animation would have survived depression Disney. Moreover, the Lord of the Rings, he not only created a beautiful animated film, but he has created a whole new kind of art -. Unfortunately, the one that never made it off the ground <br /> <br /> Most people complain about the use of rotoscoping in the movie (the use of images of live action, used as background images and animations are often compared to the use of different methods, on what appears to be a small amount of tinting to full animation). But I feel that the people who complain about it just can not take the form of art, which is outside of the norm. No, this is not a Disney animation. No, it's not live action. No, this is not "cheating" - what is new, exciting, and absolutely wonderful art form. Something so fresh and so new that he feels at home in this fantastic story as "The Lord of the Rings." Bakshi innovative use of this technique brings subtlety of Middle-earth to life is very dark and mysterious way, in particular, the darker creatures Tolkien, in particular, Nazgul is implemented in such a way that the traditional animation or live action, was not able to achieve. <br /> <br /> Scenario Peter Beagle (based on very little, as I understand it, at an early draft of Chris Conkling) is very loyal adaptation of the works of Tolkien. Where possible, it uses dialogue directly from the novel, and he feels at home in the world, who created Bakshi. There are many cuts that were made to match the first book and one 3/4 in 2 hours and 15 minutes of the film, but very little change in the storyline. There are a few holes that would be nice to have filled in: The reforging with Narsil, gifts Galadriel in Huorns to battle Hornburg, but, again, with the limited time he (already the longest animated film in history), it is certainly understandable (although it makes you wonder how they could be explained later). <br /> <br /> There is also a lovely (one of my favorites) assessment Leonard Rosenman (who also killed Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (expense for which is clearly based on his work LotR)). It's pathetic and daring and, dare I say, perfectly. It stands on its own as an orchestral triumph, but in conjunction with the images of the film, it is included in the new world symphony of perfection. Until now, the typical rate Hollywoodland, it turns many people off. <br /> <br /> The voice actors are wonderful. Of particular note, John Hurt as Aragorn, who simply takes the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The design of the character is also strange is unique, though often not for everyone. But remember that it is the duty of the director to adapt, to show you what he / she thinks, rather than what you could imagine, so Aragorn realized with a distinctive Indian feel and Boromir appears in the Viking inspired outfit. It may not be what you imagine, but I can only welcome Mr. Bakshi for showing us that he "saw". In addition, it should be noted that he spent a considerable amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien in the development of uniform signs for the movie <br /> <br /> One distant words -. Flight to the Ford sequence, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful subtlety sequences ever to be caught on celluloid. Bakshi not afraid to slow down for a moment, and his skills clearly demonstrate the incredible power able to build. Bakshi artistic ability and an incredible work of Tolkien fuse in this sequence to the glory of the peak, which has yet to make up. <br /> <br /> latest release DVD (2001), Warner Brothers, catastrophic entirely lacking. While we are able to offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format, the package sorely lacking extras. It would be nice to have comments of the director, we were able to see 20 minutes of extra footage that was filmed for theatrical release. Another wonderful addition would be collected footage of live action, which was later animated anymore. Also present in the DVD release is very terrible voiceover at the end of the film, which is a departure from the simple sound, which took place in the very final frames of the film. This version plastered and poorly rendered directly on the musical climax of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was not done. We will never be able to see the interpretation of Bakshi in Gondor, with Shelob, Faramir, with Cracks of Doom, fighting Eowyn from Witch King Gandalf or confrontation with him. We never will be decorated with the image of Bakshi in the Denethor or Palatir or Paths of the Dead. It is a shame for all the shame that we, after all, have to take luster and shine of Peter Jackson Hollywood action film version of the latest events in Tolkien's masterpieces, but, I believe, and it's better than not having a cinematic version of anything. <br /> <br /> David
