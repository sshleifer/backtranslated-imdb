This film could have a silent movie; it certainly looks like one. I was very, very lucky to see this rare version of this film. Extase, it is "Love Symphony" and transcends all language versions. French, which is the ultimate romantic language, it seems, are quite suitable for this very sensuous and lyrical version.A young Hedy Lamarr lights up the screen in this film, which is so much like sex fantasy; but it certainly is not pornographic.Tech quality may be slightly damp; but this does not detract from the magical spell of this film lovers exudes.Many early cinema, will absolutely love this movie.
