I was an accountant in the production of this film, and I have to do some voice-over work on it, so I'm not entirely objective, but if it was awful, I would say so. I thought it was a funny movie, not a masterpiece by critics, by any means, but there was a lot of laughter along the way. The Bible says that laughter makes good like a medicine, so watch this movie can be good for your health. <br /> <br /> Thus, many of the actors in this film has not yet reached its peak in the time that we made this film. Susan Sarandon, of course, the one who went to so much great fame. Melanie Myron saw on television on a weekly basis as a photographer in the "Thirty SomethingÂ» TV series. Robert Englund later became known as Freddy Krueger, still haunting dreams of the people. One of my personal favorite actors on the show was a Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was a great comedian, and really good, sincere man. We all had the pleasure of working on this show, and I think that fun comes through.
