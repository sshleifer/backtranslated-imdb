`Blood" Castle (aka `Terror Castle") is a well-researched, amazingly similar to the entrance of a ghost with the Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black-and-white cinematography, perfect dubbing, excellent casting, it is logical scenario, deliberate pacing and surprise (although it is possible) to set the end of each other. Only movies sometimes fake music and quite a steep `love at first sight" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (George River) in March another strange entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> During a visit to England, Edgar Allan Poe, sitting in a pub, telling one of his ghost stories Blackwood graphs. Recognizing the great writer Alan, a young news reporter asks an interview with Poe. During the conversation, Poe shows that all his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses skepticism about the life after death. Blackwood Count Alan offers to bet £ 100 that he could not survive the night in Blackwood Castle, next Halloween night, when the dead moves. Alan can not afford to make a bet, so he puts his life for £ 10 deposit. <br /> <br /> In contrast, Mario Bava's Black Sunday overpraised ` '(aka' Black Sunday"), `Blood Castle" is a pretty low-key, making a few moments of violence even more terrible, more surprisingly, from the director which is usually associated with the terrible cosmic Italian films from the 60s. <br /> <br /> sorry only version of this film, I found much worse (and recording) pan and scan version. Nevertheless, it is worth seeing, and calls for a modern remake of perhaps with Christina Ricci and Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch and enjoy the film, which compares well Robert Wise in 'Ghosts'.
