I first saw this film over 25 years ago on British television and only caught up with him again last week on DVD copies bought off Ebay. I remembered the musical sequences, color and beautiful dandy posture and clothing, but the plot is weaker than before Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding film Spring in Park Lane and Maytime not be so well over the years, but Michael Wilding joy in the film, charming, funny , Debonair, seems to have a lot of fun, and on top of their form. It is worth to look at it alone. Anna Neagle is little respected by his side, and a little too old for the role it plays, but by the end of 1940 their movie partnership was well known from the movie going public. Spring in Park Lane was a major hit in 1947 and a big money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding wrote in the length of his respect for the director Herbert Wilcox and instigator of this series of films in London.
