There are some lovely comments and observations on this film. I was pleased to note the comparison with Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the 50's failed remake with easy David Wayne). The real villain is entirely tortured killer (extremely fine performance Jeffrey DeMunn), taking out his pent-up anger sexy on him victims-- mostly children. It is the objective. The real villain of the Soviet system of bureaucratic strangulation, drowning in their own corrupt incompetence. Discontent uncompromisingly dedicated man (Rea in his best role since "The Crying Game"), in the light pragmatist who is willing to use the system to their advantage (of Sutherland always successful in this role), hesitant, frightened, but determined by a psychiatrist (the incomparable Max here) clumsy, boopous bureaucrat prosecutor (the brilliant Brit actor John Wood) and quiet, keeping his wife managed researcher (wonderful fan, Imelda Staunton). This is one damn fine film. His darkness and gloom supported way corrupt, incompetent system that works against success. No need to dip into the gore-laden slice n dice sensationalism that characterized so many recent films. Gore present-- a terrible story--, but it adds to reflect the pathological crooked people. The success of this history is that: it was the actions committed by a person, a person like you or me, where are you and I choose to express our disappointment reasonable means, Chikatilo took their anger on the most innocent and vulnerable among us, our children. Magnificent premise of the story is revealed as a magnificent cast of outstanding actors. --sadly, I note that our Australian friend did not like the conversation, and, no doubt, would prefer to hear them speaking in an Australian dialect. Well, too bad. This remarkable film is sure worked for me, and everyone else I spoke to those who saw it.
