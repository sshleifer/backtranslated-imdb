I viewed it as a TV movie late last night by accident. Abstract for the film said something to the effect of the mother remains with her daughter and goes on a romantic trip, as I tuned NO carpenter working hard on a new conservatory - Daniel Craig plays no less - so the plot was at once. <br /> <br /> it appears that the carpenter love interest is also the eponymous mother's boyfriend's daughter, so that problems are brewing, and not too many surprises. But I was caught by a breathtaking performance Anne Reid, and I was hooked. Direction allows her enough places to look in the mirror and scarves adjustments when she exudes sadness. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes were exciting and taboo brittle. If not older women's bodies are covered? Not here, and we were treated to a delicious awakening sexuality in Mother. Even more strange is the image, she did that (spoiler!) Once found confirmation of suspicions of her daughter that something is going on here. <br /> <br /> Cathryn Bradshaw, as the daughter did not convince me exactly the same as the rest of the cast, but it could be me. With its waves of pre-Raf locks I was expecting to see Julia Sawahla, whose face is more intense confrontations would satisfy better in my opinion. Bradshaw has a round happy face, not be angry, that acts as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> The ending is weak. If goodbyes to his mother as she was leaving in disgrace so indifferent, it is possible that we could see some close-ups of people who waved goodbye and see something of their individual causes. Whatever she did, she had recently separated leaving a widow for a single home she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found no sympathy concussion. For a film so full of emotions (and keep in mind, it's like opening the champagne, you will never get a bit ago) ending cold contradiction.
