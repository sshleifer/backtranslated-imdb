I youngsters for films like this. Movies that take you back and allow you to relive your childhood. I'm an adult now, many have grown obligations as mortgage, kids, dog, wife, and kill those of others. I love my life, but it is not so innocent and carefree as it was when I was twelve. Mike Binder Indian Summer knows this and is investigating how he was twelve years old. It brings you back to a time when life was simpler and a lot more fun. It brings you back to the time to worry about your first kiss and I wonder if you could complete the marathon camp are important issues. Indian Summer fantasy film, and it is one thing to watch at least once a year to make sure you can sit back and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> The film stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name a few) as childhood friends who are now called back to Camp Tamakwa their former head counselor, Uncle Lou. Uncle Lou played great Alan Arkin. He's the kind of guy who is the patriarch of the group. It is also everyone who knows and includes the true spirit of a father and someone who understands the simple things in life. He has a hard time, which concerns today's children in need WALKMAN thundering in my ears when they are on the site of immense beauty, like Tamakwa. This camp, which has a moose wandering through the camp, turning letters colors that God has given them and the water as long as the eye can see. Uncle Lou misses the days of old and asks his former campers back to the camp to see one of them will take over the camp. While they are all together again, we will see their trials and tribulations, and perhaps a new love may arise between them. <br /> <br /> As adults to return to camp, not long before they are children again, as typical camp pranks are played over and over again. They take the toilet paper out of the stalls, nested toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. All this is done with the funny and the actors as Pollack and Paxton, it's all very funny stuff. <br /> <br /> But for fun, we get to explore some very real adult emotions that anyone can relate to. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollack and Elizabeth Perkins overlooking the bay, where they used to go canoing as children. Pollack can not get over how small it all looks and Perkins finally tells him that the bay does not become smaller, they just become bigger. It does not kill the point home, but it does so subtly. We all grow, we are on and all of us, unfortunately, we can not live the way we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. <br /> <br /> Indian Summer is a character-driven film and beautifully written by Mike Binder, who actually attend Camp Tamakwa camp (as did Sam Raimi, who played in the movie Stick), and this is his admiration and vivid memories of his experience that feeds the film. There are many touching scenes, and there's a lot of fun of them too. Both are fine. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything about it, and it's a real gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
