Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best films of the fantasy genre and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger to pull off such a cinematic original. Apocalyptic movie that keeps you totally fascinated, 12 MONKEYS never lets and has you guessing all the way around. Excellent use of the Philadelphia locale and sets the underworld create a gothic sense of tragedy and the two people trapped in time in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis escapes his image Mego and reflects the true nutter who happens to be right all that will happen. He really is normal, but the people of the future (or present, if you will) distort the head of this guy so bad through a journey in time, it is not surprising that it unravels. He goes in World War I only after Beng sent to the wrong year to see how the army of the Twelve Monkeys pulls the destruction of civilization as we know it. They finally get it right, and that is really great script to match the performance, we see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt sinister cross-references within 6 years. <br /> <br /> Stowe sensual and strong as a risk analyst, who slowly begins to realize that Willis may not be as fractured as it seems. An exciting element of the relationship between her and Willis is their sense of "see" each other before in another place or time. 12 MONKEYS, in fact, the time and the madness of futuristic people immersed in it, and the time is now, when the killers and psychotic genius can change the world. <br /> <br /> Thoughtful Philadelphia is dark and gothic background for the plight of Willis, to complete its mission, which, contrary to all the usual Hollywood stereotype NO to save the world. It collects information. The film plays tricks on the viewer, as well as Willis accommodation in a new setting on a pin drop. It was extremely difficult to make a picture, but Gill seems to be the master of hard-boiled film. He even falls in some humor, reminiscent of other great works as Time Bandits and Brazil. The screen fabric of the man, and he knows how to draw sometimes terrible picture of the world and its possible future in the prevailing atmosphere mnogobyuzhetnyh films. If you want a genuine madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 Monkeys <br /> <br /> RATING :. 9 out of 10
