My beloved, this film tells the story of two warring New York City "characters," Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), both of which tend to be "the Main Guy" in himself at the end of the XIX century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913), were real people, although it is highly fictionalized cost of their antics (based on the play) .Brodie legendary (he did it - she is still the cause of the dispute), jump from a bridge in Brooklyn (1886), for which he became known, as shown here takes place at about the same time as the Spanish-American war (1898) .Director Walsh was clearly! big commitment at a time so beautifully restored here, and it includes a number of noisy wild ragtime from the cabin of the singer Trix Odbray (young Perth Kelton) .Raft is in his slick as Brodie and Beery shows once again that intelligent actor he was, so tough, a big heart, and sometimes quite touching Connors.Pretty Fay Wray love interest as the boys chase. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy "Plantation" is moving at a fast pace (unlike many of the early "radio stations"). This is not an easy film to find but well worth looking out for.
