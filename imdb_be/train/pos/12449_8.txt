Finally, there is a good Modesty Blaise produced a film that not only tells the story, but actually says "real" story. I recognize that this is a bad movie, if you expect action thriller, but if you're staying in your way, and to remove all of your expectations. Then you will see that this is a story that is very close to the original, made by Peter O'Donnell. Do you have a history of supporting just tell how Modesty has become a wonderful person she is. This is not a film to attract new supporters, but the film is to tell the real story. Some things could be better, but if you can not forget the horrible movie with 66, it is a great movie. So you're a fan, then sit down to relax and just enjoy the fact that there is a real story with the title just make modesty to tell their story.
