I am an animal lover of movies. If you can take the land and put the animal as the main actors you usually win me. Homeward Bound has done just that. They took a story that was as old as time and put a new spin to it. It was a complete success. It's a very archetypal film. Do you have a group Kenobi (shadow), which is a wise and logical, you have an attractive, but gusty and incredulous chance and prissy princess who thinks she should be pampered and praised. These three persons bounce off each other very well. I also like how they did chance and insolent such dynamic characters, and they do not overdue it. Most people say it can not be good, because it's too much of the film children. What they forget, however, is that it should be a film children, and it still does not take away from the film acual. This is a good movie to see if you get bored, and you just want to watch a movie. This is a film without Disney cartoons, air bud film with a better plot. I would, without a doubt, I advise you to watch.
