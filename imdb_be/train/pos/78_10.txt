Despite the fact that it has one of the standard "Revenge of cost areas," this movie is my favorite work of Vincent Price. Gallico is a quality that is missing in so many horror films characters- likeability. When you look, you feel it, you feel his frustration, the injustice against him, and you'll cheer him when he goes to the place in spite of the fact that it scares you a little bit with his initial fury. As the film goes on, it becomes a tragic figure. He committed his murder, but now he has to kill to cover it up. Again, to cover this one. And again ... your stomach drops from his soul, as it goes down its spiral like watching a beloved brother turns into a hood. Even if this story of revenge of the old, subject themselves Gallico device uses its originally-tricks to kill more and more inventive ways. Shame is one is not available for home veiwing.
