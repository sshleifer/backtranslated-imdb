One of the greatest classic comedies. Not slapstick comedy, but not heavy drama. Fun, satirical film, but buyers are afraid of leadership in the new house. <br /> <br /> Filled with big letters all of which Cary Grant is convinced, is to rob him in the dream house building. <, Br /> <br /> great look at life in the late 40s. <br /> <br />
