The only thing in this movie that bums me is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, and I would buy it, because the film is a good example of film noir ... and I like to watch Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> criterion produces large DVD-drives, but sometimes asking price is just a little more. This case is an 80-minute black and white, mono sound film, which is good, but nothing special, film-wise. <br /> <br /> The history is the history here (in contrast to the visual, actors, sound, scenery, etc.), as a pickpocket (WIDMARK) inadvertently wind spyware microfilm in his possession after the theft of a purse Peters. (Say that three times!). All but Peters is a believable character in this film: Widmark, police, agents of the United States, as well as the Communists, and especially Ritter as "Mo" informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film. <br /> <br /> Peters does a decent job playing on a cheap whore, but losing credibility by the early "fall in love" with Widmark at the first meeting, even if it is the opposite it. Only in the world of cinema !! Too bad, because it is ridiculously romance of the story takes away from it. <br /> <br /> This is an average film noir, which means that good, but not great, and, of course, do not have a price of $ 25- $ 35 For this price you could do much better on the market of film noir.
