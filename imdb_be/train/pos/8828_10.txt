I was so glad I came across this short film. I am always so disappointed that short films is difficult to meet, so when I saw this, and saw that he was nominated for the short film at the Academy Awards, I was very glad that I was actually a movie that I was sick. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, the director, the writer and star of Nacho Vigalondo tried to think of a reason people suddenly break out in song and dance numbers as they do in the movie musicals. The result is an extremely interesting and the song is actually quite catchy. <br /> <br /> This is a well done short film, well edited and the actors all do a great job. And the last shot of the movie is full. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film.
