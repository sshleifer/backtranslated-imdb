Upgrading from a previous comment. Large and overlooked Marion Davies shows her comedic things in the end (1928) silent comedy, which also demonstrates the excellent William Haines. Davis plays the Loch of Georgia, with the help of Hollywood's failure Haines, a bit player in the raw comedy. They appear together in cheap comedies, while Marion is not "open" and become a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A great satire on Hollywood and its claims. Davies & Haines are a great team, and guest shots from like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Tolmezh, Mae Murray, LaRocque Rod, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Lowell Parsons, Renee Adora, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) is the horn. A must for any serious film naked, or for those interested in further defamation Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays a father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is a leading human mucosa. <br /> <br /> PEOPLE exhibitions, as they say, they used the career of Gloria Swanson as a model (I think Mae Murray closer). Davis and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film makes parallel Swanson lift from other drums Mack Sennett comedies of Charlie Chaplin to star in films DeMille late teens and early 20s. <br /> <br /> Davis and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. It is strange that MGM never combine them into a walkie-talkie. They are great together! Sweet romantic and beautiful parody of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned, but not shown.
