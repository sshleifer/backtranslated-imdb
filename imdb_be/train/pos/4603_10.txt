There is one detail, which is not very common for a Jackie Chan movie, but who is here. It has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while amusing elements are present as well. Jackie menacing and psychotic here. He is not a hero, which is attacked by, and only then is reflected (in the usual way relaxed), but he is the one who can go out and start a commotion. His manner of attack, the evil guy with glasses strange. Every time he goes to 'evil'. I also particularly like the scene where Jackie goes to the pub and peel scoundrels who Fronted his girlfriend. This is one of the best blitz to put on the screen. In addition, the whole scene is shot against the backdrop of an action of the character depicted on the wall (it also looks like a poster "Work" our Soviet era) and several lines in Russian on the left (I've noticed that quite by accident). It looks amazing (and nostalgic for the Russian people). I also love it when the window is now divided into a movie. There is a lot of material. It is quite strange looking characters falling / jumping / running / driving through a variety of glasses. <br /> <br /> All three films are great. I was preparing myself to see the slide down the quality, but I saw a perfect trilogy with sensual and incredible stunts (and not only the character of Jackie Chan is in all three films - it is also a great and keeps the continuity up). <, Br /> <br /> I would like to describe each film only in a few words: â„– 1 - a great (in all aspects - it is a story of capture from the beginning to the end) and funny (many funny scenes); Number 2 - rages (Jackie really * beep * from here) and painful (Jackie receives attempts); Number 3 - incredibly (a woman who fights with Jackie incredible) and pathos (I should mention a lot of guns and explosions?) <br /> <br /> As for the rest -. Many mentioned others. <br /> <br /> This is a trilogy that you can watch over and over again (at least to me). His place in the top 10 among the action / comedy gems. Finally, he was released in Russia on DVD (2nd movie is the best - Chinese / Russian soundtrack and English / Russian subtitles) <br /> <br /> Hard 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention ..
