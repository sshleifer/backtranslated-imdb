Installation and actors make this television movie for me the best performance of Dickens' classic tale. George C. Scott is very plausible, as the rest of the cast. His Scrooge oozes with hostility to the very end of the film. Then, changing his character to someone who really repented. 19th-century English town chosen for the installation creates an atmosphere that fitting Dickens and adds believability of the film. This movie I look at every Christmas with a real Grinch, and it's a great life.
