"Written on the Wind" was hugely successful Universal Pictures. This can only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibility of the material it was given. Based on the popular novel by Robert Wilder and adaptation of George Zuckerman, he had all the elements that make a great melodrama: nymphomania, big oil condition, alcoholism, incest and homosexuality soft touch. Mr. Sirk laid the way for what is to follow later in the genre of soap operas, basically, "Dallas" and "Dynasty", then only two. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film was shot entirely in the studio. Much of the decor is false. How many of those paintings of the 1950s, "Written on the Wind" was shot entirely in the studio a lot. Just look at the scenes that take place in Manhattan or Miami, or even lakes, you can see how the scenery depicted background. Mr. Sirk could not care less about realism as long as he could tell the story in their own way. <br /> <br /> Recently, we caught the show, part of the revival of Mr. Sirk, where people laugh at some of the most dramatic moments, especially in scenes where there is Rock Hudson, who plays a good Mitch Wayne. There is also the fact that the schedule in a way that Robert Keith, who plays Jasper Hadley patriarch, and then on his own daughter, the evil Marylee, caress tower oil, decorate the table an older man, a native of the phallic object d'art. <br /> <br /> Sirko probably wanted to throw him to give over the top presentation that makes sense, as Dorothy Malone reflects nymphomaniac Marylee, and to a certain extent, Robert Stack, who overacts, Kyle , the tormented history of the heir. It would probably be easy explanation of what comes across on screen. The only one that seems to be normal Lauren Bacall, who asked not to make her character Lucy Moore seems to be nothing but a grounded person caught hanging out with the wrong crowd. <br /> <br /> However, his Hollywood movie "written on the wind," shows the genius of talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see: History larger than life that can only be seen on the big screen
