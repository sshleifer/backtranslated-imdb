I remember it when it was released in the Theater in Palo Alto, and was not expecting much. I mean - Australian film? But it finally got to me. Here's the scene. Richard Chamberlain sitting cross-legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in Sydney, opposite the Australian aboriginal elder named Charlie <br /> <br /> Chamberlain ". You were outside my house last night, you scared my wife who is .. you? "And Charlie Pace deliberate answers," Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? .... You fish? You snakes? You people? .. .. Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? "It's a beautiful scene, shot all the close ups, with blandly handsome face Chamberlain fill the screen in opposition to black, with a broad nose, bearded visage Charlie. <br /> <br /> The two guys could not be more different, and this film is a story about how Chamberlain accidentally bumps his everyday existence in lawyerly inexplicable, almost ineffable mystery of Charlie world. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll go to a lot of the plot. It is a kind of apocalyptic tales. But I must say that the one who did a study on Australian Aboriginal belief systems should get a plus. They have everything here, with guided bone during a dream, a kind of parallel universe where dreams are real. This is an extremely terrible movie without any musical bites or excellent special effects. Charly world just begins to invade the dreams of Chamberlain, for reasons never made quite clear. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the script, that's all. Nothing ever made absolutely clear. There Chamberlain, who seems to have any extraordinary relationship with the natives, died in the latest wave? The natives? Sydney has the fullness? The basic premise of a little hard to accept too, although of course that is fantastic. Aborigines are stacked with a spiritual power that the Americans simply on American Indians, while the fact that mythology mythology and while one may be more difficult or pleasure - more elegant and beautiful, if you like - the mythology of another attempt to go beyond the usual, demanding and sometimes disappointing physical existence. Mysticism Charlie is more convincing that the miracles of Moses in DeMille in "The Ten Commandments", but they are brothers under the skin. <br /> <br /> But I do not care about that. Taken in the film, this one is pretty good, and this is especially important for marking the famous director Peter Weir and the Australian film industry. It was the first big wave of films from the antipodes, some raucous as the "Mad Max", and some subtle and dramatic, as "Lanthanum". I love things Weir, which resembles Nicholas Roeg of harboring subconscious fear. Try a "Picnic at Hanging Rock" for an example of how to make a really scary movie with no blood drops.
