I totally disagree with other reviews.All mainly negative.I ventured on this film, and was glad that I did.Glad indeed.I could not find anything wrong with the script it.Nothing period.The original.The actors and everything nice convincing.Dee Smart reminded me of Mars from Brady Brady Bunch.But this gal can really act.The settings in the Australian outback is a soundtrack that perfect.Incredible scenery.Great Paul Kelly.God bless Paul Kelly.The Cranberries also here.I have seen this film twice in less than 24 hrs.I probably look again.It interesting.It that makes one think.It is (was) probably better than nine tenths of the so-called Hollywood blockbusters that have been during this time.Back of Beyond is photographed likable.Well film.I could not find anything wrong with it it.Check! My first review!
