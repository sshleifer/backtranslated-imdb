Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle's fine, but what gives it its neo-noir juice is terrible, violent Hopper and meanness. <br /> <br JT Walsh /> tramp gets mistaken for a hit man, and trying to make a little dough out of it, but gets in over his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel to the first scene of the film, when the cell is included in a trailer in Wyoming to get blasting, with the help of his friend ... and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain, when a character is doing the same! But that's another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper at his best here ... cocky, one step ahead of crime, boiling and explosive violence. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as a man with a dark past, trying to live by the law (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are only four real characters notes here, except for the hard -working deputy in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming. It gets the first turn in the early stages, and there is a good neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town. Satisfying. 8 points.
