It took me time to accurately assess Halloween John Carpenter. As a child, I remember that I really enjoyed the proceedings, especially Return of Michael Myers, who I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I think the first one was slow and took too long to get to the point. I watched it a couple of times recently and I know now that I was wrong. Today I really understand this film, meaning it has, all the feelings of horror masterpiece. It's not about blood and gore. This is not about naked chicks and lame jokes. This is the worst night in a short life of Laurie Strode. We are talking about the night of his mad brother returns home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This film is meant to be scary, and I think it works very well. It is also one of the first horror movies, horror sub-genre that I have always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, terrible music and talented young actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis in his first role. Need I say more? Those who have never seen it, a horror fan or not, have to do their homework cinematic right now. Very highly recommended!
