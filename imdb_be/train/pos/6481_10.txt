I saw this series when I was a kid and loved the detail he went in and never forgotten. I finally bought DVD collection, and it's just as I remembered. It is just like DOCO must be objective and factual. Film footage and interviews are incredibly fantastic. The only series that I have found is equal to «Die Deutschen Panzer». <br /> <br /> I just want Hollywood to sit and watch this series, they could do some great war films. <, Br /> <br /> Note. Ring Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers and if Trumpets Fade, some I would recommend
