It was a first-class film with a first-class gypsum. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, particularly by Christopher Lloyed well cast in this charming film about a real-life angels who help Angels baseball team. You never know what can happen. I loved the role of Lloyd's in it. It was hilarious. The history of turning your life around, as well as faith in the baby in the Angels helped turn angry, hardened and embittered Glover Manager to see the best in people. The film was well done, as well as the observation of the best in others and achieve your dreams. It was interesting, charming, touching and sad, all very nicely done. You'll like (or love) him. I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
