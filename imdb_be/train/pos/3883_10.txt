Until I saw this special on HBO, I've never heard of Eddie Izzard. I am sure that I am glad that I have now! He's one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen! Rarely comedian went deep enough in his craft, then Eddie. I could not stop laughing for the entire show. If you want to laugh, you have to see it special!
