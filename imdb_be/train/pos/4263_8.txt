During the celebration of Kurt Weill in Brooklyn, where do we go from here? It was finally excavated for screening. It is strange that the movie, from any era, which has Weill-Gershwin cooperation could, perhaps, no screens. Cost stands tall, and a CD with material from the Gershwin and Weill, only emphasizes its advantages that are meaningful. Thus, the film has its problems, but the price is not one of them. Ratoff not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy, and McMurray could not quite understand the material. Then, too, "modern" segment is poorly written. But the fantasy elements carry the movie on a high evaluation, as does the work of two beautiful leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have a charm that this kind of work, desperate for a job. The message of the Second World War in the history of our country - albeit in a "never was" scope, the film has its place in the Hollywood musical history and should be available for everyone to see and find your significant advantages.
