Deodato brings us some slightly shocking moments and a movie that does not take itself too seriously. Absolutely classic in its own special kind of way. This film gives a refreshingly different perspective on the Barbarian. If you get a chance to see this film to make. You'll definitely have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because it was funny or something mundane like it, but because it's so bad out another way and become a good, though perhaps not pure fun.
