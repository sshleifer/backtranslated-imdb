This one will receive all comments on the map, because it does not contain any form. It horror-- but splatterfest. This flat part of the exciting and Horror-- more than the usual Hollywood screams and jerks of the camera. <br /> <br /> Feels movie spare and lean with a number of special effects, no, because I think you should listen to and look at the face of the characters. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe. This is a red herring. He works here. «Camp» is a ton of different interpretations of the story. Barbie gives performance-- solid rock so it should believe, the script has something to say. We all know the sorry excuses where actors obviously do not care anymore and just waiting for tooling director of "Cut" and get their salaries. It is not so here. <br /> <br /> Just the fact that the body begins to fall from almost Mondo-comical regularity. I do not think that the goal was humorous--, but to keep you off balance. <br /> <br /> Think about it less horror «Movie» and more horror «Play» to stage--, that decrepit old whitewashed houses. Then you can see what it is really about paranoia, fear, and rage spiral installed in an isolated somewhere, USA. <br /> <br /> And it's winding. Travel Time, Mind Control, and secret experiments of the Nazis, which can not be dead. , .Yet. <br /> <br /> I say take it off and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little more cerebral. That would be a good choice for the North Saturday to sit down.
