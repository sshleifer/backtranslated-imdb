As I watched this movie, and I began to see the characters develop, I felt it would be a great picture. When you get that feeling, and the film really fills these expectations rarely experience. I had that very feeling throughout the film. Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. played riveting and surprisingly strong pieces that were as Oscar worthy. supporting cast was just as strong basis for creating a winning pictures to rise further. I can say without any hesitation at all, see this movie will not disappoint.
