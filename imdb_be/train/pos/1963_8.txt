We begin our review with the following information. My wife and I have seen about 100 movies a year for the past 15 years. We recently had the honor of receiving a life-long movie passes to any movie at any time without any cost! Thus, we can see what we want when we want. The meaning of this is that the count to criticize ZERO. Your local or national criticism critics as Ebert did not really no different from you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about movies and have seen hundreds of films, whether they want to or not.Therefore, we believe that if you get your money's worth for two hours of fun, which is sufficient for good to us! We never listen to or read the criticism. We only care about our friends and those whom we know as the same thing as we are. Well, enough of that. <br /> <br /> This film is very good. not only good, but very good. Critics of a bunch of morons. Just because there is nudity and language they hated him. It's worth the price of the ticket, and that's all you can ask. Is not it so? Each film may not be award candidate Academy. Sharon Stone is beautiful and does a great job in the movie, and it confuses me as to what the critics want to Hell
