This movie was excellent. The sad truth is that, as a culture, as a rule, are faced with the sexes. It's just one big warm fuzzy type of film. Do you have a master, which is steeped in tradition and kind in its own way, a dog, even though the girl thing, to win their feelings, and you top it off with a cute monkey with thousands of facial expressions. This amounts to a big friendly movie in the end. This film does a good job on the show as steeped in tradition one can be so steeped in that they are ready to die, not sharing their secrets. You can see the part of the culture have never seen before, which helps enhance the drama that takes place at the end of the picture. Film photography is high, in particular, the opening sequence with the entire Board sparkers. Linked to be in competition for the Oscar best foreign film.
