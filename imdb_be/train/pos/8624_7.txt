What's the best way to start a review of the film, as the King's death? Let me start by saying that I had just come straight from watching this film and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and I do not think they will move in the near future <br /> <br />. it is probably fair to say that if you're on this page, you have a good idea of ​​what the movie is, even if you have not seen. If not, let me warn you that this is not a moderate budget gem that was lost within a few years a la «Near Dark", and not low budget, schlocky, «fun» B-movie. What is a low-budget art, launched in a simple but sad way. The idea is simple - seven stories that revolve around and finishing, suicides are interspersed with shots of rotting corpses. It sounds easy right, even sad? This is not so. Words can not describe exactly how powerful this film becomes the time you're halfway there; he actually draws you into this, or do you want it or not <br /> <br /> I could go on wandering here on the technical advantages and disadvantages of direction. It may indicate that the scenes obviously shot on Super-8 cameras and sometimes shaky. I might point out that some of the sound effects out of sync so as to compete with any film Fulci, but in the end it seems to fade away. <br /> <br /> As far as movies go as extreme, I've seen the worst of them, and all the king's death moved me in a way that few others have managed, despite not particularly mountains and have very little scenes that I would consider "gratuitous." Actually, the most disturbing scene that I found was the last story. I will not spoil it, just to say that the emotional agony of a character almost drips from the screen and makes you sympathize with, if you do not miss the end of it. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not the best movie ever made, and in many places it seems crude, and perhaps a little amateurish, but in spite of these shortcomings King's death is an experience that I recommend to anyone who loves cinema complex. If you are someone who likes a comfortable viewing, or "good" movies, or just want to gross on something hard and meaningless, it's not what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> If you like it or not, this is one you will not forget in a hurry.
