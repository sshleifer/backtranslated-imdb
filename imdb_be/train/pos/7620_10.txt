Lost the best television series of all is.First there, he has a great cast and a great directing.The an extremely controversial issue, because for the first two seasons of the handwriting was unusual, but after the season 3 letters became very complex.For instance that Jacob? Why are there polar bears on the island? the fog? As the island has disappeared? who is Richard Alpert? Many people think that the writers have lost and that they have raised many questions and mysteries that they can not explain.I believe that these people have confidence in wrong.I writers.I thinks that if the secrets are now open all the charm of the series will be gone.Anyway , lost, of course, the biggest television series and this will continue for a long time.
