I recently purchassed very underrated Dreamcast and went to the city to find some games to use them. I bought Soul Calibur (Classic), and then I crossed through the area Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have a Resident Evil 1 and 2, and played Res Evil 3 numerous occasions and I was impressed with all of them, especially no.1, which is to go down in history is a classic. <br /> <br /> but none of them 3 come anywhere close to the Dreamcast attempts Brilliant Mountains Gameplay. When it just for the sake of buying Dreamcast for this game worth every moment of time and effort, I've never been so keen on a computer game on the road this hobby for me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, history carrys on with the 2nd story in which Claire Redfield searches for her brother (Chris - from the 1st story), which presumably is not commissioned by the umbrella corporation terrible. Little is known about the corporation, except that you, even though you've destroyed them 3 times in previous storys. <br /> <br /> So help Claire with the assistant Super Brat Steve, and must uncover the truth about the real location of your brother. The second CD allows you to control Chris, that if you manage to get that far out of the room in fear. <br /> <br /> control is very slippery, and the movement of the characters perfectly realistic, when the danger of character notices that he / she is facing the direction it comes from. Brilliant !! <br /> <br /> Overall I gave the game 10/10, because it is just a game, the game and the best game of the decade in the world full stop !!. Please buy this game as soon as possible.
