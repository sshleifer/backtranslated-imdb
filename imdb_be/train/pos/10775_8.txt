A good movie with a great soundtrack that spans across the rock landscape 70 and 80 years. Radiofreccia describes the generation, he describes life in a small village near Correggio (native town of Ligabue, the singer, who wrote the book that inspired the film), he describes the life of young people and their problems related to the world. He recalls the needle, a small Italian accent.
