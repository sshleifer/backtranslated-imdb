"The Last Hard Men" is a typical west to the 70s. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. In addition, it is one, but director Andrew McLaglan is John Ford's pupil, and it could be apparently evident in many scenes. IMO the beginning is very good. In a sense McLaglan wanted to show the audience a journey from civilization to the wild. In the third part there are some illogical flaws and I complain a little about Charlton Heston. He needs to play an old ex-Zakonnikov named Sam Burgade, but he is in fantastic physical shape. I never feel that he really has a problem to climb on a horse or on a rock. For me it does not look very motivated, as he usually does in most of his epic films. The same applies to the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who plays the daughter of the sheriff. Maybe there were problems with the director were unhappy with their roles. Hershey and Coburn did not show their best, but they are still good. If the writer was John Wayne in his mind, Sam Burgade? Also, Michael Parks as a modern sheriff slightly underloaded in his role. On the other hand, there is James Coburn, as a criminal Zack wires. Coburn really big villain in this. He is drawing a villain between maniac hatred and ingenuity. Its role and its action is the best of the film. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and Shootouts are terrific. Scene of bloody shootings and violence looks realistic. Zach wires and his gang were some bloody and violent scenes. What I miss is a typical Western action in the middle of the film. I'd appreciate a bank robbery or something like that. Overall, this is an entertaining western movie. Not a great movie, but it is above average due to the large Coburn, a very good start and some bloody and violent scenes.
