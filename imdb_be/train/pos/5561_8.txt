Well, needless to say, this movie is only going to appeal to a specific audience; namely Stoners and associates. <br /> <br /> However, if you are one of these people mentioned above, this film is a must. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for the head shop to sell a copy of someone purchasing his first bong. What Monty Python Holy Grail for geeks and nerds, so this film potheads. I first saw this movie 10 years ago or so, and I still crack up every time I watch it. . Joke perfectly lampoon on the end a way of life, much better than the last day of forgery as Half-Baked try <br /> <br /> There is no plot, so to speak; film is more of a set of different sketches; both films the main characters wander around Los Angeles in their legendary haze. Despite this, the film has a great sense of pace and does not pull at all. Many people cite the smoke as C & C works best, but I would like to say that the next movie is better. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for an hour and a half of the belly laugh, light up, tune in, and let your mind float away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and free TOMMY CHONG!
