The problem is that the film went on the coattails of the 60's created the concept that comics could be done only as a "camp" (ie, in the '60s Batman show) for television and cinema. Thus, you have a fighting sequence with subtitles (come on!) And cluelessly unromantic Doc Savage (he was uncomfortable around women in cellulose, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair in nightsheet (a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for a few nights) and completely false ending with secondary bad guy enclosed in gold in Herve Villechez poses for the Oscar statute. And if they do not make a boom assessment Sousa march, the tinkly little "funny" music cuts a lot of drama. <br /> <br /> Even as such, the film ... well. It is fun, and when it is serious, it is a very accurate representation of the pulp. except Monk, as mentioned above: he is very muscular, not obese. And Long Tom, who should be a pale skinny guy with an attitude, not with Paul Gleason (inexplicably) a scarf. <br /> <br /> Green death sequences, for example, a surprisingly horrible and not what I «d recommend for children. But they are very close to the feel of the pulp. If the writers and producers to get it right, they do it right. - I'll give them that <br /> <br /> But if the manufacturers did Dock with love and scenarios, for example, Reeves' first two Superman movies, thinking that we might have had at that time. I think the problem is a schizophrenic film. There's a certain sense of trying to make a tribute to the 30, but they also try to give in to "the heroes of the camp should be" attitude that created Batman. One gets the impression was sober, pulp and style of the first draft, and then someone came in and said, "Hey, let's make it fun - he worked with the show Batman 8 years ago» <br /> <br /> But the doc lives, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch does a tribute to Doc Savage in this film, people really mad. So, if the number actually gets on TV (supposedly mid-season in '99 -00), Doc Savage, updated to the 90s, will live again.
