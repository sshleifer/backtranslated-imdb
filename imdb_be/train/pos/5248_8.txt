Well, like many other similar films, spawned a parody of SNL. But Tim Meadows makes a pretty fantastic job to do 3 minutes of one-dimensional character in a moderately viable comedic nature of the film. He delivers entertaining series-threated jokes with the frequency of fair, Billy Dee Williams in it, although his Lando days are long gone, and all that is filmed very well. True, it's not great art, but if you're logged in Wayne's World is looking for Gone With The Wind, you have done something wrong. Nice for what it is .......
