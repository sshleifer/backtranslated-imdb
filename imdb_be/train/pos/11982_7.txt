This is how I feel about the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show in duplicate in 2001. <br /> <br /> I love the show, but it was too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> I hate Michelle & Joey characters! <br /> <br /> Stealing scenes from the old television show. They even stole from Â«Partirdge family." Then, in one episode of "The Partridge Family" was mentioned. <br /> <br /> The actors play different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn makes it the most noticeable, especially if she played herself in one episode. <br /> <br /> The character of Michelle impossible to take a joke, but then there was this little child is playing the "revenge" sisters jokingly them on it. <br /> <br /> storylines that have come and gone in 1 episode. Joe gets a TV show with Frankie and Annette have never heard from him after that. Denis suddenly playing the guitar. 1 episode, he coached football, episode 1, he coached the softball / baseball. 1 game and you're out and Denis? <br /> <br /> Jesse & Joey to keep getting the job very quickly without experience. Only in the TV show. <br /> <br /> I did as D.J. and Stephanie characters. Desire Suitin could learn from Candace Cameron Bure and was clean of drugs adult life.
