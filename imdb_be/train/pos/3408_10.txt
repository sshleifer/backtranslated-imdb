I give this film a huge A + for his camp! As the daughter Maria Riva, Dietrich wrote in his book about his mother, "When one sees the Garden of Allah in high camp, it can be very amusing." And how! I laughed with delight at the overloaded accounts and surprising, funny, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. Viewers who read the account toupee Boye (he continued to come to shut down in the heat) will giggle every time he pretends <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other, giving their line. - instead they look wistfully into the distance, apparently, so that their faces can be captured at the best angle and with the most favorable light (if you are in a leading role in Turkey, may also look good!). Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Paramount Travis Banton is his design some of the most divine dresses, such as chiffon beige dress and cape. <br /> <br /> I sincerely agree with the other reviewers who rave about Technicolor. It's really hard to believe that the film was made in 1936. - color fantastic <br /> <br /> In short, if you look at Garden of Allah with a soft attitude and take your stupidity, you can not help but enjoy it.
