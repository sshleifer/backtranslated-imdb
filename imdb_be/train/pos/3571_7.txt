I have seen this film twice with my teenagers, who love him. This one should be a cult favorite! The best line, "Your dress is deeply cool!" Says Prince Cinderella. Kathleen Turner clear as the stepmother. I also love the 1950s era cars and motorcycles. Melancholy prince of the great departure from the typical thug. He tries to stay cool, but not able to hide his love for the fairy-tale princess-to-be. Her shoes are not glass (or more precisely to the original story), but Cinderella loses, however, but gets it back from the heir. My only complaint is that it does not show more, and it seems almost impossible to get. Hopefully, Blockbuster and Amazon begin to store this sometime in the near future.
