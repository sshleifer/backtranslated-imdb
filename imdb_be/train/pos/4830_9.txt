Despite some reviews to be clearly Luke-warm, I found the story completely fascinating, and even if some critics have described as a love story, "Mills and Boon", then what? It's good to see the warm, touching story about true love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were secretly sniffing and wiping his eyes. Do you really believe that the young Victoria and Albert dearly love each other, even though, for political reasons, it was a marriage of convenience. I feel that, while Sir John Conroy, who was desperately trying to control the young queen, it may have played too as the pantomime villain. As it is rumored that he was in fact, the real Victoria's father (as a result of an affair with her mother, the Duchess of Kent), it would be interesting to investigate this theory. Emily Blunt is absolutely convincing as a young princess trapped in a stuffy palace with the court and the role of politicians to manipulate her. She brilliantly reflects the strength of character and determination that finally made the big Victoria the Queen of England, which flourished as never before, by her long reign. I believe that word of mouth recommendations to ensure great success for this very pleasant and a nice looking movie.
