Murder in Mesopotamia, I've always considered one of the best books Poirot, as it is very terrible, and has a brilliant ending. There is no doubt that the adaptation of the TV visually strange, with some lovely pictures and very obtrusive score. As always, David Suchet flawlessly as Hercule Poirot, a comedy event next fight Poirot episode mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser pretty good as naive Captain Hastings. The rest of the cast turn in decent performances, but carefully, so as not to obscure the two wires, the danger in some adaptations of Christie. Some of the episodes were pretty terrible, by comparing the episode as tragic as five pig episode, which I enjoyed much more than that. What made it horrible, in particular, putting music was when Louise Leidner to see the ghostly face through the window. On adaptation, he was quite faithful to the book, but I will say that there are three things that I did not want to. The main problem lies in the stimulation, it's pretty slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens. I do not like the fact that they also did Joseph Mercado killer. In the book, I see it as quite a nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of ​​making his killer, and under-developing, making it less attractive character, but I'm glad they did not miss his addiction, (I also noticed that the authors do not take into account the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book gets hysterical if she believes that she is the next victim of the murderer.) Another thing that was not so impressive was the fact that I felt that it might have been more effective if the adaptation was in the views Wow Leatheran, as it was in the book, Hey Mr. It seemed less sensitive adaptation. Overall, despite some misjudgements on behalf of writers, I liked Murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
