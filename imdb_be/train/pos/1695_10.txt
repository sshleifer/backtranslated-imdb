Usually the best way to annoy me in the film to include some reference to Orson Welles. But the sci-fi comedy quotes War of the Worlds broadcast .... and it's gold! The very concept of a small group of diminutive, aggressive and stupid foreigners, wrongly, as children in Halloween curvy dress. Do not be fooled by the notion that, because it seems that this simple children's movie - it's not, there are many hidden treasures ... Gem!
