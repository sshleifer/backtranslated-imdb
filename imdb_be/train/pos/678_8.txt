The first international success of Peter Weir, the latest wave is the main efficient chiller with fascinating histories based on aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defender, life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into the case of murder involving indigenous tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does everything possible to drive through the sphere of Chamberlin's "Dreams", an alternate reality / schedule in the central native Australian history and tribal customs. The relaxed atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous drawing, the film builds a disturbing finale, which decreased somewhat bad consequences, probably due to budget constraints. Nevertheless, an intriguing film, the overall impression of mystery and terror lurks just below the surface of what we perceive as "reality" will remain with you.
