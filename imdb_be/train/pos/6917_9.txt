Not only with further effort, Mann & Stewart production, but also who they are affected. Such Buddy Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller were all the notes, and joy for the West purists, they followed suit and carried a psychological torch even further. <br /> <br /> great success at the box office back to the issue, Winchester '73 is an excellent film that still packs a punch in the modern era. 9.5 / 10
