Another very good Man Flick through the combination of the father / son, Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often comedic or legal Stewart Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He was there to see that the young man takes to drive a fork or bend. "You are mistaken, Mr. DunstonÂ». Jeff Webster (Stewart) produces the impression that he only cares about himself, but it is clear that he can not jump Brennan. John McIntyre fair as the law of Skagway with due respect to the attributes of justice over this reality. Another key theme is helping people and, in turn, help people. Alone can make any and suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> The inscription above plays Tatum statement that he can not live without coffee. This nicotine dependence is fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and DVD I own right now.
