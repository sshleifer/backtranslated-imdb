I was 16 when I first saw the film, and he's always been a huge favorite of mine. Of course, you can not deny the appeal of Kristofferson in the film - the FINE AS, the person ???????????? Sheesh. He still. He's a bad boy, every woman secretly wants. Its effect is flawless. He played drunk / drug addict just the way a person who really went through it could - and he was - he was in the 76, finally, on the wagon, so it was all very real <br /> <br /> Music. More and even in later years, I thought that was a little Streisand is not the man for it in the physical sense of beauty, I think this is more a problem for the male viewers than females. We girls just looking at Kris - and, of course, the guys look at women's interests - my husband could not watch the movie b / c it - he does not like his looks. But I get him to sit only in red Ferrari scene on the road to the end just so he could see how well it was done - the camera work was so perfect, and you are fully in the car with him with music blasting - you should have seen it on my plasma 50 "- WOW !!!! and, finally, the quality of transmission was gREAT -. anamorphic widescreen and very clear with great color and a very low noise level for the dark areas but which is normal for the film <br /> <br /> Returning some great memories of my mother, and I love ge you are a movie together, I bought a copy for her for Christmas. would love to watch it with her last night. <br /> <br /> I tried to sit through the original with Judy Garland, but I think I saw this first, I just can not there in earlier times. Watching all the concert footage in version 76 was as much as the fact that I lived at the time. <br /> <br /> I'm working my way through the comment Streisand, but she seems to speak only about themselves and ONGS, still she almost even mentioned Kris or detail of the scenes in the film. Her voice sounds exactly the same now as then. <br /> <br /> Check it out, if you grew up in the same era, I (born in 1960), you will love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
