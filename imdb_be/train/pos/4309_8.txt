Many people have made comments strike me as (sorry), there is no point. Kasdan wants to present life, just ordinary life. Traditionally structured story where the characters have ideas that change your life, and then go out the music and the film ended, absorbed in far larger canvas. Several characters in the film have only such inspiration and then they move on. Sometimes they can hold on to their ideas, sometimes they can not, but that's how life really is. In other words, Kasdan crosses conventional dramatic structure in favor of exploration in ongoingness life ?? NOT a happy ending, only to end up ending; and all to the fact that it is still in the process, there is still always grasp ?? and if you absolutely insist on, to investigate the role of beauty in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, for starters. Then add in all the incidents and accidental cross-connections that make up life, or several interconnected lives, and you have the miracle of buckets. Kasdan emphasizes this theme a little, and not insist on it, and supports it in different ways, the most memorable device directly into the center of the film, to have a Mac and his wife lying in bed, each dreaming their dreams, but also shows later in the film, these dreams have the power, in the film, to form reality. This is not a film with a light or a clear message. You just have to let him play in front of you, and then let it sit in your mind for a few days, a month, a few years later, and see what he's done. This is, without doubt, the best film of Kasdan, his most mature, his most humane. Basic meditation on the life of one of the most talented writers and directors. The tragedy is, of course, that he has no right to run for several years, mainly due to limitations in the studio around «Dreamcatcher». I hope we have not heard the last of Larry Kasdan. A great movie by the great artist. Keep in mind that art is not a fully rationalized in order to succeed.
