One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh includes some memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dances with the 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra sings with Jose Icherbi to play the piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi conduct and much more. Technicolor perfect, with some innovative work chamber such as piano play spots from beneath, through light sources, and Grayson singing seen through another camera viewfinder. The plot is thin, but get involved with Kelly & Sinatra enthusiasm. Sailor on vacation, they need to take home a stunning boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra delivers his aunt. To install it with the aunt (Grayson), Kelly says that Sinatra could get her audition with Jose Icherbi. But Sinatra young and naive in this, and in his own words to sing falls too quickly. While they are trying to contact Iturbi, which is never available, he begins to fall for another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly is now a proper love with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh often remember the sequence of combination of live action / cartoon Tom and Jerry, but there is much more here that is worth a look. I give it nine stars, because, while it is not as good as the best musicals - Singing In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - this is one of their first-class large-scale production Technicolor (perhaps to meet with me St. -Luis was the first), and better than most others.
