"The pool of protection" is a film whose time is worth. This brooding, intense film, and all my attention all the time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in its portrayal of the tender, an eccentric chess grandmaster, and Emily Watson spelling connection as a gentle, but the rebellious daughter of a respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is obvious from the moment they meet the characters in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth look at the life of a chess grandmaster and Turturro and Watson add a minority, entirely stencil feel to the film. Most people will leave the theater thinking, and feeling a little touched by this brilliant look at the most unexpected love story.
