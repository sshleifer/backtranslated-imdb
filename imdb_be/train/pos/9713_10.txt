The series premiered on the cable TV station «Comedy Central» in the United States. He was crushed to death, and it is shown in the sequence. It was sad for the public it must attract, he did not and fell by the wayside. Fortunately, at the same time, my cable company has gone digital, and I got the BBC. Thank God, because I got to see the "League of Gentlemen" for full and cut. <br /> <br /> «gentlemen League" troupe is right up there with England "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and Canada's "Kids in the Hall." But..a warning. <br /> <br /> «gentlemen League", though one step further. This is not only to dress in drag and lampooning cultural sickness, she goes deeper and much darker. I can say that many of you are now - it offend certain groups of people, it will enrage others. But remember that it only comedy..dark, dark comedy. If this is not your thing, do not look. If you think you know the dark comedy, look at it - when you are angry and upset, you do not really know a black comedy. <br /> <br /> These guys have got it right, and the right of the button. They are brilliant, they are great, and I enjoyed each and every character creation. There is a complete story told here another episode to the end. You can not watch this one episode at a time, consciously or unconsciously, that is one of the delights of this series. Watch it right. See how creative and stylish and is deeply concerned about these guys. Nobody and nothing is out of bounds. This, my dear, it is "black humor." Bravo!
