I know that there are some purists out there who poo poo anything that is not the same as the original, but sometimes the spin-off can stand on its own merits. I like the new Iron Chef, because it is quite similar to the Japanese version, but at the same time serves the American spirit. I love Alton Brown commentator because he explains things to the sense of smell. Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know that the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef, to defeat them. Mario Batali, seems to be the most fun while cooking, making comments and be annoying when creating. I watched the series and find all the players work together well. Judges are not always the best choice, however. There are a few exceptions, as a lawyer appealed to gourmets, but most judges shady deal in the state that served. I love to watch the cook pushed and candidate countries. The food in the end always looks stunning, and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen. Perhaps this is all anyone can ask, really want to have what it seems. The only thing I would really change in the series, to ask people on the show to lighten a little. Sometimes mood gets too stressful, and it is not always fun to watch when you are waiting for more entertainment. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA), because it was so on top, as in the original, but I can say that it is quite expensive. I want him to stay with this version, and was the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, who would have me grinning for hours. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and can take this series on its own merits, you may find it to be an enjoyable hour.
