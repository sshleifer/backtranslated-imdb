I must admit, I'm a big fan of the first The Dandy Warhols, and that's the reason I came to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film, in comparison with other modern rockumentaries, is that it is not just about one group page stories (eg, "I'm trying to Break Your HeartÂ», about Wilco), and covers a long period in the history of the group. In this film, director / producer Ondi Timoner closely followed by friends / rivals Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for more than 8 years (1995 - 2003) and remove the huge 1500 hours of raw video, cut than 1:45 hours (future DVD release will contain much more material than the original film). The result is striking - no fillers - film 100% clean and a real archive footage that gives you the feeling as the film progresses, you live with the groups, through all these years <br /> <br /> Both group. at the beginning of his career, he promised "a revolution" in the creation of music, but not to sell their souls to the devil, "the music industry." However, their paths soon diverged - The Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records, and has become quite popular (especially in Europe) after only one album, while Brian Jonestown Massacre (with his self-destruction associated Anton Newcombe leader) was dissolved into oblivion ( at least as portrayed in the film). And the film is worth the convergence Brian Jonestown Massacre, climbing contrast with The Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was in awe of the film and his approach tells the story of Anton Newcombe (eg, Courtney Taylor - leader of The Dandy Warhols -. says), but after some thought, I realized that something was so with this film <br /> <br /> In the first place, he considers Anton Newcombe as a missing person. The project was started in 1995, a documentary film about several promising new bands in which Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (this was the reason why all these years Ondi Timoner had direct access to both bands). It was Anton Newcombe, who brought the Dandy Warhols to the project. In the end, he was completely ignored, as if he was expelled from the project. Everyone is talking about BJM, but he does not participate in the discussion. I believe that he was not even informed when the group began the process of final editing. There are always two sides of the story, and here we have only one ... Of course, as would be expected, Anton did not approve of the end result and see this film as a betrayal of his former friends. <br /> <br /> Second, the film is very Dandy Warhols biased. Of course, the winner takes all, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (leader DW) says (although it seems to be a good choice - it gives a sense of the seemingly closer involvement), and that at the end of the history of the bands represented nonproportionally (BJM with 'it is covered until 1997, and DW - up to 2003), Sun adds objectivity in the film <br /> <br /> third, the film (a few) shallows .. What she wants to teach us? As one critic said: "... the film explores the old questions: where is the genius fit to commodified world can flourish and get credit, or whether it should self-destruct to preserve its integrity?" No, it's not EXAMINE these questions! He simply reflects the history of a brilliant but unsuccessful musician told by less brilliant, but successful, that indulges in self-confidence and the eternal cool of the ego more than the mountains. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was fun - it's raw, it's fresh, it's stylish, it's just ... God damn interesting, at least for fans of DW or BJM. For the rest of the crowd - I do not know ...
