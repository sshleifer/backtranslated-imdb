«The Tube Groove» was originally shown in the video, in the first "video theaters" here in Boston. In one room, there were TV monitors at high stands, with old movie theaters in some places, in small groups, standing in front of monitors. There were old refrigerators accumulated with Pepsi, and baskets York peppermint patties. In the second, a small room, there was no room, just big cushions. It was a "smoking" room, ie, people get high there. . This act only added to the fun clip <br /> <br /> I was "part of the audience, I liked most of the scene, and I still remember are: Kok Clown, The Kramp Family Kitchen (Crump Easy-Lube reduced), safety Sam / VD PSA, Hitchhiking Chevy Chase w / naked running through the forest, finger ballet that eventually revealed to be a naked woman's body. The last point is very similar to the deceased, incredible Ernie Kovacs. Now, I have lost a lot of readers, They are under 48 ( "Ernie Kovacs who ??"), but trust me, it's fun stuff. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons I was a "cha om the audience was that my friends and I would have brought other «Groove Tube» Virgin to see it. We sat with a sly look at the faces of "virgins" as PSA "Safety Sam" will play. As the camera zooms in slowly to "Sam", we would expect that the "OH!" Recognition in the "virgin" face. Each time was more fun than in the past. And then, that the "virgin" will then lead one to see the show, repeating what we did. In order to get the joke, you have to watch the video. <br /> <br /> So, some of them are dated, but the majority of plays, movies, television, and now video. Just look at any video, made in 1980. <br /> <br /> I see «The Groove Tube» in the theater as a film, grainy transfer from the original video. He did not have access, and lacks some of the original high-point scenes. <br /> <br /> The first show «Saturday Night Live», pointing Chevy Chase, caused momentary observations, "this is the guy from the series" Groove Tube »" so it was a precursor of the Chevy. <br /> <br /> I I can not look at the bank shortened without hearing the voice-over "coat in hand with a generous amount Kramp Lube clear cut ..." and thinking "Kramp Holiday Bread recipe." Always makes me laugh in baking Needs altar at the grocery store <br /> <br /> the early '70s were a terrible time. «The Tube Groove» was fresh, new, and really "get" the humor of times. He proposed a "hip generation", the humor, which was not available in any other format / medium. MJH
