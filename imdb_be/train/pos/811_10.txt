When I think about the return of the Jedi I think epic. Yes Ewoks were there what? They are an interesting addition to the film (not to mention they look like the Vietcong, who were also able to lift technologically advanced armies with primitive acts). The Jedi are definitely more darker than other films. Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid portrayed stunning theater actor) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so wicked and vicious, Vader look like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what a strange end to this iconic character. Vader is really a modern Greek tragedy, and I think that people can now particularly to understand and appreciate this after Revenge of the Sith came out. His redemption at the end of moving and really brings happy even bitter feelings toward you. The best part was, of course, special effects. It's amazing how the film from the beginning of the eighties could still stand the test of time with its graphics. The scenes in the palace of Jabba (Leia looks amazing in this metallic bikini) and, of course, the epic three-way battle at the end is still stunning to look at. In all deep storylines and emotional moments of the Jedi (primarily between Luke and Vader and Palpatine and Luke reveals the truth when Leia) and incredible special effects suitable end to one of the most beloved franchises in film history.
