I recently saw an IQ, and even if I'm not a romantic comedy type of gal, I think it was just a good and sweet movie to watch. So many films, in my opinion, lacks sincerity. You know that feeling when you're watching a movie and you just feel robbed, because it takes something out of the story, and it was as the director just threw it together, as it was rubbish? The history between scientists sweet and funny. They stick together, and they tried to help Tim Robbins character become smart. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg, because it was simple and was brought up in good time when it comes to love, "nothing is what it seems." I would recommend it for Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
