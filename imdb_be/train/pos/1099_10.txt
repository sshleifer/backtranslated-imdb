Although recognized as the best film processing difficulties who have a house in the country is built (or bought) to your specifications, it is not the first nor the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the findings in the film version of George Washington slept comedy movie by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. And fifteen years ago, Shelley Long and Tom Hanks starred in the PIT money. The first was the transition in the eighteenth century country house, which is ... uh, needs work. The last one was about building your dream home - at the end of the 1980s. Although these two films have their moments, and not as good as Blandings, which was based on the autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife, Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are noticing the narrow corners of his apartment, which they share with their two daughters, Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 it amounted to $ 15,000.00 per year, which was how to make $ 90,000.00 today), and lives in a luxurious apartment - in New York that day, when he rents ! - he feels that they have to look for something better. He and Muriel take a drive in the country (Connecticut), and soon the old ruins, which, as you can imagine is arranged as the dream home they want. <br /> <br /> And they both fall in the financial wormhole that land purchase and construction can result. On the one hand, they are so gung ho about the idea of ​​building a house, as they did not hear the warning after warning from their wise, when cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas, in a beautifully sardonic roles). For example, Jim buys land in Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, sucking his chops quiet), with a check before you double check the correctness of the cost of the land in that part of the State of Connecticut. Bill reveals that he paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it was worth. There are problems of water supply, both Blandings just do not think about how hard and soft water - which leads to ZISU - ZIS water softener machine. They believe that they have a design in mind, and worked with their architect (Reginald Denny), can not be dismissed less at the time of the decision spurs Muriel build a small rookery that no one planned for. <br /> <br /> escalating cost of the project is one question that tormented Jim. It was designed to handle the accounts «Wham» ( «spam" became popular during World War II, that the public began to use it as a meat substitute, in the light of this success with the armed forces). Jim can not get control of it (he was not alone - one or two other leaders groped him in front of him). It comes with the subsequent bit "poetry» (?): <br /> <br /> "This little piggy went to the market, <br /> <br /> It was pink, and as good as ham <br /.> <br /> he smiled in his tracks, <br /> <br /> when they gave him the ax -! <br /> <br /> he knew that he would end up as «Wham» "<br /> <br /> his secretary, looking at him, as if he needs a straitjacket when he reads that one! <br /> <br /> Moreover, Jim becoming more suspicious attention Bill Muriel though (in this case) Bill faultless. But he was always around (Jim continues to forget that Bill is a sensible one, and that he keeps Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have a failure, the best being if they are locked in a room, the house is built in half, just as men have left for the day. They can not open the door, and Jim (in panic) tries to break the door down on the improvised Taranov. He breaks the window and the door opens by itself. <br /> <br /> The film works quite well, with all the actors, apparently enjoying himself. This is one film that (in spite of the changes in prices and wages) is not really grow old at all. After all, most Americans dream of your own home and always. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, the company used the paint beautiful scenes of Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell on the work of the paint company Parnell is doing in different rooms. She carefully shows different shades of red, blue and so on, she wants - even giving polite Parnell one thread for the right shade of blue. Commercials have hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job. They proudly called Loy «Mrs. Blandings» in the introduction of commercials. Can you imagine, though, as no-frills Parnell handle the situation later when Loy leaves him with a paint crew.
