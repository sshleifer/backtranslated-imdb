This is an amazing film, for an incredibly energy challenges of feverish flamenco, and in a unique way, the filmmakers weave the story of the production stage with the characters life preparing for it. Tempting is the only word I can use to describe the experience. It is not "Bizet's Carmen" by any conventional standards. This is no ordinary film by any standard. Every nuance of opinion, every stomp feet, each piece of music intertwined is so interesting that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not need to love opera or flamenco (I do not) to be captured, delighted, fascinated by this film. Thin and straight; loud and still; One of, if not the best films of its kind, because there are so few like him.
