I bought this game on eBay, having heard that it was a similar game Elite. The gameplay is really very similar, and very addictive. After I played a couple of times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all my children, so they can join in the fun too .... I've played this game right through and the plot makes it feel as if you in fact, in the film, it's brilliant. If you have any problems feel free to explore, because of the restrictive nature of the plot in a single game, just adjust the Freelancer server on your computer (this is easy to do and the software is included) and play for fun. There are still a large number Freelancer servers on the Internet, so that the multiplayer is not a problem, and not all that threatening, because you do not often mean other players if you do not want. So get a copy of this game and learn it by playing the single-player campaign, and then to establish a presence on the Internet and enjoy. The depth of this game is amazing, with huge systems for study and wrecks to be found, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic game, and especially how you can get it for a couple of pounds on eBay. Get one with a full written guidance, if you can (blue box, Sun XPLOSIV red box), then the load better!
