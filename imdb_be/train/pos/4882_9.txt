It's funny business, review of films. These days, when "internalized emotions" and "emotional detachment" in preference to a simple sentiment, it must be hard to stay true to his real feelings. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the completion of the duties of the jury at the 58th Berlinale, I managed to catch Kabei Odi Yamada. <br /> <br /> After the show I watched people ambling dreamily out of the auditorium, watery eyes, men, women, and reviewers, yes. Even the director of the Berlinale, obviously a seasoned viewer movie, admitted that he had to surprise and cries turned three quarters of the way in this shamelessly sentimental experience. <br /> <br /> But what really surprised me was the reviews that came after. Although inexpressibly touched by the film, many observers have decided to be cool and emotionally evasive in their writing. Apparently, after crying, they put on their "thinking cap", and therefore also missed out on what I felt was a genius of Kabei. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Set in pre-war Japan, Kabei story revolves around a family of one writer, and their fate in it, after he had been in prison for what was described as "intellectual crimes" against the imperial freedom. Through a series of protracted emotional scenes, Yamada makes us familiar with the man, his loyal wife and two daughters, as well as three side characters ?? pretty young sister of a man awkward former pupil and hammam uncle? ? all come to help the family cope with their difficult situation, in the absence of the person at home. <br /> <br /> The story moves forward at a slow steady pace, and heart breaks occur at the exact moment everyone is able to predict. This, of course, makes it virtually impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally distraught by any dramatic events. <br /> <br /> In other words, while you learn to love the family and their assistants, and sympathize with their unfortunate situation, you get so lulled plot certainty that you find yourself waiting for a certain type of termination. <br /> <br /> However, two hours in the film (do not worry, Yamada gives the viewer enough moments of gravity and levity on tidal together), he shall smite thee with what I can only describe as a "stinger." All you have assumed, that the story was about ?? innocent snatched from his faithful wife and daughters ?? now suddenly he points to one of the family assistants. Someone you are still taken for granted are now thrown an unexpected twist of fate. <br /> <br /> At this point, something interesting happened in the theater I was. All wept almost without braking. <, Br /> <br /> "My word!" I muttered under my breath. It struck me that «Kabei», in the end, there were more than a film about a family torn apart by the empire to the brink of war. It was, in fact, a clever study of a universal fad :. How little we care about the secret feelings of the people who are closest to us <br /> <br /> Currently, the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid but lacked innovation. That's what happens when reviewers have put on them so-called cap thinking, I guess. With Kabei, I believe Odi Yamada knew exactly what he was going to use a trick to touch one of the unique aspects of humanity. Angry old trick of it is so easy to use in the Tora-san series, and then, in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> After a lull the audience into a kind of narrative comfort zone, he throws us into the realm of emotions are rarely seen in films. <br /> <br /> This, to me, is the most effective tool of cinema. One of them allows you to avoid detection, but it affects you deeply. And the proof of its effectiveness in thousands of pieces of wet Kleenex, thrown in a box just outside the cinema thousand double. <br /> <br /> Now, if only some reviewers will resist so caught up with being smart that they forget that the movie really. Human emotions. Pure and simple.
