I saw, True Crime, when it was first released back in the mid-nineties, and I watched it many times since. This is a great mystery of Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school senior in the California town that younger sister of a classmate was tortured and killed by an unknown assassin. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet, who sees how bright it is, and they decided to work together to try to find the killer. <br /> <br /> Many of the suspects in this. True Crime feels very "real" or real to me. I read a review of newsgroups where someone wrote that the total suspension of disbelief is here, and it's so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn doing a great job, as do the other actors. These places are right on, and writer / director, Pat Verducci, really captures some of the realities of teenage life and Mary's loneliness (see the scene where Mary awakens from a dream sequence after viewing the photos she took Tony). Verducci I would like to make more films. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other film quite like True Crime. 10/10
