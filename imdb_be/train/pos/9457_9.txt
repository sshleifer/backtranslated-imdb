How can you summarize just really like Feelgood and the film correctly and touching ?? Within a few weeks this DVD Sun jumped off the shelf at me every time I went to the store - seeing Steve Carell in several films before, I do not want to spread my thought process it - so I resisted and resisted until the end end I grabbed him with a "What the hell! attitude! And I was surprised! I just wish I had bought it earlier. Watching it three times in two days I'm still smiling as the image widower struggling with her three daughters, the pursuit of what is absent from the date of his favorite wife, who thus meets an intriguing woman, charming her in such deep and fun (dare I say the book?) path, throws an entirely different light on the life, that makes him understand that it is what he was looking for. <br /> <br /> The catch is that the woman was his brothers girls complicates matters - Dan depicting comically shy and hearty Unfortunately, seeing him "someone special" I will bring so much pleasure and enjoyment in the family's home, as well as his life brothers. You only really start to feel it <br /> <br /> Then, when there is a blind date with Ruthie Draper -., What is the turning point in the evaluation of Dana Marie !! The look she gives him when he repeated her comment about not liking Ruthie - full Green-Eyed Monster! Triggering absolutely hilarious scene as two pairs compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most well-crafted, Dan begins to relief in respect of Marie </> <br /> The other turns the scenes. - Dan returns from books and tackle shops, faced with his brothers, begins to describe what just happened to .... DEO if a person falls brings a sharp breath !! <br /> <br /> his youngest daughter, Lily makes a gift to celebrate your love for Suzanne, his late wife, brings a bit of heartfelt warmth and a little sip of Dana realizes just what he has lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays guitar and sings in the talent show .... his voice cracking slightly as he repeats the song. ... an absolute gem! <br /> <br /> acceptance of what happens at the end of the film his daughter ... they are all three love their father and want to see him happy, did not reject his love for Mary; Dana despair not ruin his daughter, because he is their rock, their fortress ... and tell him so much more than just a few words. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I will leave it now - can go back and add comments here soon .... but I will finish by saying .... <br /> <br / > .... if you want to watch a movie that is just so damn good, with turns to light comedy drama that never feels forced or stupid thing that comes as a true image of a man showing a new life - not only with the woman, but also with his extended family, then look no further <br /> <br /> DAN in real life. - 9 out of 10 for this good to be a cinematic experience with the score Sondre Lerche, which is close takes you there for a while never being intrusive, a fine ensemble cast performance. I can not wait to re-watch it again !!
