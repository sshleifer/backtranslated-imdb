I really liked this movie about relationships, which are sometimes developed between the US military and the Japanese women in post-war Japan - as well as the obstacles that bias created for them. Brando is a matter of contempt for the Japanese (which is natural, given the WW2), to fall in love with the Japanese and wants to marry her. His performance in the order (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the film is amazing everywhere. Red buttons got an Oscar for the observance of the GI touching of another, who falls in Japan (although Japanese women, who play against him have also done an excellent job). <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil the movie but a good watch with a box of tissues. <br /> <br /> This film manages to say something and be entertained at the same time. For the most part, an underrated gem.
