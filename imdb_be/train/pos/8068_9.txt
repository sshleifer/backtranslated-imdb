In order to see this movie from beginning to end, without bursting into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith, as it must continue to talk to himself, "is the old", "a classic", "please" and not therefore, the film is so bad, but because in the best case, it is so good. This one is dated the film. It is also a classic, when a dull one. I am not inclined to laugh at the people in general, in principle, and I'm getting more than a little annoyed when others do it. In order to make fun of the use of information in my opinion, it's a bit like giggling idiot scientist, if he looks around his orange juice all over the tablecloth. For example, one says to himself that he is an idiot, and yet, when he is on top of his game, he is also a real scientist. The same is true for the use of the information, which is sometimes very badly indeed, and yet it boasts a beautiful photo, some fine acting, a great score and a good, decent simple story. In the end, I did not betray, politics, religion and psychology have come together in the church, so as to make the scene seem trite and over the top, and yet so life sometimes. Uneducated simple faith behave differently from us (presumably) brilliant modern humans, and the scene is not so much incredible (I buy it, but I know the Irish), how uncomfortable. Nevertheless, people behave in this way, they say things like that. Not all of the hip, and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip. There are people today are so superior to seventy or eighty years ago? And how? I do not think so. We're just different. Now go watch a movie.
