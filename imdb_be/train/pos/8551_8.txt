Ti% s and B *, many cormorants. Some great characters, a fun filled antics and well together teenage action in the back of the Amercan Pie franchise. It feels like a really old school. It feels a bit like Porkys to the 2000s. Some great funny characters, combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> While the original cast, but it's all over, except for one, this film I found very interesting. Let's not get too excited, you should take him for a fool with the teen comedy, which it is, but for what it is, it is different. Characters cute and funny, girl's hotter than hell. A fun and funny game, with some things I'd never seen in comedies, they make me wince, but laughing at the same time. <br /> <br /> So ignore the hater and give it a run and see what you think. Do not expect a classic American pie, but to wait for something that should make you laugh and sparkle to your attention for an hour or so.
