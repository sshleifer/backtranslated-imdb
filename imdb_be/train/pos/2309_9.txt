It was life changing, it really was !!! Man in the Moon exciting experience watch.The action was incredible, the story line was great and it was a great start for career.I Reese Witherspoon will not see how anyone could not love this film.Sure, it's not the best movie ever even if it was close, but it was very interesting to watch, and I even had a big laugh in one of the anecdotes, and many other little laughs.Of course, there were some moments of your heart cry, too, but this film has been enlightening and it brightens up your day, even though you have to get a little depressed from stories zijfu, then then.I can 'believe this movie has not won at least one award, and I can not believe that it was seen by so few people in this site.See this film if you have not it is certainly touching.
