This film is just pulling you so deep into the two main characters. I put it in my laptop, even without reading the cover (not to mention the reviews) and was intrigued for two solid hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. Sexual tension that brews between the secretary and criminal practically even without significantly almost without physical contact. Towards the end I could not decide which I like more: Our hero and heroine, to remove their capers or simply complete your passion. RML could have done without the curious scene and traditional 100 minutes would have been enough. I quibble, though. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local NRB library of movie restored my faith in cinema.
