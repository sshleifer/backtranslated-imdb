HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the classic Shemp BRIDELESS groom. The new jam scene of the film at the beginning of the film is large. Puppets are always funny when they cook. However, after the first few minutes of cooking food shots, we cut to the original footage from BRIDELESS groom. One thing I noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes is that they come with a new story. They make inserting a shot when an old story line is not the same. <br /> <br /> HUSBANDS BEWARE do have a new ending, but I will not give it to those who want to be surprised. <, Br /> <br /> **** 4 stars.
