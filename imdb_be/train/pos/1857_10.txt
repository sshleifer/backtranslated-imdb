This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I expected. It was definitely a heart-wrenching cliffhanger. It's an amazing story, with amazing actors and creators. Picked another great movie with Denzel Washington. (It should not surprise anyone) Derek Luke did an excellent job as well.
