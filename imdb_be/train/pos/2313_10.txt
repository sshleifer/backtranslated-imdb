This "growing up" film is dedicated to the experience of two young girls, Danny and Maureen as they learn about life and love one fateful summer. <br /> <br /> Director: Robert Mulligan, known for its excellent work in "To Kill a Mockingbird," the film never falls into the wrong note. All actions are superb. As Dani Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut. Watching this beautifully photographed and beautifully directed and edited the film, I felt like I was looking through a window into a reality, instead of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that this is one of the single best movies ever that young, in love, and passing through the sense of problems and changes adulthood. Families with children from 10 to 15 years old have to watch it together and use it as part of the discussion, as it raises a number of questions on the doubles competition, how to deal with love, parental responsibilities, etc.
