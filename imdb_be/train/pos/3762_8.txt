Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves will return to the two dopes from San Dimas, who sends to another trip of a lifetime, someone from the future feels just the opposite, as it was presented in the first film. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their trip "somewhere" between heaven and hell, and ends up being both. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they get a chance to live after playing it for a chance to come back and stop the two evil robots from destroying what kind of future they had to have. In addition, they play a role ... uh ... has improved, they also play (and revive a couple of additional sales in the process), some classic games (I even have a copy of the original battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> reason I liked this movie better than the original, because it deals with "what it could be like" instead of "what happened." No spoiling the film, I can not give more information about that (I think you just have to look at them both and decide for yourself! 8 of 10 stars.
