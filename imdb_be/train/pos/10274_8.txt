SPOILERS This exciting movie about Grifters. But who cheat, who's there? If the hunter will become a victim? This gritty, dark film is slow and seductive. He pulls you and pulls you down the proverbial garden path, but watch for you as well as you think you are safe. <br /> <br /> It has a spectacular scenario, with good acting (at least, from the conclusions). I did not notice the background music, but it was never a shake, so it must be done correctly. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I liked this movie, because I usually do not go to this genre, but this one sucked me and he kept hooked to the end.
