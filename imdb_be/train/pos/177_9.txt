This feeling-good film and nothing else. And for this, it is very fun to watch. Of course, it slips over political issues. But what? I am sure that she is not trying to make a "Good night and good luck" here. Let's not try to do anything else but what it is ... snacks. <br /> <br /> It is very nice in this! <br /> <br /> As we remember that 1984 was like? We became very difficult for the media, to the extent that we see or not. I tend to differ on this issue. Goldie knew it was a fun-down and she went ahead and did it <br /> <br /> As well as its light fare :. Protocol, Overboard, Housesitter, Risky, Private Benjamin, seems like old times, unfair play, Death Becomes Her, The First Wives Club and alteration Out of visitors, GOLDIE know what she was doing ... she plays every role in the camp that you can get out of it! Goldie simply knows himself very well, and she knows what she can do very well. <br /> <br /> She always made me laugh merrily and innocently. I loved her in Laugh-In, and all that she had ever been. She never tried to be anything else, but who she is ... and that's what bubble, fun-loving, girl next door, which is very beautiful and has a smile and a laugh that would always call me and remind me that life is pretty short and you've just got to light, because before you know it ... you're old, wrinkled and suffer from one of the inevitable diseases of life. . If even come late <br /> <br /> I appreciate Gold ~ d for what it is: attractive, comic actress.
