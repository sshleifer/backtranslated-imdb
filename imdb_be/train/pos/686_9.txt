Ghost Story (TV Movie - 1972) was the pilot of NBC series. The film was well-written and well-acted, and I wondered if the 1972-73 TV season began, when TV's half as good as the movie, the NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie was available on video !!) series was a colossal disappointment - even from William Castle, as an Exec. producer. However, if you have the chance to see the original television movie, Ghost Story, check it out. You will not be disappointed.
