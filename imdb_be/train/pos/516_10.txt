One of the few best films of all time. The transition from black and white to color for Heaven and Earth was directing sequences advantage. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely intelligent, full movie leaves you overwhelmed by all the human emotions, and although it is not considered in the war film. I must have seen it several times than any other, and I never get tired of it. This is a movie that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs about what happens after we die.
