Vincent Cassel plays the role of Paul, a former prisoner, designed for office work, where he meets Carl, secretary, ?? rather dull "if she has her hearing aids in ?? very deaf ?? if there is no (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together, they help each other to develop as a person. <br /> <br /> What is particularly interesting was the complexity of the characters of this movie ?? fall entirely obvious stereotypes. Gender is a concern in the office is that it just is not cut out for the job? This belief is scattered when he gets a job in bars and shiny. <br /> <br /> The film has a certain amorality, which I find refreshing and showed how easy it would be criminal to act, even if we believe that it is harmless or justified. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is full of great ?? moments and touching and humorous. One of them, when Charles is a nurse and tries to comfort the baby cries. She continues to nestle it ?? but it takes her hearing aids out of her own comfort.
