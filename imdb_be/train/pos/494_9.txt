This is the beginning of a new and exciting Star Trek series. He has a "down to earth» -kind touch with the darker and less «plaggy» scenography. <br /> <br /> The characters need some more time to develop, but they have the potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (of all series Star Trek really) is that they paint a bleak picture of equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture of the rest. (Earth to stop the war, famine, etc.) <br /> <br /> The female characters there are two, Subcommander TPol that Vulcan and the Hoshi communicator that person. Hoshi quite cowardly and T`Pol made to be «Vulcan baby." <br /> <br /> Some of the crew relationship feel a little too American (in contrast to the international feel of the TNG crew) but makes for an interesting dynamic. <br /> <br /> a very good pilot, but for a very good series.
