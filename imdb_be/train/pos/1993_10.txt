It's a musical adaptation of "Oliver Twist" Dickens. For the most part, the original story was preserved, though (he spent recuperating and stepbrother example, in the summer) are omitted for certain film scene flow. The biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book, Fezhiny hang. - the ending is very different from that musical film <br /> <br /> This is one of a kind musical-- one really was not whose style and scale supported by before or after. Not only that, the songs are often quite singable and memorable, but the choreography of the film spectacle. While in most musicals are few people or perhaps even a small group of dancing choreography, here the numbers often run in the hundreds or perhaps more. It really is a spectacle, and I was lucky enough to have seen him in the theater when he made his debut and one of my earliest childhood memories. Just saw it again a few minutes ago, I would say that the film got only better with time. Great sets, excellent acting and singing. - this special treatment that it's hard not to love <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the film again tonight, I was amazed at how high and singing feminine Mark Lester was for the film. Well, according to IMDb, his singing sounded a girl, and it's certainly consider its voice.
