I saw this film when I was in Israel during the summer. My Hebrew is not owned, so the subtitles were very helpful, I do not get lost at any point in the film. You tend to get used to the subtitles in about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie blew me away !!!!!! It reflects the two most known taboos in the Middle East today: the homosexual relationship between Israel and the Palestinians. It allows a person to enter at the same time as the scope of the conflict. The dilemma emotion entails. The film ends in tragedy when the anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one side of an extremist! an absolute must see !!
