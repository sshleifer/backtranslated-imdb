Big S does not play with restrictions or making a program like, say, Mencia or Chapelle (although I love them both). It states the obvious to the subtle, far from subliminal remarks. Her show will not change the world, nor is it intended to. But, together with a cheerful Brian lean and Paget Brewster's former boyfriend Jay Johnston «Mr. Show »fame, is one mean the show with an appetite for destruction! My side was completely destroyed in the first episode. Look, I love this woman and her famous boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, it simply delivers the line and allows the viewer to RUN- of them. The best kind of comedy around. Substitution of anything or anyone, like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode, when she sings fake bird on quick hitting commentary on society and the college at the age of existential nonsense. This is a highly recommended, but only for those who are still funny bone (and do not lose it in their most recent treatment Lippi-suction or boob job).
