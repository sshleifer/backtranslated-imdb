If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, you have to see it. If you are a fan of Sean Penn, you should see this. If you are a fan of movies in general, you have to see it. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover, and you have no idea who Sean Penn, the film is likely to still have a lot of value, but the more work you have seen before on Crispin and Shawn, the better. <, Br /> <br /> This movie is so funny, but it's pure genius. There's nothing that I do not know what this film recalls. It is its own genre. I doubt that anything like this will never be done again. I can not say anything more about it, why not spoil it partially, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job in doing it. <br /> <br /> In response to any of the reviewers here who gave it a bad review, I ask you to watch the movie again. In fact, there is no point at which this film could rightly be called "boring". This is probably the funniest, most interesting, and at least a sad movie ever made. And it only gets better with age and repeated viewings. A timeless classic, unfortunately, very few will be able to say what I saw. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is a brilliant work of director Trent Harris, he is also responsible for a strange Rubin and Ed, who also stars Crispin Glover in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this film is very rare and hard to find. I managed to find a VHS version, after a thorough search, although there are several ways to find it, I know. But I really want someone to put it on DVD.
