«Come Undone», it seems to cause a lot of opinions among the participants of this forum. Of course, this is a film that promises to take on gay life, as most viewers expect and somehow, he gets on that promise in an introspective look at the soul of the young man. In the film, there is a way to stay with us, even if it ended. This is a landmark study of how young people involved in an affair with someone so different from him that, in the end, leave Mathieu confused, pain and depression, if things do not go according to what he hopes relations will. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, you may want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sébastien Lifshitz, film director, told his story from the point of view of Mathieu. Most viewers apparently disoriented at different times during the film, but there are hints that are not obvious, as can be seen, in retrospect. The story is told in flashbacks, which could add to the fact that some people will view the film. This is the story of doomed love felt for Cedric Mathieu and ultimate breakdown of their marriage. <br /> <br /> First of all, Cedric, a beautiful young local pursues Mathieu, as he was unable to convince him he loved him. Mathieu feels attracted to Cedric too. We understand how different and young people along the path of Cedric says Mathieu family, he feels the school was not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in a deserted place where Cedric took it. We are seeing Mathieu, reading from the handbook, wants attention. <br /> <br /> If Cedric Mathieu goes out to her mother, she wisely tells him about the importance of the continuation of his career. It also points to the fact that they both have together, which is confirmed in the future. Mathieu seems to have learned a lesson the hard way. He goes to the uncertainty of life with Cedric and tries to take his own life. We watched him in the hospital turned to a psychiatrist who treated his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> In the final, can be confusing for most viewers, but there is a moment in the film when the mother goes to work in a bar where we see him washing the glasses and staring at Pierre, a young man who He frequents the bar. That's why, when Mathieu goes in search of Pierre in his house, apparently, it is difficult to imagine. However, we have seen Mathieu obviously interested in Pierre. The last scene on the beach, when Pierre and Mathieu are seen walking in the sand, is a hopeful sign that things will be better between them, as they look young boy, apparently lost, but then realized parents nearby. <, Br /> <br /> Elkaym Mathieu makes one of the most complex characters in recent films. This is a young man who is difficult to understand on a simple level. Mathieu suffered a lot, the first division of his parents and then from his depressive mother and the loss of Cedric. Stéphane Rideau, who was seen in the other major French films are equally good as a fine Cedric. <br /> <br /> While «Come Undone» divides opinion, the film deserves watching because of the complexity and maintenance Sébastien Lifshitz history.
