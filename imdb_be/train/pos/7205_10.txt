Deathtrap entirely a detective novel. Who's going to make it to the first one. It's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away, so I will not mention anything about the plot. As for the action it is Cris Reeves greatest role in Clifford, a young playwright. You really see the range of his acting abilities in this film from the "exhalation cheeseburgers" to quite scary. Clifford such a hard role to play in the production stage, I have never seen, Clifford played well at both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays him like a little puppy or a maniac. Reeves is the only person I've seen who has the right character all the way through. As for Michael Caine it ..... well it Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years, and in this film as good as he had never been.
