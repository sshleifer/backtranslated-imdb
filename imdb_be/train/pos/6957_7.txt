Nya My Super Ex-Girlfriend wholly entertaining film no more no less. <br /> <br /> In the history of quiet simple. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the subway and intercepts it. At the beginning of their relationship everything seems normal, but then Matt learns that she is G-Girl. At first, that seems to be really cool Matt, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and need. Thus he decides to break it and connect his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes the G-Girl is very wisely, and she starts to revenge himself on her ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> What I like most about the film is the scene where G-Girl avenge himself on Matt. In addition, I was pleased to see Anna Faris in a different role, her character from the Scary Movie saga. <br /> <br /> I give this film 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who loves a good comedy.
