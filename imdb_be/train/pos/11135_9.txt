What makes Midnight Cowboy into a successful film is the way in which Joe Buck becomes associated with Ratso Rizzo through a series of challenges that affect both of them. There's really not much glimpses of hope in this film for any character, but the hard reality, overcomes them how to make a movie of his own type of optimism that these people can at least find the humanity in each other. <br /> <br /> This film shows the best characteristics of Jon Voight and probably Dustin Hoffman, as well. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, but rounded off by a series of fine character actors, including cowboy on the bus at the beginning of the film. In addition, for those interested, a pupil of Andy Warhol Paul Morrissey shows for a short time during the party scene. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this film, it's very important. Check it out.
