I read up a bit about Che, before watching this movie and you want to know something, that he was a hero for the people, because he just wanted to see equality for all, and that he hated the fact that the repressive forces make it man as well as all other countries in Latin America as a whole! Now, I do not know about others, but he did the right thing for me, wanting to socialism, so that everyone should pay their fair share. However, a powerful elite is clearly not going to go for it. Thus, instead of realizing that like Che Guevara, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to suppress the revolution. It did not work because there were too many other of his followers, who had just picked up where he left off. A good example of this, when Castro continued its leadership in Cuba. As I understand it, and Che himself is said just before he died: "If you kill me, that's fine, but you just kill a man, you will never kill the reason.!" I could not have said it better myself . <br /> <br /> But ... Anyone .... that's why I give this film 7 of 10.
