I noticed that many people who are sent to «Kerching!» Board seems to hate this show, which I actually find very strange. I think this is one of the best of British children's show there. It's a shame this is the end, because it is very funny (if slightly cheesy time) and has great character. The protagonist is a bit like Del Boy, although quite a lot smarter. With his two best friends, he was trying to make a million pounds for his mother, starting an online business and making the nickname «Rudeboy». His friends Seymour (who loves to cook) and Denis (which is naive and comic relief character). Throughout the show, some of the characters left and the new ones, but it was always interesting and better.
