I remembered seeing this film when I was a child one day a strange Disney world. This film has been in my mind for over 30 years and I was looking for him. I would say that of all the children's films that I saw then ,, this one stuck out more than any of them, and after only seeing it once, I was really hoping that I would get to see him again . History and photographs of this movie were burned into my memory. Until now, I never saw him after that day back in the 70s, in fact, I could never remember the name of the long search on the Internet today is not revealed to me before. I loved him, and I want my children to see it.Does anyone know where I can find it?
