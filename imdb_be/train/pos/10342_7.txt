Melvyn Douglas once again gives a polished performance in which, this time, he inhabits the role of a detective who can not put love before duty and adventure, and the warmth of a beautiful Joan Blondel (which, far from being illiterate, as one reviewer suggested, wrote a novel about his early life) is as enjoyable as ever as he constantly suffers almost eccentric comedy sweetheart.It in perhaps a thin film type, almost the series, I think not quite make it continue. He does not reach classic status, but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minutes with occasional, but Pacey script, great actors of character and direction, which keeps everything is moving fast enough, so that you almost do not notice that Williams (Douglas) not quite Columbo, when it comes to detection. I wish that there were more films like this.
