This is a must see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I'm definitely going to watch the replay. I really sympathize with the protagonist of the film, because it's true, I have a soft state problem skin it was, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB). It's sad, sometimes funny and very emotional film about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. John F. Kennedy said as a child (because of not spending the vocal muscle) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. Most sympathetic to moments of seeing his terrible condition, and peeling off his bandage. Johnny was quite mischievous sense of humor, he even handed over from beyond the grave when the show his body in the grave. He tells his story with the help of her mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrities, models and supporter in Jonny, McAndrew. He won BAFTAs for Best Film Editing and Best New Director (actual), and he was nominated for Best Sound () and on the basis of the facts Flaherty documentary award. It was number 10 on the 100 Greatest TV treats 2004. must see documentary!
