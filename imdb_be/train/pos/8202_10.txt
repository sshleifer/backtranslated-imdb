It was without doubt the best of the series "Dirty Harry." With the opening of credits, you picked up the revenge story that hits hard and deeply exciting. Sondra Locke perfect in the role of the injured woman out for revenge. Eastwood has a lot of "away" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry in his poor evaluation better. Loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles, this film rocks, and should serve as the standard for movie detective / action. This is one flick Dirty Harry, it's raw and stripped of any "fluff". I can look at it again and again (in order, rather than in one go), because it's nice to "revenge" yarn. Fast pace and a few memorable scenes. "Go ahead - Make your day ... you feel taken, Punk ....?Â» Classic Eastwood once Eastwood, with his painful, rubber neck and whispery, ominous voice can do it.
