Blanket around 911. 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (first instance), sometimes used to tell the Americans "we have had more deaths than you, and you supported the killer," sometimes very strange (but very symbolic and interesting). I really loved the Claude Lelouch (personal concert couple in New York, showing that our day-to-day "problems" do not matter), Shoei Imamura (eccentric, strong anti-war as a whole), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism, despite the terrible suffering of the day), and Youssef Chahine (Egyptian intellectual of the world, having the moral difficulties, take US policy towards the Arab countries) I am very pleased to see that many Americans have come to love this movie. It shows that we are (or are they? I am still a Belgian but has lived in Texas for 12 years) is still interested in other cultures, and the ability to question the past and current actions of our government, as we have in a democratic society.
