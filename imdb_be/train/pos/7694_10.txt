I would like to know why John Amos left the show, and he died on the show again? I could not relate to the whole, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they face. By the way, they'll ever make it out of the ghetto? I think that episode with a black Jesus was my favorite. We need to see what they feel some good times. they are not very often. I wish they would bring back the show. During the day, so that people can actually stay to watch. I do not think that movie or the new show will work. Especially without the original cast. They really did what Good Times Goodtimes. Here are my questions and comments. Thank you !!
