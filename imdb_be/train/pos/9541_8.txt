Wow baby, it's really some wonderful Asian horror / gore, and crazy amazing film. This is a Japanese splatterfest, which reminded me a bit of Tey, except that in this case, with all the blood and guts, there is an amazing love story. It is hard to imagine how they even came up with this visually stunning film, with some unique alien creatures that infect people parasites, turning them into the machine, or I suppose a cyborg. The only thing that is wrong with these creatures after they take over a person, it means they have to kill each other, and there's another. hmmm yum yum. This is likely to be called industrial spray or something similar, with a great soundtrack all add pleasure. The film also borrows a bit from Carpenter «The Thing» in the design of the creatures and effects. I would put this in the category for dolzhn- gorehounds, as there are non-stop carnage and some good gore. And a must-have for Stoners, because you do not even need to read the subtitles, visual images alone are enough of travel mind. Design of small creatures that inhabit the human body, as the embryo reminded me a bit of Frank Henenlotter films, which is another tribute to some great gore film with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is great fun for gorehounds, no doubt about it, and I just loved it.
