Hunky Geordie Robson Green Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves back home to Manchester to be with his father. Along the way, he falls in love with Anna, a woman 20 years his senior, and who happens to be the wife of his boss, Richard Crane. Despite warnings from his new colleagues, Owen continues to receive Anna for himself, reaching the sabotage and deception Anna married Richard. It is a romantic drama with many humorous notes and resourcefulness. Actors perfectly: Green "Student Prince" and "Evil Touch" smoldering on the screen as the trick, as long as the heart, Owen; Annis glory "Dune" is alive and shows good agreement with Green, Kitchen, with "play King" is correct as a threat Richard, whose comic omissions and snobbery emphasizes its imperious, building hatred towards Owen. This is the perfect love triangle, and, despite the weaknesses and mistakes of our three characters, exit is better to know and observe them.
