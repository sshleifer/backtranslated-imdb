This is an interesting series, which takes real-life people (Jesse James, Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes the real part of their history with a serial character for taking part in this story. Railroad Detective "Matt Clark" - takes the role in tracking known offenders of the Old West in history, which, at least in part on the true accounts. In this sense, it is almost a series of anthologies, as someone else pointed out, this amazing structure creates some temporary conflict scale with real events, but this is a fun series with lots of action to meet the western starvation 1950 audience - and still holds very well 55 years later. Clark will cut a powerful figure in the western transfer as it goes against some of the stories Baddest villains. And his girlfriend sidekick Franky full meal. If you are western fan, do not forget to check it out if you have a chance.
