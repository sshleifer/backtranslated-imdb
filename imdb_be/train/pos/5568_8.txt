A typical romp Cheech and Chong reality, which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars, and management even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundromat, stand up comedy, wonder more drugs and Space Coke !!. It's not as coherent or plausible as in the smoke, but it's still incredibly funny, Sun becoming as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes that include the opening scene, where they get some gas for your car and the desire to work. Also funny song Cheech (in Mexican-Americans) and follow the Chong lyrics. Another characteristic is the welfare of the scene Office of the scene with Jones (human machine noise), in a series of police academy, and old people laugh. Overall, this is a great follow up to the smoky completely watchable when sober or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
