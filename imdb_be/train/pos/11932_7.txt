I saw this movie on TV many years ago, and I saw this film when I got it on film. I thought it was quite well done. It was not the best of all the movies, but it was good enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger children. The action was good, with Danny Glover leading actors. The storyline is not very plausible, but the script was well written. The film may also be interested avid baseball fans. He did not directly apply to an action-packed sports movie. This directly relates to the good movie that you can watch with your family and get to know some of the messages that are hidden in this movie. Overall, the movie was good, but not great. I give this movie 7/10.
