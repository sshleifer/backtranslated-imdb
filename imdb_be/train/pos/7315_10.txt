Classic, very influential low-budget thriller that spawned horror icon, and began his career as a director and star Curtis Carpenter. <br /> <br /> It would stop a killer escapes from a mental hospital and returns to his hometown, where he begins to stalk the local nurse for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween movie that will never be able to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! scary story Carpenter and reasonable direction to give this film a frighteningly good life that has to be seen, really felt! Direction often consists of simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, making even everyday setting of a small town neighborhood is really terrible. Carpenter also times its obscurity and its jolting punches to make them more effective it strange that in itself a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! In addition, he is wise enough to give us some really nice young characters and very scary villain to keep the tensions increasingly strong. Highest kudos also go in a simple but frightening nervous Carpenter score. In a way, Halloween is a perfect example of the ideal horror movie! <br /> <br /> wonderful actor. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a good turn as an attractive babysitter Laurie Strode, it is so good that it will continue to be a number of other horror films before intruding into great movies. Large Donald Pleasants does an excellent performance as Dr. Mayer, who was desperately trying to re-capture it. Supporting cast Loomis, Soles, lock, and other are also good. <br /> <br /> Since your own villain, Halloween irresistible force, which never ceases to excite and cold. It is a must for all fans of the genre! <br /> <br /> **** to ****
