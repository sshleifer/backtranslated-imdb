This film has it all. This is a classic description of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino), only one out of a thousand, to get the opportunity to choose their own destiny in America. This is cinematic still very accurate portrayal of Miamis' Drug Empire strange. Brian DePalma does a terrific job directing this picture, so much that the viewer becomes involved with both the story and each character in the cast. With Tony pressence characters are so believable and powerful, Brian DePalma Brang of raw talent exposed Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina's sister, Toni), Robert Loggia (by Frank, Tony Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I enjoyed every minute of watching this movie and still watch on a weekly basis. This year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime movie, I, for example, a true believer, that in 20 years people will still refer to this film in amazing quantities. On the other films offense being so dramatic, I think that this film is a shock to the system.
