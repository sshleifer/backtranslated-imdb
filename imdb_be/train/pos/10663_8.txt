Here's a great Barbara Stanwyck double bill on the same disc. The first film - and believe me the lesser of two - MGM is in the "humor Lady» (1950), in which she is paired with Clark Gable. This is essentially a star vehicle with Gable as usual dominated the film of his presence on the screen. Here he plays the macho race car driver who gets a bad press from a feminist reporter Stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins. Of course, after a lot of noise, they end up in each other's arms, and it all comes to a predictable and pleasant close. A little step down exactly, but Gable and Stanwyck - two icons of the Golden Age - make it watchable <br /> <br /> But the real meat of this DVD is the second aspect - the perfect i really do not know the little thriller called Jeopardy. Made MGM in 1953, this is a great little gem of a film that is not from the Iota! Here Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and their mother baby son Lee Aaker on holiday on a deserted and remote Mexican beach when suddenly a tragedy happens. Dilapidated wooden pier collapses under heavy trapping Sullivan pylon and guess what? Yes, the tide comes. With not a soul in sight and do not release it myself Stanwyck is sent to the machine for assistance. After passing a certain distance, but help she can collect the proceeds from unfair escaped convict (Ralph Meeker), who - in exchange for his help - wanted more from her than money or a change of clothes ( "I'll do anything to save her husband"). whether or not it ??. <br /> <br /> Meeker escapes with the image he turns into a quite brilliant performance! Once it comes to the movie you just can not take your eyes off him! Actor in a glow style Brando he surprisingly never made much of his career in film. Despite the fact that he gave a miracle Aries performances as a reprehensible disgraced trooper in outstanding Mann / Stewart Western "Naked Spur" (1953) and as one of the convicted sacrificial French soldiers in WW1 powerful drama Stanley Kubrick's "Path of Glory" (1957), his only real claim to fame was Mike Hammer Spillane in «Kiss Me Deadly» in 1955, his work in «Jeopardy» was supposed to do wonders for him, but he was only so-so film career. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> With this release «Jeopardy» can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir. Memorable, taut and gripping thriller thanks to accurate staging, directed by John Sturges tight, crisp Monochrome Film Victor Milner and atmospheric score Dimitrov Temkin. Additionally, however, there is a large track for radio-version of «Jeopardy» and trailers for both films with the exception of. <br /> <br /> This CD is also part of a box set of Barbara Stanwyck celebrates its centenary. ! Hard to believe that a lady is more than 100 years old, if she was still around <br /> <br /> Jeopardy - MGM winner!
