Guys and dolls must be one of my favorite musicals ever. This is a very fun movie to watch and nothing else. it embodies the fact that people have forgotten about, were made musicals musicals to entertain and not preach. Currently, we have Rent and Chicago, which is great musicals and good movies, but they did not bring us a solid entertainment without. The only thing that bothered me was the movie Marlon Brando, the guy can not sing! It was very annoying to listen to his speaking and singing, when I could not understand it. If it were not for Marlon, I'd give it 10 stars. Guys and Dolls provide old-fashioned entertainment, which we rarely these days. Be careful to have a good time !!
