If you like kung fu movies, and you have not seen this movie, you are cheating yourself. This film is one of the few kung fu cheapies, which can be recommended for fans of all kinds of films. As a rule, it takes a die-hard supporter of the genre, to see something in these films, but this one has it all! The story is well told, and complete. The fight scenes are great, and, as a rule, to the end, before you completely bored with them (unlike Crouching Tiger). Add a little mystery and torture, and you got yourself one heck of a movie. See this at all costs. Heck, even my wife liked it. <br /> <br /> The D it! <br /> <br /> 9 of 10 <br /> <br />
