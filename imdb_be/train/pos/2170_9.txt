I think that the creator (s) of the concept of this film deserves much more praise than they probably have ever received. It's not Oscar caliber film, of course, but at least this film for me to leave a lasting impression, since I first saw it in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think it (and I hope it is not) a spoiler, but: imagine acting on your impulses. Doing the first thought that pops into your head, uttering the first words on the lips ... no shyness, no conscious, nothing keeps you from saying or doing something that as intelligent adults, we know that we should not actually say or do. Anyway, this movie is only scratching the surface - it does not go as far as it could go. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems frantic remake of the old "classics" to try to capitalize on today, it would not be nice to see them remake old films modest success for the sake of taking it to the next level? A little further, or even explore what the original team Nia did not want or could not cope with 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion, anyway. : O)
