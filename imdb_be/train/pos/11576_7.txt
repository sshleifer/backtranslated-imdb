He's trying to be an epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Sho Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies is really a perfect B-adventure of all time. It really is quite fun, swashbuckling adventure, which, even with its flaws, captures your interest. He must have felt as the greatest film ever for people who have done it. Even if it is made in the 90s, he has no modern look. It's more is the same feeling that the old Errol Flynn movie had. Great adventure movie big thing in Hollywood again, but I'm afraid that the feeling they will never be the same as those old movies were. This, on the other hand, only has a real sense. You just can not hate him. I think it's a good adventure. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want a song.
