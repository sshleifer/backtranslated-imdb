This weekend I watched this funny movie. and I really like it. all the kids are cute, that remind me of my childhood so stupid thinking. it's a real entertaining movie for a group of families in the weekend night, that could make a lot of memories and laughters. toddler humor always works. good effect as well. simple story, but cool shooting. good job to find a way directer baby. when it comes to kid's movie, I think of "12 and Holding." another this year, but different aspect of the world baby, which is a real and tough. a lot of work. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood that every child and family needs. Twitch postscript, I think, is the voice of Nemo from "Finding Nemo."
