SPOILER ALERT! This film, Zero Day, gives inner life of two students, Andre and Calvin, who are experiencing resentment and hatred of anyone or anything associated with a school. <br /> <br /> They'll go on a series of self-thought "mission" All that led to the great mission that Zero Day. Zero days Contents Nia Unknown By the middle to the end of the film. The viewer knows it serious and filled with hatred, but never quite sure until the end. <br /> <br /> Now we all know, when the film is based on the Columbine Massacre, Ending is pretty obvious. And the ending is no different than any other film about the attack, they go and kill many of his fellow students in the end. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies on the attack, and this film is far my favorite and respected. It gives the viewer an inside look and to the lives of these two teenagers who hate life, and honestly it gives the viewer some that he understands and is closed on the terrible events. <br /> <br /> Being only 7 If the events played out, I never knew the seriousness of the shootings, while my English class was not assigned an essay or a story about a defining moment in our generation. Well, I knew everyone was going to choose the Twin Towers, but I wanted to be different, because, of course, Twin Towers tragic and very Defining, but I do not think it's the right choice for me, because there really was no path correlation before that because I was only in the 3rd grade, and I had no idea what it all means. But if your shooting and effects. I remember an interview, the sky view of the school as well as the pain and the terror in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This film daily, down to earth, and monstrous masterpiece and I would Reccomened it to anyone.
