Hot-headed policeman accidentally kills a suspect in the murder, and then cover the crime, but they have to deal with a bad conscience, as he tries to solve a murder case. Tierney and Andrews reunited with director Preminger in film noir, which is as effective as "Laura" of their earlier collaboration. Andrews perfectly cast as the serious cop, a good guy caught in unfortunate circumstances. Operate perfectly all around, including Malden as captain tight police and Tully as a protective father in Tierney. Scenario Hecht, a large and prolific writer, melancholy and anxious, and Preminzher creates a wonderful atmosphere.
