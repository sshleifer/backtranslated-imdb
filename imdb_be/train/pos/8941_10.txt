I really enjoyed watching this movie on the Delaney sisters. I knew about them, but that was all. This film opened my eyes to their language and courage. Which pair. The sacrifices they made to live on their own terms. It's not just a movie for African-Americans, but for all Americans. It's kind of a history lesson and a documentary in one person or in combination with an entertaining film biography. The current superior to all-inclusive, and we really get an idea of ​​the troubles the two sisters have been in for many years. Both sisters are very different from each other. They came from a very loving family and a very strict high, perhaps even impossible standards of perfection. It is sad to see how Ghanaian father refused to allow her daughter to continue to see her boyfriend because of the possible misunderstanding. I highly recommend this movie, and I'm glad I caught it on TV the other day.
