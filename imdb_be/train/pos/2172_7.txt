Earl `Mad DogÂ» is back, along with his sad-sack Marie Mole, and that fickle Kosolapov Velma. So there Babe and Red Doc and Big Mac, and even scenery chewing dog Pardo. The only thing missing is a good reason for the alteration of Raoul Walsh High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking the line or frame, and does so much talent up a notch or two down the ladder than in the original. (Instead, we get Walsh Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get to Jack Palance Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on down the loan.) The only change is that this time, instead of black and white, it Warnercolor; Unfortunately, there are those who would expect this improvement. <br /> <br /> I have died a thousand times may be unnecessary ?? and worse ?? but at least it's not a parody; the story is still working on his unnatural conditions. Earl (Palance), fresh from the pen outside of Chicago, drive to the west, to lead a lot of work planned patient kingpin Lon Chaney, Jr. ?? overturning the post Mountain Resort. Along the way, he almost collides with family Oakies, when he killed their granddaughter; It holds even defeat, when he discovers that she is lame. Arrival in the cabins, where the rest of the gang holes, it is amateurish hotheads at each other's throats, and Winters, who throws herself at him (as does the pooch). time to wait until they receive a call from his inner man in the hotel, Palance (unfortunately Winter) offers to pay for surgery to cure a deformity of the girls, a gesture that backfires. Then, surgical raid resort turns into a blood bath. On the run, Palance moved higher in the cold Sierra .... <br /> <br /> It is absorbing enough history, competently performed, there is not enough recognizing Walsh and his cast brought to him in 1941, when the pull-out, with this role and that Sam Spade in The Maltese falcon, became a star. Finally, a heretical remark: These mountains look gorgeous in color <br /> <br />.
