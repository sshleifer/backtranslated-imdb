This film was weird ... he made me laugh, do yell, and most of all it is talking animals in it !! this film should be seen by all kinds of people! this is one of my favorite movies, and I just love it so much that I just had to comment on it !!! it Rox! so heart felt, and a great story, which is a big and heartfelt movie! my favorite shade of character. it's because I think he is the most interesting and charming. I used to have a golden retriever as well as a shadow, I miss him so much !!! He was my best friend, and I knew that when he died, he would be a happy place, but I miss him with all my heart !! this film is the best, I love it, and everyone should! Love your pet, no matter what they do, cherish them forever !!!
