Even if we know how the story ends, this is an exciting movie fly-on-the wall, which plays almost like a political thriller. During a lull before the storm, we meet with Hugo Chavez as a charismatic, larger-than-life man who has the inextricable link with the Métis, who make up 80% of the population, but had previously been shut out of the political process in Venezuela and its oil wealth. It seems that he is devoted to them as they to him. He travels the country in turmoil pace, getting to the Campesinos, addressing a huge crowd, hugging and kissing ordinary people, taking the letters on pieces of paper, and hearing cries for help. People are very happy that one of these numbers have made it to the highest office in the country. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better suited to the festering Barrios. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. Pure-blooded Castilian Spanish elite, who are a minority, but previously under the control of all the riches of full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most unintentionally funny moments in the film, when the twin Ann Coulter, a meeting of residents in an exclusive gated community, complains about the Métis, "they do not have a clue about the struggle or sacrifice." A few minutes later, he said that the meeting "beware of your domestic servants - they could be supporters of Chavez.» Duh! Of course, they are. <br /> <br /> At the end of the night only with crew interview, Chavez shows something of his soul, when he talks about his grandfather. It can be a sensitive, poetic face, albeit with a mischievous, even clownish, sense of humor (as we have seen, when he addressed the UN and called Bush the devil.) <br /> <br /> Then the storm begins to gather strength, as the organizers of the coup are calling for a mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters in the route changes at the last minute and marching on the presidential palace, knowing that he was surrounded by supporters of Chavez and violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the story falls into place, snipers on rooftops firing at the start of Chavez supporters, some of them shoot. The local equivalent of Fox News shows that it returned fire, and claims that Chávez supporters massacre of demonstrators. Then the camera zooms out and shows that no protesters - the street is empty! Protesters have taken a different route. Needless to say that the staff at the empty street was edited by virulently anti-Chavez private television stations (which was airing the constant barrage of propaganda, calling Chavez mentally ill and sexually fixated on Fidel Castro.) Immediately after the coup, we see leaders and their owners media propaganda openly boasted on television about how they manipulate the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents, yes. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers remain at the center of this chaotic, rapidly changing situation, as a military coup surrounds the palace, and threatened to blow it up. Chavez eventually gave up in order to avoid bloodshed, but refuses to resign and taken to an offshore island, where the plane is waiting to take him - where? US? Like other members of the Cabinet can avoid arrest and to win it is difficult to armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-wealthy businessmen who are closely associated with the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> If only the knowledge and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela from the US media, you do not know anything. It is not an "unelected tyrant" and the "rule of the decree" - it is very popular, has been elected several times re-elected with more than 60% of the vote (something George W. Bush never achieved) and devotion he inspires in the ordinary Venezuelan people ultimately the reason why the coup fails. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual film about the extraordinary man in an emergency. Mastery of the filmmakers is that, unobtrusive and allowing the story unfolds through the voices of the Venezuelans at every level of the barrel against the presidential palace, the tumultuous scenes of chaos and confusion, of which integrally turns out that intense, riveting and moving. Do not miss out!
