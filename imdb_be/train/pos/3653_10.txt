Why is a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this banal movie ??? !!! The cast gives good characteristics (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, elements of Keats as a girl without a mother, and Wolin, the guy always reduced by bothering him), but the direction is very sad, and the story is not so interesting and original. I can not believe that the film, as it was made on the big screen! Julie Corman (Producer): you CRAZY ??? !!!
