In spite of the gorgeous and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of the most boring Disney movies that I've seen, and I do not slam the Disney movies very often. The spirit of the wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured, either cavalry or the Indians, both of which are trying to "break" him. Spirit ends form a bond with an Indian, and that, in general, the history. Except for the beautiful animation of horses, neither I nor my five years have been very encouraged and excited by this film. It's ironic that it's called "Spirit" as the spirit of what this film could have used a little more. An additional point was given for the soundtrack, which was nice, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. Although this film is designed the G, you are still likely to end up explaining that "break the horse" means your five years. E. <br /> <br />
