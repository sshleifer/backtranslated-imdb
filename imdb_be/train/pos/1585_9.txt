Berlin was born in 1942. Margaret von Trotta was an actress, and now she is a very important director and a writer. She was described, perhaps even unfair caricature, as a director, whose commitment to the sensitivity of what the woman on the screen outweighs its artistic merits. «Rosenstrasse», which received mixed and even strange reviews (New York Times article was one of the most aggressive negative reviews I have ever read in this paper) is not a perfect movie. It's a great film and witness rare connects successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime, of all people, in general, the Germans infirm, who demonstrate on the streets of Berlin. <br /> <br /> Co-von Trott uses actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman searching for information has never disclosed her mother's life as a child in the German capital during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> The Weinstein husband of Ruth (Jutta lamps) died, and the unexpected return to the orthodox Jewish life, apparently still in a long inactivity, Ruth is not only "sitting Shiva" (Jewish mourning ritual week) but she insists on following strict proscriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York reflects the wealth provided by the writings of her late husband. Her American-born Khan's daughter (Maria Schrader), and her brother, a little snooze on the assumption mothers restrictive Orthodox Jewish practices, but they move in. Mother coldly rejects the presence of the bride Han, a non-Jew named Louis (Fedja van Huet). Domestic crisis may well erupt as Ruth warns that it will renounce Khan, if it will not give up caring, beautiful Louis. Stay. <br /> <br /> The cousin came to pay tribute to her, as well as the keys to the drop Hannah concerned about military secrets of mothers childhood in Berlin. Hannah intrigued - she interrogates her mother, who refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is a very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany in time, and I knew that many children whose families as a whole, but as a rule, partially survived the Holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed. <br /> <br /> So, Hannah, having learned that a German gentile woman saved the life of Ruth, traipses to Berlin in the hope of finding a savior still breathing. If it is not, it would be a very short film. But Ruth, pretending to be a historian, is 90-year-old Len Fischer (Doris Schade), is now a widow. As a happy-to-be-interview, but whipped repressed memories Lena tells her story, the scene is quite easy to move between the present day and Berlin during the war capital. <br /> <br /> young Len 1943 (Riemann) was an excellent pianist married to a Jewish violinist, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime, he had to use "Israel" as a middle name as well as the Jewish women had to add "Sara" to their names (by the way, I want to IMDb gave Fabian name in its list of characters with false "Israel" on is simply perpetuates the name used in the Nazi symbol classification and degradation). <br /> <br /> while Germany deported the majority of the Jewish population to concentration camps, married to "Aryans" were released. On for some time. By 1943, when the regime decided to take their dachshunds ama (most of them were people who had a Jewish minority married to Jews). The raid is shown here in all its frightening intensity. <br /> <br /> Young Lena tries to find her husband. All that she and many other women know that they are limited in the building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd is growing concerned about women, some pathetically seeking assistance from the German officers who predictably refuse to help, as well as to insult them ( "Jew-loving whore" be one name). As Len scene more or less takes the eight-year-old Ruth, who was hiding when her mother was captured (remember, Ruth Shiv now sits in Manhattan). Child Ruth fetchingly drawn Svea Lohde. <br /> <br /> After more angry protests women finally win. Men, and some women will be released. As in the real history of the Nazis gave in, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when crazy admitted defeat in their murderous agenda (the other was the cessation of euthanasia to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic patients, but that's another story). <br /> <br /> von Trotta creates tension and the story of each woman is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to push the aging Lena, which is slowly, one gathers, begins to suspect that she was not doing a historian, and someone with a need to know about the girl, she saved the baby, whose mother had been killed. <br /> <br /> contrasts between Rosenstrasse 1943 set, and on the streets today in a noisy, rebuilt, unified Berlin to provide recurring thematic element. Today, Berlin has the heritage, but not horrific scars of the past. Von Trotta makes this point very well. <br /> <br /> The main actors are equally impressive. Husband of Lena while strong also shows how helpless trapped concluding with probable forecast deportation (which has been shown to be clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - one way into oblivion), older Ruth catalyst forced to confront the demons long have strangled in his happy life in New York. Hanoi is very believable as a young woman whose father's death makes it necessary to open his family's past. These things happen (although Critic The Times, apparently, does not know that). <br /> <br /> Hand von Trotta confident, but not perfect. The scene with Goebbels in the evening, enjoying playing the violin Lena is unnecessary and distracting. The suggestion that it could have gone to bed with the minister of propaganda, the most fanatical admirers of Hitler's top level, in order to save her husband detract from an amazing accomplishment, demonstrating the spouses and relatives. Most German officers come from central casting and formed into Stroheim "copy and paste" of the Teutonic school shit. But this is understandable. <br /> <br /> The history Rosenstrasse has been the subject of books and articles, and some argue that it is the paradigm case, arguing that many Jews could have been saved were more Germans protested. Unfortunately, this argument does not make sense. German women employed Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably selfish. Most Germans were on the line, somewhere between a passive and an ardent anti-Semitism. That is why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually the only number. If one buys or reject the thesis Goldenhagen, that most Germans were willing helpers of the actual killers, he simply can not be denied that the pre-Nazi anti-Semitism endemic strain erupted in 1933. <br /> <br /> elderly Lena says that what has been achieved with the help of women "ray of light" in the time of trouble. Most men and women emerged from near-death journeys survived the war. Thus, the "ray of light" and the film was von Trotta is a beacon of light, showing that some of them were saved by the courage of ordinary women generally and for each life saved there is reason to celebrate. And always will be. <br /> <br /> 9/10
