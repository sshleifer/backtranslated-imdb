Most films about or set in New Orleans, are ridiculously bad and ridiculously inaccurate (examble: remember «The Savage Bees» But I'll make an exception for "Tightrope", which almost got it right). <br /> <br /> Here's one, it is not necessarily wrong. The emphasis is not so bad (yes, "yat" the emphasis here by more Brooklynese, than the south), the city in 1950 is shown as it is / was, without obligatory "tourist" shots, and they understand good drama, not trying to do everything with " quirky southerner. " <br /> <br /> One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good movie to download ..
