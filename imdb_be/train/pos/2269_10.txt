I just recently read the novel "Mother Night," I had a DVD for some time, and watch it every so often. Few films I have seen and made me think and question how her mother Night, I am struck not only shine Vonnegut, but the translation of the text on the screen. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or watch this movie on VHS, this should be done on DVD, and it should be accompanied by a commentary on the film director. In order to see how they took quite a simple story, but complex in nature and dialogue, and did it so well, I think that any viewer will be struck. <br /> <br /> The omission in the film with little text and not detract from it a lot, the film can also be a book, and this is the best adaptation I've ever seen. I highly recommend both the book and the film together, it does a disservice to simply say, go see it. <br /> <br /> It changes you when you do.
