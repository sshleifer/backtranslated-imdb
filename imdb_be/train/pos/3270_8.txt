Writers Perry and Randy Howze built a very attractive short story in "The chances are." <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​human reincarnation, which is going to return to the house of his ex-wife, many years later, the story takes an unexpected, stunning turns. <br /> <br /> Twenty-four-year-old Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job, ably assisted by Shepherd as widows and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has just the right chemistry for this caper, playing with one another with a refined style. I watched this movie several times on television, and each time found that the most enjoyable.
