I saw this movie for the first time a few years ago - and was hooked in an instant. This is a great, and much better than J. F. K. because you always have to think, "Could this happen to me? Can I become a murderer? You can not turn on the TV or VCR, without thinking about the story and the ending, which you should'nt miss under any circumstances.
