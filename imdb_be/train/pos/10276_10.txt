The opening of the film with the Bach Toccata is hearing a hint to uncover in this intense drama. All compositional techniques perfected by Bach to his listeners (and performer) is intrigued and entertained applies to this film. There is no mutual affection between the two main characters and the main woman in the final stage, I feel justified in the fact that she had been raped, while her executioner feels that it has been advised that he is a scoundrel. Mamet explores the compelling emotional abyss and the differences between men and women, but I feel that he is clueless about how they actually complement each other given the healthy sense of humor. If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous look at the interaction between men and women wonder how would have ended this work? As it has a very dark and medium energetic.
