For me, the final scene in which Harris responds to the press corp, a decent view of this clever and timeless piece of policy (especially the phase of the company). If only the "real" Pols react in intelligent, clear manner, as Mr. Harris did, arrogant, self-serving members of the press would probably think twice before surfacing unnecessary, confrontational "garbage" that has absolutely nothing to do with the candidates ability to effectively solve problems in the office for which he / she holds.
