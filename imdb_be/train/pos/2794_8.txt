As the film can be a controversial and delicate? This one does it with an almost perfect structure. No one wants their daughter to be athletes. Apparently, most cultures do not want their daughters to have small breasts, either. Here we see a bunch of great actors we've never heard before depict people of different cultures living rather humdrum life to their female children want and have the potential to become professional footballers. The structure around the parallelism of two cultures very well. There's no leniency. Both cultures are regarded as modern and is valid. (And yes, how stupid, too). One drawback: Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to attract hundreds of relatives, but not one of them a child.
