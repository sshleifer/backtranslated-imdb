Clara Lago beautiful as the title character of the film is essentially a film about the Spanish / American girl who moved to Spain with her mother at the time of the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother returns home to die, and she left with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experience a lot in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is located on the first trouble her then they become close. The film is shot beautifully, bathed in soft colors, mostly. Carol wants her father, who is a pilot in the war, and you can feel the love Cher has for him. While the war itself kind of took a back seat in this film, he encapsulates the life of the character. I think you'll like. See this is especially Clara Lago, who does a great job, Carol. It is definitely one to watch.
