* WARNING * Spoilers ahead ... The authors of this story know these people very well. Actors, too, drew them very well. The result is that by the end of the film you feel like you're actually playing John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Expected tension there, especially in the first moments of awkward. But as the two begin to relax, the old camaraderie that made the Beatles work so well, begins to emerge later. Bitterness still there and interrupted from time to time, but by the time John gets the idea to take Lorne Michaels to his proposal to pay the Beatles emetic amount of $ 3,000 will be on «Saturday Night Live», the two may be the same boyish prankster who terrorized Liverpool together as teenagers, and those that remained alive in the unequal playing nightclubs in Hamburg rise to superstardom. But in the end, this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently. We are reminded why the reunion Beatles, most likely, will never perhaps even before the murder of Lennon: two driving forces group outgrown each other.
