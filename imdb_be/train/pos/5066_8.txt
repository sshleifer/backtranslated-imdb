I know that some people think that the film is boring, but I disagree. This biography of a very complex and extraordinary personality. I liked the characters in the movie, and think that abandonment of the secret life of Archie grabbed his humanity. I do not think that the goal of a good biography should be detailing someone's life, and the complexity and relationships that make them interesting. And what is even more exciting than someone so successfully reinvent themselves? "Men become what they dream - you dream well." Good work, Lord Attenborough. I would also like to point out that Nathaniel Arcand really stood out for me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more films.
