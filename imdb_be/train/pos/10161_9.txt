I picked up a leaflet in renting this movie, but I must say it was very, very good. On all fronts: the script, the cast, the director, photographs, as well as high production values, etc. Eva Longoria Parker shows the head and shoulders in Rom / com above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who mug and call it acting. Who'da Sank it? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher in a class by themselves in this regard, and should try to stay on the projects as well as «Over Her Dead Body.» Lake Bell is excellent, too, and this is the first time I saw her. And finally, Paul Rudd gets to shine in a really good movie, not a smaller films. <br /> <br /> The film, as it never gets its contributions from the close-minded men. It's too bad. Like other reviewers here IMDb noted that there is nothing lame about this gem --no hack email or action. <br /> <br /> And his description of contemporary LA and California, in general, makes every scene look bright, beautiful, clean, and otherwise outstanding in all respects. Never before had a movie made LA It looks so good. Oh, that little bit of talent and a lot of trouble can do for the film. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the plot, but for a long time and hard-core atheist, I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme to enjoy the beautiful and carefree part of the entertainment. It reminds me a lot of old movies "Topper", who were also so nice. <br /> <br /> This film reveals the popularity, but otherwise formulaic films as "Ghost" for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap festivals they are. We already know the public taste leans heavily towards mediocre. Some of us keep our praises for a really decent, though. <br /> <br /> If you've used other overlooked gems such as "In the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Kla Gallager, «Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, "The chances Tee" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Making Mr. Right" with John Malkovich, etc., you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Setting the first rate all around (even if it's kind of hard to believe, a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years.) But even this portion of the apparatus does not detract from the film's overall advantage.
