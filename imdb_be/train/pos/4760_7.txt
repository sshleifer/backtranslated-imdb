Well, I gave this film 7. It was better than "Thirdspace", but not as good as "In the beginning" as B5 movies go. I really think that the TV series did a much better job in general, with the help of special effects and image characters. Let's hope that the producers and cast to get the next series of "Vanguard" to B5 standards.
