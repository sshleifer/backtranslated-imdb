*** can not see this having a spoiler, but I would be cautious than careless *** I have never seen this film when I was a kid. I fell in love with him the first time I saw it with my three year old daughter. I can watch it over and over again <br /> <br /> In the small incumbent Ilene Woods has done in her life, she has a beautiful voice for Cinderella. very attractive; very believable. Music really put the film perfectly. The acting was great; I loved the mice !! Do you really "hatedÂ» Lady Tremain and step-sister; they were just awful. Cartoonists drew spoiled behavior is very good. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, especially if you love history. My daughter saw a movie about 25 times, and still is going through at the end.
