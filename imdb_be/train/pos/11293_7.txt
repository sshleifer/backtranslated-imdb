Wyler would be directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music / recruiting poster-Vivant, but his own military commitments intervened, and he went to the sudden steering: George Cukor. "Director of the feminine" has assured touch on many documentary-like sequences of preparation Air Corps, and he puts it with a fresh humanity than the genre as a whole allowed, particularly in wartime. Of course, the sensational (and off-white, except for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) a bunch of beginners pleasant and useful than in real life, and talk about the house and the mom and wife and the child receives a fairly thick, but it's effective propaganda and, certainly stirring. It is also characteristic for all military-male cast, some of which did not resurface for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, red button (in the resistance as Andrews sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy , Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor.

Sorry its right in confusion and print only who knows this 16mm; apparently after Twentieth Century Fox released him (with considerable success), the right to return to the army, and if there is a good 35mm print there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It's not fair and trite in spots, but it also captures the severity of military training and the horrors of war, bright, and she deserves to be more widely considered.
