I love this show, it's like reading a book and each chapter leaves you wanting more. This will help you think about what will happen in the next episode, and the struggle is trying to keep his friendship over the years. After each episode ends with leaves sweet bitter taste in the mouth, knowing that - one show was good, you can not wait for the next episode, and it really makes you think about what is really going on with your friends for twenty years. And two - the fact that the show was put "on hiatus" and we will not see a show finish in the complete set. Fox |, obviously does not know what they did, they claim that they are losing the viewer in the 18 - 49 category, they obviously do not know what people want to see if they got rid of a good show, such as "Reunion" . I have one request, though, that I would like to raise. If they were to bring the show back, and this went on for another season, how it will work, because every episode is made within one year, and the story is based on what is happening in the space of twenty years? Your responses are welcome. Return Reunion! Return Reunion!
