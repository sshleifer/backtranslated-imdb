My comments for Vivah: - It is magical, idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us to the small pleasures, like the bride and groom's family, sleeping on the floor, play games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of the commitment between the two parties. Thus, the central romance naively rendered. But got into romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to the modern mating makes you crave idealism. The film ends with predictable marriage and groom on their wedding night, telling his new bride, who is suffering from burns, "Come to me to make a sauce» <br /> <br /> Vivah - showcases many good things - the beauty of an arranged marriage, the beauty of Indian culture , the beauty of the Indian women, the last but not the least pleasant idealism about-to-be-a couple waiting to get married .... play by the rules! Simple, but beautiful; This simple story .... no plot ... NO villain - as is the case with most Soorazha Barzhatya movies. Sooraj sir returned to what he does best. He made a film with complete conviction. It's very sweet film - which teaches the current generation of a lot of good things cycle arranged marriage and the Union of 2 families. I think Amrita Rao - looks very good and it worked very well. It has most of the good scenes - although I thought that the last half hour was completely Shahid Kapoor - who for a change are frightening low-key performance. I also liked acting from everyone else for the former. Choti ie Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, brother and sister in law shahid. It seemed as real and is known as he could. Sooraj sir got another good family film about him after I have loved, HAHK & do us part. The chemistry between Shahid and Amrita is amazing. <br /> <br /> Things like the sanctity of marriage / relationship, to avoid harassment, mutual respect, care & Space, Waiting Marry "officially" pray / Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all this and much more to get screened in Vivah . There are still good audience, ¨R gather and enjoy this film. Some people / audiences already excited after seeing that i think bout Arranged Marriage-:) Thats success, if you ask me. seems Amrita Rao - our actress-to-Vivah {result} for good performance was awarded the prestigious DADSAHEB Phalke in 2006 !! Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo, despite the fact, Vivah, Shahid and Amrita has not received any of the film-tariff and other awards; @ Measures of this is news to cheer about !! Congratulations Amrita Rao to show us a visual of the Indian bride to be pure and of course Soorazh Barzhatya for drawing it the best way to forget :) Shudn't Shahid Kapoor and all others who do Vivah sweet and legendary today !! Imagine that the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... Its not mean achievement !! Congratulations Amrita Rao - for taking her career to a new level with this award .... I personally feel - it must continue to make films only with Shahid Kapoor !! They make a cute couple and their onscreen chemistry reminds me of SRK-Kajol {} or {Amir Khan and Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> <br /> some moments that I watched some of the elements: - # 1 When and carefully observe Amrita Rao looks good because Shes always wear traditional dresses. It gives every bit of Indian essence - in this movie !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapoor, like most of us - not quite ready for marriage or early marriage .... but premium listens to a step talk given him the DAD - having full faith in Anupam Kher. In the end, "Honesty" and "Trust" are the key words, which he reflects in his first interview with Amrita. Most people think this first meeting with a stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But from what I've seen in this film, I have a feeling - that the two men, who are made for each other, you can connect within 1 second is also common, it can be !!! # 3 in the entire film - is mainly 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrta together - or shown to be together. It differs from most other romantic / weddings based on films where the hero and heroine always sings / dances or now - to do cheap things. But the beauty of each of the 5 sequences: - remarkable restraint, innocence and respect for others! # 4 I really enjoyed it, the Chacha Alok between Nat and Amrita Rao. This is an interesting movie stands out shown to her daughter / girl children in some parts of India. # 5 romantic scenes between the lead pairs are removed very beautiful - not cheap scenes, the songs are not beautiful in the photo !! Words such as «praarthana» e.t.c. "Jal" are catchwords for all girls who love this movie :) Personally, I really liked a lot of dialogue in this film. # 6 Last, but not least - All hospital scene where Shahid put «sindhoor» in the Amrita, when Shes fighting for his life - that's fine. These dialogues between a pair so touching and feeling LOVE U / I-d-jamb-without-U; His hat-Off feelings !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many ways, Vivah reminded me I have loved, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Forever yours - for freshness / screen-chemistry couples LEAD :) :) *** IF U ASK ME - Together with films like Rang De Basanti, Lage Rao Munnabhai, Dor, corporate and Kabul Express, Vivah is one of the best films made in 2006, in fact - I think Vivah really deserves a better view / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal whether the time pass / unreliable / style / shit movie !!
