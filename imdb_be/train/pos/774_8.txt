I think it's a good movie; I think this is a very Romanian film through the scenery and atmoshpere; I think it would not be sensible (sensuality is a result, not a goal); I think it is very natural; I think it is humane; I think it was interesting; I think that the actors never made me think ... nya WAW lame action (they are not Sean Connery and with) none movie booster unit, they are like the movie ... the normal procurement, which may act. ..; I think the film has reached its goal; I think it made me feel a thing (or feel them again :)); I think that I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... I know.
