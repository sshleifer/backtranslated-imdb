I came across this (Act-I) pure dumb success, and it was more than ten years ago. It was'nt even what is referred to the label on the tape coating. It struck me. It scares me. This surprised me. In the end I forgot and almost ten years later, I happened to think about it again. Then he went out and bought both actions. They were even better than I have experienced in the first. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that while the armored police continue to go on and on about being in a state of war against crime, maintenance of tanks and heavy artillery, it would seem as if they are really difficult time with criminals. Either did not show or just lie, they seem to be taking it easy most of the time. If this bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it is, of course, has not been shown as such. <br /> <br /> I do not think that the original Japanese version can be any where as good as the Americanized version of it. But this story, then, of course, there were some proper explanation lost in translation, but it can be released.
