Part of what was so great about classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their irreverence and they were not afraid to do what they wanted. In this case, Marvin the Martian has the task to return the Earthman. Of course, he gets Bugs Bunny, which warns about the revolt by Marvin dogs. After Marvin finally Bugs traps - using Acme straitjacket ejector bazooka! - Bugs have more things planned for the trip back to Mars. What I have in mind when you thought it was one of the major changes in the solar system, when they stripped Pluto of its planet status, then you have not seen anything yet! Thus, the "hasty Hare" is everything. They buy products Akmal in outer space, probably beyond most people, but the point here - I mean the "hare" - it's fun. And believe me, you certainly will. In the end, a small place, with never hurt anyone.
