Rumor has it that at the time when ABBA ?? Multi award-winning Swedish darlings disk ?? Star 's reached its peak, the group was disappointed with the singing in English and longed to perform in their native language. Soon after the problems began to arise in a disposable closed-married permeable partnership and writing became less and less. The band broke up, albeit informally, in 1982, and pop has lost one of its most famous artists. Despite the fact that they have never recognized that there is some truth to these rumors, the fact remains that ABBA will never have been so successful that they are only written in their native language. If you want to appeal to the largest market of profitable media in the world, then you have to meet the English-speaking audience. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to me how such a small island, which is a stone's throw from the European continent would create, perhaps the most famous, if not the most widely spoken language in the world. Everyone says a bit in English; let it be just a "hello" or habitual profanity - you will find English-language almost everywhere. Pedro Galindo, obviously, does not agree, because Trump Infernal never been subtitled for global consumption, until he was released recently on the cheap DVD. It's a real shame, because it's actually a decent slasher film, which is much better than many of his English compatriots genre. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a somewhat unfamiliar territory pistol duel. Two unidentified characters appear to sneak around looking at one of the dilapidated complex one for the inevitable final showdown. After some waiting, and a few misses, one of pistoleers out the winner. Next, we learn that they were only a paintball gun and two members, in fact, young people from the local town. Nacho Mauricio and are ardent opponents and Mauricio are always trying to prove that he is better than his opponent in a soft voice, but so far failed. <br /> <br /> Later that night, while the victorious Gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his friend Alejandro and his friend Charlie, Maurizio walks into a bar and says that he has another test for his glorious nemesis. He says it will be a contest that will prove to the city once and for all, who deserves full respect. Nacho is on the first reluctantly, because Alejandro warns him of the dangers of ongoing competitiveness, but in the end he succumbs to pressure from the weight of their peers and agrees; a great dislike him morally superior partner. <br /> <br /> They are planning to head out to a remote area Phil de wildly as the recent press coverage reported that many people were killed in that local residents believe that the vicious bear. Mauricio offers the one who kills an animal may be regarded as the greatest, and he also promises that this will be the final battle that he is waging against his opponent. <br /> <br /> After a visit to the Armory, to stock up on weapons and ignoring warnings about the janitor old store, the group set out in the remoteness of the separate forest. The hunters become the hunted as they learn that the "bear" is actually a deadly Vietnam veteran who does not know that the war is over, and considers all people as their enemy. What began as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a fight for survival as they are persecuted and destroyed by malicious killer. <br /> <br /> I took the Trump during training in Madrid, the Mexican student, who lived in the next -Door my dorm room. I remember that I saw a copy was defective, and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled, which meant that I never got to see the last scene. Fortunately, I came across an amazing DVD on Amazon recently and immediately add it to your collection. <br /> <br /> slasher Gallindo is a surprisingly good effort, which is different from his strong leadership and captured the story, who is trying to reach the area, as a rule, does not address the chopper movies. It's actually so good that it reminded me more than once in the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic Predator. This is particularly noticeable in the scenes depicting the crawling-disguised assassin jogging through the woods and chases in the company of a panic as they struggle to avoid the site of a maniac. <br /> <br /> Despite the obvious awareness of genre cliches Gallindo (stuffed even uses a claw finger gloves a la Freddy Kruegar); Trump is also trying to add something else in the template. While most of the performance of game-specific rules categories, the final third heralds a significant step in personality, like a maniac arms himself with a gun and seduces the hero in his lair for the final showdown. From this point on, the film is quickly changing genres and is almost thriller, which, depending on your taste or excite or disappoint you. Last slasher who tried to cross the two styles that shoddy record eighty Â«The majorettes", which is not necessarily a good thing. <br /> <br /> As is the case with a number of Latin films (especially Spanish cinema of Almodovar and Amenabar), Trump has a thin hollow moral to his story, which has been successfully transported without rammed throat viewer. For temptations to indulge in competitive courage and can not always be a winner. This sugar-coated point, but it is treated quite gently, so as not to detract from the fun features. <br /> <br /> Trump may be bad, but it deserves to be seen and recognized as one of the best slashers of late, killer looks great in a terrible army fatigues and a white mask Valentine's style and originality just trying to work on. It may lack the baked blood, that the most sincere supporters horror use, but it has enough with the point of view of suspense and creativity to ensure at least one view.
