When scientists and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich), finally, accept the invitation to work at the Micro-Digitech Corporation in a spacesuit project, he moved with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son Robbie (Barret Oliver) and the daughter of Chris (Soleil Moon Frye) in a large modern house in the compound of the corporation. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family are fully adapted to the new way of life, and Tom Winslow invites families to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Those trying to seduce Matt to tell him that each member has a rapid ascension in professional Micro-Digitech, but Matt entirely seduced by the proposal. Later, he met with the director of the club, Jessica Jones (Lucci) that friends Patricia and convinces her to join the club with their children. Matt feels a change in the behavior of his family and decides to explore the club to find an evil secret about Jessica and members. <br /> <br /> In the 80s, when I saw the "Invitation to Hell", I liked this movie, which is partly reminiscent of "The Stepford Wives", with people changing behavior in a suburban compound. I just saw it today, and I have found great metaphorical message against large corporations, where people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher wages. I'm not sure what the author intends to give this interpretation of history, but I think this is perfect. My vote is seven <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "Convite Para on Inferno" ( "Invitation to Hell")
