As an adult in her mid-40s, I was not even close to any "Nancy Drew" 's key demographics, but I was pleasantly surprised by the film in the second half of the day; Yes, I would say, were a pair of gray-haired ladies sixtyish down the row from me. The older the person who left the theater just in front of me specifically praised the film to 20-ish female police officer (who said that she saw the film last night and loved it). <br /> <br /> More than a point, however: in the line just ahead of me, there were nine - count them, nine - ten year old girls lined up next to each other, passing the popcorn and hot dogs and sweets around and giggling through the preview. <br /> <br /> After the beginning of the film, they quickly settled down to watch .... <br /> <br /> .... not so much as a squeak before the final credits rolled <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie. it is not quite pay off podagovory high school, it's not quite confident enough in his own tone, and his goons just a hair too far side critically incompetent at times. But adapting the source material, in fact, with respect, the plot hangs together pretty well, and he steps nimbly between sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization. And last but not least, Emma Roberts carries the film with surprising grace - great timing Josh Flitter in spite of this film Roberts, and she pulls it off beautifully. . Her Nancy Drew is very direct ancestor of Kristen Bell Veronica Mars, and the film is also a direct descendant of Jodie Foster and start undervalued «Candleshoe» <br /> <br /> In today's market, it is a rarity: a family film that respects the intelligence of its viewers . Thus, it will not be for everyone - but what is it, what is the best film of its kind in decades.
