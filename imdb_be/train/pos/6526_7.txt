I always enjoyed watching it when he came on television in prime time each year in the 60-ies. This is a typical story of a Hollywood epic, theatrical, stylized and full of inaccuracies, but in a way that is entertaining movie and beautiful film. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of the remake of his 1938 film. His son the actor Anthony Quinn, who had a supporting role in Beluche 38 film director in his directorial debut and swan song, he had never directed a film before and never will again. DeMille gathered the crew, who recently worked on his 10 commandments to help Quinn to get him out, including longtime DeMille associate producer / actor Henry Wilcoxon overseeing the project. In addition, the 10 commandments are a writer Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, Deputy Director Francisco day, the second unit director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, director of the collection of Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester, who is the costume design team received only Oscar nomination pirate. Excellent cast here from DeMille team led by Yul Brynner as the pirate Jean Lafitte and Charlton Heston as CEO of the future president Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast Charles Boyer, EG Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. In little more than two hours, it drags in some places, but makes up for it with some great fight scenes. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.
