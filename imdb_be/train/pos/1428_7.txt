There are several exciting heart stoppingly beautiful photos here are a number of landscapes and animals, from arctic to tropical and everything in between. camera techniques are varied and spot on from close-ups to work at height. Editing and comments tremendous spot on too, with the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world. Where the film falls a bit in an attempt to capture and integrate the four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, the individual stories of animals and hunting / Hunting interaction between multiple environments. In the end, it all becomes a bit disparate and inconsistent. Overall, worth a look, especially with regard to the matters covered, but do not expect Oscar material.
