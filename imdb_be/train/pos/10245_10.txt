It was my personal favorite when I was young, it was all that was great with 90 movies kids ... cute dinosaur, cute kids, eccentric villain, and a few great songs (instead of the typical Mermaid / Beauty and songs such beast, but those atually entertaining)! I ran into this film again recently and I still love it as much as ever! I recommend that every one of all ages have to see this film, and I definitely think that it should be introduced in the younger generation! sorry not the most informative, I'm in a hurry ... just curious, please believe me. Everyone who goes against this film kills your inner child!
