I turned it on to see incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I'll read. I admit that my jaw dropped when the pork chops and links watermelon began to rise, but people can not look at this film as stereotypical or racist side. This is largely a short film made by blacks for blacks at the time when the entertainment industry was quite segregation and stereotypes for the people involved were jokes of his time, the old tendencies exaggerated for humor. We see a modern black movies do the same, but with new trends (patterns), "Ha" and "hood" and the like. I think if you look back in the eighties, you would find today's movies will look just like a racist. That viewers have to evaluate this film talent Waters and pints of Sammy Davis, Jr., who knocks his contemporary, Shirley Temple, and looks remarkably the same vestibular, as he did as an adult. Everyone involved in this film obviously had a lot of fun making it. Why not enjoy it for what it is, rather than what you think it should have been?
