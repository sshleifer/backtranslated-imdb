This film is a must for all people who enjoy football as art. What is striking about this first film about the football World Cup is the way it is shot. In addition, after the game, as the TV broadcast, there is a generous staff dedicated to adhere to the individual players in games. This brings forth emotions and situations, these people go through as they try to achieve fame. Today, the style of television broadcasting, so much different than 1986, is still inferior in quality compared with that movie. <br /> <br /> Players not only stars. The audience, judges, journalists who cover the game itself and the environment all play a central role in the development of that history today. In this film you can see how all of these factors play together in a very explicit. In this regard, today the television broadcast style has not yet reached a level of quality, although it is much closer than before <br /> <br /> There are a few players singled :. Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Michel Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague # of (Spain), Socrates (Brazil) and Sanchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This film is not a collection of the best football movement in Mexico in 1986, although most of them well-lit. Throughout the film, there is stress on the representation of certain aspects of the game and the competition itself, based on the progress of these players and teams, even by skipping appropriate play games themselves. This is what makes this film so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Because of that was due to the arbitrators of Mexico during 1986, most of the comments about this movie and the World Cup, Maradona is extremely biased. Most of these observations do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen, that they are people just like the players, and that all of the above make mistakes anyway. football rules do not allow the referee to use replays on TV based decision-making, and for the most part the arbitrators have to decide what they perceive. As a result, judges play an active role in the development of the game. Their influence can be seen in several parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Continuation of the film for the World Cup in 1990, compared to this, is the only source of bitter disappointment. Much of this comes from the fact that he had become too involved in the game, while this film tells things from a more distant, objective point of view.
