1958. sleepy little southern town of Bridgeport. Evil Sheriff Roy Childress (Almighty Vic Morrow in peak form opposite) crack down on speeders super hard, forcing said criminals from a rock to them premature death on a particularly dangerous stretch of road. Childress meets his match when a cool hot rod young driver Michael McCord (brilliantly smooth and thoughtful image of Martin Sheen) shows in his souped-up car with the specific purpose to avenge the death of his brother (in real life brother Joe Estevez Sheen in a brief cameo). Director Richard T. Heffron, working with a tight and intriguing script Richard Compton (the same guy who led the 70-in wheels Gems film "Welcome Home, Soldiers Boys» and «Macon County Line»), relates a fascinating story in a brisk pace neatly creates the installation period on flavorsome 50s, and knew how much milk the uncertainty due to the intense game of mind and wills between Childress and McCord. Uniformly fine cast helps a lot: Sheen exudes daring James Deanesque rebellious vibe in the invoice, Morrow makes the most of its fleshy part of the bad guy, plus there are excellent supporting performances of Michelle Phillips as a sweet snack waitress Maggie, Stuart Margolin as MP, Nick Nolte how polite gas station Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan, how lovingly awkward younger brother Base Lyle, Janit Baldwin, as the brazen tart local Sissya, Britt Leach as the miser taxi driver Johnny, and Frederick Downs as a stern judge JA Hooker. Naivysočajšij motor standoff between Childress McCord and a real pulse-pounding white fist gripping Doozy. sharp cinematography Terry Mead, it is well depicted characters (for example, Childress became obsessed with destroying speeder after his wife and child were killed in a fatal hit and run accident), in the winding, syncopated score Luchi De Jesus, and the beautiful mountainside landscape all further improve the overall sound quality of this wonderful winner for the TV.
