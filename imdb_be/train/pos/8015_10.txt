I first saw this movie in a movie theater when I was 8 years old, and it still cracks me up. Muppet is so cool and they are close to show business refreshingly naive. My favorite scene is when the rats start whispering company named Kermit in a trendy restaurant. This is a clever and funny movie for children and their parents. Hail to Kerman, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
