Costumes and makeup were great, there were some very funny lines, and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey did as good a job as can be done, given the rather disappointing script writing. Of course, it was basically a film for children, but if you are going to spend so much money, what makes a film that you really should at least give the story enough bodies to go beyond that of Dr. Susan. I expected more from Ron Howard. It's worth a look, but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic, by any measure.
