I have seen many PPV's in the past, but this is the most interesting, intense and most complete PPV DVD I've ever seen. On the DVD extra is worth it, because they give a different view of how the wrestlers stand after the show (for example, an interview with Chris Benoit / edge of the interview), some glimpses into the era of Monday Night Wars, the first match Hogan tag title victory gold and some promotional talk. In addition, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Tag Team Table match: Bubby Paradise and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerra and Chris Benoit 7/10 It was a very good intense game to start running. Are there too many holds and just pure raw physicallity. Spike can hold his own in the tables matches and Guerro and Benoit gave a good clean wrestling skills on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight Championship :. Jamie Noble w / Nidia v Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd really does not care about the fighter and is not interested, while Kidman did a shooting star press. Usually, people expect a lot of top-flight championship in the weight of the cruiser, but it was very small. In fact it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, nobody even cared any knowledge (you can tell by the lack of camera flashes). The ending was quick, though. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship :. Jeff Hardy v William Regal 5/10 I never liked the royal as a fighter, he lacks the intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but do not really get a chance to show his high flying act, although he still carried some good counters and added that it is necessary in the fast-paced game. It ended on quickly, making it ideal for this match. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena vs. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny looking back on the first PPV Sina, how he used to act the way he dressed and how he used to watch (watch it interview, it's pretty funny). It was a good intense match with Cena shows a good variety of holds, suplexes, counters and some antennas. Jericho was subpar but definitely helped Cena started his career. Cena won. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontenital Championship :. RVD v Brock Lesnar 8/10 It was a very intense and a good match. Both fighters picked up the style really well on the screen, with the Brocks clean power and raw energy against RVDS complete mastery of moves and speed. RVD looked great in this match (better than his subsequent matches with a side and Sina) and the whole game was fast paced. Ending worked perfectly, because he still retained his undefeated streak Brock, giving RVD its just desserts in his home state. <br /> <br /> 6 No Disqualification match :. Booker T v Big Show 7/10 Another tough match that lacked a certain intensity as in RVD match, but still good to watch. Despite the fact that the curious began slowly (which is always a great show) Booker T was impressive and made the painful movement on the announcers table. The finisher was strange, the ending was a big upset and a big step at Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship :. Hogan and edges v Christian and Lance Storm 5/10 It was a mediocre game. Hogan comes out, as usual, with great priests, but a variety of moves is not enough that the intensity and energy. Then a Christian is not exactly the most athletic ability themselves. It ended up being a mediocre game at best, but still good for the PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match for the championship Undisputed: 10/10. Rock against the undertaker vs. Angle. <br /> <br /> Easy match of the year. This is definitely the best match triple threat I've ever seen. He had a strong fall, wealth finishers stolen finisher, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. No one could predict who will come out of this. If you are going to buy this DVD, I would have bought it strictly for this match. (End? See for yourself!) <br /> <br /> In general, it was a solid PPV with lots of extra goodies to keep you playing again and again. Although it is hard to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD) it is definitely worth your money.
