For my project humanitarian quarter for school, I decided to make human trafficking. After some research on the internet, I found this DVD, and ordered it. I just finished watching, and I still think about it. All I can say is "Wow". This is such an exciting story about the 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and the American man named Patrick, who is trying to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and, although it is not happily ever after, it is very realistic. It's amazing, and I recommend it to everyone! You really connect with Holly and Patrick and heart breaks for her, and because of what was happening to her. I loved him so much, and now I want to know what will happen next!
