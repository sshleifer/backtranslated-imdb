Diagnosis Murder was shown on most afternoon WeekDay on BBC1, so I used to see him during his illness from the school a good 10 years ago - I know that I do not really enjoy it the same way I do not have to use " murder, she wrote 'but I'm totally addicted to both, and even a DVD Box sets .... well, I know it's so boring! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke Show has him playing as a doctor in Dr.Mark Sloan in Community General Hospital in Los Angeles, who is also a police consultant for the Los Angeles Police - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - real life son Dick) is a police officer who needs the help of his father on so many suspicious death. <br /> <br /> Along for the ride is Dr.Amanda Bentley (Bentley Victoria) recipient pathologist in the Community total for the first two seasons you have been playing Scott Baio Dr.Jack Stewart, who left the ranks and increased in 1995 hoping to go on to bigger and better things ... he had to stay where he was, he had not done anything remarkable, since .... and his only theatrical appearance was for many years in the children's Geniuses 2: superbabies .... Oh my God !!! <br /> <br /> anyway Dr.Jack Stewart was replaced by Travis young Dr.Jesse played Charlie Schlatter, who stepped into the shoes BAIO pretty comfortable. <br /> <br /> series is very unlikely, but that the detective novel series not? (Murder she wrote - Jessica goes everywhere, someone eventually died, or undervalued Father Dowling Mysteries of the murder of a nun Priest decision sidekick) <br /> <br /> The series was much lighter, until 1997, the because there was no supporting cast, which included a clumsy hospital manager Norman Briggs, Michael Tucci playing together with mother and Secretary Mark Dolores played Delores Hall, After 1997, both of these characters were no longer included and a number became grittier business with great looking budget some episodes have included a lot more action, one e pizod whole hospital blown up. <br /> <br /> This is a family show for Van Dyke, because just as Dick Son Barry, you also had the daughter of Dick and all his grandchildren makes an appearance in various episodes. <br /> <br /> As the series went on it is a bit silly, one episode I remember Dick Van Dyke played his entire family, which was a bit unusual, but in general, «Diagnosis Murder» was a really nice TV show who had numerous good Guest stars. <br /> <br /> from the show ended in 2001, Dick and Barry appeared together in a series of "Murder 101" television films made by The Hallmark Channel, pretty much in the same way, and still nice. Dick, who is now in his mid-80s, does not seem to change much, and looks as if it will work until the end. <br /> <br /> TV SHOW **** OUT OF *** **
