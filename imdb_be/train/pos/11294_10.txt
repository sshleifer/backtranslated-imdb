This movie gets it right. As a former USAF Aviation Cadet, I can tell you that this film has it all. Boredom application process. We are waiting for words. taking joy. Worry about making it through the course. Sadness watching his friends (perhaps the best of them) to wash. Tight to pay the highest price - the death fllow student aviators. Glory to the end. Always flying, piloting, Piloting. Many are called, but few are chosen. We made for the payment, we would have gladly paid to do.
