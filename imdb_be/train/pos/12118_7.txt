When I saw that this film was a length of only 80 minutes, I thought we were in trouble. Condenser giant W. Somerset Maugham novel down in the movie, that the clock in less than an hour and a half, it seemed like a time bomb. But you know, the movie is not half bad, and it is even possible to save a large part of what makes the book resonate so much with his readers. <br /> <br /> I have heard many movie lovers complain that Leslie Howard was wet noodles actor, and he was, but I can not think of anyone better suited to play the role of Philip Carey entirely wet noodle, because, known that Kerry. Howard plays it well, that means that you want to shake him and clap him on the head several times, and then finally, to take it and buy him a spine. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is Betty, the girl from which Kerry violent and who brings his world crumbling around him. I did not know what on earth call Mildred was in the book and the film stays true to the part. But Davis played, it will be the most fascinating characters in the story, and if it is a nasty and unpleasant, it is, at least, the most dynamic people on the screen at any one time. Davis' performance is attributed to change the course of action of the screen, as Brando would be almost 20 years later, when he shouted "Stella !!" in this obscure Tennessee Williams play, and it's not hard to see why. Davis intense to the point of frightening. She makes no effort to pull out any sympathy from the audience, and she allows herself look ugly and most unpopular. Her appearance, when Carrie goes on her end of the film, to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed illness (although not very careful to hide the fact that this STD) is shocking. Of course, it helps that the film squeaked just before the Production Code came into force; if it was done in a year, you can bet it would have been a little bit different. <br /> <br /> So, much of the novel, and many of its most interesting parts that are left on the floor of the room, and the story really became about Kerry and Mildred, and not much else. I found that the least interesting and most tedious part of the novel Maugham, but it is the part that gives the new its name and seems to be part of that readers still applies now, so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the creators the film that they have chosen to adapt the novel, as they did <br /> <br /> class :.
