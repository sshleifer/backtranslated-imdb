Any film in the first days of Orson Welles is a celebration of up to a third person with Joseph Cotton. It is also excellent in touch of evil. Please see it! He tends to get pompous and self-employed in films such as F for fake, really stupid waste film.Don't waste your time watching it. it is really ignorant. Orson Welles movie icon and film students have to see what he shot. His leading home huge, but in the end, Wells became fat drunk, like his character in A Touch Of Evil! For some reason, Orson Welles was a way with women, I can see how it could be considered attractive to youth, not like Gary Cooper and Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on and on, but I digress .. . because I'm a woman, I can see the attraction to him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true filmmakers, and if you do not count the filmmakers of our time: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most of the filmmakers just did not measure up to the filmmakers forties! I know that there are plenty of other great directors of our time, but in that short period of time, I can not name them all. No offense to any of the great filmmakers of the millennium! August 21.2006. Please remind me of some current and nearby filmmaker, I do not want to be stuck in the past! I like some movies now, but will rarely have I would put on the "100 Best" list .. "Hustle and Flow" was big, so was "Fargo" and "O Brother, Where are you," from a line in the Wanderings Sullivan; another great movie from the forties! Can anyone give me a list of the best of the 90s and up to 2006? I would like to know who's watching! Thank you! Props are also on this site! Where else can you connect the movie or boo him! I love talking and raving from ordinary people, like me, you can say what I want, and I promise not to spoil any movie for someone who has not seen it yet!
