Perhaps the most personal works of David Lynch is its most affordable. This time, instead of cryptic thematic structures that may or may not include a portion of or represent something more than a vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective, gentle meditation on universal subjects of aging and family and finds comfort in both. Just the true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who rides a lawnmower to Wisconsin to visit his aloofness, the affected brother, there are many more unique and original visual Dreamscapes (some rather strange aerial shots of the hinterland, shot veteran cinematographer Freddie Francis), to make it unquestionable effort and characterization, which are some of his most memorable Lynch. Professor perfect in opinion still respectable way to stories he hears on his way to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns in some of her best work in a smaller role, as his mentally disabled more observant daughters (whose sick secret revealed in a piercing way through a gentle turn in a sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast to the person delivering memorable performances, one of the most remarkable creatures Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing deer like exuberant and sad at the same time. But it's vintage Lynch to its ability to participate in and have to lead to the destabilization of his best. For those who are unfamiliar with Lynch or know it only by its lush, violation of reputation, it is a great place to start; for those who know their job, it is one of the best in his repertoire.
