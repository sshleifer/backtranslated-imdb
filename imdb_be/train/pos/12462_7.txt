performance tour de force Noni Hazlherst (it won the AFI award), at least on a par with its efforts to FRAN three years later. Colin Frels too well, and for those who are interested, Alice Garner looks like a child noni, and Michael Caton (the most famous castle), bearded artist. (It is also interesting, Hazlehurst currently leading lifestyle program Better Homes and Gardens, and Cato is the master of the type of property programs including hot property, hot auction, etc ...) This film once again confirms the widespread belief popular that noni was perhaps Australia's top female actor in the early to mid-1980s. Rating: 79/100.
