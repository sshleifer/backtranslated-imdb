"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of hit and miss comedy that has it and laughs, "Yes." But I suggest to give it a chance. I think it's much more than look. Not too many people give this film chance. it really works. just think how little parody «Goodfellas». Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does it well. Johnny Dangerously thug who wants to go higher in life. it just works its way from the big bosses to beautiful wife. And, of course, like a lot of movies of the crowd, someone wants him dead. 90% of jokes keep laughing. Like I said, give him a chance. Just take your favortie gangster films and comedy mixed in. Do you have a "Johnny dangerously». <br /> <br /> 7/10
