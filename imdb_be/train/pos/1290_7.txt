Yes, I remember it! Many years ago, I actually watched it. The story was quite surreal, but still excellent! That someone bet and movie reviews should be borne in mind that the corresponding film is aimed at. It is the same with the «First Kid», which follows a similar pattern. Some movies - like this one here - just focus on the plain and comic nonsense. Such films can not be assessed from the point of view of picky reviewer. Of course, these films do not have the quality, the lack of a complex storyline, very often do not have to act first class but if they are really doing their basic premise - that's fine. I do not mean this movie is on my list of all-time favorites, but I still thought it was interesting, were very pleasant consistency and made a good story. Brian Bonsall clever actor anyway.
