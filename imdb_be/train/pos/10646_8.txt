This great film is composed mainly of documentaries currently contained on the DVD together with the Prelude to War. Great American filmmaker and storyteller Frank Capra made those films that simply and clearly draw attention to the main points that caused the Second World War and the rise of Hitler. <br /> <br /> Every child in the school, in fact, every American should watch this movie now, because they are so useful. The story was repeated again and again! The Lord Chamberlain is still alive and well; tactics used by Nazi sympathizers penetrating countries through, and then the communists and now the Muslim terrorist group, which is still working for the benefit of groups of Evil. <br /> <br /> Sitting back and allow Hitler in 1935 will aggressively - France, America and Britain have caused over 50 million deaths. Americans, French and British now happy to let Hitler do the same, despite the fact that we should learn from history, what happens when you allow dictators to break contracts. <br /> <br /> These are great films can be too simplistic for fans of World War II. They do not talk about the horrors of the Soviet Union caused simply because while America has teamed up with them, the fight against Hitler. This film does not tell the simple facts and the motives that led to the terrible war.
