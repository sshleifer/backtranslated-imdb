In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Lujan) lives with his wife Lola asthmatic (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola is still mourning the death of her son Augustine for some time. Colonel waited for their pension fighter in the war against the Catholic Church almost twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old fight. Not having any ownership or money, and valuable Gamecock, they are struggling with the expectation of confirmation letters from the Government, recognizing the law and to pay for the delay retirement. This is a slow and touching film reflects the social and financial situation of the majority of older retired people in third world countries. In Brazil, the majority of pensioners have to survive around US $ 80.00 per month. Colonel debts have been made in the history of the cemetery to pay for his son, otherwise he will be buried as a need. Outstanding cast in a very sad story, which is true in poor countries. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> The names (Brazil): ( `NÃ£o ao with Escreve Coronel ') (Do not write Colonel) <br /> <br />
