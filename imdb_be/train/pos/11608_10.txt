This is a great movie. Reading other reviews, I see that I am not the only one to shed a tear. Tamilyn afflict acted with such skill and conviction, she made the end of the heart and remembered. In the hands of a lesser actress, her last scene would have seemed trite and banal. No one would guess that this film was made on a tight, limited budget. The cinematography is gorgeous, and there are a number of big name actors. The script is so great, I can understand why they want to be in it. When you see a long, long list of credits at the end of the day, you'll see that half of Hawaii's camp to make this film took place, and for a good reason. Soundtrack (CD-ROM) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood for the entire film. My only "complaint" is that I almost did not want the movie to end.
