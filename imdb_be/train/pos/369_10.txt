Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it at least a hundred times, and I can not get through it without tears. I challenge anyone to watch the reunion of Celie and Nettie, Shug, or both parents, and does not feel that your eyes are dim. Whoopi Goldberg must have one reward for a strange image. And for a man who said that you can not love the movie, if you like the book, wrong! Im testament to this.
