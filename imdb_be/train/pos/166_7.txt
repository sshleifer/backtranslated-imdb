It was the first film that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together, and they will continue to do a few more. Crawford star young rich girl who's father rubbed the stock market crash and there was nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before, and his brother, William Bakewell, gets the job done with Gable, who is a bandit and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job, but gets in over his head pretty quickly. Crawford became a reporter for the newspaper, but wants to work on the big stories, but given the useless material to work with. Their massacre in which several men are killed Gable and Crawford had witnessed it all. This is a good movie, but not one of them the best.
