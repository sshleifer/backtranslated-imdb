It's just great fun, great movie. It captures the true essence of the decade, and people, and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors. Although this film can only be in black and white, it's certainly not count on him now in our days. The main main purpose of the film is timeless. This movie has great acting, beautiful songs and dances, and great design work and footage. Follow the Fleet as a comic, there are funny moments, moments that will make you laugh, but other times when operating only gets you so involved in the story line. Its amazing, as if this film can be installed in a certain decade, as it can affect those who are. If you want to see something great, check it out.
