Steve Carell comes into its own in his first starring role in the 40-year-old virgin, having just supporting roles in films such as spellbound, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work on the Daily Show, we only got a small taste of comedy that Karel really makes his own. You can tell that Will Ferrell has affected his "comedic air", but Karel takes it to another level, all that he is doing an innocent, sweet and funny. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of these great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> 40-year-old virgin is two hours of non-stop laughter (or 4 hours, if you see it twice as I did), the ideal supporting cast and great results to captivate the audience through the film. The script was perfect with so many great lines that you want to watch the movie again just to try to remember them all. Music fits the tone of the film great, and you can tell the director knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Filled with sex jokes, some nudity, language and a lot of this film is not for everyone, but if you like Wedding Crashers, Anchorman or any film along these lines, you will absolutely love the 40-year-old virgin.
