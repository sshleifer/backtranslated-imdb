It is surprisingly above the average slasher, this is a pleasant and well made, with some decent gusset!. All the characters are decent, and the story is pretty fun, plus annoying bitches Ringwald played very well. I bought it in a pawn shop store for $ 1, and it was weird standing and special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus I loved the killer wore a mask, as it was actually somewhat terrible. The final was very cool, I loved how they defeated the murderer, and the ending while predictable was very funny as well, plus all the characters except Ringwald were surprisingly pretty good!. It is well done and written, and I thought it was pretty creative and original times, as well, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. This killer entirely lazy, and I loved it, and Slasher supporters (like me), should really enjoy this film, as well as the discovery was really angry with them, too, to make a film!. It is surprisingly above the average slasher, it's nice, and well made, with some decent gusset, and I say that it is well worth watching!. Direction good. Kimble Rendall makes good! Work here with a solid camera work, using the terrible setting, good corners and keep the film at a fast pace that moves. Actions are solid!. Ringwald plays a bitch very well, and I trouble regretting it in the end, she had to be the heroine, it was better to end, but not much, I'm surprised that she decided to make this film, however, she did a great job !. Frank Roberts is fantastic as a murderer, he is threatening, terrible and has been one hell of a mask, and this guy does not mess around, it was fantastic!. Kylie Minogue plays a knot very well in his small role. Jessica Napier cute and does well, the other heroine. The rest of the cast is excellent. On the whole hours!. *** 5
