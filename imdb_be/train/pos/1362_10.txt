Me and my groovadelic 20-something buddies just can not get enough of this amazing Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent it on DVD, but I can not find it - too bad, because I am sure that the possibility would be "extra special" !! :) We highly recommend this uber-cool comedy flickerino on a date, or even just a cozy evening at home alone! It will also purr-fect type of movie to watch with your cat, or even throw a party on the basis of the party «Party Girl", as well as in the film, which is a nice, Huggable, compressible Posey to the end. Oh, and be on the lookout to capture the fun and surprise endings ... move aside, The Sixth Sense, you are only surpassed by the way radder movie! Sorry, no offense, just calling it like it is! Take it from an old lover flick, comedy just does not get better than «Party Girl» with Parker P! I feel! Sincerely, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
