As a child, I thought this movie was great. They were animals, it was beautiful music, and it was my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for various reasons. He is well-trained animals who are put through a variety of stunts and scenes that look great on camera. It has a beautiful, well-written musical, corresponding to the scene is excellent, with rousing melodies and rapid heart agonizing main theme, which still makes me cry. Even if people are singing it. And he is my favorite actor Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> On the basis of the book is the story of three animals, intelligent, overly trusting and much paternal lab named Shadow, witty and vain - but still smart - a cat with rabies name brash and street smart funny curious and slightly neurotic bulldog chance. Three taken to the farm each other when their family goes. Alarmed and agitated, pets flare up and planning a trip through the Sierra for the ride of their lives. Really incredible journey. So it may be, the house is just the mountain. But what if it is not? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound for people who love the three wonderful actors who provide the voices for the main characters of animals, as well as for those who do that ... yes, everyone goes to watch.
