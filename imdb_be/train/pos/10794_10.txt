I always loved to see Chuck Norris in the film. Although the action may not be perfect, the fight scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Jadson Mills performing at the edge of it. In my opinion, Norris Brothers established themselves as excellent entertainers, and it was another fine production! I hope you take the time to see this movie!
