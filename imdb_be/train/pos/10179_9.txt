De Groot is a very good film. Great story comes from a novel by Tim Krabbe, who also adapted the story for the screen. Some really top class, which acts not only Van Hue, but especially Marcel Hensley, who mostly did TV work for its implementation Axel van de Graaf. The film seems to blow like a thriller, and sets the perfect mood. Then we begin to know Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and history are revealed bit by bit in a very convincing flash back structure, which adds to the more romantic aspects of drama and character-driven film. In the end, it all culminates in an emotional finale, which will grab the audience by the throat. Make sure you know as little as possible about the story, if you're going to see this movie. Required to see, especially if you like «Spoorloos» (original screen adaptation to the fading in).
