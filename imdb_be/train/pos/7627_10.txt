I remember watching this movie some time ago, and after watching the 3000 miles to Graceland, it all came flooding back. Why was this not a video or a DVD-release yet? It is blasphemous, it is the greatness of film has never been released while the other garbage was. In fact, this is one film of John Carpenter, who was not released. In fact, I have not seen it on TV or from the day that I watched it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role he was born to play. Break John Carpenter horror brought this gem that I would like the television to play again. It is well acted and well performed as the singing goes. Belting of the greatest hits of Elvis with pleasure. I think it was also the film that has formed a partnership with Russell and Carpenter, who made them go to do a lot of great films (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China and Escape from LA Who got to release it before someone makes a remake or their own version of his life, I feel that not only tarnish the king, but also to destroy the magic that this one has. If it does not get let go, we're going to be in the Heartbreak Hotel.
