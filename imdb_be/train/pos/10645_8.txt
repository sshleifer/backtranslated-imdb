maniacal desire of Adolf Hitler to impose its will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a series of seven pieces of films produced by the US Department of War as a training tool for new soldiers, members of the armed forces during the Second World War. Hitler's plan was methodical and well thought out, starting with the conquest of Eastern Europe, the extension to the European hinterland, and then go to the "world island", consisting of Europe, Asia and Africa. His latest move was to reach across oceans to the final conquest of America and the world. <br /> <br /> In 1935 Hitler ordered a national duty, the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. Grade school children sang his praises, and the young German boys have been training and education in military camps. Marching unopposed into Austria in 1938, Hitler then grabbing a strip of land that borders Germany and Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler was Czechoslovakia. Later that same year, the world was amazed to learn that Germany signed a nonaggression pact with his arch-enemy Russia, a ploy to divert Hitler's military intervention on too many fronts. Immediately after Germany invaded Poland, resulting in Hitler's conquest of the right to the doorstep of Russia. He will have to deal with it later. <br /> <br /> It was during this period that the UK still has refused to confront the thrust of Hitler in Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt that he got a big victory for his country by treaty with Germany, he is despised declaration that "peace in our time." It did not happen so. <br /> <br /> The most exciting information learned in this game, at least for me, was presented to a small piece of footage from the German on the Hitler rally in the mid '30s. It was led by the German American taking its cue directly from the homeland. Venue - Madison Square Garden!
