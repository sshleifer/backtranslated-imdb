This film came out and went to the theater. Due to the nature of this you can see why it was not well received. It was unfair cooked due to its subject matter more than the actual film. Higher education is not spectacular, but it was a good movie, who tried to talk about feared subject in America: racism <br /> <br /> The plot / Story :. Higher education is mainly concentrated around Malik (played by Omar Epps), A naive star track that has to deal with is not fast enough, and the stern professor (played by Laurence Fishburne). He befriends Fudge (Ice Cube), as well as a great lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later, they will eventually have to deal with some skinheads on campus. Remy (played by Michael Rappaport) confused child who eventually befriended some local skinheads on campus. Once they impose their views on it, it becomes as racist as they are <br /> <br /> Opinion :. Higher education is not without drawbacks: Character development is not enough, okay performances Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the leader of the skinheads (whose name I forgot), Busta Rhymes entirely appropriate in this movie at all. Plus turning gay woman after a man was abused clich√© "for the movie, so that you know that I do not like that part of the film with Kristy Swanson. Also, this film was not bad. Laurence Fishburne was good, as Professor Phipps (despite the fact that I could do without an accent), Fudge was the best result of Ice Cube and Michael Rapoport was good as confused Remy. Overall, it was one of the best films of John Singleton and one is one of the reasons why I frown on junk he puts today. Movie need more films like higher education, Mississippi Burning and American History X, and smaller films like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and very pointless remake of the shaft.
