Let me start by saying at a young age of 34 I was suddenly widowed. I was devastated, he was not sick, he died unexpectedly --- mainly from coronary --- his carotid blew out-- he died for our home. There has been much speculation on the part of the police, because he fell on something and hit his head. I was a suspect in the killing, until the autopsy has not returned. <br /> <br /> My children were traumatized as I am so in love with a good father figure as he is. I had three small children, no education, no financial support. I took it very, very difficult. <br /> <br /> During the two years of my in-laws attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritually demanding I do not insult to the children, put on the mask and showed people what they want to see, not to show them my pain during the holidays ... no one stood up for me and my choice to sit in one holiday, with the exception, of course, grief therapist, I could see that he told me to follow my heart and soul. Has in-laws do not get it! It forever changed my relationship with them, and I never went back for a holiday. This is just one example of how it was to respect my grief! My own (new) husband saw me fall apart to talk about the injury, when I shared with my soul. I break down, can not breath, hyperventilation, and in general I am a non-existent for a few days, if I even try to hide the pain to pass. <br /> <br /> At the moment about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today, my soul was stirred, my heart is broken. My fears and pain again emerged from the real demons of this film presents; as one mourns for comparison with others are also waiting for us and the demons inside. Adam Sandler portrayed quite horrible agony you face, overcome and more likely to work through in his spare time! This film is extracted all the pain that I have tried over the years to deal with. You see, when something hurts your soul so deeply, so deeply that the pronunciation of all that comes out of your mouth in the moments of thinking, you can not deal with her not wanting you were dead, and go through life in a dead state. <br /> <br /> The Bible is scripture, Romans 8:26, I clung to that, when my mouth and the soul does not know what to pray that God's Holy Spirit has the agony of the feet Boga-- I do not need talk. Sandler drew that to perfection! <br /> <br /> There's a scene where he was hauled into court session, to mental health commitments, and he goes back to his face in the laws --- (familiar to me) --- and he tells them wonderful truths he was obsessed, to Se, that he can not get more. It is deeply strong and powerful performance. I started to cry and had difficulty getting up after wards to get out of the theater, feeling my legs are too weak to do it. My son was with me and saw it first hand, has accurate movements when trying to hold everything together; lesson for him, my youngest, who barely remembers her dad. It was 13 years for me, but this film brought me back to the time of the loss of their families forever, if they are required to mask my emotions and my surrendering to his desires, and not in respect of my own. <br /> <br /> I am writing this, so if you Griever, are you ready for this film, but highly recommend it performed in 1000 gave Sandler stars. <br /> <br /> If you have not Griever, please learn from his film and just listen and make the choice of people in their grief, allowing them to find peace in his time! Sometimes the soul can not utter a word to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go this movie with fabrics and with good preparation to take him ... to your heart!
