"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown on the cable. Not seeing him for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy. Based on the Broadway hit James Van Drut, who had a car, Rex Harrison and Lili Palmer in the early fifties, the film was adapted for the screen, Daniel Taradesh. The film is directed by Richard Quinn, who has turned into a beautiful piece of comedy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, judging by some of the comments provided IMDb, the big problem seems to be the pairing of the two stars, who worked on "Vertigo", released in the same year. Movie goers nothing about the age difference does not think that if this film was released. In fact, the majority of older male stars of this period has always been associated with much younger women. <br /> <br /> The film is set in Manhattan at Christmas time is a great comedy that charmed the audience. Kim Novak was at the peak of its beauty, as is clear, the camera did not love her no matter what she plays. As a witch who becomes man, its Gillian charming. James Stewart, who plays a publisher Shep "Henderson also seen at its best. Mr. Stewart was a great comedian, who shows here why he was at the top. <br /> <br /> The excellent supporting roles Elsa Lanchester playing Queenie, is a welcome addition to any film as it is here, Jack Lemmon Nicky Holroyd, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also regarded as a writer Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend a winter night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".
