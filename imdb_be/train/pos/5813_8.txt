This movie is great. <br /> <br /> At the present time, I tend to like my films heavy on story and dialogue, but now and then, something like Moonwalker comes, and it's watchable, despite numerous disadvantages. <, Br /> <br /> This film is nothing more than a very exciting Michael Jackson advertising. Starting with a painful video set to "Man in the Mirror" photomontage list of his achievements, as well as the bits and bobs of his career, it passes through all the highs of his life, and then falls down really, really entertaining segment that acts as a funny video for «Bad» and «Speed ​​Demon», following the adventures of MJ, he runs away from the manic fans of stop-motion, and finally dancing against a rabbit costume. Stopping the movement is not as bad as some would have you believe. This terrain. <br /> <br /> Then we see a great video for "Leave me alone," and right in the main function. <br /> <br /> So, the plot ridiculous. Very funny. We see Michael out of the building, and then get a shot in thousands of troops. Then we got a flashback showing MJ and three children stumbled on an underground lair. Mr. Big "(Joe Pesci) is a heinous villain, who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on" drugs "(no specifics are not mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the little girl, he was caught, then chased .. . chatter chatter. The plot is not a very important part. We get two very cool sequence where MJ turns into a car, then the robot-spaceship thing, and, of course, a strange «Smooth Criminal» sequence. <br /> <br /> This so-so movie, but it's great for those who love MJ. it has most of his superhit s, and some interesting little pieces, as well as some pretty good special effects (sequence Robot / Spaceship in particular) should especially be seen, as if you can pick it up for around pounds on EBay. This will keep the child quiet for a few hours, and no more than 20-something, who were children when it was first released.
