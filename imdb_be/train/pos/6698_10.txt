I loved Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, and have seen every episode. I remember when I was sitting at 6 pm each night, and wait for it to come on the Nickelodeon, but when Sabrina left the show began to go down the middle school. Best series to be when she was friends with Valeria (I'm not sure which one). From there, the next row (friends of Dream) was still very good, but when she left school, she just does not seem right. All the main characters seemed to have gone, and this meant that he did not have as much of the old "Iskra", but the first series where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, but if the release of her aunt and Sabrina moves into their home is simply not correct. It is no longer a teenager, so that's why the show's name is not correct, and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh show just does not seem right, especially when Sabrina almost marries someone is not Harvey. Thank God, he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode, to pick her up. In general, I still love to watch old episodes of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers have taken it too far, and should leave it to Sabrina graduating from high school. Because after the show I am definitely lost some of its magic
