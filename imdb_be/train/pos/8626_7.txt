"The King's death" is not really the type of movie that makes you amused ?? Jörg Buttgereit second religious monument in the series, which is actually much better than the infamous «Nekromantik», there are seven short scenes ?? one for each day of the week ?? spinning on suicide unrelated people. In between these is already very alarming episodes, Buttgereit inserts really horrific images of strongly decomposed male body. Episodes are not all equally powerful, but how useful, "King Death" takes a high place in the list of the most depressed arthouse. Especially the episodes on Wednesday, with the participation of the person, explaining their sexual frustration to a stranger in the park, as well as one of the Sunday, focusing on the young man, stick themselves dead, extremely intense and devastating for observation. The added value of this film, or any other shockumenary like, controversial, and I'm not even sure whether or not Buttgereit any type of message to communicate here. There's a vague mention of the terrible chain letters which prompts readers to suicide, but mostly we are left in the dark about the motivation of the people to end their lives so dramatically. Completely unlike I had expected, "King Death" is not exploitative or shockingly graphic! On the contrary in fact, I could never hope Buttgereit is so subtle and thoughtful relatively clean image of human suffering. Thursday episode is a great example of how this stylish shows different views of the famous German bridge while the names, ages and occupations of people who jumped appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitably poor and editing often lack professionalism, but it is not what really matters in this type of movie. The subject of strong and makes us think about the less oars ?? but also an indispensable ?? aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music, too!
