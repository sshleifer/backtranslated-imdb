It was a great movie! Although there were only about 15 people, including me, there it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mom even liked it. Was two middle-aged women there and in the middle of the 20-year-old out there, and they seemed to enjoy. I love the part where Cork and Ned like Nancy and her cute liking stuff BZ. And when she gets her roadster and Ned have. So it was a great film, even thought people underestimate him lol. Go Look, I'm sure you will enjoy it !! I really enjoyed it and so did my friend. <br /> <br /> The people were so harsh on this film, and they have not even seen. I bet the next time they will give the film a chance and actresses. They did a great job in my opinion. But if you have young children it is also advisable. I would probably take my 7-year-old niece to watch too.
