Man, some of you people have got to cold. This film was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for meditation or messages, to justify it in reality, why can not you understand that this is a work of art? History. Entertainment, for God's sake (no pun intended). It seems to me that too many people on here trying to be film critics - and they are not doing well. I was so impressed with the film and the work of Bill Paxton as a director, I'm going to call him or her to tell him. I know if you did not try to analyze the features of a possible story line, you can just enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends did!
