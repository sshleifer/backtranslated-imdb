It really is a great piece of cinematic achievement. From the beginning, I was completely hooked into the (true) story when Lieutenant Victor Burakou (Stephan Rea) weeps during the exposures on the remains of children's organs. This is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, superbly played by Jeffrey Demanov (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost begins to feel sorry for him, as long as we do not remember what it is. Psychiatrist Dr. Alexander Boukhanovsky, perfectly played Max von Sydow was quite believable in every detail, and he makes a point, when it comes to paranoia in the Soviet Union, made too obvious behavior of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk plays Ekland. For me, though, it was the excellent performance of Donald Sutherland, once again, that wonderful character actor he really prove. I was almost in tears when he Burak said the FBI, so closely watched and admired his work. This film puts the silence of the lambs in the shadow, atmospheric and gloomy Soviet landscape, in fine performances of all participant. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this film 10/10
