I was so impressed with the film version of Doug McGrath on Jane Austen's novel "Emma", and I loved the music score by Rachel Portman so much that when I went to the video store one day and found that the two were reunited for "Nicholas Nickleby" I immediately rented it without any other considerations. <br /> <br /> I read the book, and for those overly critical supporters of this adaptation of Jane Austen, I do not know what else to McGrath could do to better convey the spirit and the essential elements of the plot of Miss Austen's work, especially given the limitations of two-hour movie (Which some complained about for too long!). And as far as the emphasis Gwen Paltrow, I must admit, I'm not too familiar with it, when I saw it in the theater originally, and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was British actress! <br /> <br /> I was taken aback by those who criticized the film for the lush scenery. It's one of the things that I enjoy and look forward to seeing in the period pieces set in the English countryside. Film interesting backgrounds of the main reasons for its appeal and success. If your idea of ​​escapist fare is darker, then perhaps you need to rent something like «Death Wish III!» <br /> <br /> The English country-specific settings are attractive and charming, like the cast, and combined with the history and the soundtrack for entertainment that makes you never tire of repeated viewings. McGrath this miracle on the choreography of interaction subtle expressions that are so essential in the transmission of complex romantic intrigue that takes place in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing film can also be a clinic on how enjoyable film may be less sex, violence or even criminal antagonist. History often funny, endearing, and sometimes very touching. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of literate adaptation of Jane Austen's books, but it is without a doubt my favorite.
