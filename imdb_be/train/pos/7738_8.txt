After Dark, My Sweet is a large, modern noir filled with miserable characters, dirt roads, and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the really big Noir last two or three decades have occurred in the south, where men shine at home, um, shine, too. Why? Because it is hooooottttttttttt. And because everything looks better wet (at least the men - women leave me sweaty sticky). <br /> <br /> Anyway - there may be some spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This film is a perfect example of all Noir must be sustainable - stimulation (although some with attention disorders refer to it as "slow"), it is clear and widely drawn (though not easy) signs, and tons atmosphere. Noir, if anything, about the mood and attitudes. That is why the great sun is indicated by your traditional definitions of "large" current (look at Bogart, Mitch, Hurt, and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were nothing but real - but they had style and daring, and the crime film, it exactly what you want). or a fast-paced adventure (besides all the great noir seems to be on a slow burn like a cigarette). Large Noirs to create an environment, and you just populate it with characters for a couple hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet, let you do that - and it will allow you to enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie intriguing - never letting the audience know what really makes them tick - and Patrick and Dern (I love Bruce Dern, by the way) are pitch perfect, particularly Dern (see preliminary comments). They take the basic contours of a character and give them depth and cause our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story itself is interesting. There, you are the best sites in the world of noir (hardly a secret here - mostly unknown), but this one hard. If anything, just "good" site has more to do with the writing of Jim Thompson, than anything else. C. Thompson, portions substantially of the secondary winding; he avoided the maze history of Hammett and Chandler for a simple story with a stronger, more intricate characters. Look at the novel as The Killer Inside Me, and you will immediately see (from the title), it's all about. When it comes to Thompson, it's not what it's about, it's how it is on this (to quote Roger Ebert). Thus, in fact, relatively simple plot of abduction is not the point, and if you do not like, well, a joke on you. <br /> <br /> Why is 8star film, not 10star one of the female role. It is not bad in itself, but it does not Anjelica Huston and Annette Benning (see adaptation of Jim Thompson Grifters, if you do not know what I mean - besides, it's best film, and you have to start there for the modern film noir - this is the best of the 1990s and Blood Simple problems for the title of the best, as Chinatown). She simply does not have the chops (or appearance for that matter), and although she and Patric there is chemistry, I do not have it with her. So there.
