The film belongs to the Inventor - Underdog genre. Jake Zhillenhol, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper to bring a bit of acting inspiration for stories with a few standard elements. Good shot, well-edited, with many well-acted supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Some declared the film to be a classic American false. This is something more. I agree with those who say, "The film celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration.Â» <br /> <br /> The film is a pleasant reminder that achievement can be born from ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
