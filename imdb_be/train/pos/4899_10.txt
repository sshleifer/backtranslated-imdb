I'm so glad I happened to see this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies, and this one was a real gem. I loved that film, a love story in the spirit, not about a beautiful twenty years; rather, it is the story of a beautiful sixty-something that had previously been used twenty-something. That's good, well-written and well-acted story with fabulous WWII brass music thrown in as well. He also received a wonderful surprise in it for fans of Scottish castle. He left me smiling and ready to watch it again, I made a couple more times before I turned it. I highly recommend it.
