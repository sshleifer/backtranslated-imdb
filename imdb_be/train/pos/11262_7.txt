Plaything devil is my second attempt to manufacture Joseph Sarni - and although I will say that it is much more enjoyable than the painfully boring and unerotic Swedish Wildcats, he is still a little slow and not-explicitly for my taste <br />. <br /> This one centers around a group of vampires girls living in the castle, who want to resurrect their earlier killed a "leader". To do this, the girls have to dance naked and kissing each other and sing strange things - and, of course, drink blood, too. If the doctor and her brother's car breaks down and they have to stay in a castle on the housing - they provide the perfect bloodbank for horny vampires ... but they can not be as helpless as it seems ... <br /> <br /> Plaything devil is a very good example of the early 70s is operated immorality. A lot of nudity - including some full frontal, some sleazy undertone - including incest, and, of course, lesbo-blood-sucking ... but the scene is still pretty tame by today's standards. Some pretty hot women in this case, would have benefited from some of the more explicit sex, but I guess I can not have it all. In addition, they would benefit from some kind of severe violence / gore, that this is a movie about vampires, but I think that the purpose of the Devil's Plaything had more to show the skin, rather than blood. A little more slowly - and to do for the most part completely wood - but that can be expected from something from this era and this budget. It should look to use fans - others may find it a bit too boring soul. 7/10
