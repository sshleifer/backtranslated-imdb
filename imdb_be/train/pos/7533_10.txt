I loved this series when it was on the Kids WB, I do not think that there was a Batman spin to see how the original show ended in 1995, and the show came in 1997. First of all, I liked the idea of ​​leaving Robin Batman to solve crimes independently. It was an interesting perspective of their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series, and again, as his predecessor in this show were great storylines, great animation (better then the original), a fantastic voice work and, of course, the brilliant writing. The only thing I did not like was when he was in the US, he will often run episodes of 15 minutes of the storyline. I just want to see some of the episodes may be more. My favorite episode from any cartoons Batman comes to this series, and it's called "over the edge", in my view as well, if not better, than the "Heart of Ice" and "retribution Robin." In general, good to watch, along with Superman this show made my childhood very happy.
