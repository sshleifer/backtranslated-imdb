I loved this movie !!! The characters were people that you could get a feel for. The young man returned from the service is still in love with the girl he left behind. Meanwhile Drake always perfect romantic lead, and Donna Reed, as the love of his life. It looks he gives her, as if he had been on hunger strike in front of her, and her hesitation and confusion as well as her feelings for him were very well played. The rest of the whimsical characters in the shop were perfect as they were trying to bring them together. The most touching scene, however, was a young couple in the home of his great-grandfather. I laughed in part, some crying and liked to watch this movie. In fact, I watched it again about 5 times. Definite must see for complete romantics.
