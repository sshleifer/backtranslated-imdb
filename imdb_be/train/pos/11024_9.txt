This film is simply magnificent. It is entertaining from beginning to end, you will always be on the edge of your seat throughout the film. In my opinion, this film is strongly underestimated by critics. <br /> <br /> SLY suits perfectly in the role of well-trained mountain rescue man Gabe Walker. Along with him, Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've ever seen him as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that it takes 75% of the film place on the mountain with a lot of bad guys on this path for many activities! <br /> <br /> A brilliant film!
