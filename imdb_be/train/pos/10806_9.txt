I felt this film - everywhere. I WAAS impressed by the talent of Russell Crowe in the development of his relationship with Lily, a typical Australian blend softly softly approach, a little self depreciating and very stubborn. Really loved the cinema and direction. Pace was just portraits of almost all the characters is impressive. <br /> <br /> Gosh, Sun Russell talent even in 1993 shine! .. and I still see the gladiator.
