This is a very peculiar staging of Wagner's last defined grew on me. When I first saw it, I was a bit annoyed many of the films surreal images, and felt that it was very much imposed on the story. However, if you can put up with a fair amount, and the Recherche Â«gimmicks" I think you will find that the film can not capture the very strange, otherworldly atmosphere of the opera, and there are moments that particularly well. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have never understood the role of Kundry, until I saw how Edith Clever reflect it. Her performance (MIM lips synchronized by singing voice Yvonne Minton) is not nothing but a dazzling, from end to end, and only justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film. <br /> <br /> Another reason to enjoy in this film is that it reflects the exciting interpretation of Robert Lloyd on the decisive role of Gurnemanz, one of which Lloyd played until crisp in opera houses around the world. I had the privilege to use it as Gurnemanz on stage several times the Metropolitan Opera, and juiciness of his voice, and warm, fatherliness his interpretation of this noble character really need to save, as well as its performance in the two main monologues character, Karfreitag scene and the presentation prophecy in the Law 1. <br /> <br /> version I saw was a videotape made in America, and so were the subtitles, which, unfortunately, can not be destroyed. This is particularly unfortunate, since the translation is used very inaccurate and makes a very Christian interpretation on the film, which is already forcing the layers of interpretation on the opera. It seemed to me quite clear how to avoid conflict with Christian Wagner, and his very conscious attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements of the story. (See footnote with a spoiler at the end of this review.) I believe that it is practically impossible, while watching a movie with subtitles, to keep from absorbing them and highly recommend if in the DVD version you have the opportunity to turn the subtitles off, you're doing it, and instead, if the operator is not familiar to you, that you have read the libretto carefully in advance. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there is a lot in the film, which I do not like, and would as soon have seen done differently ... but it has been steadily growing in my estimation over the years, as I first saw it, and I find myself pulled to enjoy again and again. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> footnotes containing spoilers: A good example may be the famous line of Kundry, "I saw it ... it ... and laughed." This is translated in the subtitles for reasons that escape me, as "I saw the face of the Savior." It especially annoys me, because for the libretto, Wagner very conscious and careful about this invisible character, who does not necessarily have to be the biblical Jesus as "der Heiland" ie, German for "doctor" - a reference to the early Amfortas and all wounds and hwa Rob and the need for treatment.
