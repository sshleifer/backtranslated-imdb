Absolutely fantastic garbage .... this one has it all: nudity, good action scenes, blood, action, explosions, etc. It is also a great star Belinda Mayne like Ingrid, - Olga did not like another reviewer noted - although Olga turns Ingrid later in the film (you should look to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I will not go down in history as it is wound too long and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - look towel stealing the scene to see what I mean <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were just pretty good, and then spoiled by some really bad blood. effects that look like they were made by a team, he made the city Walking Dead (ie the amazing color of blood flowed from the wounds of the neck). <br /> <br /> I would advise a fan of low-budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy - it is quite rare, though I could not see who bother to republish it so it will become increasingly rare for several years < br /> <br /> somehow I. d recommend it only for big nude scenes Belinda Mayne in! This lady is a fox!
