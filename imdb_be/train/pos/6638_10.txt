The attractiveness of old movies, like this one, you get to see the actual moving picture of life more than 100 years ago. There are a lot of people that leave the factory, they are already dead, and none of them even remotely aware of the scale of the present invention, they are used to. I was shocked to read one reviewer call this film as sad as home video today, and at least one other mistakenly identified as the first film ever made (it was the first film shot at 16 frames per second, and not because of the normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Of course, all that you see a lot of people who filed out of the building and passing in front of the cinema on his way home from work, but it is curious piece of dozens of reasons, not least that is it was the first film made by the Lumi√®re brothers, who probably had a greater impact on the development of cinema than any other person or group of people in history.
