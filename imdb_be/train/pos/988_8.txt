I liked this movie. If the guy who was in the bank robbery of $ 40 million in gold dies, his cellmate used as "bait" to bring them to the high-tech crazed killer partner (if control device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge). This action, the type of spy movie with enough comic scenes to keep it light. It reminded me of an enemy state. Well acted and quite a good story.
