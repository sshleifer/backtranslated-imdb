Princess Tam Tam without attributes of racism in the way we think about racism in the United States, but there are more subtle (for the American audience) allegations of ethnic identity at the time. Notice (Baker) Alwina placement within the shot, it is addressed by other characters, settings around it that all paint her as a "wildÂ» African, and ask yourself if Alwina has a piece of the agency throughout the film. I do not want to spoil anything, but in the end to pay very close attention to the dichotomy between "eastern" and "western" culture, to put it mildly, insulting, such as diction fortunately disavow these days. The French have a checkered past as an imperial power in all areas, drawn (see Chris Marker Les Statues Meurent Aussi- 1953), as well as pay attention to the places visited by European travelers while they are in Africa, and that that reflects their attitude in relation to the "other". I give this film 7, because I'm a sucker for Baker, much of what she had done in his professional career as Princes Tam Tam, which is regressive, of course, overshadowed by its efforts towards the integration of its work as a fucking spy (I'm gushing, I'm sorry.) However, the film for me is captivating because of its work, in addition, that it is an eloquent relic of a bygone mentalities.
