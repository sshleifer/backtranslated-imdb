Every time I hear the movie seems to be because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, my BS The detector is extinguished. Typically, the film as a sentimental garbage, which panders to people who do not want anything to surprise them, but claim they are superior to us cowardly people. Therefore, if the straight STORY David Lynch began to receive these types of reviews, I was afraid, especially because I was not a fan of their other "inspirational" stories, The Elephant Man. For all the excellent image and good acting in this film, it seemed to be more interested in preaching to us, what inspires us. <br /> <br /> I do not need to worry. Straight Story honest film, rather than a single saccharin. Most of this is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney say it simply and directly for the most part. There are several sermons on direct I could do without, and arrows of their grain collection is repeated too much, but that's just quibbling. There are no posts despotic, not sentimental strings to pull our emotions, not mercy to us and his characters. Instead, they rely on history to build his own power, and it does so in the final scene, we really moved. <br /> <br /> Of course, casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part. He really is someone who looks like he's gone through a lot, but still persists, and for those sermons, except the desire he has to get back together with his brother, does not seem too sentimental, because you can feel there is someone who lives for too long and seen too much to be movable anger long. And he knows that his time is running out, so he wants to make some kind of peace, not only with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek also makes a great, ill-mannered job as a daughter right in. Although I city and suburban boy, Iowa and Wisconsin landscape beautifully shot that makes me want to, at least, to visit some day.
