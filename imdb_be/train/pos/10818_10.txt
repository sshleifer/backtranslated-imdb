Why it has such a low rating? I really do not understand ... It's because of the bad acts? Bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in a low-budget horror films of cheese? Seriously, acting and dialogue is not important in these films. People who hate the movie just because of the bad actions and bad dialogue should not be allowed to evaluate the cheesy low-budget films. These films are not to be taken lightly. Period. <br /> <br /> In any case, the time to talk about the film, is not it? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I was expecting Gorefest, but it is not Gorefest and blood is very bad (in most cases this is just an animal intestines, located on the body of actors and lame), but I really do not care, because the film is hilarious! funny characters, acting paddle (a bad game is a good thing in bad films, low-budget horror), the dialogue is hilarious (bad dialogue a good thing in a bad horror movie low-budget), zombie rapist with a huge dick oars, paddles flying demon child, and I could go on and on and on, but I do not want to say too much ... but I must point out that there is a scene in which a girl masturbating with a sex doll as he is alive lol! Oh, and she falls in love with a zombie rapist sex doll lol <br /> <br /> The best line in the film: <br /> <br /> Detective Behavior: * snorts coke * Detective Sloan: What the * bleep * are you doing, manners ? What the hell do you smell? What the hell is this? Detective Behavior: It's nothing a man is ... Ehh ... Cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detective Behavior: * injects heroin in his hand * Detective Sloan: What the * bleep * you do the behavior? You * beep * crazy? Detective Behavior: This cold medicine <br /> <br /> Detective Behavior: A * repeatedly kicking a random guy in the face * Detective Sloan: What the hell is going manners? What are you doing? Detective Behavior: This maniac was rambling about demons, and then he began smashing his head on the stone! He just started smashing his head on the stone! I think he's on PCP or something! <br /> <br /> LOL!
