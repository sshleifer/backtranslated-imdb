The film rewrote the history of cinema in all respects. Nobody cares what anyone thinks about this film, because it is beyond criticism. Every flaw in the film is easy to overcome a lot of amazing things, the film has going for it. This is a very beautiful film, and I doubt that many of us will see anything like this again. I've seen it several times than I care to count, and I'm still getting freezes every time with a feeling that is hard to describe. One for the ages.
