I've always been a supporter of the show, so I admit that I am biased. When you run the show ended, I felt that too many questions remain unanswered. This film seemed to me that the closure. In order to see all the people I went to for the last few years together, finally, it was the most helpful. I've heard that it is probably the only Slaughter movie that we can expect. If so, then this is the right way to get out. This film is sometimes bitter, sometimes upsetting, but always satisfactory. If you are or have ever been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
