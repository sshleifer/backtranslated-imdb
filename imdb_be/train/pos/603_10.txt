Music Alb√©niz permeates this film. Once in while he plays with the original equipment (such as a piano, but never a full orchestra), but often he again worked with a variety of modern ensembles (e.g.guitar) and treatment (eg, jazz piano). Only occasionally is the music of a single focus of the film: the vast majority of the time the music is set to a variety of dance, flamenco is often, but not always. I think there's 12 ?? 14 scenes that are not unified plot. Not all the scenes to reach a height for individual viewing. In my case, about half have reached the summit, but all the others were in their own way very well. Those who have worked for me, moved me to Gusyatin aesthetic pleasure; Indeed, the final scene left me gushing with joy. And in a very magical way it brings you deep into the Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. Almost wordless film, though each scene is the title of a piece of Albeniz. Seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of Sauro films not available on DVD in the United States. I am referring here, in particular, his flamenco version of "Carmen", a spectacular work of art, which is available in Europe but not here (European DVD will not play on US DVD players). It's a scandal.
