I have not laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time. Garbage that Hollywood was to extinguish lately makes me a wall! This one was definitely fresh and witty. If you look at the demographics of the ratings, few women voted! I do not want to spoil the movie for you, but I'm sure that everyone who saw it ran to their computers to evaluate him and gave him a bad grade, why? Because the film puts people in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this film because of its real cost of humor and not because it harms men ... it can be easy to "7" was rated by the movie!
