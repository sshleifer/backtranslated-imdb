A little slow (as something like a movie Sofia Coppola), but still very fascinating film about sexuality opening three teenage girls. movie magic lies in its ability to bring back a lot of memories before it was as if their age. Confusion and insecurity are drawn in a very simple way, but so true to life. Music is perfect and the effect is amazing. The camera works fine, too. I highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life, when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also like to say that this is a great film for young people who are going through this period. So many films have been made about adolescence, but it really captures the true essence of romance identify adult world and its complexity.
