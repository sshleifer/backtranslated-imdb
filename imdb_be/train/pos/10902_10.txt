I was very moved when I watched movie.how Jonny could keep such hope and faith was strange. so many people care only about what they want, and fuss about all the things that they do not have. and they are such small things as chothes, the money a new car. I have seen people in tears because of the defect. this film brings it all back to the basics. love, hope, beauty simple, but equally important things in life.It makes our everyday problems seen in the fact that they are small and very important. you see this boy, and you know, by the time you have been blessed with food, a roof over your head and your loved ones around you .You really blessed.and saying stop and smell the roses really new meaning.and I know Jonny will see it and I want to thank him so much for the spread of such faith, Strenght and humor with me .thank you Jonny I know you soar the sky and bring a lot of love and laughter in the sky above.
