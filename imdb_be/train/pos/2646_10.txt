I think that most people do not seem to get the right idea of ​​the film, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure that this is a film about drug abuse; rather, it is a film about the way of thinking of those brothers of genius, drug side effects, the marginal. Again, this is not a commercial film that you see every day, and if the author wanted to, he certainly has not turned out as most people think that this is one of the many films related to the drug. However, I think, is something else the matter. Like many films by drawing different cultures, audiences tend to fully understand the movies that show their own culture, that is something they have grown up with and are familiar with. This film is to show that these "brilliant" people often think and what problems they face. The reason why they act like this is because they are bored crazy :) They have to meet the people who make mediocre things and take those things as if they launch the space shuttle on a daily basis. They start quite hard work and succeed in the shortest possible time. They feel kak-I went to work, did not do anything, still doing two times better, because the guys around me, when they were in all their projects, what should I do now with my free time. And what is even more boring? If you can begin to predict behavior, not because you are a psychologist, but instead, because you've already seen this picture in the past. Thus, for them, on the one hand, it is not a difficult job, which is also a rather dull time, and on the other, they begin to figure out the behavior of people. This is a recipe for a great big boredom. And not stupid things, as a rule, are made to come out of this state. They guy earlier who said that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life from the point of view of logic (mathematics describes the logic), while life is not really logical thing, in fact, absolutely right.
