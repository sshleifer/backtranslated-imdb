Firstly, I did like this movie. It is well acted all. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the comments I hear from people about the unexpected ending. I knew nothing about this film takes place in addition to several "must-see" recommendation, but I knew where the plot takes place in under ten minutes. (I will not mention that knowledgeable me so as not to spoil a good movie to others.) Nevertheless, despite this, it seemed obvious, I continued to watch. It was nice to see how it all plays out, filling in the details and motivations of the characters in these scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not hate, I think, the end of the beginning of the film. I just hate it when the road to the resolution sent a dull landscape. <br /> <br /> screen persona of Will Smith just cute, even if he plays a restless nature. He is energetic and true in all that I had seen him do. Seven Pounds another fine performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson solid performer, drawing brisk and upbeat character, in spite of the terminal state of the heart. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and Rosario, if you can not find it great, you have to think about replacing the eye. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I have not seen him much lately, but it might just be me. Woody was not a huge amount of screen time, but he sold his cheerful, piano, blind man character for all it was worth. Excellent. <br /> <br /> A quick bit of research on the box jellyfish is telling me that his poison cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity dermatonecrotic. I think this makes it a questionable choice for both pets and plot. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to recommend this film is not for sketching, but for some very good performances, as well as for the fact that it tends to cause some of the tragic emotions that we usually try to avoid.
