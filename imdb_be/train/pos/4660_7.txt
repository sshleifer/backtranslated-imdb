"Hot Millions" is a well-written, well-acted story about embezzlers who steals (whoops - too low class word for embezzlers, according to the chief hero Peter Ustinov) "Hot million" from the London branch of a US corporation, creating a shell corporation in the continent and using supposedly secure computer company to transfer funds to them. (. Remember, police spoiler, it's a comedy, not a mystery) <br /> <br /> Since 1968, the description of this film may seem naive computers today more computer-literate population; but as someone who has worked with computers since before the film was released, I would argue that even if this smacks of what has been written for computer literate, probably in order to strengthen Droll comedic aspects of British film. <br /> <br /> If one has little taste for this kind of entertainment, the film may seem to drag in spots. Fortunately, it has a beautifully wrapped up the end; Unfortunately, the end credits do not give any signs of classical music used in it - at the end of the symphony and a piano-flute duo in the middle - a song by Lula, which I do not remember.
