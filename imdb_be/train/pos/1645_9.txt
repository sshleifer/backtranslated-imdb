This western is different than most others. Realism is the key. Farrell comes finished in Wyoming Rip Torn work on his ranch. As it is presented it makes for the most interesting slices of Americana. I would prefer to see it on the big screen, not on the tape, but it's worth a look to see how life back in the real west. The cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell succeed in this film.
