The first series of Lost started with a bang ... literally and reduced slowly in pace. This may put some viewers off, and the people who have started to look at the half-way will be either bored or just confused. <br /> <br /> I would advise people new to the world of Lost just watch from the beginning and do not get the PT from the slow episodes. Acting for fun, but for some reason it is planned 5 series ... WHY ??? All this means that there will be no response for at least 4 years, oh well, I will continue to watch as he keeps the tension and dialogue flows.
