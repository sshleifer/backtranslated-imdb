This movie is as good as it is hard to find. The protagonist (and the author of the script and director) Simon Geist- man "with an agenda." He creates a fake magazine just to have the right to interview svinyaha Los Angeles- actors, models, musicians-, who believe that their own defecation It does not smell. With smart dialogue, Zucovic manage to do it. Of course, the budget of the film is likely that he paid for a used car, but this film is so strong and so well written that it works very well. Any person who can play Edvard Munch's "The Scream" in the reflection of the silver trash can at a local cafe should be appointed to some type of award. Give this film a chance and listen to what he says ... because they were doing the same car since 1986 ... it's called the "machine". Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
