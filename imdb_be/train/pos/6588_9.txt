After watching a few episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that the producers of the television is completely devoid of any form of originality. Here's the old standby fiction, ingeniously wrapped in a really original concept - and still they can only -almost. - make it work <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good! Male actors are sufficiently proficient in their profession. Most of the characters are well drawn, with special kudos to the hero and his more likeable side kick. And most of the plots of the episode came across as appetizing. So what could be wrong? How about female characters and cosmeticly committed actresses who are chosen to reflect them. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers insist on drawing a female character in this - almost good - series, thus making the final product appears to dilettante are inappropriate. Why, I ask, why? <br /> <br /> In the episodes all falls flat when a woman guest star or recurring character comes on screen. These actresses all absolutely incredible in their roles, and you really do not have to see them to know that they are not in a position to their acting assignments. A blind man can tell. Just listen to their conversation. They provide their dialogue with all the drama and effect of 16-year-old in high school graduation. Who would believe that these women are Phd scientists, senators, corporate executives and physicians? <br /> <br /> In a nut shell, when manufacturers have a choice on Stockard Channing and Morgan Fairchild, guess who they will choose - every time? And, of course, the series suffers because of it. Too bad!
