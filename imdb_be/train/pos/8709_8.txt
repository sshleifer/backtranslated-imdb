I recently (May 2008) found that in the childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Despite the fact that I saw a lot of high-quality films since then (at the end of the 70s (I was 10 in 1978)), is a three episode, low budget, it still stands strong. <br /> <br /> What is interesting is that at the moment I watched it with my 10 year old daughter, and she feels the same as I remember from that time: the terrible music (she had to hold my hand, even if it I was raised to view the OK and Resident Evil), constantly changing theories about who the culprit is actually, as well as complaining about the theater from the era of the votes, before Norway discovered the difference between stage action and action movies. <br /> <br /> This is the one and only good science fiction film (or series) ever made in Norway. And it's still worth watching.
