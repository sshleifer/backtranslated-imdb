«Read My Lips (Sur Mes Levres)» (which probably has a different resonance in idiomatic French title) is a refined, modern winding tale of office politics, which suddenly becomes a crime caper as unusually matched characters slide up and down the ethical and sensual slippery. <br /> <br /> two wires are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (which I have never seen, in spite of her long resume in French films) and even more disheveled than usual Vincent Cassel (who brought the sexual and / or threatening appearance and voice in several American films). <br /> <br /> The first half of the film on its turf in the competitive commercial real estate, and it is a neophyte. The second half is on its territory, as the ex-Con and its painful adaptation to this environment. <br /> <br /> The writer / director Jacques Audiard skillfully uses isolating hearing disabled woman as entree for us in her perception, turning the sound up and down for us to hear how she is doing (so it's even more annoying, than usual when viewers say), using visual effects such as sensory reactors as well. <br /> <br /> none of the characters will not work as expected (it is not like that malleable victim of "company men" and not in the individual interactions, not in stages, rather than in a common arc unpredictable story line (well, up to the last shot, but the features of the audience waiting for the performance) as we go from caring modern office, in the turmoil of the disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs. <br /> <br /> There is a subplot, it thematically redundant and unnecessary, but it only gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths. <br /> <br /> E and one of my favorites of the year! <br /> <br /> (originally written 7/28/2002)
