If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy this wonderful film with Stephen Rea in the title role. The story of the most famous rock bands out there in the 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there will be a lot of problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy large, and the song "flame burns" perfect. You should look.
