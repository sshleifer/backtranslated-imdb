I think people are under the assessment of this incredible film. People see it as a typical horror movie, which set out to frighten us and keep us from getting some sleep. That when he tries to do it would be to get a well-deserved 1/10, but I consider this film with some friends, and we found it very interesting, and although it was a good movie, after all this is Stephanie Beaton. This is the reason why I think he deserves 10/10 for pure entertainment film. <br /> <br /> General view of the film is that it has a bad action, a simple script that 10 years old can produce and that can not be taken lightly and the man lower grade because of this. But I see it as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece ... having fun funny script that made it even more interesting and the actors, though not very seriously it's very interesting.
