It's not easy to make a movie with 18 different stories in it. Although 18 different international directors accepted the challenge, not all of them good, some of them even boring. But in fact, "Paris, I love you" is breathtaking, showing that, as "Love Actually" puts it, "love everything", especially in the city of love. Here Restore (I'll try to do as a spoiler, as far as possible) with 18 different stories <br /> <br /> Montmartre -.. a kind of dull opening sequence, nothing special about this man finds a parking place, and saw a lot of amazing couple walked past, wondering why he can not find a girl and. than, suddenly, the woman faints beside his car ... <br /> <br /> Quais of the Seine - still zin blunt sequence about three teenage boys who are looking for a "piece of ass" when suddenly a Muslim girl trip in front of them, to get help from one of the boys. In fact, basic, but with a sweet heart to it <br /> < br /> LES Mare -. it was a huge disappointment Although the story of love between two boys from artsy background could be of interest to a large Van Sant In the end, everything that comes after a monologue Ulliel well, all before he's just annoying <br!. /> <br /> Tuileries. - entertaining sequence of the Coen brothers. Bush - even without saying a word - it is fascinating and the entire sequence is simply hilarious. This one kept me hooked until the very end, and this one also gets you really addicted to the film <br /> <br /> loin DU 16IEME. - a beautiful story, too, even if the performance is poor, the heart is, is a story about the Spanish-speaking woman who gives her child away, early in the morning to take care of other suburban child. . Beautiful <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - This segment should be more surprising and amazing from the whole movie. A shampoo salesman comes to Chinatown-doubles in Paris. If I understand correctly, that story about inner beauty, but I think that I'm wrong <br /> <br /> Bastille -. Really great sequence. The man found his wife in a restaurant to break up with her, so that he could run with his mistress. But my wife has some devastating news. Pretty simple, but really sad and beautiful! Victory Square - the sad sequence as well. Juliette Binoche plays a grieving mother. One day she wakes up at night hearing her dead child. When she arrived at the scene, cowboy tells her that she can give one last goodbye to her child. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - two mimes who fall could be great, but, despite the fact that there are some good cinematic tricks, history is not intriguing and funny <br /> <br /> Mons. - a truly original and great consistency, one of the best movie! A young girl and an older man to discuss his future, and his fear of certain people ... Cuaron does a great director's work, and the actors of the country! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS blush - American actress (Zhillenhol) falls in love with her drug dealer. beautiful segment again, with a very sad end DES FETES revenge - a woman comes to the homeless, he begins to speak romantic with her ... because she's the love of his life. . Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Plaza de FÃªtes make everyone cry <br /> <br /> Pigalle - it is a sad consistency between Ardan and Hoskins, who are looking for a new thrill in their relationship ... very unfunny and unromantic , Pigalle is a let-down <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE. - bringing some variety in the film, QdlM relief. The young guy (Wood) is a vampire kills the victim ... Tourist vampire ... to fall in love! Dark, scary and wonderfully romantic, beautiful Madeleine <br /> <br /> Pere Lachaise. - another segment of a let-down. Directed by Wes Craven, and with stars as Mortimer and Sewell, it might be great, but the Pere Lachaise is just an ordinary, not the original <br /> <br /> du Faubourg Saint-Denis. - the rumors are true, Twyker-s short film beautiful, stunning and well done. Blind person picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend (Portman - really stunning), she breaks up with him. It reflects their relationship <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin. - even if this segment was co-directed Depardieu and has stars such as Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is a let down too. Nothing happens, the lack of chemistry between the actors <br /> <br /> 14 th District. - latest sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. American said in his French class about his trip to Paris. Her French is really scary, but at the end of the segment, she realizes that Paris is much more than it seems at first glance. <br /> <br /> With the dog in the background, "Paris, I love you" end in a sweet tone, not letting me down at all, even though some segments of boring the hell out of me, the essence of the film is excellent! A true cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
