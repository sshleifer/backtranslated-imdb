It has some wonderful places, but the length of the film can not withstand the ultra-thin plot. It is still the sailors on the holiday movie, zippier than Astaire to "Follow the Fleet", but not as good as the «On The Town». <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson bland, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their "If you knew Susie" jolly number, they make up songs as they sing. "I pleaded with her," and have fun with Sinatra it shows how skillfully he was hoofing. solo songs Sinatra blunt and seems to be inserted in order to show his singing, and not as a part of the story. Fortunately, it is providing support for actors as Grady Sutton, rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and unlikely, but impertubable Jose Icherbi, like himself, to keep looking. <br /> <br /> Kelly star of the film, even though third account, and it is interesting to see how he interacts with children who Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a kid who wants to be in the Navy and latches on the character of Kelly. He is also to visit the school, which leads to his child telling a fictitious story of his life in Pomerania (!) Fleet, which leads to its remarkable dance with animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene, he dances with a charming Mexican Hat dance with sublime tomb faced little girl, Sharon McManus, a magical and sweet. <br /> <br /> A very nice thing, but a little too long. A taster of the best musicals to come.
