In the spirit of the classic «The Sting», the movie hits, where it really hurts ... in the heart! Prim, proper woman psychiatrist, adventurous, meets with the dirtiest and rottenest with scoundrals. Vulnerable doctor falls in love with Badman's career, and asks him to take part in its work. While the film moves kind of "slow", is the culmination and the end of the wonderful! You will especially enjoy, like a doctor "forgive himself"!
