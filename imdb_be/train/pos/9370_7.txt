I've never heard of this movie before seeing it, I thought it was an independent film, and I was right, but with a good shot, I decided to chance it. Basically drifters Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is located in Red Rock, Wyoming, in search of work, and the owner of the meeting Wayne Brown bar (Pleasantville in JT Walsh), he receives a large sum of money, is mistaken for a hit-man, he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He did not correct it, takes the money and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides that he must go. If Wayne knows his true identity, he chases Michael removes the big gun, until he gets into the car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But everything is complicated when Michael realizes Lyle hits a person, he was wrong, and he makes a quick retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing that they are both in danger, they are planning to leave the city together, and add one more complication in the fall for each other. Before leaving, however, Susan insists that they go and steal a large sum of money in the safe. Of course, things do not go smoothly, and Wayne Lyle and catch up with them, and causes them to Lyle and now linked up Wayne, to go and get the money buried. In the end, Lyle and Wayne how to get what they deserve, Michael and Susan really get on a moving train together, but it is obvious that she cares more about money and she gets what she deserves, too. Also starring Craig Reay Jim Vance Johnson Mr Johnson, Timothy Carhart as deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as a driver and Robert Apel, Howard. Performances, except maybe lame Boyle, everything is fine and dandy, and he got a pretty good sympathizes noir black comedy thriller. Very good!
