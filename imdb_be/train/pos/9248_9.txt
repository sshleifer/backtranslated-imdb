Hold Your Man finds Jean Harlow, the working class girl from Brooklyn to fall conman Clark Gable and receive all kinds of trouble. The film begins as his film, but by the time it is more emphasis definitely goes to her character. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Gable Street swindler pulling games with your partner, Garry Owen and sign the cops yelling. As he chases the ducks in Harlow gable apartment and he be such a charming man, she protects him. <br /> <br /> By the time she was engaged to him, and, unfortunately, with his racket. Gable, Harlow and Owen try to pull out the badger game on drunken Paul Hurst, but then Gable Sun go through with it. Of course, if Hearst knows that it was a fraud, it still hurts and gets belligerent and Gable to hit him. But then he wraps the dead outside the apartment Harlow and platinum blonde makes it easy to identify. She goes on accessory to murder. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is her and her adaptation to life in prison. Its interaction with other women prisoners to give her some really good scenes. I think that some of the material was later used for the MGM classic CAGED. <br /> <br /> Harlow also gets to do a song title, and this is done in the style of the torch ballad very popular in those days. She says / sings in the style of Sophie Tucker and pretty good. <br /> <br /> Gable well cast as a rogue, he develops a conscience, a part he plays often, especially in my favorite movie Gable, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> However, this Harlow, who gets to shine in this film. I think this is one of the best she has done in the MGM, her fans should not miss.
