If Chamberlain family camp near Ayers Rock, Australia, Linda Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) to see your child pulls one dingo tent, and then begins an ordeal that no one should feel. For similar stories Dingoes do not believe the public or the press, and all this is turning into a circus. Linda does not help the cause either because it would not play in the jury or the court room, she just herself, and she is a tough nut to crack, so of course everyone thinks that she is guilty, because it is part of the evidence that has not come light. Sam Neill well as Michael Chamberlain, in the Seventh-day Adventist pastor, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps of his wife. It's good (or bad) to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid in another place, as they are in the States, too, because the Australian public does not believe in the story and the media only fans the flames. In the end, Linda found guilty and sent to prison for life in prison, but years later, the lack of the evidence shows, and she released, but not before the end of family life largely destroyed. Heart daunting story, very well done, a little long, but worth a look. 8 of 10.
