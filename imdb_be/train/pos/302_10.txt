This film is ideal for all romantic in the world. John Ritter was never better and has the best line in the movie! "Sam" hits close to home, it's nice to look at and so much fun to play with. Gazzara was a great throw and easy to fall in love with. I am sure that I have met in my travels Arthur somewhere. All around, a great choice to pick up any evening.! :-)
