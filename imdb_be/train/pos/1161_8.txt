It was an extremely low budget (it is some of the scenes, it seems, they are written with a home VHS). However, he has a good story line, and it is easy to follow. 8 years after the shooting of her sexually abusive stepfather Amanda are released from the hospital, with the help of your doctor, who she secretly has to deal with. The doctor completes her house rent and buying her a car. But within the first 20 minutes of the film Amanda kills it and hides it in his backyard. Then she sees that her neighbor Richard set eyes on him, and does not stop until she has it. It acts innocent, but after another neighbor Buzz learns that Amanda killed this doctor and tried to kill his wife Lori Richards (this after Amanda and get it in a hot tub). Then it ceases to act as Innocent and kill Buzz, and then attempts to kill Richard, whom she supposedly loves and cares. And you have to make a movie to see when Amanda died or not. In general, a good movie, reminds me a lot of my life, you know, all falling on neighbor and stopping at nothing until you are part of it.
