Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) in the bar and invites her to see the show with him. She agrees on the condition that they do not change any information about each other - even names. Sometimes it's the best kind of date. However, when he returned to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was killed. His alibi for the mystery woman, but no one can remember when I saw her, and, as a consequence, Scott was sentenced to death for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not sure of his guilt, and sets out to find the woman who could save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good film and audience 100% behind trying to Kansas City to get to the truth. We follow her through a few memorable scenes, such as its commitment to Mac bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and claustrophobic venue where Cliff drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) takes her to hang out, drink and dance while he stuck with his friends, it is a glaring picture of sexual desire, it allocates a portion of the film, as well as all sweating heavily and rhythmically for a scene. Ella Raines good in the leading female role and Thomas Gomez makes a nice policeman. Alan Curtis began as confused, innocent people, but as soon as he is arrested his speech made a left turn, he became completely unpleasant Kansas for no reason. God knows why she stuck by him. <br /> <br /> The film keeps you guessing about who the killer is, as we know, about halfway through the film, but it does not matter. In fact, it adds to the tension and the dramatic development of the story, as we have Kansas, to find out what happens and then get the hell out! It's a good movie with some great scenes, but at Elisha Cook Jr. has a memorable role, I just do not like it at all, I see it in .... someone give me neck tie .....
