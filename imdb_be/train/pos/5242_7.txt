I really liked this movie for two reasons. Firstly, it gives an idea of ​​the world loyalism in Northern Ireland, which is very rarely treated in films, most of which speak to us of the republican struggle. The second reason is performance of actors. I thought they gave a very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that many people do not hear about is my native shores. <br /> <br /> In general, it is an entertaining film Ganster with stellar performances from a who's who in the Northern Ireland actor cast. It does not overturn the earth, although it may open up some peoples eyes to the dark world of the loyal militias.
