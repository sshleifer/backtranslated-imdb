This movie is hilarious! I watched it with my friend, and we just had to see it again. This film is not for you moviegoers who will only watch movies that were nominated for an Oscar (you know who you are.) I will not summarize, because you have seen, that of all the other reviews. <br /> <br /> Â«Whipped" is a light-hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout. It does not take itself too seriously, and you need to watch with your friends, not your friend. He will not win any awards, but it just has to watch to appreciate. However, some toilet humor jokes, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use some of them sometimes. Some people need to illuminate and see the "Whipped" for what he is, not what it is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 with *****.
