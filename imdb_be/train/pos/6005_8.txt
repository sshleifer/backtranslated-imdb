Despite the fact that this film is somewhat sanitized (because it was done at a time when people just do not talk about sex), it is extremely useful to a short film to show prepubescent girl, so they know what to expect during menstruation. Not surprisingly, it was paid by Kotex, although that may surprise many that Disney made this film - they did a lot of training films during the 1940s, 60s. However, well-made film, though, I think I missed a real opportunity to film director. Instead of the glorious voice of a female narrator and relatively mild visual would be nice if they used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the gang Disney !! I know that would have given the old Walt's heart attack, but wow, that would be a great movie! By the way, although the notion of sex just hinted at in the movie, it can not adequately explain menstruation altogether. However, it lacks some details (especially regarding sexual intercourse), I guess I have been included in the accompanying booklet. <br /> <br /> Now, if only I can figure out why I was watching cartoon about menstruation.
