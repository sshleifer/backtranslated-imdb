This sprawling (4:00), a remake of the history of Rider Haggard, with the usual addition of women's and outsider podagovorom with Russian soldiers looking for a "power stone" buried with the treasure of King Solomon. This is a very good shot, giving a vivid sense of wide open spaces of Africa, and very well acted. Patrick Swayze is a great Allan Quatermain and Alison Doody attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help save her father. Saydd Oniul in Umbopa, Gavin Hood, both McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (not listed in the list on the IMDB) is also memorable. After all, Hollywood can not leave a good story alone when they fit it, it's a well-written, and besides, it's too long, I enjoyed it. 6/10.
