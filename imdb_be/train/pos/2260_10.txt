Damn good movie! Anyone who is seriously undervalued. Songs that children sing in the film gave me the feeling of pain, but also hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg puts a good job here, but the best performance throughout the film is that the actress who plays the main role. I want it to be more films. <br /> <br /> This film should have a higher rating. I give it a 10/10.
