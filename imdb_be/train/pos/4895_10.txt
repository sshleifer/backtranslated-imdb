It is rare that I sit down in front of a TV special to watch a specific program. It's even rarer when I actually use the program at the end of the day, but the last Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I think I've seen. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, and a lovely, witty and poignant script combine to make it a truly rewarding experience. I can not express how good I thought it was, so I will not try, I'll just say, when you get the opportunity to see PLEASE !!!! I only hope that he will be released on video.
