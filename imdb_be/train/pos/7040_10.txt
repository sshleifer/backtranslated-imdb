This film was very rich for the following reasons: 1) It contains a large screen and sets. 2) He has shown inconsistency war environment, along with the technological one. 3) John Cusack action was amazing. It is very well portrayed amounts. 4) He has shown the vulnerability of the situation in the devastated war. 5) He has given us a picture of what might happen in the future in many ways. I was impressed with the current for the most part. Hillary was acting, I found the most unnatural. Morals and values ​​of each person in the war-torn situation for grabs. Liberal journalist and conservative business man is capable of doing anything in any situation, and equally unpredictable. Great stuff. PSP
