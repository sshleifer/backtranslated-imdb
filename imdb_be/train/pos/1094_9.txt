This is one of the few comedies I can watch over and over again, and still laugh out loud. In other places I've read complaints about racism and sexism with sanctimonious, politically correct prigs. There is none here, if you do not define sexism as a woman, as a housewife and racism in a family with a colored maid. <br /> <br /> Lines fun, and all the wires have never been better. Melvyn Douglas is particularly brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you ever thought of or tried to build a new home, you'll be relieved to know that no matter how the process is not annoying, no matter how much lamb among wolves, you can feel, you are not alone!
