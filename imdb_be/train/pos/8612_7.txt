I totally disagree with other comments posted on this film. For example, a film based on the book, and if the author had a gay character in it, as it were, "Hollywood" just throw in a symbolic gay character in the film. And besides, there were two gay characters, and I thought that they reflect each other perfectly. One of them was normal, and the other more feminine, but it was not over the top. And Diane Keaton gave a great performance, and if the other reviewer had the decency actual watch the entire movie, they would see that her character is based on the film by interacting with other characters. For example, if she and Adam went to look at the car that crashed into a dump Sarah could see the mother's side of the exit from it, and then you saw the movie, she was also unbeatable. But I think if you're too worried about gay characters, and characters that are flawed, then this film is bad. But if you are more open, and I do not know, in fact, there is a suspicion that it is good, then you will enjoy this film.
