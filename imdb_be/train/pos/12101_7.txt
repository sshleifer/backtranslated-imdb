I remember this film in the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a boy. The scene in which the doctor finds a coffin Carmus gardener, and breathed the body in it, was a terrible part of the movie for me, only increased the darkness of the movie. I would also like to know about the people who hang from the trees at the end of the day, until I learned of the film, which surname to Blackwoods was changed from Blackblood, due to the fact that a family history there was a character who was known for his numerous fabrics of different people. Sir Thomas the Blackwood real estate, it seemed to get pleasure from the addition to the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that Foster first part of the cemetery gate, he carefully noticing a sharp object gates, where he meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie for fans of horror films.
