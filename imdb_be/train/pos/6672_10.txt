I saw Mystery men in the CC bit sticks in the press and the general public (take IMDB voice for example), but my general feeling that Mystery Men more fun than most of the films is certainly ingenious, than most of the so-called. comedy movies and almost "smartÂ» <br /> <br /> starring fine; Greg Kinnear is very rich, like Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Limousine scene Kinnear Ricky Jay perfect "spoiled movie star," and he imbues his character with the right balance as comic books and realism to make it work. <br /> <br /> I admit a bit of Shagan in places, and visual effects, of course, very flash of the explosion, possibly to the detriment of further characterization, but in the end, it's a high concept of the creation of the film - it's about the little things, "What It happened to Tiger Lily? "- and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing.
