It was probably one of the most well-made 40s movies - Warner Bros. at the peak of his style. Photo Sol watered perhaps his greatest achievement - great composition and lighting with subtle shading. Max Steiner contributes to one of the most challenging and beautiful points - the embodiment of his classical method of Leith motive. Music adds a lot of excitement and thrill to the story and an elegant and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same crew that made this film went straight to make "Now, Voyager» later this year - a great film that won accolades and awards, and went down as a historical favorite, ciefly, because he He starred Bette Davis. On my view, «The Gay Sisters» much better film - made better in all departments, and more interesting, challenging and enjoyable. The most unusual film that entertains those who take it for what it is, and not project their own feelings of modern creative or advanced and demanding standards of the hyper-critical of perfection. Every thing should be tried in his own time reference and for what he is trying to achieve on their own terms. Most of the complaints that I have read in these reviews so childish and completely missing the point. If you're hungry for the perfect Phil minions entirely go to the counter and start to whine and complain about the fluffy dough. film critic art really lost a large part of the population. Unfortunately people - perhaps if this film was praised by the Rolling Stones and hundreds of intricate and introspection podagovorami, you would all be happily satisfied. I will take the old film without modern intelligent claims the day of the week!
