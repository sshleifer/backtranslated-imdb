Although I really enjoyed the last "serious" speech Jim Carrey ( "The Truman Show," "Man on the Moon"), I have always believed that his real genius lies in the physical comedy. This does not mean that it is a fantastic, talented actor: the laity at the Oscars, it seems, do not like it so much that he never had (really deserved) the appointment or award. Well, any "institution" that will provide for 11 Oscars boring, such as "Titanic" should not be taken lightly. <br /> <br /> As with the inspection. "Grinch" sweeter that looks better, better acted, more pleasant seasons since the movie "The Nightmare Before Christmas." Both films seem to be very similar, too, are stylized scenery and location who steals Christmas. And make them the protagonists seem like thieves (one more so than others), how to pack a strong moral lesson, and as a truly pleasant. <br /> <br /> That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and the Grinch is a human. But the man who is so incredibly clear, so the fluid in his movements, so animated, so unreal that never gets in the way of the film. It can be fun, it can be boring at heart, he can be evil. He lives in a 3-dimensional world, where the 3-dimensional people live. He jokes that he laughs, he cries, and eventually, he saves Christmas. I loved this film to pieces, rather than wait until it comes out on DVD. This is one of those movies you'll really enjoy the 10, 20 years. As timeless as they come.
