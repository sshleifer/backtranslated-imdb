This film received terrible reviews, but since it was unusual because the critics usually do not "receive" extraordinary films, I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, they were mostly right in this case. <br /> <br /> The film is just an awkward feeling and that is the most off putting. Kind of feeling that is impossible to describe, but it is not good. To further confound things, the script stupid pointless thing that only remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> very talented Thurman just drifting through this mess, creating a little influence. Harm and Bracco ~ d vainly tries to add something to the film enthusiastic performance, but there is nothing in the script. It may be less embarrassing for them when they have simply chosen to drift and will finish with this, as Thurman. <br /> <br /> One case "respectable" film critic does not mention, however, that the film is actually quite funny. Be precise those moments of satire and some outrageously bizarre moments, like when cowgirls in question pursuit of harm from them the ranch with the smell of unwashed ... um ... the front bottoms. <br /> <br /> Because of chortles more friendly throughout, while I would not recommend this movie, there is entertainment to be had and look even worth Cowgirls miss something else.
