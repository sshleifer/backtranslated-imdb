At first glance, I was waiting for this movie to be crappy, because I thought that the story will be so overly feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in earlier comments, I agree that feminist role in this film is not boring. I never had any idea that the protagonist was exaggerating her position as a woman. It's like Guzman presented as someone with a backbone, it is unlike his classmates. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was pretty good, for a predictable end, except. Maybe it would be a good idea to give the story a radical turn, so that the viewer is slightly more surprised. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez earned her respect as she took her character. I can not explain why, but especially in love scenes she convinced me. He just looked real, I think. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 out of 10, only because of the lackluster last half an hour.
