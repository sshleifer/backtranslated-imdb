I went to the movies with two of my friends, and chose this film out of a hat, not knowing what to expect. And poured into a very nice, to die laughing experience! This is a great movie with a very unexpected plot, very good dialogues and crazy humor. All the characters are obviously made in "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comics) style, but it does not bother me for a second. In fact, this kind of misfits, vagabonds made a part of the film are quite unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role as Clooney Willian Mace barely known and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzman. He made part of his life in this film! The scene where his character Cosimo dies in the film, so much fun that it made me gasp and almost die with him! Highly recommended for all fans of "Alan Ford"!
