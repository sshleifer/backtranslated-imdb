This movie can be interpreted on different levels. Do not listen to other comments bashing movie and say that it is played back story or w / e and that it is only about drugs. It has a very obvious superficial metaphor about drugs; However, the rest of the film (and why I think that this was done in person) is not really that at all. It really mocks psychology and conditioning of society. It shows, for a split second, that the brother of the protagonist looks these sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it must demonstrate that all this gruesomeness, that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions, and not to see a person as people. As for the stage of logic, also referring to the people who were in the federal mandated 1% of smart classes, who are confused and frustrated, because life is not so predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems at the macroscopic level. You should apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (along with all other laws and principles of uncertainty) is not only physics, but to life and leave room to change their plans and adjust along the way. One of the best movies I have ever seen. It just might go way over his head; this is not for you, and for those people who are having trouble coping with life does not work like a mathematical problem. If you are critically analyzing film or recording to try your critical review does not read the back cover of the first (written by marketing and parapsychologist)
