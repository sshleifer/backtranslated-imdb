I have to admit - the only reason why I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Gackt and * huge * fan Hyde. I was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were, say, a nice eye for the female, but a little cheese stories. I mean, the synopsis sounds really there. And now, when I've just finished watching - I feel the need to tell the world the brilliance! Hyde and Gackt both gave heart-wrenching performance, and my eyes are still hot from crying, which continued during the last half of the film. You are drawn into the story, and you really feel for the characters to the end. Element of vampirism - which I love, but it is very easy to overdo or damage the film with - subtly blended into the story, to make something as simple as the exotic, the normal to the environment, rather than a random unnecessary additions to the stories, I appreciate that in 9 out of 10 on first ... and then I came back and tried to think about why I'm not giving him that last point. I came up with nothing. Thus, ten out of ten it is. In the end - I do not have a lot of criticism - the fact that I tried to write a review at all it means that I either really hate the film really love it. You can say that I side with the moon child.
