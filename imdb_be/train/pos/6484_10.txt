I remember watching it in the 1970s - then I just recently borrowed a couple of episodes of our public library <br /> <br /> Of the nearly 30 year hiatus, I have come to a different conclusion .. Most executives surveyed in this series - some in the center of power as Traudl Junge (Secretary of Hitler), Karl Doenitz (the head of the German naval fleet) Anthony Eden (United Kingdom) - are long gone, but their first-hand will live on.From generals and admirals sergeant, Russian civilians, concentration camps, which survived all on the record here. <br /> <br /> I remember an interview with Lord Mauntbettenom (killed in 1970) <br /> <br /> It really is a gem, and I believe that the producer of this series was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for this to work - deserved <br /> <br /> Looking at these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy a set <br /> <br /> It is only "10" I have given any review, but I have. . found as a fine bottle of wine, it is more appreciated with a little time ...
