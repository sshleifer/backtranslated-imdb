Lovely shot, more please! <br /> <br /> If you can catch just about anything else, Plater written by (or with the participation of these great actors). For those who do not know, Plater has a real sense of jazz, my recommendation is to see the trilogy «Beiderbecke» whenever you can <br /> <br /> "There are three kinds of jazz -. Hot, cold and "What time does start the melody?"
