I came in the middle of the film, so I had no idea about any credits or even her name until I looked it up here where I can see that it has received a mixed reception from your commentators. I'm on the positive side with respect to the film, but one thing really caught my attention, as I watched: beautiful and sensitive evaluation is written in the style of Coplandesque Americana. My surprise was great when I discovered that the account was written by none other than the John Williams. However, he wrote a bitter and sensitive results, such as Schindler's List, but one usually associates his name with bombasticities like Star Wars. But in my opinion, that Williams wrote for this film surpasses anything I've ever heard of him tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in accordance with the tender and a great plot of the film. And one recent estimate it for Catch Me If You Can, shows more intelligence and sophistication. As for Stanley & Iris, I love education films like How Green Was My Valley and Konrack, one that Jon Voight and his young African-American charges in South Carolina, and Danny DeVito Renaissance Man, etc. They tell the story of the necessary intellectual and spiritual awakening, a story that can not be said often enough. This one is a great addition to this genre.
