Given the fact the opposite of 2009, where the reality is we have a black president, this film takes on a fairly strong historical significance. For entertainment value, I found this film to be as interesting and nasty. I was pretty well known designed for blatant racism of time, but also found the music and the dancing is incredible. In addition, it's pretty cool to see Sammy Davis Jr. as a small child actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy, who is now comforting his Mammy. He said: "For some reason, you could be president." It was so funny, in 1933, he was ridiculed and thought, punish, magic and fun. The bulk of the film's fantasy sequence that the Government will, as if he was running a black man. They paint the place of government as having been born again Baptist Church. <br /> <br /> The fact is, when I came across this film one day he caught me. It's really well done and very interesting. I believe that if we can move beyond racism, we can see this film at all this brings us. In fact, to understand that this is not only not funny to have a black president, but that's okay, just makes this film that much more relevant. This clearly marks the point in time for our collective consciousness.
