Honestly, this is the best reality show anyone ever come up with. In order to win money, you have to actually be intelligence. Not only do you have to be bold, athletic, cunning, etc. It actually requires skill. Not like some lame-ass show, that these days. Nevertheless, they have only two seasons it! Bull..they need to bring this show back !! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that they will have a hard time traction Anderson Cooper from CNN. He was great. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was an amazing show. You never know who will go where. And it was so much fun trying to figure out Like yourself! It was a show that you can actually play yourself if you want! <br /> <br /> Give MOLE !!!! Give MOLE !!!!
