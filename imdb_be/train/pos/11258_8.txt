Spoilers! sex garbage Classic 70! Breakfast Gal (Helga) was what made this film so great. She was beautiful, but that in fact I was the way she was sexy. She radiated sexuality in large quantities throughout the film. Her best scenes were when it was, um, stimulating yourself. Every time she was on the screen, I became transfixed. <br /> <br /> In addition, Dr. Julie (sister not far male movie attention) was very interesting visually. Despite the fact that most of the 12-year-old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how to use what little she and her scenes (especially the scene with a silk blouse and a black skirt) also captured my attention unmercilessly. You also have to love the main hoaky scene where bats stripped her Nekkid; I do not know if I've ever seen anything more absurd, but sexy at the same time. Classic stuff!
