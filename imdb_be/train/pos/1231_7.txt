I like good and evil battle. I loved Eddie in the film better than any movie he has ever made. He was not smart, cocky, everyone knows that he usually plays his. It shows heart, and a more modest humor. The fact is that it shows there are wonderful things in heaven and earth than we can think about giving me hope.
