I saw him only once. This happened in 1952, I was seven, the film 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... I mean, forever, powerful moments Gunga sacrifices. <br /> <br /> I realized that time, how many people are unlikely to be presented and used in a foreign country. In these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relations of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores himself, he raised among people who share everyday life, who see each other's face, who know each other's names, but belong to different worlds, It can only be done there. Then, in the most critical moments of troubling question arises: "Who are we, first, have to be loyal?" That people, family, country, man, you know close to you?. Do not have time to give a precise answer, the urgency is there and it's life or death. Ganga-Dean gives his answer to the sacrifice of himself. Somewhere in the confuse, the problem remains unresolved, the emotion grows movie rhythm, until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared with many other inventions or realities we see today, because it is death, it is a unique Disappearance of life I I lived, I shared with my child unconditional friendship. He lived a spectator I was. On the same day I release Ganga Din forever. As I left, later on, my dear child, I left since so many worlds I lived. I left all that good and the lines short visit, I did not expect today to do it in the morning on rising.
