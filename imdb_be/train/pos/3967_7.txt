This is not one of the best films of Jimmy Stewart - I quickly admit that. However, while some see it as a pure propaganda film, I wonder what is wrong with this? Yes, of course, as the FBI TV show, this is an obvious case of the Bureau to do some PR-work, to try to enlist the support. But, as entertainment goes, he does a good job. Also, oddly enough for the time it was made, the film focuses more on offense than espionage and "commies". Instead, this fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he has chosen. Considering now the agent plays Jimmy Stewart, it is quite certain that acting and writing were good - because it was a film with a real budget and the studio, which is not going to spend a star in a wave of a third year. In general, it is worth seeing, but not particularly large.
