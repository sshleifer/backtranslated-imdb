Sharp, well-made documentary focusing on Mardi Gras beads. I've always liked this approach to film-making. - communicate ideas about a large, more complex and often incomprehensible phenomenon, breaking the question down into something familiar and close to home <br /> <br /> I'm sure most people have heard stories about sweatshop and understand the underlying motives of profit and capitalism, globalization and the effect on poor countries (but people feel about it). Instead, to teach about these topics and become a bar of soap (not that there's anything wrong in that, except for such documentaries tend to preach converted), this film just shows Mardi Gras beads as they are made, which people, and under what conditions, and then how they are used by consumers at the end of the process. It is open and dramatically explores the motivation of all stakeholders, including workers, the company's management, US importers, and finally, at the end of the consumer chain. <br /> <br /> I felt a little sick of it; equally revelers Mardi Gras, but also on how workers in China have taken their position as normal and par for the course (even if they have some objection to the details of how they are managed). Images from the janitors to clean the streets of the beads in the end, made a special impression. But it was just my reaction; I can see how someone might read this documentary is a little bit different. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries on the subject, I do not think you should have any definite political views may be affected by this. It is ultimately a story about people and our goods which we produce and consume. If you have ever bought a product manufactured in the Far East, this should give you something to think about. <br /> <br /> The outstanding and highly recommended. You need to see more documentaries like this. Kudos to all those who participated in the creation of this film.
