It was a very good movie. I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but I do not want to risk. Anyway, towards the end of the film, the prosecutor read the Scripture verse, and then quoted another memory. I can not remember the first pass he reads, but the second one Genesis 9: 6 He says it is Genesis 9:12, but in fact he quotes a verse 6. It is a common passage, which many use to defend the death penalty. It's too bad that the prosecution did not dare to quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first in the history of the Supreme Court of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all the books. It is a pity that we lost this view in America.
