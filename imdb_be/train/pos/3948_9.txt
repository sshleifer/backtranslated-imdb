Thus, at last I know that it exists. Together with other members of the UK where I saw it that it must be the only UK screening in the 70s. I remembered the name, but it did not work, when I talked about this to people. It scarred me (it's 2 "g), but when you go to sleep with thoughts whizzing about your brain and listen to all around the impending horror, it is not something that any IT CLASSIC horror is all about ?? I can hardly remember the intricacies of the film, but what I remember May quivering flesh and heightened senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is a black and white? Again, if anyone has any information about how to obtain a copy of this, please contact ...
