This film is one of the best of all time, of course, in the horror genre. Claustrophobic atmosphere is beautiful, the music is just as good as the movie, and a killer, how terrible, how can there be! Actors fantastic, the RIP Pleasence you were fantastic as Dr. Loomis, he made the film even better. Without him, the film will be missing a vital component. Jamie Lee Curtis is also a great as our favorite scream queens! Her innocence does not know her real evil that is behind it, until she finds her friends brutally killed in the house, which of course is one of the best movie scenes. It gives a tremendous performance. I loved this movie, because it scared me as hell when I saw him at the beginning of the 80s, and I still have to look at this day as it is a great movie that just brings you into this world, you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format mad man in a mask, who escaped from a mental hospital and is ready to kill everyone in sight without having any idea what it is, it's just incredibly scary and cherish you even more in the film as events, though fiction may be easily realized. We all know that, unfortunately, evil exists in this world and a mad man with a knife, of course, not uncommon, very disturbing deep fear of it all. Death at any turn. Halloween, of course, shows that it is the most horrible way. Horror has to be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story, which is made into a beautiful and terrible atmosphere. As well as a great story Psycho, both of which I love, I believe that the best horror movie formats to offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho the best films I've ever seen, and I will watch them all my life and never get tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
