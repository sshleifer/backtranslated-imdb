Peter M. Cohen satyr winner on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the film in major publications, the media, as "offensive" and "obscene" only serves to emphasize its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of sexual urges and desires of people. It is in the tradition of what I call the "reality-based" satire after "The Company Men," "Chasing Amy," "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two girls and a guy." Cohen's dialogue is hilarious, and I'm always intrigued by how well he captures the real pace of today's talks. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams three different, ruthless sex passionately predators, which together with the foil their newly married friend (played superbly Judah Domke) upside down on their own terms predator females (Amanda Pete). Under the surface lies a satirical romantic comedy is much more fun than most studio sugar coated products.
