I saw this film when it was new. Later, I shot it in Japan after three years here, I'm afraid that I would be twists when I looked him in the harsh light of my extended international experience. The film has pleasantly surprised me how well it reflects the clash of cultures between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I come from). Not all of the material will actually spot, but the tone perfectly. <br /> <br /> I'm still in Japan for many years, and I continue to enjoy this film for his impartial treatment of the two sides to the story. Interestingly, despite the fact that the Japanese-American actors to speak Japanese in the original version of overdubbed dialogue in Japan, to hide the obvious problems with the delivery of a second language. <br /> <br /> I noticed one reviewer uses it in a Japanese class, I think you can learn more about what to expect from the meeting with Japan, watching this movie than reading any of the "serious" books this issue (most of which were written in the 80s and funded by advocates of Japanese companies). <, Br /> <br /> not be fooled by the resistances in the middle rating, one star reviewers called that, among other things, found it implausible that the Japanese wanted to build cars in the United States. (Of course, the Japanese work many factories there to be closer to customers and to avoid trade friction.) This is a very warm and funny film, which I would rate higher if not for a few 80s cliches like dancing around cheesy electronic music disc. Michael Keaton has never been funnier.
