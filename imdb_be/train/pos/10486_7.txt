«Saving Grace» never incredibly funny, but it gives a lot of good laughs, and I enjoyed it pretty much. Blethyn fine actress, and does a good job is shown widow Grace, which refers to growing marijuana to pay off their enormous debts. supporting cast also does an excellent job. French actor Tchecky brown is a fun little role. Only one room attractive. The idea of ​​creating a hill-woman growing and smoking pot sounds quite funny. And the film plays with the premise wisely every now and then. Of course, there is a flat moments, like the one where marijuana Two elderly women are mistaken Grace sheets for tea leaves and they start to pull out children's antics in the shop where they work. It was pointless gag that is not entirely removed. tone of the film is dark and sometimes sad, but I got enough laughs to give it an English import recommendation. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
