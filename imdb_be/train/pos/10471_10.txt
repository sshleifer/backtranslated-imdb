I enjoyed this film still hated it, because I wanted to help this guy! I am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business ... which are currently still trying to become adults ....: no more fans, groupies, money, etc. ... and they have such a hard time adjusting to ordinary life ... as they see new groups, etc. becomes the center of attention ... it's almost like they have to start over again ... this film is a testament to the fact that a lot of old rockers from the 70s and 80s are experiencing at the moment .... and that's where I I find the film boring and depressing.BUT it reflects the life of the old rock star declined and no loss of true way.The young girl who comes to his old house reminds me a Hollis Maclaren (outrage) ... and she was a lady in the movie you cheer for. This film is a must for people in their 50s, who have seen the rise and fall of groups, people who knew a member, and watched them hurt as age creeps up, and the popularity of fades.This almost perfect film ... .sad but in a positive way .... because of the whales. MUST SEE!
