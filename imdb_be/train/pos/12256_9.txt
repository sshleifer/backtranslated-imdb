Kate Beckinsale beautiful as the manipulative and yet continually magic Emma in the TV adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read this novel, I sometimes very questionable, is really worthy of the protagonist, to be considered a heroine of the story: To be honest, she was so terribly arrogant and intriguing that one is tempted to dislike her seriously. Kate Beckinsale's interpretation, however, retains Emma from him, so to speak: it is represented in all innocence and nobility of his character in the form, and one can not help but to give in, and how (if not love) her despite her less polite qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main but not the only reason why this show is so beautiful; Raymond Coulthard perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, expressing this character's personal magnetism fully (all the more noticeable because of this role is not well handled by Ewan McGregor in the adaptation before 1996 Emma screen), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton Bernard Hepton, Olivia Williams and all of them should be in their respective roles. This production, in general, is a great achievement, and one to watch many times increasing pleasure.
