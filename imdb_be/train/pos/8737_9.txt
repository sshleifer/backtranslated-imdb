Critically, people say Antz better. Antz good movie, but I was enjoying life a little more mistakes. I can not think of Pixar's animation, but two Toy Story films, I laughed so hard. Animation clean story is original and does not preach. In voice-over, making this film. Dave Foley is a serious ant, who gets himself in trouble a lot. Hopper is a superb characterization is always a great Kevin Spacey as Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also full support from Denis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes touching. It lacks social messages Antz, but the fact that we have a rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
