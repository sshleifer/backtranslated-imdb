I love this show! Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffle cats are so different from each other, but they refer to themselves collectively as "brothers". I often try to imitate a tired sigh focus his butler, Hovis, or even the Scottish town of Gordon. There should be more episodes made about human Kimberly. The episode about cats are assessing prior teenage girls to gain admission to the night party Human Kimberly to get their thirst paws on your favorite drink, Rootbeer, a fun classic. We can not drink the rootbeer in our home now without doing anything or voice Catscratch Hanson Brothers from the movie "Slap Shot. As a classic. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD ??
