It is difficult to describe the Bug words, this is one of those films that really must be seen to be understood. It follows the story, which is more flexible and interesting than anything I've seen lately in the press release of Hollywood. Like his characters react to a chain of events in different ways, as well as events dictate different ways for characters to follow, the audience just an observer. Almost Proust narrative flow of thought to the idea itself is immediacy in the scenario will have you glued to the screen, waiting eagerly to see how it all works in the end. And as far as thematic elements ... there is a certain sequence in the film, which goes from melancholy, bright and beautiful, and then tragic, all in the span of about a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This film is pure magic. It reminds why independent film, perhaps, the brightest star in the film industry at the moment. Maybe, as with a lot of Bug movie, people will start to notice.
