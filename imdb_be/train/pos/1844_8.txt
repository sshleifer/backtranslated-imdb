I'm not sure that this is just another one of those stupid nightly soap operas that seem to clog the air time, but, as it turns out, this is a very good show (with no small thanks to the talented cast). Four female friends with different backgrounds come together and share a weekly habit in their love life. Long program hours worth of each of them individually through them often blinked quest to find love, and it does it without being boring or banal. Sharon Small in «Trudi» is a housewife (presumably widowed after September 11th), which gets a little annoying and enlightening with their friends (which, as a rule, a little looser and more creative in their efforts). It's great to see a small TV back, so it was great in "The Inspector Lynley Mysteries". Chicken can act. character Orla Brady (Siobhan, lawyer), perhaps the most damaged, but still very responsive to women, as she struggles with her kind, but introspection husband Kharya (Jaffrey, previously "Ghosts") in its driven by the desire to have a child with her, regardless of her needs. The last two members of the cast are effervescent Je (Shellie Conn), an event planner that wild child who sleeps with someone else, and all the floor is not specific, and Katie (Sarah Parish) gloomy doctors, which is the case with the patient and his son sent her career and love life out of control. That being said, now I'm hooked and I hope that the BBC continues to scroll through the series, because it's good, it's different, and it has a great cast.
