I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and I also work in an emergency medical facility. Over the years I have seen people die of hemolytic transfusion reactions, attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogen, and have seen a few patients become seriously ill from pathogens, caused by blood transfusions. I also heard several Jehovah's Witnesses say that they would die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field, I have never seen this happen, leaving the question "whether it is unwise indeed to refuse a blood transfusion or a community in a great boon the fight on this issue? "The question for Jehovah's Witnesses is a moral. "You have to abstain from blood" is not ambiguous statement. Thank you for this film and letting comments on it.
