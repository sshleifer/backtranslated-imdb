Wow, I can not believe I waited so long to see this movie. I just did not bother to watch it. The plot has nothing that interests me. I do not know anything about football (soccer). I am one of those American fools that does not have a clue. I never even saw David Beckham for this film. I decided to ignore the buzz around the film at the time he was released in America. Enough about me. <br /> <br /> In truth, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of the film, making the sky. What a fun movie. He is full of color and wealth. I had a goofy smile on his face throughout the film. Parminder heating so sweet and cute, you can not help but root it. No wonder why American television show E.R. I grabbed her. I have a new understanding of the Indian culture. These people know how to have a good time. Wedding scene spectacularly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I've had to decipher some of the British slang and accents through dialogue. I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I do not miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the movie!) I'm sure the audience all over the world it is difficult to understand the constantly changing slang in American films as well. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect date movie. It has great sports story, like Rocky, and a strong sense of feminism that empowerment and opportunities for women. I watched it with my wife, and sixteen years old niece and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.
