The movie was a lot better than the other reviewer she said. This is a good family film. He has a funny fantasy aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her home. Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearance. It finds and made friends with a girl her age, and can help the girl's family in many ways. It can also help her to her relationship with her father in the long run. It reminds me of the Hallmark movie so give him a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed aimed more at children under the age of 6-12 years (maybe a little more), and it's pretty much PG or G rating. I'm a grown man who can appreciate a good "family" film - I think the other reviewer is not.
