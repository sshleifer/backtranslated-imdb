Fantastic Arabian adventure. The former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (plays Sab Black Narcissus) find the love interest of Ahmad, who was stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There's a little down time here. It is always inventing new adventures for the characters. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a little sad (no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad made the fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always fun actor, makes a great villain, and Sub much fun as a prince of thieves, who in some moment finds a genie in a bottle. I am also very fond of Miles Malleson Sultan of Basra, the princess's father. It collects strange toys from around the world. Jafar impresses him by the hand of his daughter with a mechanical horse fly. This is likely to be considered one of the greatest children's films of all time, but the special effects are terribly dated today. Children, of course, to make fun of the overlay image, and when Abu gin is on the screen together. And the scene with the giant spider looks particularly badly. Although most of the younger generation, probably thinking that King Kong looks bad at this point in time-lapse animation of Willis O'Brien, a thousand times better than a puppet on a string, which is not even remotely looks like a spider. 8/10.
