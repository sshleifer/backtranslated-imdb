When I found the film in the schedule for Christmas, his name does not sound familiar to me, because I have not read the novel, and something about the film is not heard. However, after reading the content, I decided to spend their Christmas Eve to watch the film. The effect surprised me completely, I can not remember when I last saw a movie in which every moment got me. Vow to cherish, without a doubt, one of the films, which currently represents a real surprise I got from the movie. Here are some arguments why my I believe that this film is very underrated piece of good cinema. <br /> <br /> In the first place, all content is particularly informative. It has something to offer modern audiences - clean, right faith and some answers to universal questions. Is there a need Christ in our time? There is love still matters? Why is faith? What is the logic of the burden and suffering in life? Is someone on my side, I can always trust? The film provides answers through the content, since everything that happens with the characters can also happen to any of us. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is extremely humane. The main characters are feeling and inner struggle to cope with an extremely difficult decision. Is it better to Kyle David Denman) and Terry (Megan Paul), to start their own lives and forget about the family or to save the values ​​they were taught at home? Is it better for John (Ken Howard), to leave Helen (Barbara Babcock), his sick wife, and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock), the woman he falls in love with? In fact, Ellen no longer recognizes him ... Nevertheless, he decides to take the oath of eternal allegiance to his wife. If the rebellious brother John, Phil (D. David Morin), it is better to go for an easy life, but it does not bring him pleasure or just start seriously thinking of his life. Phil prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterpiece of universal aspects of humanity. These words might be as well to say to all, regardless of where, when and how they live <br /> <br /> In the third place, the film is a great family picture is not very popular these days :. There are problems, but there is always something more powerful that gets these people together. This "something" is love and trust. I know that this may sound a bit idealistic. Not all families can count on the loyalty, and it may not be as easy as this. Nevertheless, this is a very realistic and educational aspect. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the entire film focuses on people's mutual aid. If we want to live a happy life in our society, we have to understand one thing: we have to help each other. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of this attitude. At the beginning of the film we see that it says John about prayer. Later, he helps his brother. Alexander is a kind of "Angel", which is sent to John and his family. Is it not possible that we can be angels to each other? <br /> <br /> Fifth, artistic features, is also worthy of attention. PERFORMANCE: Barbara Babcock gives a true performance as Helen, and although it is complex role, it does an excellent job. Consider, for example, when she appears at school and wants to teach again. Ken Howard is also remembered as a faithful husband. PHOTOS: The most memorable for me was the scene of John and Helen in the park, walking on fallen leaves (autumn) while the sun (love) is distributed everywhere. I interpreted as a kind of sign: even if there is sadness, it can always be illuminated with light and joy ... <br /> <br /> vow to cherish a great movie that really showed me what it means to love that loyalty, and it proved to me once again, as it is beautiful to live and believe. In the end, I would like to quote the profound words of the film, I found it very touching, and I hope that you too <br /> <br /> Kyle Uncle Phil: Yes, he (John Brighton) lives according to the Bible. But no one forces you to do it. However, in accordance with the rules which you live?
