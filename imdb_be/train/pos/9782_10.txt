Peaches really great movie. I am writing this to refute the opinion of someone called «Auscrit», which appeared on this site. First of all, the idea that any Monahans first film "Interview" some way TV is an extraordinary statement. Here is a movie that was much praised all over the world, it is simply one of the best Australian films ever made. She deserves to win best picture. Peaches brave, bold and courageous departure. For me, it works on every level, and I've seen it twice. Monaghan is a director who showed incredible skill and sensitivity. For «Auscrit», to make a point that this is another television film, etc., and that Hugo Weaving is not good, just do not "get" the movie. Or more specifically, do not want to get it. Frankly, it's a kind of commentary that one expects from any other director who is jealous or bitter, or both. Or someone within the industry or distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average punter, I found not only comment like this. I noticed other comments on the site and links to the film Sommersault. One has to wonder what people are thinking, what they are watching. Unfortunately, in Australia, while the SS was released impetus was, if you do not like it, then there's something wrong with you is not a movie. This manipulation of the media is quite a common down under. The reality is the only similarity between the two films is that they are right movie passes. Unfortunately, nothing that could be said in 15 minutes for me to SS film. I see this as a one-dimensional film about the alarm. Peaches than master pieces. Personally I can not wait for that next Monahan makes him clearly ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to movies. In conclusion, if the film did not win all of these years, the AFI, and as a reward, it is rigged game. As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive to do with your time
