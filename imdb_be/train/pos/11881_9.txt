Every great gangster film is a human drama currents. Do not expect the emotional story of guilt, from «Scarface» revenge and despair. This story about the fierce greed, corruption and power. The darker side of the legendary "American Dream". <br /> <br /> Someone complained «cheesiness» of the film there is no point. Superficial characters, cheesy music and dated fashion to fuel further criticism of this life diabolical excess. Nothing in the life of these characters is really important, not on any human level, at least. In fact, the film is almost border satire, irony, given all the gangsta rappers who were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana. <br /> <br /> This is not the strongest directorial effort by Brian DePalma, sometimes cool and well handled (especially memorable finale), but often omitted messy and misled. Fortunately, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably a good therapy for him, considering it is the coke habit Tackling while). Topics serial, with a focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character, he is consumed by greed and power. Dialogue is also perfectly comfortable see-sawing between humor and drama. There are many challenges of the lines, so that climbed into the popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> cast help make it what it is, but it's really a movie Pacino. One of his early ideas less thin (that much more of it in our time), a world completely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Nevertheless, it is watchable here, as always, in a very exciting (and deliberately over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after watching this film, perhaps one of the most imitated performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as a dull and uncomfortable at first viewing, but I came to understand how she plays the part of an indifferent little wife. Nha exceptional effort, but unjustly underestimated. Supporting players are very good as well, especially as the suave Chenard Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> A powerful, sometimes humorous, sometimes shocking, controversial and ever. «Scarface» is one of the films of the eighties (all that mean for you). Essential and accessible gangster flick and pop culture landmark. 9/10
