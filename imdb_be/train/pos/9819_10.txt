This is a great film from a lost age of reaction due to television drama. My favorite actor Robert Culp skillfully builds paths through the alarmed liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system, kneejerk conservatism and fear of crime and the death psychosis. Teenagers are a set of pure evil mocking stereotypes, and ultimately the message of this film makes it look impartial DragNet episodes by comparison. But what really shines in this great film pace, build fear and paranoia on the degree, as well as a sense of the whole installation in California. The cars are really great, as good as I remember. I give this film 10, and I defy anyone to watch this movie and enjoy every minute. Remember that just because it's made for TV does not mean it's not great art.
