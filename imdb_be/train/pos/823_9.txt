Up to the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I always saw this 1983 recording, my favorite film of a long series. A variety of scenes and really different characters (Jabba the Hutt, furry woodland creatures, etc.), it is particularly attractive film made. <br /> <br /> None of the action, never focusing too long in one place, either. The last half-hour shows is same as the scene goes every few minutes from the forest to fight among spacecraft to the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> Another nice feature of this film was that the previous two did not lack fighting between the two stars. Disappeared continuous disputes between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was just a great adventure tale, more than anything else.
