I've always been a huge fan. «Homicide: Life On The Street» ago, when I heard that a reunion movie coming up, I could not wait <br /> <br /> Let me say that I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone again, but the greatest pleasure of all was to have Andre Braugher back, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss has always been the strongest part all together a great show.
