Set in 2017 (although one could easily mistake it for 1987, according to the hairstyles and clothing), The Running Man sees all round good guy Ben Richards (Schwarzeneggar) is framed for a crime he did not commit. After a daring escape from prison, he is captured and entered as a participant in a tough television game Running Man, along with some other refugees and rather symbolic woman, Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso). <br /> <br /> is used by the totalitarian government as a way to control the masses, demonstration pit judged against a number of picturesque (and often quite camp) opponents, each of which has its own unique style of slaughter: Dinamo shoots electricity from a special suit, the Buzzsaw uses chainsaw, Sub Zero club has a razor edge, and Fireball prefers flamethrower to finish off an opponent. But these killers are not suitable for Ben Richards, who sends mail to each suitably horrible (followed by mandatory mot). <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Ben joins a group of freedom fighters in the struggle against the government, and get revenge on the reverse show host, Killian. <br /> <br /> Twenty years ago, Arnold Schwarzeneggar directed the film universe and to his legion of fans, he could do no bad. Austrian Beefcake had a successful formula, which is almost a guaranteed box office success of his films: comic violence plus the logic of free plot plus pretty woman Sidekick plus witty jokes, minus the acting skills have made huge profits. Running man faithfully followed this blockbuster prescription T and the (mostly male teenage) audience lapped it up Arnie (including myself). <br /> <br /> Now, two decades later, and just finished re-watching the movie for the first time in many years, I think it's an amazing movie, one is completely devoid of technical merit, decent action and convincing effects, but as a very entertainment. Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (best known as Det. Dave Starsky from the cult 70s cop show Starsky and Hutch), and adapted from the novel by Stephen King (who writes under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), The Running Man cheesy 80s tat that looks like an incredibly cheap and very outdated but, in spite of (or perhaps because of) shoddiness film, it has a special charm that is difficult to describe. <br /> <br /> with no attempts to create realistic -future near the installation, the film provides a large number of unintentional titter. Check out the scene in which Ben discovers a secret cache of Ember forbidden cassette (!); marvel shit "futuristic" graphics used on billboards and Running Man board game (as a graphic designer, I found it particularly funny); surprising the apparent lack of compelling technological advances. <br /> <br /> Running Man can be complete nonsense, but it is very entertaining nonsense, I would not hesitate recommending for Arnie fans and sci-fi action at all.
