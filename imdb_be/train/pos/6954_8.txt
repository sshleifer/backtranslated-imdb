This film was one of the funniest movies I've seen in recent years, and the laughter from the audience to support me. Not as My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) has a laugh was spontaneous and intense. Easily is confused, as in the past year, Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) in its use of parody (spying on Mr and Mrs Smith and sex in May Super Ex-Girlfriend). Ivan Reitman Director balance between comedy and drama, between insane and completely out of place large. He never makes a dramatic shock and serious cracks rule of comedy. At the same time, it is predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements, even if the completion of the broadcast in advance. In a sense, it is so obvious that it's great to see how he plays. Just as in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that no one can really see it. Easy eight out of ten star rating there with Tootsie (1982). Perhaps nine (depending on how it appears on the second viewing).
