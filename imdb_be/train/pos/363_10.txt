This film is about the development. People grow and people are fading, people wonder, and people disappoint. It has all that and more. There is hope, disappointment, injustice, justice, love and hate. It really is a classic drama, which has fantastic views of the entire cast, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role. <br /> <br /> This film made me feel very man and proud of it, and I believe that this film should be mandatory every Saturday in all prisons in the world - this applies to your sympathy. Rating: 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> PS: I admit I shed a few tears of joy during the final scene.
