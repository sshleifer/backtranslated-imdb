Does anyone know what the pickup drove John T? I look like a mid and late 70's Ford. This film is my favorite, as well as my wife. It was the first memorable movie we saw, as a married couple. Pick-up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck I drove, and recently found another like it. I would like to restore the pickup should I look at the film. In addition, the music was strange, and the action was great. Where the lady, which reflected the aunt of John? In addition, Jan has an understudy for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? In addition, in what year did the Mustang Debra W drive in this show. It was like a 60-model. thank you,
