NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents space in an old brick where she meets some strange neighbors and experiencing some terrible hallucination. As a lawyer-boyfriend Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) is about to queries on its behalf, she struggles to save his sanity (not to mention her will to live) how to endure the experience of her physical, mental and emotional health. <, Br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil the best moments in this psychological horror film for those who are not familiar with it. The history is interesting and entertaining, but the film does not really offer much in terms of real scares. Or, for that matter, any atmosphere. It's kind of eerily quiet, but it's not like a traditional horror film. It's more of a story about the attempts of caring women to deal with the increase of unreality in her life. At this level, it works, but it is not powerful enough. <br /> <br /> What's "Guardian" * does * offer some attractive set pieces (particularly exciting, incredibly awful climax, and there's a scene from Beverly D'Angelo, who must be seen to be believed). There are also some gore is not visible, but not very much. Ominous music score Gil Melle adds risk. <br /> <br /> A lot of review of this film would not be complete without assessment for filmmakers assembled such great actors for its ensemble cast. Some of them do not get to do too much, but to see them all together is impressive. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith made the greatest impression as, respectively, sober and careful detective neighbor. Other legendary names included Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy, and Ava Gardner. Future stars like D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum make short speeches, and other familiar faces include Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey, and Martin Balsam. Anyone who has been the director of casting for this film deserves some kind of prize. <br /> <br /> Written for the screen by director Michael by Winner, probably best known for the Â«Death Wish series," which he did with Charles Bronson, a novel by Jeffrey Konvits. <br /> <br /> I do not think this is really great horror thriller, but it does have its moments, and quite interesting. <br /> <br /> 7/10
