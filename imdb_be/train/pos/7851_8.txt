Revenge of the cameraman is not unusual short because of the subject (adultery), or because it is animated (Winsor McCay Little Nemo entered on film until now), but because it reflects a mistake to tell a story! Ladislav Starewicz originally wanted to remove factual errors combat, but could not get them to do it on camera because of the hot fire they have gone through, so he took the dead and began using stop motion techniques to control the movements prior to his satisfaction. This summary does a good job of putting the human qualities of small creatures such as motorcycle riding, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz also make Frogland (1922) and mascot (1933), but his first notable work is the one. If you are interested in this, and mentioned other shorts, check your local library to take on DVD The Cameraman't Revenge and other fantastic tales from Image Entertainment.
