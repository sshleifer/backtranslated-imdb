Starfaker (let the reader on my box) was the weirdest movie I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen. So why not 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at the darker side of Hollywood. I forced a few others, to see the film, and they all agreed that it was an outstanding film.
