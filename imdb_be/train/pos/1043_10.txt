Ever since I can remember, and I was only 18, my mother and I have been, and continue to watch old movies, as well, I find them much more useful in the long run (but hey, do not get me wrong, I love movies we have now just are not as much as I love movies of 40's and 50's) in any case, now I have to say that at that moment I started to watch a movie my eyes were glued to the TV. Of course, my favorite character was played by Grandma Lucille Watson. But I loved how Bette Davis and her family was drawn. Kids ... do not act like children anymore. But there is good reason for this, keeping in hiding and run most of his life, seeing the terrible things, the children saw in those days destroyed their innocence. So people say, "Ooooh, I hated how kids act ... blah blah blah" read between the lines and know that they have seen things children should not see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas ... dear Paul did an amazing job !!! Now I know that many people with intelligence, that he went to Oscar and the sliding is not done, but hey, they both did an amazing job, so I think it could go either way. But Lucas' performance was so amazing that by the end of the film I was reduced to tears. I loved this movie so much, and recommend it to anyone !! :-D
