I enjoyed this film. It was a carefree, beautiful and very colorful. You can see that boasted MGM Technicolor. There is hardly any color are not in this movie. Each scene is packed full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He's so talented. dancing in this film the number of all the fine made, and are ideal. He realizes that dancing can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the film, the big dance sequence is very impressive. What makes this film very special music of Gershwin. Few American composers were the best gift for melody. I love the music of Gershwin. It's magic. Ira Gershwin, is certainly one of the greatest lyric writers. He is so witty and charming. It was a very interesting film.
