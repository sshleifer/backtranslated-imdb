More than a snapshot of the popular Pinup all the time than your typical pulled a biopic, it's fun and fabulous movie and have the appearance of an era with an excellent soundtrack, and all that you want in the indie-film type. I think that trend will reflect Bettie Page as a kind of sex vixen like Jayne Mansfield. But if you really looked at positions Bettie, she always looked happy. Not "you want to get with me," a contemptuous glance, or "I just do it because my acting career did not work" kind of porn stars. Thus, the home associated with this film (three women producers, women's writer / director, women co-author and an excellent Gretchen Mol, which I'm sure helped to shape this role with its own sugar content influence) really captures the idea of ​​sweet, slightly naive, southern girl who liked to be photographed with her and hoped that good ol »JC will not be too upset with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is a high performance career (it may just be the most perfect breasts ever) that I am happy because it was a curse. A few years ago, she made the cover of Vanity Fair, when no one knew who she was, touting it as the next It-girl. And let's be honest, it was a bit presumptuous. I mean, unfortunately, she did not do it the status of Gwyneth, but not because of a lack of talent. Making a few options for the poor film, if you're pretty blonde in Hollywood nonpermanent makes you forget, I'm afraid. If this does not put it back on the A-list, and I'll be a monkey's uncle. <br /> <br /> Intensely private, Bettie herself had not seen the film yet. Bettie left a movie star party on a high note, and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Regardless floats your boat honey. You were one hell of a woman. I hope you're happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Mary Harron, you made our worship of the idol of justice.
