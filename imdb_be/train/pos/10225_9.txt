I got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film, <br /> <br /> as it is obvious that those people who have criticized the film never saw him, or were stupid enough to pay to see it. <br /> <br /> the best reason to watch it on Elvira show a few years ago. Elvira make a film with so much laughter as possible. <br /> <br /> It is good Monster Flick, compared with hundreds of horrible American films made. Way better !!!!
