There are many people in our lives that we encounter only once in our lives, but for one reason or another, we remember those people for the rest of our lives. This once in a lifetime friendships are between people with large distances between and there is always some natural reasons why we do not find these people more. We do not always even know their names, because we have never introduced to each other, and sometimes we even forgot to ask their names. Funny how often humanity does casual friends, and we want to keep it as such, because it can spoil the reunion pleasant memories, or we do not know they do. We are too afraid to test it. <br /> <br /> film "Before Sunrise" just caught me looking. I'm never going to see it through, but because the discussion between the pair seemed interesting, I gave a look at the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect from him, but did the young couple. They had time to discuss with each other before sunrise and nothing could happen before they had to leave. I believe that this film had good reviews, because the situation is the fact that everyone on this planet has at least one or two times through. It makes all of us think about all the people we had met only once in our lives.
