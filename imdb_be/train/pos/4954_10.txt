Big, funny, sweet movie with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself), and who are acquainted with the Spanish girl named Scarlett (Paz Vega) in a small store while the study of the potential of independent film. I was a bit dubious about the film in the first ten minutes, but as soon as he was in the store, I really started to enjoy the film. It shows how a positive attitude can change anything. It does not contain any complicated plots and easy to follow, but will raise the sad mood and make you smile all the way without the need to finely clich√© romance. It includes a few scenes all the way through that will make you grab your sides with laughter. Very rare masterpiece!
