I have never met a single person (out of hundreds), who hated this movie. I bet that anyone who voted it down small pest, or a victim of one. This film has it all. Ask yourself: "Are you a fan of ...?" Then go to "LaputaÂ» <br /> <br /> This is not my favorite movie, but my favorite is directed by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki) In any case,.. this is one part of my five. And I've seen a lot of movies.
