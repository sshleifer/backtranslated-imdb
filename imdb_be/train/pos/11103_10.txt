"The Godfather" TV, but aside from him recognition and gangster characters, the two are not similar. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist discovers that Tony is actually part of two families - it is a loving father not so perfect husband in one family and another family he was ruthless wiseguy. After the analysis, Dr. Melfi finds that problem Tony actually originate from his mother Livia, who is believed to have borderline-personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as a protagonist; more Bracco and Marshall are not so recognized for their talent and the same performances as a psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are highly appreciated for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) played his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and quite convincingly, and it snaps into place. Chianese, the only recurring actor actually appeared in The Godfather movie, plays Uncle Tony and-and-nemesis. Many supporters also enjoy the characters, played by the pastor, Ventimiglia, Curatola, failure, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Bush. children Tony is "good", but no different (except Iler excellent performance in the third to last episode, "the second coming"); Sirico and Schirripa inconclusive and more-the-top, but the show is too strong for them to hold on to it. Even the show goes on for six seasons, he ceases to be a dull or predictable time. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
