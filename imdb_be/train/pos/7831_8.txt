German medieval saga of Fritz Lang's Die Nibelungen continues: Kriemhilds Rache (1924) .Kriemhild (Margaret Schoen) wants to avenge his murdered husband, Siegfried.Her brother too weak to bring killed, Hagen to justice.Kriemhild marries Etzel, the King of the Huns ( Rudolf Klein-Rogge) .It creates a child, and invites his brothers to party.Etzel and other Huns should Kiel Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers.We see a huge battle of life and death begins, and it sets all the space on fire.Eventually Hagen is dead, and so Kriemhild.These films deal with large themes such as revenge and immortal oh love.Sure we later saw some of the best films made of these topics, but it was one of the earliest.
