"Who loves the sun" working its way through some thorny subject with enough wit and grace to preserve the history of not only attractive, but often funny. It's been awhile since I found this touching carefully, thoroughly enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> The film is a lovely, eye image with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes. Peaceful imagery contrasts beautifully with the voltage between the very human, very imperfect, and yet very cute characters. Thanks to the excellent cast of all five major players surprisingly interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who Loves The Sun." This is a very funny film that takes a sharp look at the pain that we can cause one to one, and surprisingly difficult, but equally useful for forgiveness process.
