I knew about it, a similar program as Jackass, and I've seen one or two episodes on Freeview, and it is the same, only more extreme. Basically three Welsh guys and one crazy British guy share a love for skateboarding, and a complete disregard / masochistic pleasure of harming themselves and their health and safety. They were tears, there is pubic hair covered with pizza, jumping into nettles, naked paint balling, jokes on the little guy while difficult to sleep / snoring tricks in the workplace, for example, the army, cowboys, and many other insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, maybe, not only for themselves. Starring Matthew Prichard, who does almost nothing, Lee Deynton well as for just about anything, Dan Joyce (British one), which is hardly a lot of physical things and has OTT laughter, and Pancho (Mike Locke), which makes a lot, but most of popular for being short, fat and lazy. It was something a number in the 100 greatest funny moments. Very good!
