I do not understand why other comments focus on McConaughey. He was never a very interesting movie actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is to write and wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGee make an unusual comic duo is definitely not accumulate types. Although we can not say their characters are well developed, that does not make them any less funny. <br /> <br /> In the version I saw was on HDNet and had subtitles in Spanish dialogue, so, of course, no problem. The use of the Spanish language gives it more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underrated movie, judging by the unusually low score IMDb members gave it. I thought it was fun and interesting, and worth 7, at least. Many films spots with higher scores and make a lot of money at the box office much less interesting.
