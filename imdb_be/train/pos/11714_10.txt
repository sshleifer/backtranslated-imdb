Then you must see this film to understand the reality. After reading the book, Mrs. Duke is now in favor of those who suffer from bipolar disorder; previously labeled manic-depressive. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that in this day and age, people are still a critical analysis of other emotional problems, or those who seek psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists, and it's sad. <br /> <br /> In this film, the viewer sees the pain and suffering of Ms. Duke was to end, especially in childhood. Many of us may remember her from teenage «Patty Duke Show». She was a household name in America at age 15. <br /> <br /> You will learn about its exploitation by Ross (well played by Howard Hesseman). As she grew up in the 1950s, the stigma was in full force. Nevertheless, we see, as it moves forward in his career, but the disease gets worse. It passes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity; even marry someone whom she divorced in the next week; and it has several conflicts and hysterical children and elderly mother. All these problems have occurred before she received adequate therapy and treatment. <br /> <br /> A recent survey published by NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) says that the majority of American adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. In addition, it was revealed that one in five respondents in the survey believe that people can control their disease without medication, if they want to. (PV Magazine, Winter 2006) If you watch this movie, you will learn the real story of the talented women who can not "pull themselves up by its bootstraps" and "recover" until she is aware of his disorder, and has received appropriate treatment. Thank you, Ms. Duke, because to oppose ignorance and prejudice.
