All we encounter influences our thinking, change our ways, this little man was gone not on us. "The Eighth Day" picks up this theme (Compare «Rainmaker»). In this movie, Harry (Daniel Auteuil) businessman expert in the field of sales psychology meets Georges (Pascal Daquin), a down syndrome child on the run. Winning performances of both these actors to give the film its main force. A great opening sequence, where Georges applies his theory of the creation of the world and in the final scene we find that God created on the eighth day. There are some moments in history that are very worried about Harry. For example, George, who quite freely requires a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. This kind of scene where you laughing through your tears. I liked the scene where the Down syndrome group on a trip to an art gallery run by the bus and the gate-crash Paradis amusement park. The most humorous of all the difficulties of the scene where Harry and George convey horse float on the highway and, looking back, Georges gives the driver an obscene salute. But there are some tender scenes, and especially impressive use of close-up of hands - the hands of the feeling of the sun, wind and rain, hands reaching, hands and continuing to embrace the love and friendship. This is true of a movie that touches the heart. There's a very dynamic scenes, where Georges offers Nathalie, where Georges cradle Harry's head in his hands, where George keeps calling his dear mother, where George teaches laugh..I Harry felt a profound message in the film, that life is beautiful- very presence grass (you know he cries when you cut it?), the tree above his head, the songs of birds, small insects - strange creatures, all in nature. They are all there to be enjoyed, if we do, but lie (as Harry and Georges) to look around us and listen ...... beautiful film.
