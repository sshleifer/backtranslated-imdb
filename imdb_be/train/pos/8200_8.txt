Clint Eastwood definitely made better films than this, but this one does not bother him. Dirty Harry has attracted the attention of everyone, and if someone does not want to see the romance, there's no reason why you would not want it. He is cool, because it is dirty, big, because it kills without much thinking, perfect, because he gets shot right through the heart and a hero, because he does not care. <br /> <br /> From what I have seen in the movies, in which Eastwood acts, starring character fascinates the audience. The White Hunter Black Heart, he's crazy director, in the "line of fire" he was "Old" UN ", but" almost "unemployed with his work, that is to say that it does the job for himself, does not care a damn about his superiors, who practically send him on vacation. <br /> <br /> Based on the rape victims, the film is promising for all the "no-nonsense" film observers. The film does not have anything that comes from the central portion of it. However, what makes it a little bit inferior to the best movies Eastwood that although the character starring captivating story not as it is now too from the very beginning. this is not a film that's going to make you sit on the ground, not moving. in addition, too many people, it is much dirtier than Dirty Harry.
