The idea of ​​creation of the Beatles movie sounds doomed idea, since no production can not grasp the idea of ​​real historical Beatles. Then, perhaps, it is better not to try to recreate the past, but in order to make the illustration, it is best to work with the other Beatles material available. This is exactly what "The Birth of the Beatles" offers us a simple story is known to us without extravaganza. <br /> <br /> *** spoilers here *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that not everything is exactly as some Beatles graduates might expect. The Beatles are seen performing songs that are hardly the time were even drafted. The Beatles perform «Ask Me Why», «PS I Love You" or even "do not disturb". The Beatles-graduates must see that if Beatles on film only sang songs that they really are in Hamburg, the young audience could no longer recognize the Beatles, they have learned to know them. From this original repertoire Hamburg only «Johnny B. Goode» Stu and Sutcliffe «Love Me Tender» stored. <br /> <br /> The guys who play Beatles in this production is hardly similar to the originals, but the rest of the film is still doing a good view as the film for the rest quite accurately. The guy who plays Lennon is doing so well, and the rest of the band is not bad. Brian Epstein large, and at a time when he dismisses the Pete Best of the group, probably the most memorable scenes in the entire film. In addition, as a bonus you get to see the original Cavern club in the film.
