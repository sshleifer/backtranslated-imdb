Oddly enough, this film never made it to the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for release of the video. My expectations where high, but they where not in any way disappointed. As always with Ang Lee has a fantastic action, intelligent and immersive storyline that has you guessing until the very end and beautiful shots. Along with Unforgiven is easily one of the two best westerns in the 90s. <br /> <br /> The people who expect something along the lines of Mel Gibson in The Patriot (corny) and Braveheart (acceptable) will sour disappointed, all the others, who appreciate the quality of the above will have a fantastic time watching it. 9 of 10.
