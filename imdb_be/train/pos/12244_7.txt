As winter approaches, our public broadcaster ABC, decided for some reason to be partial Jane Austen Festival on Sunday evening. It started with a twelve-year-old film-length version of "Emma" last Sunday; Later versions of three other novels, "belief", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" in the future. <br /> <br /> Curious about this product A & E Television Networks, with a script by Andrew Davies Ever reliable, is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two very large versions of the film's budget, one in the main the role of Gwyneth Paltrow, and "Crazy", in the "modernized" version, starring Alicia Silverstone, transported for sale in Beverly Hills. Perhaps, in the end, even with Kate Beckinsale in the long run, this production fell without a trace. <br /> <br /> As a rule, much is lost when compressed novels for installing a full-length film. Adaptation of one aspires to and enjoy and remember are the ones that have enough space to develop as the story and characters. A striking example is "Brideshead Revisited," which had 13 50-minute episodes back to 1982. You only have to compare the very ordinary version of the movie length in "Pride and Prejudice" in 2005 with a brilliant six-part 1995 TV mini-series, this is not that the novel must be removed by page, and some novels (often not very good) adapts perfectly to the film ( "Atonement" is a recent example), but the novels of Jane Austen kind of need some time and space to have their full charm. <br /> <br /> Considering the disadvantages of this type of adaptation, this production is in order. Kate Beckinsale gives Emmyu right combination of confidence and weakness and Mark Strong is open Mr. Knightley (he reminded me that Jane usually processes the characters ?? Knightley is more eloquent version of surly Mr. Darcy from P & P). Samantha Morton was pretty lame but Harriet prunella balance received chatterbox Miss Bates perfectly ?? Sybil Fawlty at speed. Bernard Hepton, as weak father Emma was also excellent. We saw a wet area, dirt and poverty, as well as smart interiors, if someone thought it was a particularly idyllic age for all. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it was condensed device has been surprisingly slow in places ?? Some conversations were quite unnatural, even with the formalities of time. I have to watch the film again to be sure, but this may be due to lack of use reaction shots. <br /> <br /> If you like removed between things is quite a good example, and compares with the version Paltrow. In any case, there is yet to come!
