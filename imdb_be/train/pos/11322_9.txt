This anime seriously rocked my socks. If the anime first discovered myself, I felt that it was too slow; the story is not quite moving forward, and the general was a very impressive male role. Once he learns more about the trace, and you will learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself, the history of the pan, and you can see the diversity of his movement together. It was fantastic. <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt that the way the character is designed very precise form to how real people are developing, in the real world. There are no stupid things happen quite obvious it was; Ilya development and Rin was fun to watch, but I think that the path is wide and Saber has grown in them certain individuals was just interesting to see all of it away. Some of the "surprise" people who are (Gilgamesh?), Seemed to be unique from the rest of the cast in one form or another, that is, we did not have "the Generic teaser A" is replaced by "the Generic Bed and bully", as the just died. <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved the music. Opening music rocked, and the final topic of the final episode just ... Seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more. Good work, Type-MOON!
