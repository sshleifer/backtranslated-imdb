* Possible spoilers * Although done before (and better) in "Midnight Express" and "Return to Paradise" Brokedown Palace still strikes a chord with me. <br /> <br /> Here we have the story of two young girls, a journey through Thailand, and arrested on charges of drug trafficking. Whether it was the Danes Alice? Was Darlene Kate Beckinsale? It was a beautiful stranger, whom they met on their way? None of this really does not matter, because it is a story about friendship i trust and boundaries may be stretched up. Add Bill Pullman as the enthusiasm of the lawyer Jacqueline Kim and his Thai bride (and the best lawyer than he is), and we have a nice little story that keeps your audience's attention. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace there is nothing unusual, or infamous, for whatever reason - it is not an original concept, it does not show a sensational violence, leading to the wannabe-avant-garde crowd to talk about it is a "gritty realism" or " hard hitting truth "- it's just a good story with some great game. Bill Pullman is the weakest of gravel and lazy way to say - I was pretty bored with the character <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, while decent, nothing special .. It works well, but it is not memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim, however, is in great shape, cute and treating certain character, where there really is not much to work with. <, Br /> <br /> But make no mistake - this is a film Danes. I've long been a fan of her work, and this will not change. She is interested in every scene she appears, and it was not for her, the film is likely to tilt in a sad fare. I particularly welcome its appearance on the scene between her and her father. <br /> <br /> Darlene film also has a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
