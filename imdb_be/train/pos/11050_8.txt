Well, magic mysterious. This film is about 4 prisoners, trying to avoid using spells written another prisoner centuries ago was a wonderful occult thriller with a surprising end and a lot of uncertainty. Even if it was something in the theater game (almost everything happens in the cell), it is never boring, and it was very well acted. In the tradition of "Cube" you feel trapped with the characters, and even if they were a criminal, you have developed some sympathy with some of them, only to change his mind turns the story takes. Some incidents caught you by surprise, and there was always a touch madness in the air. In general, an intense and interesting, and how I do (one rented it) did not expect, it was a positive surprise!
