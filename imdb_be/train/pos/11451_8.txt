Very attractive documentary about the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mainly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements of nature. His work consists of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc. that gets blown away when the tide comes in the beach or the wind blows on the field. Thus, most of the work Goldsworthy does not really last, except for the pictures or movies they were. Now it can be argued that the works are the reflection of mortality Goldsworthy, or words to that effect, but not easy to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype of the artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in the old city conditions, Goldsworthy, it seems, on the contrary: a stable, unpretentious, family-oriented, a person who loves nature and the life of a small village in Scotland (of course, I'm sure it's the same reason why he shuns some of the people in the world of art, who found his work furry or surface).
