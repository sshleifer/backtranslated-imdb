This film, even if one of the favorite themes of Mexican manufacturers manufacturers: extreme life in our cities, there is a funny way to put it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the most important Mexican filmmakers of recent times, the approach of the history of our city is decorated in a variety of literary sorts, as it can be a farce or satire, which enables us to overexpose the film theme in our country, but is told a very different way, which gives a fresh tone to it. <br /> <br /> With the actors little known, but treats a nice way of their paper, each of Directors reflects in history the capacity of, we have been identified anywhere in the world, that the ability to laugh at the pain and sorrow to make a holiday. Perhaps, for many people in our country are not pleased with the film, but I think that people from other countries might find attractive and Share Mexican surrealism.
