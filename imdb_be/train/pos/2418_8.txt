One of the funniest John, Eugene Levy big in this, as well, I just want the studio will understand that this one should be on DVD, I have it on video, but I feel that this film deserves a DVD (and more will be great) Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) skit that much funny as the whole film, he is also the scene with his girlfriend and her family is more, this movie never seems to be on TV, but it loses most of its fun when edited for TV broadcasting, if you can find a video, I would suggest you buy s it (Ebay is a good place to find a copy of it), I'm not going to keep the VHS until one day we get to see it on DVD. There are so many great films out there that still have not been released on DVD, and this is one of them.
