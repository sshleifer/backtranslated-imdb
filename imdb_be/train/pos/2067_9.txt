Despite the fact that the universally recognized that Fearful Symmetry was heavily influenced by Kolchak episode, they, they, they, and he does it plagiarism or celebration is generally more controversial issue. As a huge fan of both series I subscribe to the latter belief, though less charity can not do. James Whitmore was brave enough to take on the task areas such difficult episode, invisible elephant and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster, but he pulls it off with style, badass be an absolute gem. Lance Guest is doing a great job of creating a strong character with Kyle Lang and Jack raiders bubbling ominously as Ed Meecham. Forget the dubious originality Fearful symmetry and just enjoy it as deeply satisfy X File.
