Presenting Lily Mars real nice little movie showing comedy actress Judy Garland skills along with their standard singing moments. The plot consists of Lily Mars toe after John Thornway producer for her big break. I think the comedy world and nothing too heavy here. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
