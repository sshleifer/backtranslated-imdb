Streetfight (aka Coonskin) a very unique film directed by animation pioneer Bakshi. This oddity movie, and very worth seeing. This live action mixed with animation, it would seem, the impact on the legendary Disney songs of the South, almost as if it is a response to this film. Philip Michael Thomas, who later became his partner Don Johnson in Miami, and Scatman Crothers, best known for his role in the cabin lights are refugees prison. Charles Gordon and Barry White (yes, Barry White) and Thomas are friends plan to help him avoid prison. They are stuck in a police checkpoint, and Crothers says Thomas story of black rabbit, bear and fox, which move from the south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. Animated story, and gives many wonderous things to see. Like all movies Bakshi, most will be angry and do not like animation. These lovers of animation clunkiness forgive him and love him inventiveness. The film is very strong, very sexy, and it's mostly about the battles between the races. For a long time I thought I saw something very important, but after a while, especially after I got done playing, he began to seem more like a mediocre blacksploitation Flick, along the lines of Superfly. It's very messy and does not really say anything. In addition, Bakshi is not white? Whatever the answer to this question, Coonskin / Streetfight still very much worth a look for fans of animation, as well as supporters of the cult film. 7/10.
