Although pleasant enough music, something that stuck with me about this film was an unexpected comedic chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as there were a composer and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Playing high-strung, distracted artistic type (far from his better-known roles as either threatening thieves or indifferent logical Sherlock Holmes) character Rathbone looks as if he could not find his way out of bed without assistance. And that help is Starbuck, played with his usual wonderful humor Oscar Levant. When hiring character Crosby as his ghost songwriter, Rathbone enter it in Starbuck, saying, "He does all my thinking for me." To which meets the Levant, "Oh, it's only a part-time basis," Of course, it goes. by (or on) Rathbone, who are too busy fretting about where his next hit song out of. As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone can be so funny! It is a pity that he does not have more opportunities to display his comic talent.
