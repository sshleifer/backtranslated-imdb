Another fantasy film from a country where, because of decades of oppression by fundamentalist regimes, has no problem in making the hot object. Panahi different approach this time with a mixture of ironic comedy and punished, non-professional actors. Although still get him a message that he sees as inherently wrong with his country, he does so without the need for heavy storyline. This is positive for the country, in particular, its people, the Iranian people in desperate need. The greatest pity that will not be released in the domestic market. Insular, paranoid Iranian government claims that this remarkable filmmaker only successful abroad because it is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After rising against the backdrop of revolution and observing scientists, artists and educated "disappear" during the past 25 years, he has shown great courage for to put their work out there. The realism achieved by shooting in the real world cup qualifier really takes you to the event. The fact that he shot on 35 mm surprising, since most will just try this project, using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His persistence in the use of only non-professional actors and really works in this film. Wonderful performances from all sides. After watching many films that show Iran has problems, as well as the media teach the facts, we can, as a rule, to demonize the people and the government. This film does the opposite. This shows us that they still love the same things, and that, laughing at a ridiculous and sharia rules that may change for the better is not too far away. Some call Panahi feminist filmmaker, but I think he's just fighting for the most oppressed population in Iran. Young, independent women.
