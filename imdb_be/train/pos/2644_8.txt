I do not know what it is, I believe, so endearing about this film, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield, nor war-drama, but I'm really only interested in how and when Winfield find your child. All he knows that the boy has green eyes. In truth, I have not seen this movie in years, too, has not been shown on television at the time, but this film is more of an odyssey of one man after the pain of war. Winfield shows very friendly and heart warming image of a man lost his memories. There is a basic message in this film that he is looking for the last piece of human morality in the aftermath of the war and the fact that he had to confront. Why this film is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
