This may be the second best year in the BB PPV after Wrestlemania it was a good surprise! John Cena was a great match, in which he upset Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his IC title match with a short sloppy Willam Regal. Bubba and Spike Dudley won quite a violent game tables over the Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble was a very good match with Kidman, which was surprising to me. Booker defeated The Big Show in the match No DQ, at one point gave Booker T hit Big Show scissors and sent him right through the table. The stupid decision VVYA Christian and Lance Storm, jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and the edge with a lot of help test and Jericho. RVD and Brock was the night when he was filled with large high spots and RVD should retain his IC title in the DQ, so I was happy that he retained the title. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means virtually nothing. And in the main event of Rock became the first in the history of the 7-time WWE World Champion, defeating Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a triple threat match. Overall, this is probably the second best PPV BB in 2002! 7/10
