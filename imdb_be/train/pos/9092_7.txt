I think that this film adds to the variety and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. As it shows the various communities, leaving together in Thailand is very interesting ... Portuguese, Japanese, and various community ruled by a king. Areas around the yard, as usual, a power struggle with a lot of infidelity. Wardrobe perfectly. The film is also being done locally in Thailand in sound production. Scene from Elefant as a performer is very interesting. It's fun, and I think it can also be used in schools for its historical accuracy, because it shows that the European in Asia has been the subject of local kings as very different from traditional Hollywood point of view.
