This film is color me cry in the end! I see at least 3-4 movies a week. I saw a bunch of great movies, even more crap - of them. But if the end of the scene - in this cathartic core - I came to cry! And if you did not - you have a serious problem! Archetypal story - nothing new or original. But it's really - because this kind of thing really happened, and that people do exist. Glam is not my kind of music, but I really admire all that they went through in the early '70s ... At some point, it sent me in the direction of Velvet Goldmine! Never documentary feature really works very well. But this film really meked us to believe all this ... because they do not try to do it as a path full of good concerts, these musicians who are superheroes, Groupie Girl, stupid and emotionally numb, they did not glorify drugs and Do they contribute to the restoration and redemption that comes even 20 years late ... again great movie. After all, "Leaving Las Vegas" I've never been so moved by the film.
