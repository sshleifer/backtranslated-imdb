One of the best movies out there. So, perhaps, the cinema was not the biggest, but also a great story and concept. Great for time and bright and creative ideas. Something different from the usual films and more fun. One of my favorite, and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative films. Post World War 3 and the fighting in the giant robot, the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth it. Sets are not amazing, but simple and worked on the overall look of the film. This film is very difficult to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out, because I loved him as he left. Nha mainstream film, not as anything you've ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It's a great view and a lot of fun.
