Rather .... well done, in fact - under attack by evil villains in their dens, stop the Little Big Horn style ambush, save the day through Bugling The Waterboys', works for me. British Stiff Upper lip and all that. <br /> <br /> Since he is playing on the DVD 66 years later? It struck me as both Western Apache or Sioux replaced ~ d for the Thugs and the US Cavalry for Imperial British Army. This is a very Colonial in its outlook, you know? white man's burden, and all that? Kipling, of course, would have approved. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen play as widely as possible, putting some slapstick buddy buddy in the mixture between the shooting and brawlings for good measure. (I had no idea he was Joan Fontaine, as a token army wife - they left some of her scenes on the floor of the room very briefly?) None of them were not aimed at the Oscars here - that Grant was not his best in a few scenes - but the sod, it is still running. Where else Ben Casey plants like Indian bugler? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Def. check it out if you like adventure and pseudo-Western-style antics. This was done by a bunch of pros, well, I might add. <br /> <br /> *** Outta ****
