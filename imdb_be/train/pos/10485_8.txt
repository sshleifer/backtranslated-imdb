I saw him last night on TV, and was very pleased. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that makes you feel nice and warm around the heart, and believe that there is still some good in the world (all the neighbors pretended not to see that grace does for to help her and protect her- old police my favorite), though you know that this story is not quite realistic. <br /> <br /> I loved the action (they all seemed the same as usual, ordinary people, who live in the small picturesque town of the English coast), but the biggest thing in the movie was the wit and humor he has! Just remember the scene in the store with two old ladies after they had their "tea" !! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the ending was a bit strange, but that did not stop me really, really enjoying the whole story!
