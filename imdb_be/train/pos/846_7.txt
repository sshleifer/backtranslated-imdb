Two years ago, I was watching "Matador" in the movie, and I loved everything about this film. Obviously, I was totally impressed by the excellent role in Pierce Brosan. Yesterday I caught this movie on TV again, so I looked at it a little deeper. Now I can say with some that this film is not that special, but you just have to "love him because of one person. <br /> <br /> Brosnan raises its estimate in my mind with an amazing performance of Julian Noble, a hit-weary man who has no friends. Julian soon meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, a man gets lucky: his son died in an accident, his work is not so good, and he's not sure he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis) <. br /> <br /> I've always loved movies like this; crime film with a great sense of humor. Basically, that humor comes from Brosnan, he tells jokes about dwarfs with large g .... or one of my favorite lines in the movie: "I look like a hooker in Bangkok on Sunday morning, after leaving the city, navy. "Brosnan says it is his charisma when he drinks his Margarita, as usual. I too, as a "typical American face" Greg Kinnear in the role of underdog, which made a very alive, because there are many people like Denis Wright. <br /> <br /> So I recommend you see it is quite possible the best role Brosnan ever. It will make you smile and admire at the same time. Big Brosnan in not as great movie.
