The United States is still fighting the Second World War (the film was released in the period between VE Day and VJ Day). Every studio is worth its salt, or do martial movies where fearless American soldiers beat the enemy, or Americans in general were songs and dances. Technicolor musicals that flourished in America depressing days when everything was rationed. Most musicals of the day were just a bunch of musical numbers strung with the best available plot slipped to fill the time Til the next musical number! I get the feeling now that people are reviewing this film were all born after 1970 Disappointing, how quickly we forget. <br /> <br /> This film could have called "In Search of Jose Icherbi", but now one wonders why, let me explain. Since 1929 - his arrival in the United States - until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the best pianists in concert decorate. He agreed to make several films in 1942, but Hollywood has been after him for almost ten years old at the time. Not only a great pianist, but a successful conductor, as well as, Iturbi was very nominal for more than 40 years. <br /> <br /> In the scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists to play with each Rhapsodies of Liszt was planned at an early stage - and not anyone noticed that other pianists were kids? Joe Pasternak, who produced this film & many other MGM musicals enrolled Iturbi interesting youth of America in classical music. Grayson wants to listen to Iturbi in the film was not unlike the real life at that time. Everyone wanted Iturbi then. The joke among the soldiers was that «GI» means «Get Iturbi» (he did a lot of concerts in military bases). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was a great dancer and a great singer Frank Sinatra, but at the time this film was made Sinatra was just 30 and only had a contract with Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already well known as a dancer, but Iturbi already at that time was a worldwide sensation for 20+ years. <br /> <br /> As for the lack of plot, the Americans did not need a plot. They are tired of war, they were sick with fear for their loved ones, and worry about the future. They were in need of happiness, hope and confidence that everything will work out well in the end. They need music and smiles, joy and romance. This film and others like it delivered just what was needed. <br /> <br /> Enough lecturing. Mouse dancing on the sidelines, the best scene in the movie takes place between Sinatra and Iturbi with each of them "ignorant" music compliments the other. <br /> <br /> If you have any interest in Jose Icherbi Spaniard, who won over America than De Soto, Cortes and DeLeon put together, please contact me at my website, www.joseiturbi .com, where you can find a brief description of the plot, excerpts of reviews of movies, "day" and photos of this and other MGM musicals of the 1940s, as well as biographies and discographies Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
