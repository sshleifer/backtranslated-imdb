My mom and I have only recently become addicted to this show, the laughter of our examples! I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I am disappointed that I did not pay attention to this hilarious series, before they were canceled! The storyline is very funny, the characters are really great person (or not so great, but they're still funny!). I TiVo every episode What I like about you. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all the cast, do not leave me bored while watching! There are several language inappropriate for children and some sexual content, but with parental guidance there, you should not have too many problems. There is some type of "buddy relationship that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.
