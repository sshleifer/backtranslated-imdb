The first time I saw a thief, as a child, which makes me almost as old as the jinn, I think. As any child would, I was delighted with the imagination, ingenuity and energy of the film. A few years later, I realized how much satire and wit script I missed on that first viewing. I never passed up an opportunity to watch it over the past years. In addition to the script, the production goes beyond the fantasy genre. It Korda, the narrator is at its best. If you see a thief as a child, you know that you `had a great time. If you see a thief, as an adult you know what you`ve seen a masterpiece. It`s out of time, as the story of his cure. Awesome work. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
