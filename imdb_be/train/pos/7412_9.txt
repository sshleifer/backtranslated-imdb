I love this movie! Beautifully funny and utterly believable characters. Each scene is richer and more beautiful than in the past. Every aspect of this film is full of wit and humor, love and depth. Complex and fascinating story, too. This film is filled with love, humor and intelligence. Absolutely wonderful!
