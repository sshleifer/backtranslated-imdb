This is one of my favorite comedies ever. Not wanting to put up with the sad way his hero, but taken for what it is worth, and not the banality of alcoholism, the movie just so much fun. This indicates improbable tale of drunken 40 something irresponsible bachelor named Arthur, who established a legacy of great fortune, but only if he marries Susan, chosen because the family thinks that she can do something about it . Arthur offers, but inadvertently falls in love with Linda, a waitress and a thief. <br /> <br /> perfect Dudley Moore as Arthur, the most affectionate drunk in the world whose antics minute laughter. It should be recognized that Moore Arthur and I agree with those who can not imagine any other actor in the role. piece lady too good at drawing. Liza Minnelli shines like Linda, and her on-screen Moore's great chemistry. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, a rich and more suitable for a woman chose Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this film is literally made of Sir John Gielgud, who draws sarcastic, but moral butler Arthur Hobson. Obviously, these two had great mutual affection during a long-standing employment Hobson. Hobson's best friend and supplier of unwanted comments and recommendations of Arthur. The most interesting relationship is not Arthur's romance in this film at all, but his unusual relationship with this witty and, of course, constantly disapproving servant. This is the butler you remember better long after the closing credits roll.
