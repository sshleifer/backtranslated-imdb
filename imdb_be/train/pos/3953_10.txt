I saw this movie on TV, when he came out, and never saw him again. For the life of me, I could not remember the name, and just stumbled upon it while checking the movie credits Roy Thinne in. Excellent, dark and spooky TV horror film in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm»; "Do not Be Afraid of the Dark" and "Satan's School for Girls," all is lost classics of Satan. I also think it has many parallels with the classic Clint Eastwood, «High Plains Drifter». Why do not they let these great small films, especially considering more recent garbage that fills discount DVD rack at Wal-Mart? Most of these clicks is a cult-following, so sales should not be a problem.
