If you go to this movie expecting something it is not, you will be disappointed, as with any film. This film contains what Hemingway described as "iceberg effect". On its surface a cache random videos smashed together to make a movie. If it would have been written in the book, it will be a short story, because the action in the film is very fast paced and if you really do not try to catch it, the plot study (along with some subtle foreshadowing) may very well pass you by. Definitely a movie you have to see it twice to fully appreciate. Experimental Cinematography hardly describes this film. The camera work and postproduction to add a lot of common flavor of the film, which makes it very artistic at some points, and open to interpretation on others (something better in American films in recent times). Although some parts of it can get a little rude, disgusting and too difficult for some audiences, the film never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the film, which I would have to write off as "improvement" of the needs is to choose the soundtrack. Neither film is not always well without fitting soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is appropriate, opening a little too long, and other songs of rap in the film really could be replaced by something more appropriate (hard, rough rock or psychedelic Electronica would make this film a real trip ). The flood of images and vibrant color palette ... adds another "art" aspect to it, as well as in conjunction with the events that occur throughout the film, it's not a film that you can skip any part of, and still understand. However, it also makes it much more desirable film to see, and not one you will soon get bored. 8.5 / 10
