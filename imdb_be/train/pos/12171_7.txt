I literally prepared to hate this movie, so believe me when I say that this film worth seeing. In general, history, and fun it is far-fetched, but the film has charm and grace to get them. This gag where Jason Lee believes that he has crabs, and tries not to let his boss / future father in law, and employees see him scratching himself not very smart, but he sent me into a frenzy of laughter. Few of the gags of the film is a high-brow, but they made me laugh. As I have already said that the film has charm and charm can go a long way. <br /> <br /> The characters are cute, too. I must say that I want to see more character James Brolin, as he was horn in very few scenes he was in. In addition, I admire any romantic comedy that has the courage to do the character of his wife (who is an obstacle on the graph) total witch. Character Selma Blair is unlikely to trouble, and there's never a scene where I thought to myself: "Why does he want to marry her in the first place?" Ending Hollywood-ish, but it could have been much sweeter. <br /> <br /> talented cast. I did not have a favorable opinion of the majority of the basic work of Jason Lee. I just loved it so much in a Kevin Smith movie that I could not help but feel disappointed when he saw him in the roles of these sluggish. And he never looks comfortable in these roles sluggish. Even in this film, it does not look very comfortable, but it makes my two cents and efficiently handles every scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles again proves why she is so damn cute. Of course, she is very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to pass out, but it also has a unique charm and there seems to be a good person. In other words, it shows the beauty of the inside and outside. I do not know the name of the actress, but a woman who plays a drunken grandmother cheerful. Julie Hagerty also has a small part, and it is always nice to look at, that makes me wish she received the best roles. I liked it so much in the "Airplane" and "Lost in America", it's a shame that it does not get the same opportunity to flaunt their skills. <br /> <br /> Do not be put off by the terrible trailers and even worse cash records. It's funny, charming film. Romantic comedies have become so predictable that at the moment it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet, so that always sees the good of all these bad apples. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
