The post-feminist image of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! <br /> <br /> This underrated gem of the film tells the story of Flavia, the fifteenth century woman of noble birth immured in a convent after her father's determination and actually all medieval Christian society, considering that fell Muslim soldier as a man, not a demonic figure. <br /> <br /> Or failed to accept the patriarchal authority of the monastery (clearly shown in the scene where Bishop comes among soldiers and monks) Flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself, and through butting against the whole chain of command, oppression and violence, inevitably leads to a tragic end, not only for themselves, but all around it. <br /> <br /> Billed as a piece nunsploitation is far from the truth. This is a film depiction of the violence, the consequences of patriarchal domination, the nature of the uprising and the deterioration of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> I have described it in the title of this piece, as "post-feminist", and finally beats Flavia should always be damaged, compromised and perverted men. Even the horrible end of Flavia committed by men for men (women are turning away and only the monks look without horror <br /> <br /> How much debated violence :. This is a description of the effects of violence and the horrors of the world with the mind of religious excess. In order to evade violence will have a limited impact of the film, would reduce the cost of the film and allowed it to be assimilated in the patriarchal speech exposing it. also, it is a realistic portrait of medieval society. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted (in particular, Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), containing a great score on Piovani and still is difficult after all these years Flavia is a classic of European cinema.
