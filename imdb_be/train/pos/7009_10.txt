I thought it was a great movie. It affects every fiber of human beings. Love in the film is very intense. I thought it was the best performance to date Will. Big direction. I liked editing. The music was great. Good use of flashbacks. It's kind of a movie, everyone should go see it. I hope that people will get something beautiful out of it. Overall, a great movie. I think Hollywood needs to do more films with substance. Even the action movies may have a troubled history. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in its effect. He had a purpose and dedication that is rarely seen. I would suggest to watch it alone or with someone that you really care about. For me, I discovered that the world stood still and my only focus was on film. The outside world has been put on hold for a moment. It was a good feeling with the chaos going on in this world. And with this generation I it was great to see something (someone) that care about others more than himself.
