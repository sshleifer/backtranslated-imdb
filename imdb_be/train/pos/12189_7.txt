Despite loving Rita Hayworth, finding some last sequence of the film intriguing and be able to appreciate some of the subtle "symbolic" aspects of the film, The Lady from Shanghai is not quite work for me. I had a problem with most of the performances, the script and the overall structure. And in the film that most people talk to each other in different situations, it is very problematic. The Lady from Shanghai were at a very low «C», or 7 for me. <br /> <br /> Lady from Shanghai is really all about the character of Orson Welles, Michael O'Hara. O'Hara see Elsa 'Rosalie »Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in Central Park in a carriage and goes to her. Later, he rescues her from a robbery, and it takes a shine to him. O'Hara brands from Ireland and the ubiquitous Elsa happens to have a yacht with her husband, Arthur (Everett Sloane), very famous and powerful defender of California. They say O'Hara in working for them, despite their initial reservations - it seems to him and to the audience that Elsa is just looking for someone to deal with, and O'Hara did not want to get involved. <br /> <br /> Shortly after will be working on his yacht, a wonderful man, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), who says that he is a partner of Arthur is in a port of call and begins stirring up trouble. In the end, Grisby asks O'Hara enter in a very dubious and dangerous scheme. Silly, O'Hara agrees. Naturally, she gets it in quite a bit of trouble, and in the end, a number of secrets revealed. <br /> <br /> Maybe it is a problem with the film lies in the fact that so far, I'm not a huge proponent of Orson Welles, and, behold, he produces, writes, directs and consumes most of the screen time. I have not seen anywhere near the majority of the works of HG Wells yet, but I tend to like his later films better, when he became a little more cutesy and performance arts. I like F for Fake (Vérités etc. mensonges, 1974), for example, and I even like his performance in Casino Royale (1967), when he cleverly insisted allowed to do magic tricks at the table baccarat, but Citizen Kane (1941) never much for me, despite giving him 3 or 4 chances over the years (including about a year ago, my low rating was 7 - the same as my current account for lady from Shanghai) <br / >. <br /> performance of Wells and the dialogue he wrote for himself across infected and pretentious to me. He's a little Motormouth, a little ham and a little monotonous - it usually sounds like he's reading. His performance reminded me of what I've seen version of Wells' Moby Dick (listed at the IMDb in 1999, but the "completed" in 1971, it can also be seen in Orson Welles: The One-Man Band (1995)), where he it seems to be read only to the camera, and assuming that it is inherently elevated dramatically. I'm also the one who almost never complains about the accents, but somehow Wells manages to make his Irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me too. <br /> <br /> As for the other features, I can only say that I thought Hayworth did an excellent job. Of course, she's gorgeous, that does not hurt. Lots of eye candy here. Like Wells, The Sloane also seemed a bit pretentious and affected me - I never bought his character, his handicap and so on, and Anders just wonder where the bizarre, does not seem to fit. Wells often shoots at him close-up Anders and almost always has something more exaggerated, manic look on his sweaty face. <br /> <br /> Structurally, The Lady from Shanghai is very uneven. The first 50 minutes or so, it is extremely mild and soap-opera, although the soap opera ministrations, as a rule, should be approached with sinuous oblique. After Grisby enters his own scheme, things pick up a bit and generally improve as we near the end. But by then, The Lady from Shanghai becomes a crime / movie mystery, it's too little too late, and it quickly turns into a hall of court drama in front of a sudden, exciting finale, which comes almost out of nowhere, and it is a far too fast for his relative advantage. <br /> <br /> ending is more focused on action, less heavy dialogue, more diverse and exotic settings, and sometimes quite abstract. Wells processes this combination could material as a director. If Lady from Shanghai would be largely a combination of crime / mystery of things and artistic end, it might be easy, at least 9. The final scenes easily 10s, and Wells goes on Hitchcockian suspense scene in San - Francisco Chinese Opera on the other unknown scene in a park of China entertainment. Funhouse climax uses the cinema, which was experimental for its time. It integrates well with the script, as it enables a complete solution and fuel in symbolism. <br /> <br /> The cinematography across interesting, even if it is, as a rule, can not make up for the problems in the foreground. Wells scene blocks with craftsmanship. There are many attractive options removed, from Central Park to Acapulco at various locations in San Francisco. Wells effectively creates a symbolic action prompts for him, with exaggerated height and steep drops to the Caribbean Acapulco maze of streets, as nicely decorated and silhouettes shots in San Francisco aquarium, and so on. Romance material for which the aquarium is a background, it is interesting tempered with some unease throughout the film, but on the other hand, making the romance never quite works like a novel. <br /> <br /> Of course, serious supporters appreciate Wells Lady from Shanghai is much more than I do, and it's certainly worth a look if you like Rita Hayworth. The Lady from Shanghai is not entirely terrible movie, in my opinion, but it's dangerously close to the "do not pass". Be careful.
