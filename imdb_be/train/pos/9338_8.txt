However, the idea of ​​this series may have originated from the huge success that Ally McBeal enjoys around the world, even here in Germany. Nevertheless, it says Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work beautifully together. Edel Felix (Felix Noble), played by the famous German actor Christoph M ORT and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, get it ???), played by Rebecca magic Emmanuel, sharing quickly and continuously romantic cues to spy on each other, while participating in a sitcom as criminal cases in Berlin and its surroundings. In addition, they helped a fine cast of co-stars, especially their secretary, Isabelle plays Tuengerthal, which is a rare gem with great comic potential. In addition, shadow schemers, Otto, and precious childhood friend Felix, Frank, work very well, not to forget Sandra best friend and roommate, Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> all-in-all a joy to watch Monday Nites: it is not surprising that a number of its stars and received several awards. Will Felix get Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope that we will have to wait many more episodes to find out ......
