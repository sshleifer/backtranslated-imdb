Soprano was probably the last best show in the air in 90 years. it's sad that it's over, it was the best show on HBO, if not on television, not everything has been written for you for you had to think it was brilliant. the cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is an excellent actor and has played his character perfectly, as well as others. Each character has flaws, that's what made them so real and allow viewers to communicate with them, and then for one reason it lasted so long. The last episode was good, I do not know how to take it a lot of different things that can be interpreted ending Id like to think that Tony is not dead, but the meadow came in and sat down with them, and that the blackout was only for the unknown. Tony will have to go to court and have to deal with this, I hope, entirely dead that's how I feel ... Long live Soprano Tony Soprano .......
