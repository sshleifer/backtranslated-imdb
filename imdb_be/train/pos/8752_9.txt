I expected such an original, such as this for quite some time. Brokedown Palace is that the `hard to believe" aspect, but with brilliant directing and script ?? Score big palace. <br /> <br /> I've never really liked to see Claire Danes in any of his films, but I'll tell you what, it actually changed my mind about it. Kate Beckinsale joined the Danes on holiday in Thailand, where they meet a young man who convinces them to travel to Hong Kong with him. However, he forgot to tell them that they will wear obscene amounts of drugs for him. Well, eventually they get caught and end up in jail in Thailand. I know, I know, how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can get that one tiny miscue, you will find a very well written and acted out the story. Recently, I found that more drawn into the plot a movie I watch, and developing personal feelings for the characters, which I look. This film is no different. By the end of the movie I found caring more for it than any of the other characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand, specializing in international relations. As always, Pullman provides with excellent performance and binds the film together nicely. <br /> <br /> There are a few twists and turns that will, by the end of the movie, you in tears. This is one of those films that you will most likely taken to find this film to watch at home. It is my opinion that the next time at the video store, do not pass by it once.
