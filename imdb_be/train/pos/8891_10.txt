I would agree with other comments that it was not a huge number of stories told in the film, but it's not a documentary! He had to entertain and I think he did a very good job of that. <br /> <br /> I agree with the Negro family. Scenes with them, it seemed out of place. Suddenly he will be thrown out in Russia, but I caught on the history and relationship between the families later and found it very good. <br /> <br /> Although it was not a hoax 60 years he did bring to the world is very large and important periods iconic decades. I found it very interesting and worth my time to watch.
