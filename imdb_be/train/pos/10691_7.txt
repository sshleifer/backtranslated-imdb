I caught it on a platter last night. I liked the movie. I went to Russia 3 different times (taking our 2 children). I can not put my finger on why I liked this movie, other than seeing the "bad" turn "good" and "good" include "half-bad." I liked the look of Ben Chaplin through the whole movie. Like, "I can not believe this is happening to me" is good or bad, it's the same kind (and it works). Grand Final. 7/10. Rent, or catch it on a platter, like I did.
