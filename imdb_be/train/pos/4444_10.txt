Most fans of Italian horror, seem to hate this movie, because, because it has no relation to the first two films Demons. And «Demons III» in the title, one would assume that it will. The problem lies in the fact that this film was never intended to be part of a series of demons. Distributors only "Demons III of" over its original name "Cannibal" to capitalize on the popularity of other films. New US Release DVD-image is called "Demons III: Ogre» in the field of art, but the film itself only says «The Ogre». I do not know when the last editions have the title of "Demons III» at the actual film, but this new release just seems to be a little white lie. If you can get past "Demons III of" in the title, you might have some fun in the "Ogre". It begins with a slow intro, and remains quite creep everywhere. There's no gore films and film slow, but I still unearthed. Just do not expect it to be like the other movies Demons. I give «The Ogre» 7 of 10 Italian fans should try it.
