This film contains one of the greatest performances of Richard Dreyfuss, as an actor, who plays the dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother shows no impostor. In addition, this film is funny but has a serious side as well. What is particularly intriguing about this film the character Madonna, who is the mistress of the dictator, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Evolution of the Madonna and mistress political leader abruptly added to the quality of the stories and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who at the beginning of the film struggling actor and more of a buffoon, is also being developed, and by the end of the film evokes respect. I liked this movie.
