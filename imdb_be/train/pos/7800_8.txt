I first saw this film when I was about 13. It blew me away then, and in many ways it still does now. But I'm less inclined to see him as a true piece of history right now. There is very little effort made to explore and interact with racism - and, therefore, fail to recognize that the most powerful weapon antiracism, to understand it in its very nucleus of those who commit it. What we get instead of a dichotomy - on the one hand, and the BEKO forest in 3D panoramic view of rainbows - on the other hand, two-dimensional characters are displayed as irreconcilable mindless evil <br /> <br /> All of this makes for a lot. film story, but I am concerned that people see the image as a "fine".
