While the main story should take place in Morocco, this film was shot in misty Romania in 18 days on a very limited budget. However, broken their cards can be cast and crew play them with astonishing skill and affection, so that in the end I found the result as touching and beautiful. Nikolaj Coaster-Valdano provides a tremendous performance as the bad guy. The script and direction provided some gems. If you like this film or not, however, probably depends on your take on Alexandra Staden in the title role. Other observers point out the inadequacy of the stage as Modesty Blaise. They may have a point, but I found her interpretation of the beautiful and very handy. Modesty has managed to overcome terrible odds through discipline, natural talent and courage. Staden, seems to be doing the same thing here.
