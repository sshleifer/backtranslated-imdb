Stardust Another review Guarded (originally written June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine has only just begun for this (no website yet? Wth?), So I doubt that most of you have heard about it. In fact, I did not have a (sort of). When I received the ad, I thought it was a different code name, and was really worried it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see if it does not work, so I have to enjoy 100% as a mere mortal movie-goer. It turns out that this was not the Transformers, and I knew about it way back when, as "that Neil Gaiman film. What is it? Well, in short, this Gaiman tale about a boy and a fallen star. More than that, and I would give information section, which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) to spoil your fun. If you really want to know what it is, go out and buy the book. it is rumored Gaiman may be something the writer. <br /> <br /> not knowing what can be expected so nice in the movies, when a surprise is worth it. And for this, it certainly was. this screening was "special" in that piece for it included not only the critics but also the exhibitors (they rarely have mixed screening) and the local people of science fiction / fantasy. So, you know, the expected audience, is not it? I mean, with this crowd and called stardust, I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, how sweet I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a fairy tale written by famous author in the comic bookdom. But this is not Lord of the rings. He he was not even another wannabe Lord of the rings (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than that. <br /> <br /> But, as Lord of the Rings, it was, well, the humanism of the film, which sells fantastic quality. This, of course, a romantic tale, but with generous splashes of humor. And humor is similar, which is not a farce Shrekism. It's more along the lines dramedy than comedy. Before we go any further, let's make this review a movie thing. <br /> <br /> duties, at least, good. It's always hard to say more than a science fiction movie, but I believe that significant superbly acted role. Michelle Pfieffer is not, unfortunately, one of them. She plays the villain, and it does its job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, however, he was a real jerk. That is, a great villain. Peter O'Toole, well, Peter frickin 'Toole - who amazingly. Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed too much fun for the most part. If he wanted to deliver the goods, however, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) As the main character was a wonderful surprise from a guy I never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I have always been mixed with her thoughts. It can be large, and then it may seem to miss the mark. In this case, it is the former. And it is, quite literally, the star of this film. Of course, her accent comes across here and there. And, yes, it is not as good as it could be if Coke is not on the stage. Nevertheless ... well, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The special effects are muted yet done, and the only significant where they should be. Best airship yet - sorry Potter. Direction is a relaxing and flows beautifully. The operator could be better, but not all the films in New Zealand. Everything else is top bracket. <br /> <br /> And now, when it's done ... <br /> <br /> ... writing. Oh, a letter! Neil hell. It is difficult in today's climate, to make something original and, at first, you begin to wonder. The kingdom, the dying king, the boy to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, quest (or three) - what's new? But the history of Gaiman attracts you with its surface familiarity only to blow it all in a sweet original story about a boy and his heart. And if you suspect how it will turn out, you start to wonder, in the third act, and - if you have - found themselves involved in the highest fiery confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you will find this story, this film is that all the stories have to be, but there is not too often. Fantastic and real. <br /> <br /> (I would like to talk about Septimus against Tristan, but I will not spoil it for you. For those who are reading this book, you can be sure that it is done properly.) <, br /> <br /> Those I spoke later had the same impression that I did. A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and a new {} withheld for this generation. The blank is filled in only after the film in wide release, because, well, you might expect it. You'll know when you go out, anyway. I sincerely hope that the Stardust is not lost among tentpoles. Even if that happens, it will be my pleasure to bump into the hands of all the people I know. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> Forgot to add {} to open withheld. I'm a few years late, but ... "A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new Princess Bride for this generation.Â» <br /> <br /> It may be a little lofty estimation, but I still sure years form now, there will be one and the same: "Oh, I love this movie," the answer to this question, because there is now a princess bride,
