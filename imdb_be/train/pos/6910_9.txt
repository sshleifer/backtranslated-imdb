Paul was completely ripped off by someone paramount that made Dave. It's the same story, is not it funny, though. <br /> <br /> Paul contacted me this morning about the scene were Semy Davis sang a new national anthem parador. He arrived in Brazil after a long flight from Las Vegas, three airplanes, drive to the set, and so on, he was beaten. he could barely stand, had to use a cane. he was in the trailer about the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> He was not sure he could do it. Then he saw a crowd of 6,000 extras, paid 7 bucks. He came to life, and they shot the scene within two hours. he was great, it almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a great guy, but very liberal. real talent.
