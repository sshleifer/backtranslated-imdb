I love Elvira, and not in the "I-going to a shootout on-pres-just-to-print-Jodi-receiving-partisan" way, but enough to say that I think she rocks. The film plays like a horror movie 50 just a lot more fun to look Â«leasurely stroking ankle" link to see what I mean. relay shines in Elvira film (or should that be Cassandra's) absolute charm. I have this film first saw the tender age of 8 years and I saw him contless times since then .. I really need to get the ka have to buy a copy version of the video store looks a little worse for wear. If any other film buffs want to email me about it, do not hesitate. <br /> <br /> ps even more performance from Makklorga (chastedy outcast) actress, who have never received the attention it deserves.
