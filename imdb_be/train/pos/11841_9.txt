It was a great movie with a good story. My kids (10, 7, 5 and 4) all loved this film, including himself. The music was also fantastic. No, the horse does not speak, but instead, the story is told by the Spirit. And to hear the story told by the horse's point if view was interesting. <br /> <br /> I think the title says it all, "spirit." This film really gives you a sense of home and family and friends. I would say that my 4-year-old boy and a 5 year old girl were very touched by this film, and even got so into it, they were laughing so hard, and they welcomed the spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the «Spirit» with your family, and your spirit is lifted with this touching story. Your kids will love it. I think you will too.
