How really friendly, hospitable and friendly, this unassuming old serial; I was happy, seeing the old Lugosi. He is disarmingly friendly and lively. This document is long ?? I lost ship. (The best series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good soap.) Chandu deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. It refreshes the mind. It is not stupid; foolish ones who do not get the terms on which such series of work. Chandu has an overwhelming sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. <br /> <br /> I do not giving too much ?? Chandu is a sorcerer Occidental, which is also the same name of the eastern and who also loves and defends his niece from the killers sects. <br /> <br /> Chandu has his supernatural gifts in a rather cautious and moderate. <br /> <br /> As for the pretty sexual niece, Naji, she kidnapped priest Ubasti: dirty Vindhya. Poor sexy girl actually repeatedly stolen ?? in the sarcophagus after sending sleeps with flower; nearly stolen from the boat; by fake police; Temple lemurs and his strange, macabre rituals resemble the images KING KONG ?? and barbarous mockery RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> You have to protect her as easily as making Chandu? <br /> <br /> Lugosi was like a libidinous old and very insensitive, a drunkard, and it only contributed to its performance. He is the prototype of a drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This may sound like a pretty curve Lugosi tribute ?? another biopic Burton Wood left me the impression of Lugosi and related strong sympathy for the old actor. I enjoy performances fantasy Lugosi. " <br /> <br /> This serial unfairly beat.
