Im a huge fan of M Lillard, so I ended up watching this movie. Frankly, I doubt if he was not in the movie, I would have enjoyed it as much or even watched it, but once I did watch it to understand that the story was pretty decent. Bad end, I have to say, but I saw it coming. This low-budget film, and some of the actors were not very good, but overall I rated this film 7/10. <br /> <br /> suspension wondering what Lillard really was but it was something that really interested me keeped in this film. <br /> <br /> His good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
