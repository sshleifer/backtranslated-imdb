Here's a real freak for you. It begins with another take-off on the shower scene of PSYCHO, on campus, then gets insane when several Coeds and their boyfriends Doofy south for spring break. The problem begins when they go to the murderous goon County Sheriff Dean manages. One of the college cuties wandering in the woods, the witness of the murder of the sheriff and her head shattered the open. Then it allows you to rip-off-MACON COUNTY LINE-deanship stems, trap and slaughter ineptly witnessed one after another. Tony Marsh on purpose, as an evil, happy shotgun Dean. the overall tone of the film is really disturbing. The ending is so sharp, you almost think the director ran out of film; it is also a study in despair. Shallow Grave is a must for misanthropy, and nihilistic misogynist worldwide.
