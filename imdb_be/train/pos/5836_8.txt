Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, it can not be vintage L & H, but it's not the worst of their work, both in the twentieth century Stupid ... I mean Fox. This film certainly has all the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys. But it is their serious approach and determination that makes them funny. They do not play for a laugh, like other comedians could, but they take their work and the situation is quite serious, and this is the essence of eternal humor. In this film, they are faced with some major issues that can really encounter any of us today, namely work-related stress. Firstly, we would have checked out the doctor, and he will appoint a much-needed rest and perhaps to stay on the beach. That's where surrealness comes to all this. L & H is always to take the most likely set of circumstances and exaggerate, but not to the point of being unbelievable, except maybe once in a while. It makes us laugh because we can relate to their own reason, and heavy rescue attempt. That's what makes Stan and Ollie are universal in their appeal. In this film, all these ingredients are presented in a beautifully artful and elegant slapstick way. Not them better than their earlier work, probably because it was actually the last film they made for Roach, because he wanted to reflect the "big" studio and keep creating opportunities exclusively and also wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual obligations. BIG MISTAKE! They should have all stayed together and continued for maybe five years. That the world might have missed them does not consider this as an option. See, laugh, and enjoy it as their last great performance.
