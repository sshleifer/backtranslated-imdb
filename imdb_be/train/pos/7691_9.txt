This show has become a landmark in American comedy, as it was the first sitcom to star in an all African-American cast. Unfortunately, although he was never a broad cast on British television. <br /> <br /> In the family Evans poor African-American family who lives in the tower. Dad called James, he's trying to run away from home, but his wife Florida always gets the best of him. Three children are artistic JJ, Moody Thelma and intelligent young child, Michael. Always coming to the house to gossip Florida each Willona. <br /> <br /> I watched two episodes of the show on YouTube (Black Jesus and Sex and Evans Family- only two on the spot). You may be thinking, why the English audience watched the series, which has never been shown or barely heard in their own country. The answer is as follows. In 1976, Britains first all black sitcom came out under the name «Fosters» Only two episodes were made, and now seems to have forgotten. But I watched the episode and was really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts were identical «Good Times». They were exactly the same signs, but with different names- Sam Foster was Dad, his wife Pearl Foster and three children were son (a young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. gossip each Pearl was Wilma. (Read about the Fosters, I wrote a review about that). When viewing «Good Times» are only two things annoyed me. First was the opening theme tune (awful), and secondly, was the audience's laughter. I like the audience laugh, but that someone would say a little ridiculous lines and the audience go crazy and start to clap. Also it was a very funny show. Hopefully, more episodes turn on YouTube and gives us hope that someone will release "Foster" on DVD in England <br /> <br /> The best episode :. Sex Evans Family- Series 1 Episode 6 episode of The Sex promotes it was called in the Black community. Another episode I saw, Black Jesus was the title of one episode of «The Fosters»
