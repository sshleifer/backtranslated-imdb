I watched it at the cinema with my girlfriend at the time, and I can say that I did not have a good time mainly because I did not know about Ned Kelly and his stories. <br /> <br /> But since this is a biopic, it is important to at least know what to expect from the character. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the events say true, or if it's all invented. But Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really leads me to believe it was true. I do not think he is portrayed as a redneck criminal or a thief, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a solid western type of movie tastes of each. Heath Ledger great as always and sexy charms Naomi Watts on the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this film a chance, if it is broadcast on cable. Otherwise, I do not think I could recommend it.
