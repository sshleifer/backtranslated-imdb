The first time I saw this movie in the theater at the festival of foreign film, I thought it was an intriguing, exciting, sensitive bisexual artist. So very European, so it is very Dutch! I recently rented it to the second view, and could hardly keep from laughing in this topic overworked mad writer with religious and sexual orientation persecution mania. Get a grip! This guy riders, lives at the expense of society. I suspect that the real reason why he feels these fantasies nightmares about «spiderwoman» is that his guilt feet after years of ignoring the mother's advice about getting in the car (and bed) with strangers! Not only that, he makes outrageous amount (probably TaxFree) loot to produce stories (lying guilt trip), but he was too cheap to pay for a haircut, so he pushed the owner of a beauty salon. Then he has the nerve to complain about the score! But I also suspect that the world has changed a lot since the film was made. On a serious note, it was interesting to see some of the camera, and one of the early films of Paul Verhoeven Jan de Bont in. Hmm, maybe the world has not changed so much after all?
