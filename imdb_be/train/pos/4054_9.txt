The first time I saw this film was in 1980 as a tiny guy. My dad actually wrote it on the TV. I must have watched it more than 20 times, until relatively recently released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course, I bought the DVD and looked taken aback and how the dialogue has changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the movie mood, thanks to the dialogue, it was really very dark. However, the new version, featuring Van Der Beek, and others, more comic. <br /> <br /> In other words, it's like watching the original American release Akira with this dub, before watching the remastered version with a literal translation of the Japanese. <br /> <br /> I'm in no way complaining about the story and the animation quality does not diminish, but it does raise the question of deliberate Miyazaki to lighten or darken the narrative and theme in his film .....
