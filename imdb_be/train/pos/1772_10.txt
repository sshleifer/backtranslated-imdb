what a relief to know I did not realize this program! resume by large tax. I also remember to find it intrusive and not particularly family viewing, I was 10-11 at the time I watched it. I think that for a girl that age of the attraction was very blond hair lead, and it constantly sad state. The theme has been played on the flute I remember - although I can not remember how it went. I think that the administration showed him to play - or maybe he played the flute in the program, and especially when he was bored? Maybe I'm not meant to know how it ended, or see the video or hear the melody, but at least now I know that it's not just me.
