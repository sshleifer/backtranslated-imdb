The game, as a kind of pre-runner The Great Escape about 13 years later, it is a crushing bit of British film plays it straight, no thrills and dare to do well oversupply. The first part of the film is set and the subsequent flight of our main characters, while the second part focuses on their survival while on the go, as they try to get to Sweden. The film is based on pure characters with a simple, effective and may probably carry it through dialogue, and it reaches its goals hundredfold. Quite a few small amount of uncertainty does not hold the film together is ticking, and as the story of the adventure it works fine for a period it sticks to, so thumbs up for the film, which may well be the first of its kind ?. <br /> <br /> 7/10
