World At War, perhaps the biggest documentary film of all time. Historical research is practically flawless. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about 2. The priceless historical work, which includes interviews with some of the most important and exciting figures from the war. I highly recommend it as an experience.
