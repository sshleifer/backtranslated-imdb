I was a fan of Star Trek, as long as I can remember. When they announced the planning and the premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The premiere of the enterprise is well worth the wait. It was well done with a perfect location and a great acting job done by all the characters. NX-01 Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginning of what many people have come to love. <br /> <br /> Scott Baku was just above the captain Jonathan Archer. Blalock gave the commander of the performance as the Subcommander TPol. The fact that it's just two people of this wonderful new team, which is going to take us safely in the long history of the Star. <br /> <br /> The company looks like it's going to be a good series is well worth a look, and I recommend caution.
