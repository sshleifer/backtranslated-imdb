I liked this movie. His other Yasha Raj movie that you know will look good on the screen, all the characters are always good or very good, with one exception, you know, eventually veiled to be good ... Another rules Yash Raj film with ' is that either the hero or heroine; d have only one or none of the parents. Think of all the movies .. MPK bag was not my mother, HMAPK Salman do not have parents, and the last rule is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Nat crying ... <br /> <br /> the film is also good. Its a little slow at first, but keeps you entertained. There is almost not a comedy, but it does not make you smile often enough. A small child (nephew of the hero) is well placed to deliver and very good ships. The actress is very beautiful, but shy, you do not get that in real life. this film does not have a massively big happy family who live in a big house, I have you been a good idea and allowed the film to be distinguished from other films. There will be many women who cry at the end of the film. There is not a strong message from this film, but its a good watch. If you are married (marriage), the film will remind you of what you went through. And if you will not be informed and may scare you ... <br /> <br /> In general, very good looking film. No large areas or twist, but very gentle film is very similar to the classic Bollywood.
