Nicolas Mallet failure. A bank teller, everything is going on all over the body. Then his friend, the writer, the book no one likes to have a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he was quitting. He intends to spend the rest of his life making a lot of money and sleep with lots of women. And he manages to do it. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the amount of the death (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the film, it would be a farce. There are numerous injections in marriage, politics, journalism, and ... life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant, is pretty immoral scoundrel. Romy Schneider in her most attractive. Definitely worth a look.
