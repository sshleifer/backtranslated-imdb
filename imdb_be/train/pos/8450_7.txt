Was'nt very bad for the first PPV Raw 006, but the ending was really shocking to all those present and those watching at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST match- Ric Flair VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP not a bad opener, the two can seriously put on a great match when they had more time to put on a fight. Flair wins DQ after the border slap it with MITB briefcase. 3/10 SECOND match- Trish Stratus VS. Mickey James at the WWE Championship women Not bad overlook the fact that this is the first time these Divas compete in a circle together. Miki go on a modified Chick Kick, but Trichet ducks and nails her own Chick kick to win to retain his title. 3/10 THIRD H tripled match- VS. BIG SHOW Seriously good this match was, in fact. HHH entire game focused on the Big Show in the affected arm, but Big Show is still affected. Later HHH is able to reset the Big Show nails & Pedigree for the win. 5/10 Fourth Benjamin SHELTON match- W / MOTHER VS. It was gutted {bonus} Not so bad, it was alright. After insides were down, with the referee, Benjamin's mother received a purse which had a brick {it}, and closed the insides on the head with it three times. Insides rose only will fall with a rotating strike the heel of Benjamin to defeat the great man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Five JERRY match- 'The King' Lawler VS. GREGORY HELMS sad, slow and sloppy. Both men sun really put a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a fist drop for the win. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH match- Torrie Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE Michel FIRST EVER MATCH female glove It was pretty interesting to me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice in the past to win the first match Gauntlet women. 5/10 seventh match- John Cena VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. Engle W / DAIVARI In an Elimination Chamber match for Uwe CHAMPIONSHIP It was cool the elimination chamber match. But nothing will exceed last year's Elimination Chamber, which was the best. The last three masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito turns his back to the Master and received a cigarette on it to remove it. After a few seconds Cena gets a cigarette on Carlito for the three count to win the Elimination Chamber and keep your WWE title. But his night was not over yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Shin for his victory. Vince McMahon claims that his night was not over yet, and says that Edge cashed in his Money in the Bank opportunity to challenge for the title of Sin. Edge comes out of the cast, giving suitcase to Vince and the heads of the ring as Cena has one more match to go here tonight. <br /> <br /> EIGHT match- John Cena VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR wrestling CHAMPIONSHIP {Ce, which burst open during the match Chamber} gets pounded from the edge, then the edge of nails Spear on Cena, is on the cover, and to his surprise Cena breaks. Border nails still Spear & covers for the three count shocking as he beat Cena and won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 Since last year's New Year's Revolution was better than this year, but it was still good. EU's match was also good and shocking edge of cashing in his MITB opportunity is certainly the most shockingest on the PPV show <br /> <br /> In general :. I'll give it a 7/10 & C
