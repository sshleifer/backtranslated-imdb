Another Spanish film about the 1936 civil war. This time, we talked about the history of Carol (played by beautiful newcomer Clara Lago), a little girl who comes to live in the small Spanish village of New York. It initiates such a trip, and she soon finds the injustice of the human race, their foolish fights and conflicts, their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes his best film since "Few days" (1994) with a sober pulse, beautiful photography and a good script. He tries not to take part in the conflict, it just shows us some facts and let's face (well, the facts clearly enough to make us decide which group we are), and it takes great advantage of presence and freshness of a young couple in a leading role : Clara Lago and Juan Jos√© Ballesta <br /> <br /> and cared production <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 ..
