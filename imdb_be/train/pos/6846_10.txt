The film gets its seal of approval. The scene in the museum's requirements, operating without dialogue. This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in movie history. Dickinson character Kate is very well developed, and its performance is felt throughout the film. The best work of Angie Dickinson did so Point Blank!
