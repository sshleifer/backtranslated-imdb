Firstly, I do not like almost all of Neil Simon movie. But there is something about it that is unique, that attracts me, and I would like to say that this is one of the most interesting comedies I have ever seen. The second time I watched it, the connection was clear. If Neil Simon meets my grandparents? <br /> <br /> Oh, I'm afraid they can sue him to change them on the people. And how sad it would be if they were just housewives, show business stars more fun. Well, it is a personal examination, and my grandmother still lives at the age of 97 (she even survived a great incarnation of her Matthau!) Will deny it - but some of you need to find resonance in these symbols <br /> <br /. > Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but for some reason he was one of the best supporting performances I can remember (and my late grandmother even liked it, though not able to recognize the outstanding features of it together with the characters in the movie). <, Br /> <br /> It is very ethnic flavor, and over the top, you will either laugh, laugh or off. For me, the pleasure linger.
