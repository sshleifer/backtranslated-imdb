A wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse had just published his first novel, and feeling down about his profession, feeling that it was hopeless to help their patients. Young customer gambling addict asks her to help him pay off his debts, if he really wants to help him get better. Here she is tied with Joe Mantegna. To reveal more of the plot would spoil the fun as hell, and the movie "House of Games" may very well be the best con film that I've seen. David Mamet wrote and this gem, which is full of instant dialogue, great sharpness and enough twists to keep you guessing Sesame end. Kraus ideal uptight psychiatrist in need of changes and Mantegna top of it as diabolical cunning swindler. And except for a match in the last quarter of the film, the film is in full control of his audience; and we love the game. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
