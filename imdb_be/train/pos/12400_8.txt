This is the second Animatrix short, and the first of them will be what might be called "art." It contains a lot of references, metaphors and symbols in a dense amount of material, especially with a duration of 9 minutes. I've heard some complaints that it "anti-people", or trying to direct hatred for the man, for his "sins against the machine." I do not think it's true; it just uses the robot to show us that as humans, we are not particularly given the open nature or in relation to any other than himself. I would say that it does a great job of that. The plot is good ... he is playing as a historical document, listing, which led to one of the major conflicts in the trilogy. Thus, it has clips from the fictional news and the like. Voice acting is very good, if there is not a lot. Animation is good, and the use of color, although usually realistic drawing style, making it more open, to make smooth transitions and other surreal images. It has a few bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals, as well as a little nakedness. The disc has a comment, but not in English but subtitled, and worth listening to / reading. There is also well done and informative decision based on the two parts, so I would advise him to look after viewing the next as well. I recommend this to anyone who likes to sample the universe, and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
