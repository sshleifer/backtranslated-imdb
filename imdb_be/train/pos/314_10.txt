This show is a great history story. It has everything from slavery, they were treated, religion, the way Jews were sent into hiding, the Inquisition, the belief in the African Orisha gods, how women were treated, including daughters. Even to the extent of homosexuality. The way the characters are intertwined, and Violante, the character is upsetting me. She so desperately to be loved, she destroys everything around her.I I'm so glad that they decided to re-release it in the storage vessel again. Although I'd like to see the unedited version. Xica became my heroine. I look at the way she uses her power to help all who seek it. I love all the characters and found that they can relate to many of the people currently in this century. I look forward to every night Xica. It would be great to rewrite it in English, so that Americans can love her, too.
