Two things haunt you for L'Intrus (The Intruder): Who is the offender and his movie or dream that you are watching? The ending is so shocking that at some time you are at a loss to answer any of these questions. The intruder emerges in different characters, different people in different circumstances, which do not belong in the scene, so they are excluded from it, gently or harshly, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a despicable man. He has a rough way, some average work and no heart. He needs one and go for it. He has a heart transplant, and then decides to start a new life. Could this person be successful in his quest for redemption? A guy like that can cut the throat with drop of a hat. You know it, but Claire Denis does not call you to judge him. Sometimes, there is a young Russian woman -a beautiful girl who seems to be living somewhere between heaven and earth - who judge him. It may even punish him. But Denis. There's also a character played by BÃ©atrice Dalle, who does not want anything to do with it: do not touch me, she says. But Denis allows that person to be himself, his films in search of contemplation. I do not know what she films the heart or mind, but it is not the traditional foundations of the plot. Whatever she films, you get it in the end. You know who, "" an attacker, you know, for some reason, more or less, and some scenes are returned to mind with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
