The tweedy professor-type thought they knew everything. Today, the peoples inhabiting Polynesia originated from migratory Asians, fearlessly moving to the Far East, island to island, to the east, in Tahiti and all the other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific for thousands of years. But the established thinking just does not sit well with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation were true, then how can some people were born and raised in the islands tradition, art, and physical features which resemble not those from Asia, but South America? As vegetation, Ecuador, Peru and Chile looks just like what you'll find on the island thousands of miles? Is it just a coincidence that the natives point to the sea in the direction of South America and say that this is where their ancestors came, led by Tiki, their equivalent of Adam? At the same time, as the Norwegians say Scandinavian predecessors, who were expelled from the American continent, they colonized, and, together with some of the indigenous people, they became friends and went to the sea - to the west? It is too much to be a coincidence to Heyerdahl. With a strange amount of courage, a handful of crew members as well as local know-how for the construction of a traditional raft expedition begins. This is as much as a trip to the human imagination, as a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey possible only with the basics and tools of navigation. Oscar-winning documentary can be dated in tone and Anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it takes off from the adventurous spirit of surpassing even the space program, which began a decade later, when people are willing to risk everything in order to test the theory, they believe it is true. Excellent. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. This is a strange place turner and the perfect setting for a film newsreel style.
