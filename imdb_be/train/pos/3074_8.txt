I recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable. It took me by surprise, though, I would have expected from the team involved in this film. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directed this film with a sure hand, and it shows. Always the question is asked about the secret life of the victims of murderers. No need to go too far, to understand that they are likely on their own neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends; they are no different from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, the grandfather, is a despicable character who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone at a reasonable price. He has no pedantry in learning the ropes to his son, and even to his grandson! <br /> <br /> Alex, a person living in fear. He knows what he has done in the past, and suddenly comes to realize the consequences of their actions. He needs to see someone to help him find peace with himself. In the transition to Dr. Park, he tries to find indulgence, even though he does not find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic turn when Alex learns that someone has to kill on. <br /> <br /> Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William H. Mays, hypnotizes us. Not only that, he is a fantastic actor, but it makes us believe that he is a man. One of the best things in the film of the late John Ritter. He was so convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who unravels the mystery. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as the perfect grandfather. He is a natural actor in everything that he does. Neve Campbell surprised in its central role of Sarah. It shows the ability and range, incredible. Tracey Ullman, Martha, suffering wife, and she does not get to do much. Also, Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, this grandmother from hell. David Dorfman, is a delight in the film. It shows the maturity of his years. <br /> <br />
