I loved him as a fan of the original series, I always wondered what would be the background - it did not fail to please me. I also love the fact that in addition to Eric Stoltz, I did not know a single person - it is refreshing, as well as BSG. He introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - can not wait to start the series airing. Well done by Ronald D. Moore and the team - great job. Special effects, dialogue and action were in place, and I felt emotionally connected to the storyline. I know that there are purists out there will probably disagree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica is far superior to most of the Sci-Fi material produced in the last decade.
