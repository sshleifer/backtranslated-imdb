Seeing as the average voice was quite low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was "just ok", I did not have many expectations by renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But in spite of the above, I liked it a lot. It's a magical movie. This should not grow on me, I liked it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the main character, I think, that are somewhat different from the ordinary person in his films. <br /> <br /> There's not a lot of jokes knock-out or something like that, but there are some pretty funny scenes, and overall it is very nice and very easy to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> highly recommended.
