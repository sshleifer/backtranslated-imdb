When I was young, I saw very few films. My parents in all their wisdom is rented. I was very careful that the film was about, in fact I was not even allowed to watch it. My brother and sister have, of course, and that made me very angry. So what do I do? Late at night I smashed a VCR! Kicked out of the TV screen and called the police and reported the vandals. I was arrested, of course, I could not get my foot off the TV before the police arrived. I only gave the food talks and sent home. My parents grounded me, of course, and made me work to pay off the debt for the TV and VCR. It tore me apart, slave labor really sucks, believe me, but I had to do it. Chores around the house all. What happened in the end? We got a big screen TV, DVD-player and a surround sound system for my work. How do I get the money? Easily I made films on their own, and sold them to Disney! You remember Finding NENO? I wrote that the film is shot and my gold fish in their aquariums! They rewrote the story, of course, and did it in CGI, because they could not afford to do that in real life action picture, as I did! In the end, I have never seen the film heads that do not die, and the rating I gave it my rating life! It is doing very well!
