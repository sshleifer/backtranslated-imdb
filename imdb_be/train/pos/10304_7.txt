"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds extremely silly, especially of the trailers. However, I found in him a deep sense that actually made me like this film more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and given divine powers from him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man here symbolizes God, and although it is not his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does fine with the fact that he was given to work with. Although raw then, the film is really a lot of laughs from Bruce parting soup half as the Red Sea and the customer response to it, as well as Freeman seemingly laid-back time and astute way of God. He is overly exaggerated at times, and there are some crude humor, but in general it is possible to be a little ridiculous. There is a decent supporting cast such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carell, which always helps. The end of the film is very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear that we have to do what God has called us to do, and to be "a miracle." The film is far from perfect, but still nice, and much better than I, and many people are likely to be expected, especially when we see the deeper meaning of the film. <br /> <br /> *** s ** **
