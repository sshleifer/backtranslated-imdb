Sweet-natured young mountain man with a sad past (Thomas Henry) arrives at an abandoned baby girl in the woods and immediately falls in love with her. The elders of the city in general support it in maintaining the child, although the local seductress (Cara Seymour) thinks little of the new family. The resolute little girl for a long walk and a sinister salesman (Strathairn in his terrible) have parallel stories that converge in the fatal path. This divine life piece-of-the Ozarks in the same vein as «Where The Lillies Bloom» and "Puppeteer". All three were shot on location in these picturesque hills and covers the life of simplicity of life - but not simple-minded - the American people. At least strong language and brief but pointed violence makes it pretty safe family viewing.
