One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I see it for a long time on network or cable television. Watching the show was like taking a breath of fresh air on the background of the TV schedule, filled with reality shows and boring repetitive runs. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I had my doubts. In the end, the critics were almost unanimous cry foul and dropping show. But if over half an hour (by the way, thank you, NBC, to run the show without commercials), I was left with a feeling of instant love, love at first sight, true love that one feels in the gut, Everything about this show screamed EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> The graphics in this show was at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek. No small feat, considering the movies were not needed years to develop. <br /> <br /> Cast was amazing. I'm partial to the voice of John Goodman, but the rest of the team, of course, were on a par with John. Special mention: Lisa Kudrow guest appearance. She was on top of the game, creating a neurotic, plump and attractive panda Jewish stripe in it. (Panda from Brooklyn? Only in this show.) <br /> <br /> The script was funny, with a large number of domestic and adult jokes that were sharp, but not sticky. Note to all parents: it is not for children. This show is never advertised as such and there is a reason why it is set for 9PM, Sun 8PM. So if you want to complain about the "undesirable context", save your breath. Adults deserve comedy made just for them, and my Father is the Pride. <br /> <br /> It was not all perfect. I was a little confused by Siegfried and Roy characters. Do I feel "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are bright. Yes, they speak with a German accent. But this is yesterday's news. Give us something new, something new, something funny. Collect old tricks in the new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of the show wanted to use the "star" that these guys. That's fine with me. But, please, do not dwell on something everyone already knows by heart. Let us hope that the rest of the show will not play the same old record again and again. <br /> <br /> In general, the show is definitely a must-see TV. Funny, witty, with a few unexpected twists here and there - there was not a comedy it is a good thing, since Seinfeld. I'm certainly looking forward to the next episode.
