Jessica Alba and Max original Cindy Valerie Rae Miller shines in this actionpacked atmospheric series. Amazing politically incorrect. Quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but overall the standard is high, and if it is not, Jessica is always worth a look. City jivetalking afroamerican Valerie is occationally almost dragging Dark Angel in the territory of a sitcom.
