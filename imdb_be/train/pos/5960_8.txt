It's great to see George Fox in roles where she gets to smile a lot. Also I loved to hear her sing. Nice change to see her out of her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was interesting, but seemed to miss some explanation in much detail. Some of the characters seemed to be unhappy one minute and happy there, and it is left up to your imagination to figure out why. Each character was quirky, although in some cases, I could not wait to see what they will do next, or to hear what they will say next. This film was not full of squeaky clean people, but it is difficult to realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them, and then find a way to fix them.
