I loved the Long Way Round and was not even aware of the Dakar race, until I saw on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a little "hmm it will be as good," the first episode, I decided that it was. Charley Boorman was a big as the other crew members. Great to see it with Evan again. There was a fair bit of language in it, but it does not bother me. As for them not to be no mention of this on the packaging. What more to do with the silly Excempt from that of the evidence that the BBFC is. They had to give him 15 for only one language only. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the series, I want more !!
