It's pretty simple, is not very active, but very charming film. There were moments when I can see why Cher won an Oscar for Best Actress, but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close Fatal Attraction to win. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe winning and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with low labor wages, which had just asked Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), to marry him. He promises her that he'll be back in a month, because his mother was ill, so she had in mind while needs to get as much of his family as possible to attend the wedding as possible. Only problem is, when it is one-armless brother Johnny Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), they begin to have a relationship, and love goes to the scene of the moon (where the name comes from). Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as the Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. He does not end marriage to Johnny and Loretti, but she and Ronnie were happy together. He won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay written directly on the screen, and he was nominated for best director at Zhuison (In the middle of the night) and the best film, he was nominated for BAFTAs for best indicator for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and he was nominated for a Golden globe for best Picture - comedy / musical and best screenplay. It was number 96 in the 100 years, 100 Quotes ( Â«Snap out of it!"), It was the number of 17 100 years, 100 of flour, and it was number 41 in 100 years, 100 Laughs. Very good!
