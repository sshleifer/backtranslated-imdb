I paid him the pictures that try something else. Many films just seem like a re-tread of old ideas, so it's a big reason why I strongly recommend a passport in Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The film is set only after 2 and a deficit after the war and rationing, seem to be behind the wheel of Londoners "yeast". The film focuses on a tiny area in London called Pimlico. They are also the patient is not able to buy what they want, but do not see any way out of it. That is, until they accidentally stumble on a hidden treasure and the charter, which is officially named the area as a sovereign state, many hundreds of years ago! With this document, they reason, they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live as well as they want to, because it turns out that they really are not British citizens! If the movie is out and how the crisis will ultimately decide what you need to see for yourself. Leave it brilliant minds Ealing Studios, to come up with this gem!
