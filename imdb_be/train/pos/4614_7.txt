This film is funny! This is exactly what I like about this piece «Guilty Pleasure». It is easy to condemn the film for not including Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year, and do the math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick has long outgrown them apart! Time does that for young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who once again appreciate its role Lily pushed Big 6-0 (although it still looked good and still is the ideal «Lili»). <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Yvonne De Carlo did not get most of it. Nevertheless, it was nice to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the role that made them so famous! During the 2 seasons that Munsters was in prime time, it was Guinea chemistry / Lewis, who made this series such a success. The rest of the cast had to maintain an actor, not to say that they were not needed. They were! The series did not survive as long as it did without them. Given a choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the best choice of Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> While this film does not measure up to the original series, it still measures a beautiful and one of the best «reunuin» TV events suffering boob-tube in the late 1970s / early 1980s. <br /> <br /> "
