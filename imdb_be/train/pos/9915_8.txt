I did not have much. I flew to Vancouver. I probably would have missed this film if I did not choose Air Canada. Viewed on a small screen in front of the rear seat, I found this a fascinating and bewitching. I drift in several places and had to skip back, but I had to look at this is the end. Now I'm looking forward to the DVD release in Europe, although if I'll be just freezes when I walk out the door, yet to be discovered! <br /> <br /> Photographic composition is stunning, and the film gives so much insight and "fills" history of photography to tell. <br /> <br /> It is recommended (if you have time on your hands).
