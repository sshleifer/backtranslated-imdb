This is what I wrote to some friends before: <br /> <br /> Holy crap, this discontent, honestly, one of the worst films I have ever seen! I either get a very soft in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost images do push ** job! (Can not wait for The Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared, sitting in a dark theater and wanted me to be someone, someone sitting next to me (except for the main character in the Grudge. I saw the movie I am.) I swear there was a lot a lot of scenes of jumping, which are not expected! I felt stupid, but my nerves are not all the same! I was on edge the whole movie, from the opening credits and the music was fantastic scary. I keep thinking about the sound, though, and I do not like! <br /> <br /> I actually gasped out loud several times, and cried out, "O" on stage !! Oh, yes, I even half-closed his eyes a few times! Word to the wise, though: I thought that some of the scenes were a little psychosis. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought that the person who wrote it was painful and crazy, but I do not remember a film so I can not compare. <br /> <br /> I can not say that "liked" this movie b / c I was terrified, but it was very good and scary. The end of the scene, too ... Wow! During that 32-year-Mom, I think I might have nightmares of this film, especially because of this sound. Please get out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In general, it's not a slasher film, as I grew up (Jason, Freddie). This is the most because of the time a terrible film. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> The two large trailers for this film were Boogeyman 2 and the ring !!
