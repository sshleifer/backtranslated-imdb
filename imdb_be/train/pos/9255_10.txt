If you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor, then you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why anyone would not enjoy it. Take it for what it is: a car for Dennis Hopper, to mess with your head and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's well done. Ericka Eleniak absolutely beautiful and holds its own in this one - better than any episode of Malibu - and shows knack for subtle humor. It is a pity that she did not have many opportunities to expand on this. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger within its role as a "real fleet" fine and William McNamara does a solid job as a pickpocket. <br /> <br /> Throw in the shower on Hopper in the middle of the pursuit of "the cherry on this SundaeÂ» and you have a movie that held my attention and kept me laughing. I bought this as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain-candy.
