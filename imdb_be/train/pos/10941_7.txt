The thought of Sarah Silverman with her own show bothers me first. Movies she appeared in a not very funny, and her sense of humor is a little off. However, I was very surprised to see her true colors shine in the Comedy Central stone. I could put it on a par with such Um Sedaris in Strangers with Candy - Sarah's character is a true psychopath, very comparable to Sedaris' Jerri Blank <br /> <br /> One drop of this show is it. support cast. the nature of her sister's good; It's funny sometimes, but in the end, does not mean to steal the show Sarah. However, the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison. <br /> <br /> I am pleased, however, that Comedy Central gave Sarah a chance to show their unique and crazy mood and humor.
