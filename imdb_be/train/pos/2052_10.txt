I do not have much to add to my resume, this film takes a right up there with the Top Gun, as one of the funniest movies ever made while trying not to be. For example, I do not think that should be taken seriously, when viewed as a very pleasant one. <br /> <br /> I do not think that it brings down the reputation of Christopher Walken or how his reputation was at the end when all the same, took Pulp Fiction to awaken him from sleep, he was. As for Michael Ironside, he was in some of the big funny, instead of trying to be serious movies. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is weird, the budget was this film. The stage and the actors and explosions, etc. very strange, because obviously someone liked it quite a lot, and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever he or she is, I love them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If anyone reading this looking for information about McBain (and I seriously doubt that there will be too much) just know that this is a hilarious movie, and to be regarded with a smile on his face!
