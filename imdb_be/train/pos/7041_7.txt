. WAR, INC (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergei Trifunovic, Lubomir What, Ned Bellamy (voice: Montel Williams) <br /> <br / > hit-and-miss-21 "Streynzhlav" <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? who co-wrote the script with Marc liner and Jeremy Paykzer ?? stars as the tormented hits a man named Mark Hauser, who was burned, but decides to follow through on one final assignment on the icing attendant Middle Eastern oil by the name of Omar Sharif (yes, no, that Omar Sharif, but you get the tone here from this misfiring for laughter) requisitioned the former US Vice-President (Aykroyd, Cusack old «Grosse Pointe Blank» co-Horthy, making an average of Dick Cheney Manque refer here), enlisting the brand, to do business under the guise of producer trade mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for a private American corporation Tamerl on (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> While the future informed Mark faces a moment of clarity, when he comes across a fearless journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> At the same time Tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely alliance of Eastern European teen sensation Yonica Babyyeah (odd decent Duff imitating his own celebrity to tongue- across the cheek) and the idiot son of the country's leader. <, Br /> <br /> below bold attempt for the 21st century, the black comedy a la «DR. Streynzhlav ", but for all intense and purposes is, unfortunately more misses than hits in this vast attempt to laughter among political posts (unjust war being transferred to American capitalism, check!) <br /> <br /> At the while Cusack riff on his Martin Blank of the above "point" he does add some nice touches his man in black (it is to take an arrow Tabasco sauce dull), the rest of the cast plays catch up (except for sister Joan, who revolt as the excitable aide- de-camp to Hauser and it has one of the funniest laugh-out movie line, "mass communication skills has finally paid off"), for the most part <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the war in Iraq at the beginning of this year, 180 degrees different "Grace Is Gone." and then he allows his political views to wear on his sleeve; while a great overall pace and rhythm of the film eliminated largely due to the first-time director Joshua Seftel makes his directorial debut here (and it shows) for may well choreographed fight Hauser is involved with the environment idiotic groom Babyyeah, except. <, Br /> <br /> good attempt to mislead another failure; maybe next time Cusack would not try so hard and let the idiocy of war speak for themselves, instead of having to do the hard work themselves.
