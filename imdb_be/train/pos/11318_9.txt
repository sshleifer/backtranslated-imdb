This haunting, powerful Italian adaptation of the novel by James M. Cain The Postman Always Rings Twice director Luchino Visconti large. What is so interesting about the film is that in all respects it is superior is the source material to become something more bold and original (I wonder Camus also credits the novel Cain as a key inspiration for his landmark novel The Stranger). The film has a lot of power and intensity than the novel, because Visconti is able to create the cinematic equivalent of the narrative structure of Cain, but offers a more complex study of gender. very American novel Cain also uncritical captured white building (the main character of Kara is a manic fear that it will be identified as Mexican and embarrassed that she married a Greek immigrant) who has no relation to the Italian rural communication that works Visconti . This allows the class antagonisms in the spotlight, and dance among embers hot, condemned the love story of the two protagonists. This film is a complex, disturbing, rewarding experience.
