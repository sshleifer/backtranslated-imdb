Made in 1946 and released in 1948, Lady and Shanghai was one of the greatest films made by Wells after returning from a relative reference to the creation of Citizen Kane. Dark, brooding and expressing some early paranoia of the Cold War, this film stands tall as a crime movie film noir. The cinematography of the film is filled with distinctive quirks Wells odd angles, quick cuts, long pots and sinister lighting. Using ambient street music is the predecessor of the incredible long opening shot in Touch of Evil, and a mysterious Chinese characters and sequences in Chinatown can only be seen as an inspiration in many ways, Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, this obsession with technical Wells filmmaking, which damages the film in its entirety. The plot of the story is often lost during the confusion of the film incomprehensible methods. <br /> <br /> However, despite this criticism, history, combined with excellent performances Wells, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) make this film a joy to watch. Orson Welles takes not only an Irish accent, but tattered identity as an honest but dangerous brands. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Wells at the time, broke with its usual role as a goddess of sex and take on the role of real depth and contradictions. Finally, Glenn Anders strange and bizarre image or law partner Elsa's husband is not nothing but a classic!
