MOON Man in a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a family farm in the 1950s. The main plot follows the 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon), who develops a crush on the 17-year-old neighbor's (Jason London), who ends up falling her older sister (Emily the Warfield) and how unexpected tragedy changes the dynamics of the family forever. In the 1950s, lovingly called here and the script gives you the characters that you have come to take care of almost immediately. Witherspoon is already beginning to show the Oscar-winning talent, she will develop this early role and London makes the magic leading man. Warfield gives a quiet maturity of the role of elder sister, which is effective as well. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who play the parents of girls and Gail Strickland, who plays the mother in London. I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that evokes strong emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the phrase "family ties".
