Known for introducing the world to Hedy Lamarr and full nudity, but it's oh so much more. In fact, this is one of cinematic poetry vertices there with some of the most significant works of the 1930s feature films, in the same prestigious group as under the roofs of Paris, Taboo, Olympia, and even L'Atalante. It is almost silent, relying mainly on its beautiful images, as well as its fantastic, symphonic score by Giuseppe Beccia. It is a masterpiece of cinema and music, yes, as well as editing, writing direction, and acting. A good 90% of the film moves at all. Machat√Ω seems an expert in the use of motifs. Perhaps not so subtly, as it could be, and perhaps a little overwhelmed, but the appearance of objects, such as insects, fires, and horses to carry the story forward nicely. Small scraps of dialogue, thankfully unobtrusive. They are not bothered as much as one could imagine. The last bit odd, that at least. Reminds Russian Silents, we have a working installation. It hardly makes sense in the course of the narrative, but it is so beautifully done that I refuse to dwell too much on this problem. Ekstazte film that desperately needs a rediscovery. He is one of the best films ever made.
