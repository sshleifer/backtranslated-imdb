The first film ever made. Working with a jet plant, some cycling, walking most moving left or right. Along with Méliès then Lumiere is a starting point and a point for the movie - Melies begin narrative fiction movies, science fiction, artificiality catcher; Lumieres with clean, unadorned, observation. True. There are many intellectuals who regret the movie ossification of the latter in the tired formulas of the first. <br /> <br /> But consider this short again. There's nothing "fair" about it. The film is full of action - static, brutal scene burst into life, activities, quiet and harmony of the frame broken, decentered from the back to the right or to the left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera). Yet the camera is stationary, contains energy, possible sabotage, subordinate it to his will. Cinematograph can be revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes. - to outline the world, to change it, restrict it, limit it <br /> <br /> worse than the historical reality of the film. These factory workers are employed by the Lumiere. Bosses spy on their workers, unseen eyes regarding his faceless minions. Therefore, the film describes the two types of detention. Outside the gates, the workers are limited in their workplace. The opening of the gate, it seems the image of freedom, escape, but they are faced with another wall, the fourth wall, further limiting them. The first film is also the first example of video surveillance, image of the invisible, all-seeing power grabbing his servant. Frightening, too prophetic film.
