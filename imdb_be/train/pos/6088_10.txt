The scenario is more suitable for 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they still make it work! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with another soft scenario, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most of the people on board, it seems, really hate this movie. I personally can not see how this could be, but Envy is just one of those movie that you either love it or hate it. Just as Napoleon Dynamite and each Leslie Nielsen movie ever made. You either think this is one of the worst movies ever made, and one of the funniest. Do not avoid this film from the reviews. Watch it and see if you are one of those who really love it! If yes, then I guarantee you that it's worth your money. If you do not like it ... well, now you know.
