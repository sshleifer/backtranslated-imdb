I loved this masterpiece and completely honest, I also found a Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Van Dyke) to be stupid and sacrine-sweet. Angela Lansbury plays his character to perfection, and I do not know why people think that this film is distorted. It was magical, and it was very fun to watch. Each scene is held a certain charm, as you should know that the characters better. You really see how this little thrown together family learn to communicate with each other, despite their age differences. I thought that the characters were well developed, especially Charles, who was in the "Age of no faith." Mary Poppins may be more popular and cherished by others, but this little gem is one that I will always love and cherish.
