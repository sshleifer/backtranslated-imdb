Back in the 74 Eric Monte I made the classic T.V show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite, and I love to watch reruns on Earth T.V. Jimmy Walker always seemed a star and Esther Rolle. John Amos most of the time felt a little jealous of the popularity of Jimmy Walker winning millions of fans just to sit and watch the good times. The show would have been dead if JJ would't was there to keep it always Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when he went out, and 8, when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979 he had gone more than in 1980, when I was growing up.
