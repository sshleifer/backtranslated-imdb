The first thing I thought after watching «Mystery Men» was how the film can be so unpopular? I found this film so adorable and funny, that this state, like a bomb defies logic. Well, I hope that it will become a cult classic in the future, and you can count on me is amoung fans. <br /> <br /> In short, and without giving too much, the film makes for a comic book, which is "The Princess Bride" made for fairy tales and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" made for classic cartoons. This should give you a clearer idea of ​​the tone of the film, the Marketing Committee, unfortunately, has signed a contract with (this is one of those cases, as the "Iron Giant", where the studio had no idea what he had on this hand) . Rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little unusual. You will not listen to BeeGees in the same light ever again.
