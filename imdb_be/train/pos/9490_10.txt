The first time I saw this film was in the eighties, but now this review thriller is still relevant. Some of the new movies are focused on similar topics, but they do not agree with this French milestone <br /> <br /> But the president. - obviously, JF Kennedy - gets a shot at an open car during a public performance. As a result, a huge study finds "Lee Harvey Oswald" figure guilty of this film, but one member of the jury insisted on further investigation. It shows some amazing evidence ... <br /> <br /> In contrast, Oliver Stone's JFK - a film with the same story - this one does not play with emotions, but is concentrated in a fascinating description of the plot and how everything fits together, painting a new picture murder. Even the real psychological experiment used this description of the crime. Compared with JFK this film is more reasonable, intelligent and exciting. Parts of the plot can be found in a large number of new films, I was a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Â«I ... Comme Icarus", "must see". Its unique and colorful, and the music of Ennio Morricone fine. This film deserves a very good rating when it was a Hollywood production would be precisely known. <br /> <br />
