Not many reviews so thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> Do not go for another review! It was a great movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the very few Indian directors who can really put together a very good film. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay gave another example of a great acting, as it does bhoomika well that was a little unexpected, but cool to watch. <br /> <br /> Marvel was a lot of hype around the release. <br /> <br /> Or Filmfare / other awards nomination, considering how good the film was. <br /> <br /> Better then Khakee, I thought, and I thought that Khakkee also was a good movie. <br /> <br /> There are quite a long movie, but definitely worth while watching it certainly seems a long time. <br /> <br /> I can not wait RKS next film and the next AB, Akshay movies they always seem to be good together ... like, Station. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika also worked very well in the film and should do really well, if it continues in the same way in the future.
