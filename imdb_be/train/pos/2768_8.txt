Apart from wooden shipping Susan Hayward for this film, he was as good as any biblical film made. Henry King handles this film epic with respect to all the little scenes, and Peck, as always, impeccable. Alfred Newman stirring sound score with stirring twenty-third psalm unforgettable even after these many years. Scene Goliath bit on the side of hockey, but not all that bad made for the era in which the film was made. It goes well with smaller bible epics of the day, "Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King." It is worth watching, and Raymond Massey wonderful Nathan the prophet. The film widened always nice James Robertson Justice as a abishai and Jayne Meadows like Michal estranged first wife of David.
