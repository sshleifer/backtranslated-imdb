When I was a kid, it was a time of Lex Barker as Tarzan. I have often heard from older people that Weissmuller "was" Tarzan and I do not understand why, since I've seen the last couple of movies Weismuller in the character, and I thought he was some kind of shape. It was not many years after that I came across "Tarzan and His Mate," and then I realized. Weismuller in the form in this picture and has a strong presence and character looks requirement has not yet been agreed by other Tarzans, such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Danny Miller, Miles O'Keeffe and Cristopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> As for this film, I was also surprised by the presence of sensual beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan strong, independent-minded, active and "non-restrain" the woman, Jane is far ahead of time in which the film was made ( Tarzan pushes her into the pool naked as she entertains, one of the researchers by surprise and kisses her, although she did not kiss him back like she would allow him to do a little bit, and do not make a big deal out of it); such behavior would have been unthinkable with the "Jane" to come, such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Houston and Dorothy Hart, all play a kind of too perfect sweet vulnerable women, which makes it hard to believe that they could survive in a hostile place, like the African jungle. sparkling face <br /> <br /> O'Sullivan character overshadows the very Tarzan, except, of course, when it comes to action and Weismuller undertakes easily; perfect combination. Another highlight in the film supporting role Cheeta, and not as the main lead, as in the later Tarzan pictures, where it often saves the day. <br /> <br /> Â«Tarzan and His Mate" stands as an excellent product in its genre (Tarzan films), and possibly the best, although I must admit that I enjoyed "The Greatest Adventure Tarzan" (1959) made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast (and in spite of a possible Gordon Scott in the title role, with its too perfect "all my school" physical views that are not suitable for rural ape man). <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her partner!
