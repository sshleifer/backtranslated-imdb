For people interested in the business and corporate world, this show just the best of the best. As one of the former members of the show wrote in his blog about this innovative show: People in business, finally an audience. The whole idea is perfect; having a group of businessmen, competing against each other in business-related tasks, in the best place in the world, New York. Donald Trump is ideal as a boss, despite the fact that his ego is bigger than the whole universe is infinite time. He also does a lot of questionable decisions that the fire, which is one of the negatives of the show <br /> <br /> Season 1 :. A great season as a whole, the best season in the "normal". This season was the one that most of the real-world business skills. I am drowning series later in the marketing problems associated with too much product placement. Large and interesting opponents in general, with the cutest character ever in this series: Troy. I know I'm not the only person who suspects that the Trump World Tower-episode, where he was fired rigged to Amy and Nick to win this particular task <br /> <br /> Season 2 :. It is also a great season. Objectives were still pretty much OK, and he had a lot of interesting opponents. Jen M was awful and never made it to the finals, IMO. In addition, the firing was the worst ever (Pamela) this season <br /> <br /> Season 3 :. Terrible. In fact, I liked the concept of the book smarts against street smart, but the throw was so completely terrible (it turned out that Trump hated the cast as well) that the whole season was a complete failure. The best moments was the second episode (the motel renovation), with PM Brian shot, the guy who said nothing, but a huge amount of value comedy <br /> <br /> Season 4 :. A great season, a lot of interesting and exciting contestants this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and total disaster, whose name was Thor). "Take me to the BoardroomÂ» episode one of the absolute classics of the show, finishing well remember a quadruple shooting. Unfortunately, I think we were robbed on Randall vs. Alla finals. I think that Trump was afraid that she might win, and to prevent what has happened <br /> <br /> Season 5 :. Sad season really is no special things to him. Brent was just embarrassed and obviously only there to create drama. Tasks were terrible in general (as was the creation of Jingle nothing to do with the business at all?). I believe that the best man won, but I personally could not care less <br /> <br /> Season 6 :. I can understand why they would want to try to LA as a new location for the show, but in retrospect it was a mistake. New York will always be a place for it. This season has added so many new things, most of them badly (as a team loss has to sleep outside in tents, winning the PM continues to be the PM, for example). Tasks were terrible and Trump also chose the wrong winner. James deserved it, no doubt, <br /> <br /> Season 7 :. Celebrity Edition. The best season ever. Completely different rules (such as the use rolodexes), but all the fun and entertainment. The biggest problem is that many of the participants were not real celebrity at all, especially women, where all unknown to me for Omarosa exception, which is common to shame all that it takes part. It looked like a season of Gene Simmons, but after he made a complete embarrassment during Kodak task, another man emerged from the shadows: Piers Morgan. Never before has anyone dominated the season like he did. He crushed his opponents, and came across as a guy with a great sense of humor (although some prudish Americans (not all Americans, of course, do not get me wrong), unfortunately, do not have the social skills to understand). WAY TO GO piers !! <br /> <br /> For those who like that, I highly recommend the British version starring Sir Alan Sugar as a boss. In fact, the British version is much better, and that's saying something since the US (the original) is really a great show. One thing about the British version is that the participants are usually tend to behave like decent people in the conference room, in contrast to the constant yelling and rude behavior that occurs in the US version.
