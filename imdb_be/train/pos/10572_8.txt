I have a feeling that Warners Bros Depression-era musicals are going to become much more important in the next couple of years. Yes, we are in an economic depression (or you've been living under a rock) and time look bleak. But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles. In the 30s, the film continues was very popular even in the midst of economic gloom. "Parade ramp flooded with light (one thousand nine hundred thirty-three)" was one such film that audiences flocked. Although this Lloyd Bacon directed the musical did not quite capture the social problems of the time, as "gold diggers in 1933 (1933)" makes it still a great talent showcase. We have to wait until the end of the film for three CENTERPIECE Busby Berkeley extravaganza numbers, but boy, they are waiting for me. Yes, a little Ruby Keeler terrible singer and actress, and her pat so-so, but Busby magically "waterfall" whisks her, and what seems to be hundreds of other girls choir at a dizzying water wonderland. Of course the number Busby could never really be performed on stage (they defy gravity borders on the one hand), and they contrast with the terrible cruel realism, while penetrating non-musical scene. And "light-flooded ramp" and James Cagney in on one of their musicals too few (in fact, I could not do it man?). He even gets to take over from the leading man Don Sailor clothes and fawn over a sexy woman! Shanghai Liv (which is actually a little chop in China girl wig!). He co-stars with Joan Blondell, his favorite, favorite secretary who Cagney once to go to the benefit of other women (until the last reel, that is). Apparently Blondell was just another woman who loved Cagney, except his wife. And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene.
