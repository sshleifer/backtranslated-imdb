With all the latest movies, dealing with the British monarchy, it's really time for another? Answer: You bet! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the film wave from the UK, dedicated to the royal family. In this case, we are talking about the early life of Princess Victoria, and the events that led to the coronation of her becoming queen of all England, and her romance and eventually marriage to Prince Albert. The film also deals with the turbulent life and career as the Queen and the Prince of England, as well as a number of other events that are established (by political upheaval, etc.) .. Emily Blunt plays Victoria radiant in her youth, while Rupert friend is her favorite and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is rounded off with a Miranda Richardson as the Dutchess of Kent, and are always happy on the screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as a cast of others who shine on the screen. Jean-Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., loser Love), directs from a screenplay win Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, separate Lies). I'm completely out of my head over the visual look of the film (filmmakers Hagen Bogdansker), which gave each film frame a picturesque view (with the help of the director, Patrice Vermette), as well as some tight editing (on Bilkok Jill & Matt Garner). What I also appreciated the script Fellowes' is the use of the game of chess as a metaphor for some political motives of the film (the characters in the film move like pieces on a chess board). This is a reasonable, well-written, directed, filmed, edited and acted entertainment (and enlightenment), which makes for a good night out at the cinema. Rated PG MPAA in several scenes of erotica, some brief violence (a bit bloody, but nothing too bloody), coarse blast language and some smoking on screen
