The film has a lot of feeling in the game from the start - I think it would be better to play than in the movie, because the recruitment and the dramatization make a version of the film, it seems a bit too artificial. But, nevertheless, this is done well enough, and the history and especially the dialogue interesting. They accepted dialogue pretty much exactly as it is from the actual game. Maybe it's a good introduction to the plays of Shaw. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Ryan has his head in the clouds and a flair for the dramatic and actor Helena Bonham Carter does a good job here. Her fiance, Serges, it is a bit too cartoonish, when he really should be very handsome dashing figure. Her parents entertained enough.
