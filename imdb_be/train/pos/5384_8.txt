I thought the film was very well made for TV movie, and it contains both a lot of action and humor. I found that the entertainment value is worth watching, and I will watch it again and again like a show. I am disappointed that Sean entirely attributed here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I see the opportunity in a series of actions based on this concept and continued with Sean once again play an even higher "cash" rate, as his life will be on the line again anyway. <br /> <br /> I felt that Sean very well played his part, and reminds me of the actor by the name of Matthew Ashford, who plays Jack Deveraux on the bottom of our lives - a soap opera.
