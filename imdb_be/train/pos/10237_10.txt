This is one of the best films to come out of Hong Kong "New Wave", which began with Tsui Hark in "ZU:. Warriors of the Magic Mountain" Tsui set the tone for the new wave approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all of the directors of the new wave (Jackie Chan, Hung summit, Wong Ching, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) taken as long as a given; namely, the approach to such films from now on will need more than a touch of irony, if not an outright comedy. "Burning Heaven" to put an end to all this, and with a vengeance <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there is no humor here. but it is a purely human sense of humor, as well as the age at the beginning of the Buddhist priest who is controlling the near sense of a married young prostitutes, hiding in the straw bundle. But it is the same as people who do not even Buddhist priests may be holy all the time. <br /> <br /> If irony is finally introduced into the film, it is bad it is possible that moves away from "the abbe" with Red Lotus Temple, which is a study in pure nihilism, such as has never been recorded on film before. He is the very epitome of a "Paradise Lost" Milton's Satan: "It is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven!" And if he can not go to hell Satan, fast enough, it will turn the world around him in hell, he can control. <br /> <br /> This is the motif underlines the brutal violence much imagery here: This is not what the abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel completely hopeless to take it as an all-encompassing nihilism reality. Thus, there is a pervasive scene Red temple, there simply can not be any other reality outside the temple itself a certain sense - it's getting there in the universe, and the abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is responsible for <. br /> <br /> know, fortunately, the film does not end there. Although there is a loss, the human will be just an ordinary person finally prevails. (If you want to know how to see the movie!) However, there is no doubt that when watching this film, we visit hell. I hope that we do not see our own life after death; but we certainly feel punished experience - and somehow better for him above all.
