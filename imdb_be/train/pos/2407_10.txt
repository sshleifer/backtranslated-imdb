The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. This was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (the Bible to believe). I do not go along with the crowd of right-wing believers. I dropped out of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> For me, in their attempt to take over our government, they do what Judas was trying to do. I call it the Judas Syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not receive it, even though Jesus said that his kingdom is not of this world. <br /> <br /> This film certainly showed some of this. <br /> <br /> I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /> <br /> In addition, he was a very beautiful Jesus. <br /> <br /> Watch it again and cinema. <br /> <br /> It is very satisfying.
