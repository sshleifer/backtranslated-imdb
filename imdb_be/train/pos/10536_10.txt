Yes ... I will be with 1-0 of this, and here's why. In the past few years, I have watched a lot of comedies and only have a few laughs and a couple of soft video late fees, because the films were so easy to forget. Then I stumble on "Nothing." Looked interesting, I do not expect much though. I was wrong. It was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever had the opportunity to observe. Dave and Andrew make a great comedic pair and humor was catchy enough to remember, but no more complicated to the point of missing the joke. I do not want to notice, on any of the real scene, because I feel that this is a movie worth seeing at this time. More and more meaningless concepts come in a movie (you know, the killers of military aircraft and "fresh" remakes, which destroy the old classics), this film will make you happy to say that it's okay to laugh, "Nothing."
