I watched this movie three times. The last time, I kept skipping around intricate scenes to find a solution to the plot. Maybe the plot is not intended to hang together logically. Or perhaps these rough spots in the plot because Anne recall distant events is quite faulty. <br /> <br /> Take a young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who attended college with an unnamed processes wealthy family. She must have had help to afford a very expensive education, but never seem to have any family ties in general. She never seems to have a family, it may apply if the effects of one of its harmful decisions take effect. <br /> <br /> Anne shares the night of passion with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, when Harris consoles Lila after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Anne suddenly finds it annoying and repels her own behavior. I must have missed something significant here. Ann behavior seems completely incomprehensible. Anne refuses her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the best man at the wedding of Lila in. Despite the refusal Ann Harris, she continues to hold deep feelings for him before he died. <br /> <br /> It was evident from his behavior that Harris was deeply impressed with Ann and would be happy to marry her. The scene, with their chance meeting years after the wedding Lila showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Anne. <br /> <br /> The film showed a pattern for romance Ann. She always had a quarrel with his men, and she denied it. This model is conducted with Harris and the two men. In contrast to this, Lilly was married to a man she does not love, and she stayed with her husband until he died. Perhaps Lily was able to build a relationship, because she refused to marry her failure. <br /> <br /> Then too convenient reappearance Lila Ross near Anna bed. Apparently the nurse Anne was able to get enough information from the last lucid moments Anne to identify and connect with Lila. None of this message is not on the tape. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking about Anne house lived during her last days. How could she afford to buy a house for the poor salaries of their singing career? Anne has always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster, raising her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I enjoyed the setting of the film and the music very much. Seaside mansion was so heartbreakingly beautiful. Claire Danes was glowing like a young Ann Grant. It really is a very talented singer. I prefer her natural brunette to a bottle blonde look she had in the crowd of the film. If only those pesky CGI fireflies are gone, I could just pick up roller in the sense of my voice!
