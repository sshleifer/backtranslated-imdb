I was Serve cable channels late one night and crashed into the movie about 10 minutes at the beginning - every time I did not even think to go to bed, something kept telling me to continue to watch it, even if it was the way the way way past my bedtime. <br /> <br /> This film would be another easy slam dunk anti-gun film, but instead they decided to study the aftereffects of filming. Better yet, the film went on with real life - just when you think they're going to take the easy way out and obviously contrived, twist comes and changes the entire look of the film. This film is not only to follow the formula, it shows how other events often lead to and / or influence on what happens next. <br /> <br /> I just want to filmmakers studied issues related to anti-depressant drugs more - children Columnbine, who did the shooting had them for years, and it was scary to watch as Diana threw them every time when the nightmares started. Until recently, they were dosing of things like candy and only now they are even beginning to realize that the long-term effects of the drug there. It was very nice to see that the mental aspect of the history of the disease has been given quite a bit of the film, having a relative with a mental illness, I can say that the film is dead nuts in every aspect of mental illness. Bravo to the director and the writer, who obviously did their homework on these issues. And for those who think that some things could not happen in the hospital (I will not say what information), you are dead wrong on this, too - I was there. The script was so real, it was amazing. <br /> <br /> Go buy this movie and show it to your teenage child before it's too late. Someday they'll thank you for it.
