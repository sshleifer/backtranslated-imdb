I've always had the philosophy that everyone has different tastes, I found this movie to be strange, and I think every college student can there agree with me. Despite it not being "a film with a plot", its about real guys, and some of the "issues" they face. I found the film hilarious (especially those parts which they played practical jokes on each other). Simply put, if you are in the same "wavelength", as these people, you will find this strange film. I do not think that's going to win either a Golden Globe or an Oscar, or that the people in this film will be the future stars of Hollywood, but a kind of "cult classics" among the young people who can relate to their experience. For me, the guy who stands out the most, Hans: Scandinavian guy who, according to him, "Is watching", but receives all (or some) of chickens, "Little-people" also play a big role in the film, especially if they are. drunk. When I keep going, I could provide a spoiler and I do not want to do it, just go and get the movie and you will not regret it. I give it a 8/10
