This film is a real gem. The arc portion defined within the first 3 minutes, the characters are pretty clearly drawn and their motives quite true. The dialogue is fresh, and so real. Situations are unique characters, not formulaic or beaten. Before menopause, that is. Whereas if the film derailed a bit, and he got a little sentimental and incredibly. But I do not want to stop people from watching this movie. The first 3/4-h it is really excellent. I gave him the 8. There are some fine performances here. Check out this movie.
