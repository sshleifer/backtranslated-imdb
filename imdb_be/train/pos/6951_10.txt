I've never been a big fan of the television while I was not looking 24 for the first time. I got into a series of very late. Season 5 ended before I even saw my very first episode. It was an episode of the third series, which has been on my parents DVR (digital video recorder) box while I was sitting at home on the weekends. It took that one episode for me to be a hook, line and sinker into the world of Jack Bauer. And boy, I was hooked !! I watched over the next six episodes, without batting an eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited monthly pass for twenty dollars and that a matter of course, it was the biggest blockbuster of the money I've ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. It is 72 forty-minute episodes !!! I would say that finding out what happens next, it's easier on the DVD, rather than wait for a week. I can only imagine the anticipation of watching Season 6, week after week !! I find it mildly painful and cruel, but I'm going to give it a try and see it in the same way as the rest of America !! DVR is installed, and you can bet I'll be chomping at the bit !!
