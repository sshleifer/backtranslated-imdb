I caught it on display at the Sundance Film Festival and fluttered over the absolute power of the film. This study of the psychological impact on our brave soldiers who join the military with the hope that they will protect and serve our country with pride and take care of our power for him. Details Film psychological changes that occur in the camp, the soldiers become "killers for his country," and to put the war and after effects as soon as they return home. It also reflects the effect that the murder has on the human psyche. He pays tribute to the soldiers and never criticize soldiers, unlike other films, and does not criticize a system that is not ready and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of returning vets. <br /> <br /> This film is a powerful, moving, emotional and thoughtful. He serves as a call to arms to support our troops not only to buy stickers and going to parades, but really listening to them, and helping to support changes in the way their health and well taken care of after the murder. <br /> <br /> the best film of the festival so far, **** / ****
