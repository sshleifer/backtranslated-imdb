It takes a special kind of person to make a film that is so unfortunate, utensils, disgusting and repulsive, but do it in a way that also makes it shiny and quintessential personal cinematic release. Crispin Glover, in all its "there" antics and addiction, really has done something that is unique. In a world that has become sharply partisans, this film seems to depart from the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively impress everyone. <br /> <br /> Immediately, the film takes on a rather distant paradigm (if there is in fact a model at all) and it initially generates a similar Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and the naked woman pleasuring people with cerebral palsy. It's pretty shocking stuff, but if you had the opportunity for Q & A session after the screening, clearly opens a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether art or just the lowest common denominator. In any form, you feel the tremors that the film will eventually lead to. He will never be accepted, not even the filmmakers imaginary world that boring to talk about the human condition. You may not like, but this is definitely something worth watching.
