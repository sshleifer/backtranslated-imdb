Not being one of my favorite, it's good to have a change of pace ... even if only for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a great battle between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who renamed «Butch» here). They're knocking each other, but then Spike does a heroic and perfect solution: he stops the fight and shows that they all have to be friends. Thus, they all sign a peace treaty and become friends ... which will not last long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, three became gentle, patient and kind to each other. They even save each other when one of them is in danger of life. Relationship nothing comes out, but it is remarkable, yet very big steak is not, and all of them are greedy. Three guilty to return to their usual battles and rivalries. <br /> <br /> But still ... to see Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends really beautiful and rewarding experience, even if only for a while. <br /> <br /> Oh, and as a curious fact, two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" play here in the instrumental versions of "We're off to see the wizard" and "Somewhere over the rainbow."
