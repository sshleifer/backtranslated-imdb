For the life of me why this film get rated R?! While about flesh-eating zombies, believe it or not, this is actually a very good family film - at least, if your children age 10 years and older. Unlike traditional zombie movies, this one has a great sense of humor and traditional values ​​- a little twisted! Language is not a serious problem, NO nudity and style of the film, of course, focused on the child (the same as the old TV show «Eerie, Indian") - but some Knucklehead slapped an R rating he alone! Believe me, most of the children have seen violence worse than that, and it just seems silly to viewers think that this adults-only film. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in the world in parallel type. While fashion, cars and manners are about 1953 in the Bizarro world observed the recent tough zombie plague led to "zombie war" and massive changes in their daily lives. At school, children are trained in combat and there is a cute scene at the end of the film where a father gives his son a gun and tells him to keep it in the bag "just in case"! As for life outside the school, it is pretty amazing as well, as people will now learn that zombies are not so bad! Heck, use shock collars and training, they can be turned into slaves, which can make your housework, clean streets, delivering milk or, in the case of really sick guy to be your "special friend." <br /> <br /> The film deals with one particular family, which finally buys his first zombie servant (played by Billy Connolly). Mom happy, and her son is slowly becoming a zombie. Dad, on the other hand, not sure - he was forced to kill, the sooner your own zombie father, and he still has not got over it !! Funny, irreverent and unique - this film should be seen by a much wider audience.
