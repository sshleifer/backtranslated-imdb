Do not listen to the critics on this croaker is a gem! Young rich Joan and her brother is penniless after their father's death - and now they have to work for a living! It naturally becomes a reporter, and he, as well as, of course, the driver for the crowd! The wild co-incidence of their career to meet with the head, thanks to Clark Gable gangster. At the same time there is a chance the lunar underwear swim on a bunch of pretty young things and Joan, to make a pair of juicy dance numbers (with the grace of a steam shovel). <br /> <br /> but none of this should not be taken lightly - it's all good fun of these fine pre-code days, when Hollywood was very naughty. Joan looks great and reflects much of the emotional range that would give her career a long life (thank God, she stopped dancing!). Gable distinctive as the slippery gangster - he was not a star yet, and therefore should not be a hero. Great to see him play something else. And William Bakewell well as poor confused brother. And there are some great editing and tracking shots affectionately director Harry Beaumont, which moves the part to a cracking pace - and the occasional wink audience! Great fun!
