«Amazing Grace» has a sluggish feel to it, as he tells the story of different modern life in an apartment building. Language is Hebrew, but the drama may take place in any modern city. He noted, family values, romance, and age characteristics of the group with equal aplomb. He does not judge the characters, but present them in a straight forward way, as they seek to develop their individual problems in the modern world. The quality of action is very good, and the observation made on the characters insightful and sharp. I appreciate that the bulk film very much.
