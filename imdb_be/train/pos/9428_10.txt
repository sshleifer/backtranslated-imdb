One of my favorite movies today begins as a trip to the wild side of the team of four people from Atlanta. The idea of ​​river life Chulawasse, before it turned into the lake comes from Lewis Burt Reynolds, who unconsciously drowns it in their worst nightmares guys. But if the first half of the film is more like a thriller, the other half carries the audience into a completely different story, with our men are forced to make a decision that (they know) change their lives forever. In a very bad way. At the end of the movie, everyone is going to be forced to deal with scars that would just be a pretty weekend on the river, but subdued in a struggle for survival. The film (with the exception of some rather obvious inconsistencies) very well directed and beautifully shot in the nature of paradise that steals your breath. Photos fine as well. Voight, Reynolds, Coke and Beatty are all excellent, showing how one event can ruin different four different lives only tied to the same error.
