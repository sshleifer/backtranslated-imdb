I read Holes in the 5th grade, so when I heard they were making a movie, I was thrilled! Of course, being my own busy, I did not get a chance to see the film in theaters. Holes were screwing just out of town, but unfortunately, we were too busy. I was surprised to learn that all my friends have seen it, and not one of them invited me! They all said that it was good, but I read the great books that have made bad movies, so I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, a great opportunity to see it come. It is with this week, and my parents were going on a cruise and I was nursing. My sister, who is 9, and I watched it and absolutely loved it! Then I took him to other people, I was babysitting HOUSE and their children, 9 and 4, liked it too. Even my parents loved it, and they deffinately critics. Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who understands the family spirit and loves a cheerful throw! This film should be on your top 5 "to see" list !!!!
