I have not seen it for, but I'm 20yrs still remember things about it. <br /> <br /> This film could not be made in color. Sharp shades of gray, which makes it, and life was really just in 1950 ?? What stands out most in my memory, Perry Smith is going to the gallows. His breath under the hood before they were trapped. I do not think I could watch that again ..... once much. This is how an unnamed man at the beginning of «Papillon», involved in terror to the guillotine. The guy who said it is looking at a double bill with «Dead Man Walking» have been added to the last 10 minutes, "I want to live", as well. <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors being "aristocrats" went to the guillotine in 1794-95, so that my feelings on the death penalty is quite intense.
