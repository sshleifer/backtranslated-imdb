It was thought the soul! I am Iranian, and live in the 21st century, I did not know that such large families lived in such conditions, while my grandfather! <br /> <br /> You see that today, or even in 1925, on the one hand the world a lady or a child can have all served to him or her clean and at the request, but then 80 years ago, people risked their lives, to go somewhere with a lot of grass. It's really interesting that the Persians are these difficulties, to seek pasture their sheep, but they are losing a lot of sheep on their way. <br /> <br /> I praise the Americans, who had accompanied the tribe, they were as tough as Bakhtiarov
