I saw this movie in the '07 Festival Adelaide Film and thoroughly intrigued all 106 minutes. I love documentaries, but often dragging them about 25 minutes before the end. Lee denied $ is included, though, never lose interest. <br /> <br /> subject of the film is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman to receive fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book, The Edge of Love, a biographical story of sorts against her Muslim member who was killed by his family for having a relationship with a Christian man. A few years later, though, some journalists began to poke holes in the story, leading the public to believe that it's a scam. The film covers it quickly, but carefully at the outset, and from there we spend most of our time in the company Norma as she tries to convince us that her novel more than fiction. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broynouski found really fascinating woman to study, and she spends endless interviews with Khoury as she searches for the truth. As always in life, however, it is not so easy to find. Norma is afraid for his life, worried about the violent backlash over the hideous portrait of her new colors Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to go back to Jordan, and show us the facts. Broinowski not deterred, however, and slowly puts the pieces together before us. <br /> <br /> As a result, an incredible sight in the cheater's mind. Naturally, what we find there is little sense and is extremely difficult to follow, and ultimately, we do not know whether to believe or not, or Norma. It is quite unfair or hurt a woman trying to survive, or the fantastic maiden. Web of lies, half-truths and the truth it turns through the film is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses a lot of interview footage and dramatisations say that this story and Broinowski uses these dramatisations, to show us why people like Norma may exist: we want to be cheated. We go to the movies every day, and allow yourself to believe what is happening on the screen is real. It may just be the things I read on a bit too much, it did not come up in the Q & A with Brionowski after the movie, but that's what I took from him. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian film, and should get an international release, and a swag of awards, if you ask me. Of course, the best film I've seen in AFF07. <br /> <br /> watch it when you get the chance.
