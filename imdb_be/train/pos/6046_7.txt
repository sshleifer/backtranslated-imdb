I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Let's face it; the room does not seem particularly attractive, when you have to pass the money on a movie night, but it was a quiet character that wins the one above. There were no moments that I found wild, and I doubt that I'll remember the next day, but this is not necessarily a good leak. What I found funny was watching here in Beijing with my Chinese girl who never understands anything I like. I told her that was three parts, guys, bring back some weeds in London. Slightly arranges for her. There's not a rip-off going on the camera, which I expected after reading a number of comments. I object but a comparison with Withnail and I; not in the same league, and I doubt that it was intended to. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
