Well, let's start with the fact that this film is not an accurate execution of the crimes and the legal prosecution of Andrei Chikatilo. While this may be the "official policy" in the Politburo that the Soviet Union was not a serial killer, in fact, the legal system is pumped to the other, and "Killer XÂ» (it was actually called) has already sought when Fetisov led Burakou on the case. In fact, as soon as he realized that they had multiple murder on their hands, the authorities have identified the target group of dozens of officers to track down and stop the killing spree man who does not fit into what is perceived as an ordinary serial killer settings. This is a good director and writers constantly remind the audience that the story is only "based on real events," docudrama for it is not so. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS following **** <br /> < br /> However, this is a hell of a good example of a fast-paced thriller in the style of Hollywood, which continues to receive through the basics of what happened. this is easy to follow and has just enough of the truth of their version of events, to make for a spectacular view . so, Chikatilo was raped and killed both children and adults, both men and women. So, poor laboratory work to free him to continue killing for years. So, innocent people have been charged with murder and "confess" to their crimes urge the police. So, the gay community is disturbed while the crimes were perfect (albeit with the help of perfect Burakou in). and so, Chikatilo was brought to confession, not the fiery special prosecutor, Gorbunova, but gentle understanding psychiatrist named Boukhanovsky (although Gorbunov was very far from selfish martinet painted in fl m film). Puns about the truth and veracity aside, all these events are played out in a manner that consistently draws tension and fear. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt that the director and co-writer Chris Zherolmo has a pitch perfect cast, growing emotional involvement in the murders of Stephen Rea and accumulating experience in identifying the key, elegant manipulation Donald Sutherland Soviet party hacks and thin spine that becomes obvious if necessary, boiling undercurrent Jeffrey Demanov furious hide the fear-filled manner, Max boyish excitement background Sydow at being part of a criminal investigation of a sharp increase dialogue and accurate edit Anne ways that can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Taken for what it is, "Citizen of the X" near-perfect pitch ( "almost" because of one moment of self-congratulation at the end that just does not fit). Highly recommended as a fiction well said, not a fact seems ... but considering useless "serial killer" movies that Hollywood usually spreads, it's good enough for me.
