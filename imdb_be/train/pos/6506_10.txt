Absolutely brilliant. A powerful and evocative. The most convincing documentary series ever made about the war. It offers tons stark contrast to the often fanatical attitude to World War 2, the media exhibits. Rather than opt for a scream about the horror of war, it allows the soft voice of Sir Laurence Olivier to take a back seat to the real images of war dead bodies everywhere, explosions terrified the citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that have cost thousands of lives, suffering innocent people. Most of all it really brings home that humanity is capable of, when all normal, "civilized" rules are removed. There is something clearly Hobbes about a man in the true state of nature, he returned to a more brutal form, capable of the crimes are still shocked and fascinated 60 years. Maybe, maybe track down a series called "The Age of a state of war" in the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors. I feel that this is the irony of enormous proportions that it took an event which led to the deaths of 50 million people, to make such a compelling and excellent series such as these.
