I just saw "Valentina", and I must say that it was the best slasher movie that I have seen in recent years. In contrast to the recent trend of 90-horror, the film is more concerned to be terrible than being self-irony. For those who are there that the hated "The Scream," is not a reference to the "rules of horror" in this movie (even if the old rules Slasher movie really apply here). <br /> <br /> This is an ideal combination of the 80 and 90-horror. You get style, cinematography and good acting in 90 films and annoying chopper madness 80th Flick. I believe that 2001 will finally give fans a kind of horror movies, they longed for. This is certainly a step in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands here as a funny character. You can tell that she loved the role, and what makes it stand out. I loved her in this film.
