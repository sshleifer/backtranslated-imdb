This is a film that should be seen by anyone interested, is carried out, or are suffering from an eating disorder. It's surprisingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia nervosa in teenage girl, its causes and symptoms. She plays one of the brightest young actresses working in film today, Alison Lohman, who was after so spectacular in "Where the Truth Lies." I would recommend that this film will be shown in all schools, as you will never see better on this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding, and one of its surprising ability to convey melancholy girl who suffers from this compulsive disorder. If barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy. Her emotional range is so precise, each scene can be measured microscopically for him gradations injury on a scale of rising hysteria and despair that reaches unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother, and does so with great compassion and emotion as a range of finely tuned, Laman's. Together they form a pair of sensitive emotional oscillator vibration in resonance with each other. This film is really an amazing achievement, and director Kathy Shi should be proud of it. The only reason, without seeing it, if you are not interested in people. But even if you love nature films the best, it is still the behavior of animals at the sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme option as a tormented soul can kill her own body in a frenzy of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people who suffer from the depths of despair, we are dead inside.
