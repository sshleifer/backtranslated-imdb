I really think that people are taking the wrong approach to this. First of all, I think it's a short film very interesting and entertaining. I just take it for what it is. I think the suspense and the mystery of their witty innuendo when observers. Another thing that caught my imagination that he immediately gets the audience involved, even if there is no clear history, only hints, and pause and emotions played out this kind of characters give you the impression that there is a story to everything that happens. No one else could do it better than Lynch. This is the essence lynchianism at its best. Of course, I agree with someone else, that people who are starting to view it with the desire to have fun without any really imaginary work by the viewer find myself disappointed. And in a good right. Lynch is not about that. At least, this side is not Lynch. The one who helped make the Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. It is at full tilt here, and people who are just waiting to be entertained as they watch something else, just do not understand what it's all about. My opinion is that the dark room is all about messing with your animal core, your instinctive self, giving you the means (image, sound, situation), with which you instinctively respond. This is not about any kind of joy, it is about getting the desired response from you. And that, my friend, is pure art.
