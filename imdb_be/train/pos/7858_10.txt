TESS storm strange, perhaps, the best film of all films of Mary Pickford. Two hours later, it was quite a long time for the 1922 silent film still continues to hold an interest of about 80 years after it was filmed. Mary gives one of her best performances of the times the role of performance seems "greatest hits" with bits of Mari innocent, Mary imp, little Maria's mother, Mary the Spitfire, the romantic heroine, Mary, etc. characteristics which have often been used for one of the film in the past. The film is surprisingly sincere illegitimate child of a supporting character for 1922 and at some point our little Mary thought unmarried mother in the matter! If the Academy Awards have been around in 1922, without a doubt, the best actress Oscar for the year would be Mary.
