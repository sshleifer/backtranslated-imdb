Great movie. The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to State Railways of Hungary (M√ÅV), and this clearly shows that they were used in a large train, but not in the local rail - on the history of Chikatilo took their victims to the local railway station. In addition, the film is perfect.
