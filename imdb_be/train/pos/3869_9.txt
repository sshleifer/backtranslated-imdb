I saw the film at Viennale a few years ago, where the audience liked. I liked it as well, Summer Phoenix performance still haunts me, that's why I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story is set in London in 1900, where the Jewish girl decides to become an actress. She tries desperately to become, but it is not true to how a person treats her badly, she realizes that in the scene, that she has the talent and that it connects with the audience and acts as a strong man. <br /> <br /> there were some reviews, was her performance was broken, they accused her of being bored, unable to breathe life into her character. I think, that's her forte, that's exactly what should be Esther Kahn and Phoenix makes a bold decision to make it a pretty sad girl Esther. Thus, at the end of its transformation it is more powerful than it might be otherwise. <br /> <br /> cinema great, London's image around the turn of the century is very dark and dreary, you can see how life was then nasty. <br /> <br /> The only drawback, in my opinion, the film's length, you lose touch with the characters, after all winked at only about finding an actor in itself, so there is no dramatic action in the film, Phoenix winked loan that we do not lose interest in the film after the first hour.
