14 years since the show was done, and he is still the best show ever made. Drafting was first class and the second net production. This show will never be made today, and that's a shame. I hope that when you think about the search of the show, to see what you're doing. <br /> <br /> AG came out the year I left high school at the time of my fav TV show The X Files it gives you an idea of ​​why I first got into this show. AG was much better program with better writing, but only one reason? I know that this is not the only program to receive only one season is another example that comes to mind is the lone gunman (x files twist) it was a good letter, and it was funny, but it was only one season. It does not seem right! <br /> <br /> We must also remember that the show was around before the show as dusk darkens the show "cool", so I think it may also let the show goes downhill. <br /> <br /> See the program and enjoy! 10 out of 10 for me.
