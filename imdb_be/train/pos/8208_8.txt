I like almost all the films in the series Dirty Harry, except that I think it is called the «Enforcer». «Deadpool» was a little weak in the fields, but I still enjoyed it. This one is one of my favorite series, nothing else for a great line, "Go ahead, make my day." This one also has an interesting albeit familiar story who kills those who have done her wrong. Just think «Magnum Force» with fewer secrets about who is behind the murders and you have your own story. Of course there is a little more than that, because it really shows a very good final showdown in the amusement park. It also has a Dirty Harry gets the bulldog as a gift and footboard Sandra Locke in a rather humorous scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood must have had a very mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of his films. It brings down by a point each time, even if the whole film is pleasant to me. Of course, it's not bad here, but her character could be much better by someone else. Another problem with this film and other Dirty Harry movies, sometimes they almost seem to be an advertisement for guns. I love guns as much as the next person, but we really need to explain all the scenes of his strengths of its newest weapons and how many bullets he holds? Nevertheless, a very good entry in the series Dirty Harry movies.
