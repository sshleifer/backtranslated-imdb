I saw this movie after watching version Paltrow. I found that a very good, and I thought that this would be not so good ... but I was wrong: The British version was much better and more pleasant! I found the North more "pleasant" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Knightley Strong catches much better Austin. In any case, both options are good, but anyone who loves books Austin should watch this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davis changed a few things, but remains faithful to the original <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> Has 2 cents.!
