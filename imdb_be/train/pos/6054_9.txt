I saw a preview of Freebird at Isle of Man TT, as I heard about it a couple of magazines motorcycles. Although I was finished mainly for racing, the temptation to see Phil Daniels on a motorcycle movie (yes I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) was enough to get me a beer and get-togethers. Finally! we did it! We actually did a great British motorcycle film (and no, it's not as torque) is up there with the best of British comedy. Mark my words, it's Phil Daniels is the best screen performance, and how Geoff Bell is concerned, there is a new British legend makes his name felt. I loved Harry ~ d Stretch in Shane Meadows Dead Mans Shoes fantastic and here he gives a touching work quietly, that he is proud to add to his growing reputation of the film. This film not only bikers for us, but I think that for all (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope he gets the same brilliant answer on the mainland, he was on the Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of some of the classic scenes that the film (watch out for the store), as it may spoil the fun, but I would say go see, enjoy, and have one of the best nights in a movie you were at that time . I really think that this could well be a cult. As they spoke to TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
