This short film for a long time in my "keeper" list. There are people who understand how stress, menopause, emotional abuse of women (as well as the mentally retarded) were really to treat the medical profession at the turn of the century ?? !! All pious anxious Christian relations at that time were fatal for the study of the true emotional feelings that would allow us to take the suffering of the soul, let alone to explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you imagine (by today's standards), that Walt Whitman books were banned, because he recognized the woman as having feelings and emotional reactions as large as a man? Think about it! The sensitivity of this film still makes me, and I give credit to the director to capture this in his eyes.
