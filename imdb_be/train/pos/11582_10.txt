For someone who remembers Jane in a strip cartoon Daily Mirror, the viewing of this film is an exercise in nostalgia. In this context, it is fine, but young audiences will undoubtedly find a limp comedy and miss the point that the actors cartoon characters. The plot also limp for today's audience, but reflects a naive 40 and 50 is very good. Jane, you must remember, was part of an escapist fantasy of wartime years, created to boost the morale of the troops. She gave a double meaning in the "band" in the cartoon strip. <br /> <br /> The story has something in common with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme would be familiar to readers of that era, a lot of awkward Nazis disrupted several equally awkward Englanders, and set in the African jungle, of course. <br /> <br /> For fans of Jane, a must-see. For the rest of you, damp squib. <br /> <br />
