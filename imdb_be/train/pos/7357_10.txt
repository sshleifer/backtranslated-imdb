Well, where do I start? ... This film has changed my life! The site was no longer linked. James Cahill from itself did. Initially, after the first viewing I was disappointed that I did not see it on the silver screen. However, it was to explore the many functions of the DVD !!!! Oh my god Jakes comments Cahill movie was nearly as flawless as his actions. He spoke about the trade secret, used in the film, that you only get to experience. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the other actors. The scene where the guard talking to a girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) films. I, of course, Gangsta, when he expresses his frustration with not a sequel. <br /> <br /> I'm still blown away with every viewing skills of martial arts involved, corresponds to only sign indicating the location of the library in the school ... and maybe the guy playing retard! In general, timeless classic and the best film to come out of Europe in the years to come! where it has the Oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
