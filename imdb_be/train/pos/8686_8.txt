The second official episode of the series «Columbo» ( «Murder by the Book" is removed later, got on the air first). Robert Culp, who will match wits with the detective Peter Falk in several future contributions, is terrific as the irascible head of exquisite private detective agency that kills the client's wife if she refuses him indentation blackmail schemes. The two stars are well matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise, which is one of the best in the series.
