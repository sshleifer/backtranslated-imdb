Emilio Miraglio «The Red Queen Kill Seven Times» (1972), only the most perfect example of Giallo, that I have ever seen, mixing all the elements into one sinister corner precisely. First of all, and of paramount importance to me, it is a complex, convoluted plot that ultimately makes sense, and then the killer comes completely out of left field at the end. The story about a series of gruesome murders (you already know how much of the film's title, is not it?) What happens in the imaginary fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, is the involvement of one, and a killer, red cloaks figure out yourself crazy crazy laugh, is both frightening and memorable. Every great Giallo requires some wonderful lead actresses, and here we have a whole range of products, led by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bush as one of the two sisters, and one of his earliest roles, Sybil Danning as lewd vagrant in the fashion house, Barbara, Other a necessary component of a superior Giallo is catchy, hummable account and Bruno Nicolai provides one of the film that should stay with you for a few days. Wonderful scenery? Will you check it again Filmed mostly in Würzburg, Germany, treat eye picture exactly. Okay, okay, but what about those killings? In the end, it's not something that gialli all about? Well, I'm happy to report that most of the audience should be well pleased with the various knifings, shootings, impalement and other carnage that this film tasteful dish out ... not to mention the tombs, bizarre dream sequence, rat and bat (and a lot of them, too!), drug references, the rape scene, a red herring, and mandatory, in the face of AGO Paglia, laborer in the title role for the female audience. As I said, the perfect Giallo. Better yet, this DVD from the beautiful people, without any shame, and you know what that means: excellent printing and a variety of additional services to download! Thanks guys!
