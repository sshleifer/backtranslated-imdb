Amazing documentary. I saw it on the original and Airdate DVD several times over the past few years. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for best documentary at the Oscars, he was released in 2002. No other documentary is not even close. <br /> <br /> It's been on TV recently for a 5-year anniversary, but I missed the adventitious "where are they now" segment at the end of the day, except that I caught that Tony is working HazMat unit. <br /> <br /> I have seen criticism of documentary film-making from a few on the list. I can not understand how this could have been done differently. They had less than 6 months to get it together and get it on the air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised by the fact that according to IMDb.com, the brother did not have any projects in the four years since then. What did they do?
