Well actually no. This film is very interesting, though. Went and saw it with my girlfriend last night and had to use the procedure, "I think there may be something in my eyes." The film is a great mix of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carrey beautiful like down his luck reporter who is given the right to change himself and the city in which he lives. in fact, all the characters are great. the movie is not funny or too rich, a good movie to see with his wife. <br /> <br /> all in all 8/10 .... note * I am not an easy grader. That's all with BigV above and beyond!
