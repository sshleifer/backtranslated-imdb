Reading various external examinations Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics makes me ashamed to admit how much I love this movie, even though I only have dubbed-in-the Japanese version of a video about it. <br /> <br /> appears to many critics seem to perceive it as a negative, that the history of the premise has been used before, the most famous in a very large "is a wonderful life." For me, the major premise is a great room, no matter how many times it is used, and I would love to see more movies with this particular background - unhappy man who gets the chance to get a fresh perspective on his own life through a little "divine magic." <br /> <br /> I think people and criticism over intellectual tendencies not involved in the story, but I do not go to the cinema to criticize them with a notebook in hand --i go to the movies to rush into them, and let them take me where they are. <br /> <br /> If you are sentimental sorts, like me, you will be well rewarded by seeing this picture. Presentation overall is fine, and the film was very well chosen. Great choice of music too. Michael Caine as beautiful as the sympathetic bartender. Belushi doing a great job as the "average Joe" kind of guy who wonders if his life is not as it should be. Linda Hamilton, always great, again right on target here, as a loving wife. Jon Lovitz entertaining, as usual, and even has some surprisingly touching moments in "Mr. DestinyÂ». <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Destiny" is not an "It's a Wonderful Life", but who says that he must be? Taken on its own terms, "Mr. Destiny" is a pleasant, well-made, funny and touching film. I saw my Japanese dub video it many times, and I'm sure I'll see it a few more times. If something makes me a "cattle", so be it! I'm just glad I did not read the reviews of "Mr. Destiny" before seeing it. <br /> <br /> I think I should have the courage of their convictions and give the film nine or ten stars, but I could not doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews!
