Having read many of the other reviews for this movie on IMDb have alleged consensus among purists that this film has nothing to do with the books on which it is based. On this issue, I can not comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists of adventures before. However, what I can say with certainty that it is surprising to me that many of these reviewers must have certainly undergone a sense of humor bypass; Let's be honest - this film so much fun <br /> <br /> OK ?? .. so I have to admit that time that the film apparently is not representative of the character / s, but let it in! clear perspective ?? .. do one and the same person, quibbling on this film also regrets the fact that the classic 1960s Batman series to stay true to the original DC comic book character? Or perhaps there is STILL excitement in the same person, that the version of 1980 film Flash Gordon was too departure from the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is, yes, this film is incredibly camp, but it was his charm! <br /> <br /> The former Tarzan Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and has more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey in addition!) and supported by a large supporting cast, who all look to be with the ball are the respective roles of . Also note the very short, but very welcome appearance of favorite horror Berryman. <br /> <br /> The best scene? Too many to choose from, but check the funny facial expressions, adopted waiter when Savage and his men committed the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk a formal occasion! Sometimes it is a scene late in the film, where Savage decides his nemesis Captain Seas using various martial arts disciplines, which are indicated on the screen! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the film does not take itself seriously at all, and it is even more interesting for him. Great fun from start to finish! (And you will sing John Philip Sousa adapted the theme song for days after guaranteed!)
