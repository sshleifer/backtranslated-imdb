Man on Fire was hot. I love the classic story of the place is good, and what better reason for revenge than stealing an innocent little girl. <br /> <br /> The authors have done an excellent job in this film is to build relationships between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning), so that the viewer would understand and really feel Creasy drive had to save Pete. It was also nice that the crisis was not the prototype of a choir boy tried to save Pete through "own" channels, but instead used the tactics of torture and street smarts. Someone may say, "Torture is wrong no matter," and you may be right, but if you see Creasy pain goes away because of the loss of Pete and pure passion he has to get it back, you can not help but side with Creasy and entail it to be even more ruthless. There would have been no progress, if Creasy use diplomacy to deal with a variety of vile thugs and criminals, and he knew that. <br /> <br /> Creasy quest ended with the return of Pitt to his mother and Creasy dies bad guys in the vehicle. But death did not diminish the crisis in the film's efficiency, it is actually to increase it, by showing that the crisis was ready to die to get Pete back. His death was noble indeed. <br /> <br /> Denzel does an excellent job, as is done by the author. This film deserves good marks, because it certainly was a good movie.
