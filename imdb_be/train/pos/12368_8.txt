I had a TV companion for white noise, and heard a "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment," I ran into the room with a TV, waiting for another 70s Flick and get so much more. Fortunately, I could rewind to the beginning (DVR buffer) and press the record button to watch it completely. (Cinemax uncut and in HD no less!) Aside from some holes in the story and discontinuous incredible dialogue / events, it is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. Pretty awful and progressive time :. Character Beverly D'Angelo in masturbates in front of Alison Parker, played deftly Christina Raines, Parker range, very bloody way her father obvious MENAGE triples scene (do not let the kids watch) Full movie 70 full of bad clothes (polyester suits and sticky ascots) and decor, bad hair, over the bloated score, and friend watching a movie. The cast is excellent, take second place on the home page of this movie to check it out.It was amazing to see, Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles- always perfectly awful! Enjoy!
