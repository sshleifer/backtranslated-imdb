Clearly, many people have not seen this film, because no longer post any comment. This is not a film not to be missed. In the end, he won the George Peabody Award and Humanitas. Paul Winfield should have won an award for his amazing performance in this film. Eugene Logan, who was a co-author on this made-for-TV movie was also part of another film on mankind, or the loss of it, being the technical adviser of the film Truman Capote Glass House. This film is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will post another letter telling how it was that Eugene Logan came to be a technical consultant to the movie such a strange person like Truman Capote. Thanks for reading this and I hope you find a way to see these two films.
