Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan to take their flock from Seattle to Alaska and Canada to stake out. Once there, they have to contend with a seductive, ran entrepreneur Ruth Roman and ice, careless villain James McIntyre. <br /> <br /> John Wayne could get talked more, but his good friend Stewart made some wonderful, hard-edged and westerns, some with great director Anthony Mann. Honestly, I would do it, with its sturdy workflows and fine melodrama over northern Alaska on any given day! <br /> <br /> Far Country has some breathtaking scenery and cinematography, which must have been shot in widescreen. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some strong support from the always reliable Brennan, Roman (who is great), incredibly cute Corrine Calvet, and James McIntyre, who plays one of my favorite kinds of bad guy, the kind that It does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> This would make a great double bill with another highly recommended Mann / Stewart northwest Western set, bend.
