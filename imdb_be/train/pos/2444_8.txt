"George Lopez," in my opinion, is an absolute classic ABC! I have not seen every episode, but I still like it. There are many scenes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) entered in the moving parts of the machine. If you want to know why you have to see it for yourself. Before you wrap it up, I would like to say that everything has always given good performance, production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing is always were very strong. in prison, even if new episodes now any time you can see, I strongly recommend you to catch him just in case he leaves the air forever.
