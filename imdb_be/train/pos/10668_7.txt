As many observers have pointed out here, the film adaptation differs quite a bit from the dramatization of the story. I've never seen a stage version of the story, and so I have a more favorable review of the film, than a lot of other reviewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the director of the film, but the film is still entertaining by several dancers are trying to make the big time in show choreographer Michael Douglas. The film does right, without selecting any famous actors or singers start up in the final testing group. Thus, our attention is focused on the movements of the dancers and the individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day fitting outs. Douglas also probably not the best choice for the part. Obviously, some of the songs were cut in favor of the new, and has been added backstage clich√©s focused on the story of a romantic relationship between a dancer and choreographer. I must say in all fairness that is the weakest part of the film. Repeated incursions by Cassie made during attempts to enter, seems to reflect almost desperate requests often have to do if involved in artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past, and it is interesting to see this tired old boot heel of his feet again. Opening the dancers themselves were sufficiently promising to "I can do this" number, but then wandered off a bit at different points, and the dancers tell their stories. To be honest, their stories were not very different from the real lives of people who will never get a chance like this. *** 4 stars.
