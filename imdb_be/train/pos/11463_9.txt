I saw this film at the International Film Festival in Rhode Island and was completely blown away. The structure and design of the film was fantastic ... I know that it will not, but it really deserves an Oscar nod. Cal and Andre were phenomenal, as two troubled classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial, and I see a lot of people who have a lot of problems with it, because it has to do with the school shooting and forcing you particularly identify with murderers. Nevertheless, in spite of the harsh and blunt object, zero day so worth watching. I look forward to it coming out on video, so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the end of the sequence shooting leaves you speechless, because it's almost too realistic. Their lack of confidence in the "Recording", pictures and panic students, absolutely incredible. I really hope that it gets the attention it deserves. This is done in the same format as the Blair Witch, hand-held camera, made to act as a real home video documentary kind of cinema - but God is much better. Very impressive, hats off to all the participants. If you have a chance, you really should see it.
