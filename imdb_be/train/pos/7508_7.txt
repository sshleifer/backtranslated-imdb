Great performances by Gretchen Mol. This film is one of the best biographical movies to hit the screen after a while. While it covers a large part of the life of a young Bettie, he also managed to stay focused on the main path, which is something most biographical films, seems to be lacking. There is some great fun and menacing overtones in the dialogue and action. This film is a great break from the Dir. with "American Psycho," and I think it will show through, as her best work to date. Oh, and as the operator's naked, I give this film 100% in cine department. It was amazing how well they pulled off 50s look with modern film stocks. Honors to D.O.P. All around very nice. I recommend anyone to see him: 8/10.
