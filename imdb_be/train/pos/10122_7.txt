I found it a bit difficult to follow, to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle, when I tried to make head or tail, who fought, who and why. One of the problems is the cultural / language one. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem, about which we know little, and because we are simply reading English subtitles inevitably lose some of the subtleties. Another problem is that there seems to be too much, only half explained twist and overlap. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that there is a very bad Miiki film and it certainly is not that. Many stylish and bone crunching violence, the window on some of the less orthodox sexual movements plus the family aspect. Overall, a decent ride, but maybe checking out the story could actually be useful, before you watch it.
