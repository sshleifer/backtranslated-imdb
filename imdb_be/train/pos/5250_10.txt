The world consists of two different types of moviegoers ... There are types of "The English Patient", who can not be bothered to enjoy all that is not enough high-brow, which will be shown on PBS, and was is "happy" types Gilmore for which an hour and a half of genital puns definitely worth $ 7. <br /> <br /> of course, there are tons of gray area, but do you know which way you're leaning in. If you are an English patient person, save your time, save your money and save us all, "Oh, this film is so childish and stupid" comments. I Jedaiah, you will thoroughly enjoy belittling every movie you do not like, and every person who loves them, but maybe you could keep only once. <br /> <br /> But if you type Happy Gilmore. .. go see it ... you'll find it's fun. Tim Meadows created a cheerful character, and Ferrell continues to be fun for all about everything he does. go, check it. you'll be glad you did. and that's fine .
