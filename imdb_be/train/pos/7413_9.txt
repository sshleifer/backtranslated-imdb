Shower holds within itself in many ways. Almost all of the film take place in favor of the time bathhouse, with residents that provide humor, pathos and emotional strokes. Love and friendship between the owner and his late son and deeply moving. The way the older brother pulled into this tiny world seems to make convincingly. The plot is convoluted, full of surprises and paradoxes, and touched the whole sense of what I would call the good neighborly relations and conflicts performers. This film pulls out, I want to believe in the world again.
