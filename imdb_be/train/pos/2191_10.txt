Shakespeare said that we actors got into the big stage. But if this stage Israel work we interpret multiplied by ten, and all the actions that we are doing the full of the hard style. Dan Katzir manages to make a spectacular portrait of his life in Tel Aviv, but in addition, Katzir manages to reach the Israeli people hearts and this people is far from simple well-known figures, they tell us from the heart, Katzir film allows Israel to get away from the dark informative difficulties in which they live, and this beautiful country there is to light as a magnificent bird that is born from its ashes. This is very cool for me, because in reality the state of Israel, the Europeans know for informational journals or newspapers, is how close and Absolutly human reality, the reality of millions of people who are looking for their place, exploring the whole state, the whole culture with the sole purpose, to feel part of it. Katzir creates absolutely amazing documentary, and it shows that if a person movies enthusiastically deep feelings projected with force, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thank you Dan for open eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most amazing countries in the world.
