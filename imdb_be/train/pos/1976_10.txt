The man who directed "The Third Man" also sent a sequence of "Who will buy" in "Oliver!" Now that you have the talent. <br /> <br /> I raise my hat Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know that there is a "second unit" are involved, but still ... <br /> <br /> and he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> <br /> I believe the quality will out. <br /> <br /> (This will show in the final scene with Nancy [avoiding spoiler - everyone should see Oliver for the first time ever]) How much do I need to dial strings <br /> <br /> encourage people to gain too much to encourage <br /> <! ... br /> I hope it makes a difference, as "the 10th line".
