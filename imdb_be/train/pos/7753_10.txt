This Belgian film director Tom Barman, singer of the famous band of Deus, will not be approved by all. For the simple reason that it is not clear story or plot. This film shows just 24 hours in the "Cities" (here Antwerp) and allows you to watch and really enjoy the dialogues, directing, humorous (Dario!, Osteopathy Bruno! ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul. Garcin, ...) characters <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: Windman on the beach, a dance party at the end, KISS-fan, Windman visits an osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Obviously, some other viewers do not understand that it is so beautiful and interesting in this film. They complain that the film has no story, etc. But it's the atmosphere that keeps you watching, and that will pull you into it. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched yet, do not forget to listen to the music carefully. The soundtrack is unusual as well as Tom Barman and his band Deus. <br /> <br /> And Â«ssst, mondje DICHT it." (Do not tell anyone)
