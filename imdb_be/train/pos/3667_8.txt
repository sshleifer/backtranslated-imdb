North Hollywood is a satirical look at the time in the history of Canadian film, when the Government of Canada has offered huge tax breaks for made in Canada films. Most of the time she was treated as a tax haven or a cheap way to get American films are made. For example, x-Whipping released therefrom. In any case, Matthew Modine plays an aspiring producer who wants to make the adaptation of the beloved Canadian novel. However, in order to get the money he needs to be the name of the American stars. He gets the Loose Cannon, and learns that he has to make a compromise to the point where the film does not look like more than a book it was originally based on. He plays well in Canada, but can not be understood outside of the Great White North. Americans will think we are making fun of yourself but miss the point that we are actually making fun of them. For Canadians 8/10 5/10 rest of the world.
