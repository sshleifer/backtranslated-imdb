A long time ago I watched this movie since the middle of the cable. then I was in love with Mary Moronov. I saw her again in the food Raul. I was convinced that she was the hottest woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> I may have biased about this movie. 9 of 10 <br /> <br /> This is the only film I have on the original tape.
