This documentary was interesting, but it was also a long time (as long it lasts a total of 225 minutes), Ben-Hur long. But if your into that for you. But only if you have a passion for cinema, like me. Being that Martin Scorsese is my favorite director (live and perhaps even ever), it's very exciting, especially if you know, the work style of Scorsese. Because then you can figure out where he got his inspiration for many of his films. Not the best documentary ever made, but it is a jump for Scorsese, who is always good to look at.
