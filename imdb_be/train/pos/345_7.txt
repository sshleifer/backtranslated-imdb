The first hour or so of the film was mostly boring to say the least. However, improved after the start of valentine party. Besides twist as an individual murderer at the very end, a hot tub murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of the film. The scene in the garden with Kate is well shot and so was the very last scene (ie "turn"). In these scenes, there was some uncertainty and real thrill and hot tubs were scene kills unpleasant (crushing path should be) edge thereto. Earlier killings are depressingly devoid baked blood.
