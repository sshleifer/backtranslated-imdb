Can I be as simple and primitive in their assessments, to simply say, "I liked it"? That's pretty funny, bats, he got big stars, and this is a great look. Songs (there are about two, which are then repeated) are forgotten, but they get a healthy ironic treatment (for example, a very beautiful, Mr. Fairbanks explodes in a furious version of Wagner gentle ballad Miss Ghraib only provided); there is not much to dance with all 1861 crinoline wrapped around Miss Grable, and the comedy could be a little tight, but vyni still very uplifting. Pictures (including an open-air frames, which are a thrill) Surprisingly, playing with different shades of magnificent heavy gold. Miss Grable bit past her prime of stout on the side, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental "Olde Worlde" comedy. It is largely through the "down to earth" with Rita Hayworth, and that one tends to be very much loved by many. So I think a few people will be regarded as "Lady in Ermine" to be outdated and stuffy. But this is a fairy tale, and they tend to move together in a specific post, anyway. My guess - just to enjoy the works of art, costumes, witty script and everything else, this film has to offer, and stop complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany and with German and English audio track.
