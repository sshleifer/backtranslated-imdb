In 1990, the World of Disney television animation, of course, is the prime minister. Shows like Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears have been popular, and now Disney has taken another big cartoon and cartoon brought the birth of the Disney Afternoon. This cartoon is called Miracles on bends. This is the old character Jungle Book Baloo the Bear as he gets a job in a business plane. In the series, he meets Kit Cloudkicker, a former air pirate and a good surfer cloud, business woman, Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and has tons of great puns that you can not understand as a child, but to understand later in life. This is one reasonable written series, and it's great to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buy it for your kids and let them see all these horrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked the Miracles on bends, and then check the "Black Cloak" and "Goof Troop". Spin it!
