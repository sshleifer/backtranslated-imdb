This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director something unusual for his early films - cast with some stars. Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to penetrate the secrets of America - and they will stop at nothing to succeed <br /> <br /> The film begins. Peters on the subway watched by federal agents. They know that it is a link in a long chain of espionage. It is not known to all is the wild card in the equation - a fine pickpocket (Widmark) is also on the train, and he was able to steal secrets, Peters carriers. Widmark thinks it's just another wallet he plundered - only then he realizes the seriousness of what he had stolen. Now Widmark own - with. And the FBI Communists heels <br /> <br /> WIDMARK, and the rest are exceptional and the film captures from start to finish. Despite the fact that she did not get top billing, any special needs to be done with Thelma Ritter. This actress was probably the performance of her life as an informer. Rarely had she given it much of a chance to act, and I was impressed by her ability to play broken down and boring old lady. <br /> <br /> As for the writing and directing are, they are very well- bottle with one small exception. First of all, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted. This is one of the few times when on the tape, you will see a woman with his fist in the mouth area! Now it is difficult. Later, for unknown reasons, they are surprisingly close - too close to be believable. However, with so much drama and so effective Noir, as a film, it can be skipped. Watch this movie.
