This is not a bad film. It does not wildly funny, but interesting and <br /> <br /> entertainment. It has a few funny moments. Cher gives a good <br /> <br /> performance in a role that is the opposite of her real identity. It <br /> <br /> performance alone is worth watching. When this movie came out <br /> <br /> Today, he would not have been appointed, but the '80s standards this <br /> <br /> was beautiful.
