Inconsistencies in military school? Hmmm, it sounds funny, it may be offensive to some. You have characters there, the Arab thief, crazy teen sex, smart mouth, pot smoker, and not forget the guy who burns things. Throw in strict entirely nonsense Sergent, Sergent and one homosexual sex ammunition teacher, and it makes one crazy adventure. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie, and it's funny, because the comedy revolves around the fact that if you are trying to work together is done. <br /> <br /> This group of students in the solution of Weinberg military school was placed here because, as Sergeant Liceman quotes "because you rogue, difficulties in your family and community, Opal." One of the earliest appearances of Ralph Macchio before Karate Kid and My Cousin Vinny with performances by Barbara Bach, and this film appeals to teenagers and young adults. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack keeps moving film.
