I was about 11 years, I have learned, I live miles from 12:48 uncle home. Uncle house on Westway Dr, Deer Park, Texas. they added a home, since the film was made. I do not know the house number, but you can go see it. I'm 21 and I like to watch this movie. Bar Spencer is not them. Pasadena ISD wants to build them a school. I drove by the house last week in the house still looks great. My dad and uncle would go to the street where the house and see the actors come in and out of the house, trying to make a movie. where John is crossed by railway cracks they did 225 above. when I hear about John loesing his son I start thinking about when he made the urban cowboy, he was 26 or 25 at the time.
