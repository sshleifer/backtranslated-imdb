Quite a touching little film, and not just for kids. John Thaw is brilliant, as always (without any hint of him Morse Inspector). Boy plays William did a good job as well, although I did not find it convincing in every scene. I loved the whole look of a small village and a slow pace of life in those days. I also felt the scene in London, where historically accurate, as far as I could tell. <br /> <br /> It is strongly reminded me of the Scandinavian film that I've seen a couple of years ago called Mother Mine. This film features a boy evacuated from Finland to Sweden during the Second World War. family wife, taking his girl asked, because (as it turns out), she lost her daughter. As a boy, instead, that it completely ignores it. The fact that the boy says Finnish complicates matters even further. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed Goodnight Mister Tom, it has the same feel to it.
