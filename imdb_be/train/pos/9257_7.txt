Is this your typical woman in the chain of naval transport love story? Maybe hell, you know how the formula works at the moment, a beautiful woman is introduced in to the picture, someone has to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think that this film is not going to some of the typical story lines, but knows nothing about the content. There are great scenes from Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, Gary Busey, albeit short. Some things do not make sense, such as the need to get into random battles, but it is entertaining to watch the fights were really good. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a comedy of all, but it does have a lot of good feelings for him. Humor is well balanced and does not hurt your stomach for it, but you will keep a smile. <br /> <br /> There are a few steps evaporate so that not one for children.
