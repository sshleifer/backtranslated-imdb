good, but just silly. Not bad for a horror / comedy. I have read that people have moved it from Michael's version, and it's a good trick, in my opinion, because some adults hate horrors and when they see it will get them interested in horror movies, like this one, or maybe (and had never seen him ) horror (perhaps a comedy) uncle Sam, I'm going to see about renting or buying this movie, but the second one is better, it is one, but I bought it on VHS Amazon and received it on November 21, the day before thanks. It costs four bucks, l.o.l. in this film. <br /> <br /> 9/10
