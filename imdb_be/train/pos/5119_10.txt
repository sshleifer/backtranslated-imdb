I must say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can not even count how many times I've seen him. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans her body after he is clean-shaven look beautiful for her first trip to Jill, I was delighted. Debra Winger, as always, provide excellent performance as a young, naive wife bud, but with the necessary attitude to get married to a stubborn and hardworking cowboy. If you are not country music person I was not, this is one soundtrack that you will sing right along with every word. If you get a chance, please watch this movie, it did not disappoint.
