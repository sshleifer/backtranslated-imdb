This work is less about character, Davis, Steve Martin, what about Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon) and Klein and McDonnell (Claire), but inserted a dialog box through Davis ponders contemplative, almost poetic existentialism, at best, he witty, intelligent and thoughtful both in the delivery and content of the dialog box. Writers deserves the Oscar <br /> <br /> Productions easy, relaxed and natural. just what you would expect from the "list" actors. Martin is making its contribution to the work that leads to his later saleswoman, guiding you through life, love and the pursuit of wisdom, if not happiness. Kline straight - suit - conformist film, and as such his performance fresh and refreshing <br /> <br /> This paper deals with life in all aspects .. This creates a real emotional investment in his character, and leaves you with a sense of hope that mankind has not been convicted, in the end, no matter what you believe, deep down. <br /> <br /> In general? This is a great, rough with a flash or two, and a slight natural dialogue that draws you in helping your audience to receive high satisfaction from this work. It is definitely worth your time, though it may not be every one of the top choice in the Friday / Saturday night entertainment. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this intelligence exhibited. This is not the case, and was an unexpected surprise. Another great surprise was the honesty exhibited in this document. Couples and friends to hold detailed conversations that feel and sound quite honest, and (again) naturally. I was very impressed with this work, and will add it to the DVD collection in the near future <br /> <br /> He's rate of 9.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> hostile.:.
