This fascinating film is one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. This shows China, I have never seen or imagined, and I think that it shows 1930, China in the real world ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely heartbreaking in so many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and all the same story, and the ending is incredibly joyful. You really see the depth and heigths human existence in this film. Actors everything is perfect, so you feel like you really got into another world. <br /> <br /> I just can not recommend this film highly enough. It may just change you forever, once you've seen it.
