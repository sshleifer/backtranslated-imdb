Eddie Murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this HBO stand up comedy show.I love their impressions of g-T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden with «The Young", Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson too.The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo also funny.I saw it the first time, when he was released in 1984.I was laughing so hard I almost fell off my chair.I still think that it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy when he was on «Saturday Night Live», made me laugh so hard that he is one of the best people to get out of the «Saturday Night Live». "Eddie Murphy Delirious» is his best performance stand next to the "Eddie Murphy Raw.» <br /> <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs up and a 10/10 stars.
