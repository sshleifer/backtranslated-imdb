This movie has it all, action, wrestling, dancing, bull riding, music, pretty girls. This film is authenic look at middle America. Believe me, I was there in 1980, a lot of oil money, a lot of women and a lot of HONKY Tonks. It is a pity that they are all gone. The film, in fact just another boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, but this is compensated by the actors and music. There is absolutely no film with any best music, this film, and that includes the American graffiti. This movie I watch over and over again and never get bored. Every time I watch it, I'm young again, and it's time to get out HONKY tonking. The only reason why I only gave it a 9, because you can not appreciate the film Zero, I do not feel you have to evaluate a 10.
