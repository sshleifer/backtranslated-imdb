In what is probably the best outdoor adventure of all time, four urban children to resist the wrath of nature, survival stories. Installing the backwoods of Georgia, with its forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> The director, John Boorman, decided to use the local residents, and not an actor, to reflect a minor character. These locals feed the film with the depth of the bright characteristics in film history. No central casting "actors" will never be able to approach the wonderful faces, voices, or the actions of these people. I do not remember a movie where the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. As much as anything else, it's gritty realism that makes this film so strange. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film's theme. Nature, in the wild, can be tough. Like the way that the installation should be the American South. Very few places in the US is, or was, as violent as redneck country. In the history of Darwinian survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature, not separate from it. <br /> <br /> «Deliverance» is very much a product of its time when, unlike today, the Americans expressed concern about the vanishing wilderness. magnificent scenery of the film, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets, and ditch rapids, combined with the lack of civilization, all convey the environmental message. And this is another strength of the film. <br /> <br /> At the level of entertainment voltage gradually exacerbated as the portion proceeds. Not even halfway into the film stress becomes extreme, and then never lets up, not until the final credits roll. Few such films can maintain intensity level for such a long period of plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is top-notch. The direction and editing are impeccable. The cinematography is excellent. Dialogue is interesting. And the acting is terrific. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty cast perfectly and does an excellent job. And Jon Voight was nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film is the music, which strikes me as timid. <br /> <br /> In general, the "Freedom" is almost sure to attract viewers as outdoors. Even for those who do not, rough characterizations that act, and the tension of the plot is enough to see this movie, one of the best in the history of cinema reasons.
