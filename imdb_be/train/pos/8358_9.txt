Not many people like in the movies of Bertrand Blier, simply because they do not understand them. Just because they are different people. <br /> <br /> If you have not lived under a deep despair intertwines with great personal hope that it may be difficult for you to enjoy the humor Bliya listed here. <br /> <br /> Blier and a film can not easily be classified as black comedy or worship, etc. as in fiction, etc. Because it is a treat North American audience often fail to appreciate. <br /> <br /> When I looked at the dining room of the two 'bullies with Jeanne Moreau in a seaside restaurant, I felt that they were more Gentil, than any gentleman can be. <br /> <br /> desire to make love wildly as it is a normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless existence symbolizes the truck suddenly appears in Carrefour. <br /> <br /> Ok, forest valseuses much better than the name of the happening place. To waltz you have to be gentle, but you do not waltz.
