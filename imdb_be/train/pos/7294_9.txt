After reading a few comments, I felt that I had to add my two cents as well. "Sadness LostÂ» is one of the most memorable short, I think I've ever seen. I got a chance to see it at a festival in New York City independent film. I felt that this film was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was pretty complex - especially in such a short period of time. The story focuses on a young girl who is pursued her rigid father. She quickly given the choice to "stop" it plays a demon "Witchblade in Eric Etebari." Watching the show, I was struck by the strange way he played such a unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was a deeply complex, and he was very convincing. The action was absolutely gorgeous them. The girls were good, and my father was decent. There is also the death of the one who follows a girl around until she could not escape from their future. Effects and cinematography were absolutely stunning. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand of the budget for this purpose. Occasionally you can see such a high quality short. The discovery was absolutely spectacular compared with none of the main features of the film. This does not mean that it is not without flaws - I think it takes a bit to go, and the intro was a bit of time. But it stuck in my mind days after seeing it. There are very few shorts with a level of quality.
