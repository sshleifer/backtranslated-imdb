Invisible is made in the style more like the old Hollywood mystery than a horror show. The film is a bit slow, but a lot of bizarre images keeps it alive and film watchable. The basic idea of ​​young girls stalk something in the basement of an old, but good acting and production make the film worth watching. The film is notable for its emotional impact and, of course, not for any overt action or special effects. I rated it 8 out of 10.
