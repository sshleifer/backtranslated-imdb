This lovely little film has all the elements that made the spaghetti western is so exciting and fun: great music (one of few..if not only..female composer's work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), an exciting action sequences (and very evil of them during the day!), and beautiful scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a beautiful tragic love edge to it. Actors do amazing work - truly outstanding performances of Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for women in Sierra Leone with the Cardinals in "Once Upon a Time in the West" Spaghetti Western..outside). Without placing any spoilers, let me say that this film contains one of the best endings of any movie I've ever seen!
