No one really does not understand the logic of the numbering of the Italian zombie movie, but ?? honestly ?? why do we worry? Each film series «» Zombi- great pleasure, nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and «ZOMBI 3" is no exception to this, despite the production difficulties that occurred during filming. The film started as a fun project Fulci, who was supposed to develop further its success «Zombi 2", but it ended up being a typical product of Bruno Mattei with a lot of shortcomings and stolen ideas from the previous films. Scenario hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity, every brilliant idea from George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and "Crazy" shamelessly repeated here and effective performance is really unfortunate and painful to watch. However, all this does not upset me for a minute, because elevated above the uppermost gusset compensates for everything! On a secret military base in the Philippines, researchers completed a bacterial virus war «Death One» and to prepare it for transportation. After failing to attempt to steal the virus infected corpse terrorist cremated and the ashes zombies contaminates the entire population of the nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors must fight hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies and soldiers in white coats, who were instructed to kill everything that moves in the zone of radioactive contamination. This film can be compared with Umberto Lenzi in «Nightmare City». Really bad ... but incredibly addictive fast-paced action sequences and some very creative zombie madness situations. Undead birds were the original, for example, and the entire sequence of the birth of a zombie was pretty cool in a deserted hospital as well. The infamous flying head scene is not as bad as it is made to be, and it belongs in this very cheesy and thoroughly enjoyable Italian zombie flick. Recommended to fans; I do not mind negative reviews.
