Bell, Book and Candle was one of the greatest pop culture phenomena in the middle of the twentieth century, very similar to the Phenoms we see today (even in the 70s - more than a decade later - were still endless references to this film). This made Novak a huge star, a good thing to put on a resume Lemmon, in a new light, Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Zhingoldu new possibilities for the study of his career (both went on to continue to play a witch, and other interesting "old bat" in film and television). <br /> <br /> Along with the film 40's, I married a witch (who helped to make Veronica Lake icons), Bell, book and candle inspired by great movies and TV fascination with all things Witchy, which began with a witch and continued through Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> what I rarely see mentioned that the film is also quite interesting alternative Xmas movie. The story takes place during the Christmas holidays and despite the fact that this surface of witchcraft, in fact embodies a lot of Xmas spirit (giving, love, family, sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I will always watch this movie (seen him several times since my first show in the early 90s), especially if it is shown around or just after the holidays. It has style, substance, a large cast, and superb production values. And Adam's Rib, he accidentally expresses ideas that were very radical for its time, even now are radical (in both films the female character simple and powerful), and it always seems to be ahead of time.
