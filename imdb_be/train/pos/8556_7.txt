This film clearly fun.I has nothing to do with the original American Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another attempt, but it is better than the group and The Naked Mile camp, at least, ridiculous. <, Br /> <br /> Immediately after the first five minutes I was laughing my ass, so I decided to call my friend, and we would have seen it together.We had a few beers and we had fun. <br /> <br /> You will not find a profound message in this film, but it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> So, soak and just enjoy.
