13 days before the Glory tells the traditional story with sympathy towards the Mexican point of view. The main challenge in this film was the fact that while the cowboy actor James Arness played the role of Jim Bowie persuasively, the name of the other actors in the cast, Brian Keith (Crockett) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were too old. <, Br /> <br /> Raul Hooley played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity, due to the professional soldier, who eventually won the battle. The scene where he accuses his officers for having to install guard and prevent sortee is one the writers did not understand. Otherwise, to watch one of the main unforgivable in the army. Sant'Anna was within their prerogatives angry. Raul Julia superbly conducted the poor record across the stage. <br /> <br /> Bird York was an impressive Susanna Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York, maybe recalled that, as a kind of Pennsylvania Dickinsons they probably does not sound very Dis Southerner.
