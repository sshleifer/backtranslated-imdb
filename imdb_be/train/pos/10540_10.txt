I can only agree with a taximeter, it's a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience. Representation on the display, a visual interpretation of the script, the humor is constantly surprising. Two wires are big and really carry the film. My advice would be to not even see the trailer, just to make a movie and watch without waiting. I rented from Blockbuster, so it is readily available in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it, but I think that most people will have an opinion, and it is always good if it's not just "that was stupid. I loved this movie, you just can not see a gem like this every day. this should be a cult. Give it a try, you can just feel the same way about it as I do.
