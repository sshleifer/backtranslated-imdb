It's cheesy, it's terrible, it's full, but that's what makes it so fun. He got over the top melodramatic moments that are simply ridiculous. This movie is great to make fun of. Rent, for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The film centers around three women announcers during the way to cell phones. They go to a small town to cover the festival, but they can not get a room to stay overnight. And when they meet Ernest Keller. He is terrible in Psycho kind of way. And he invites them to stay in their home. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> performance Stephen Furst so amazing as a "secret" that he really carries the film. Much of the film seems boring, but to find the truth of Ernest family is kind of interesting. <br /> <br /> Just seeing this roll in these scenes makes it worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make good eye candy. <br /> <br /> I believe that a film old stone, it is difficult to find and worth a look.
