Despite the fact that this film is placed Davis at the map because of its brilliantly intense work as a broker illiterate waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this film is remarkably satisfactory to me as a whole. Actions really well in most all respects. What I can not understand for the life of me just how and why Philip, sensitive, well-mannered young man to the constant abuse that tramp constantly dishes out of it, I believe that it is quite naive tolerance incredibly funny in some ways. Yes, I know that he is a sensitive club feet, introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a poisonous witch, no one that cultivated affected her attitude or actions and make it believable. Davis strange in their roles, so it can go overboard in its theatricality now and then, but it's bright creative image any which way you look at it. It is a pity that it does not play a gangster Moll. Her character would be completely believable as a vagabond among the low lives!
