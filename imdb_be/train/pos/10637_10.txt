Last harem best film that I have seen in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ã–zpetek. Sensual shot and a stunningly depicted, Last harem bold film that solves the interracial romance that is so taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors, fill the film. Cut off from the outside world, women entertain each other, telling stories of intrigue, rivalry and jealousy in their ranks.
