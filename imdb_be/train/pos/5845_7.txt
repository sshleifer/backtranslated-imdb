I enjoyed this film is much more than something led me to wait; from reading the other comments here, I suspect that it benefits tremendously from the full-size viewing screen in the cinema, in the company of cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was lucky enough to have this experience, covered in the ripples of laughter from all sides, and had a very good time with this unpretentious comedy. <br /> <br /> As a comedy that shines when it shines anywhere at all. Music is nothing special - in fact, I did not understand that it * was * a musical, and was very surprised when I gathered ancestors broke in half say lyricism - but I have to admit that half threat, half a promise, "Oh, that I'm going to do ... "proved far more eye-catching than ever, it seemed, at the time, as it will continue to be a top in my head! <br /> <br /> plot, such as it is, to a large extent revolves around the past history of the same name Francesco, a portrait of the sixteenth century sports clearly anachronistic hair and fur. Her idea of ​​the sanctity of marriage is not quite mockery to those of her distant descendant, Countess Angelina, and you can almost hear the story creaks at the seams under the strain of the Production Code in order to ensure that the character comes from her unblemished save many a marriage bed with the right person .. . <br /> <br /> novel is hardly strange, but in fact the first few scenes, played very well, right on the brink of exhausting. But where the script and the movie really come to life in the battle of the sexes, which is worth. Chutzpah courtship Douglas Fairbanks Jr. married Angelina Ghraib is matched only by Betty Grable-and Francesco persecution on them, in turn, led to a complete change of roles in a fun fantasy sequence where it is - literally - sweeping his with his legs. This is probably the culmination of a comic story, although the consequences understandable confusion Colonel worked with a deft touch in the remaining two "action" from the operetta-structure, and the spectacle of the blessed, stunned awakening Fairbanks follows more or less the price of admission alone. <br /> <br /> Grable is quite convincing in the creation of its two contrasting characters wisely it receives almost all (limited) opportunity of singing, and shares honors, where swathes cited dialogue in various verbal duels are concerned. But in the unspoken reaction, it really surpassed her male support retracted; Fairbanks, in particular, is an absolute pleasure in some wordless sequences, settings and humor guards silent screen. <br /> <br /> This film is too uneven in style to be classic, ranging from brilliant wit a battered boredom. But at best, this is quite frankly very funny actually, and brought round of applause and laughter through the audience at the end, as the lights came on. With the tune of his time, he may not be able to attract a modern audience - but, according to this indicator, does not really deserve to be rejected as Grable and Preminger, in the credits () director. This is not a masterpiece, but thoroughly entertaining little work, and I for one have appeared smiling in memory all the way home.
