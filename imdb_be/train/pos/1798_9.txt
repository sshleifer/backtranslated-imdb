I am seen this Saturday evening at the festival Provincetown movie, and this movie sticks to your bones - it really stayed with me. Very smartly adapted from what is probably a wonderful novel, a drama back and forth in time with a fully rounded characters, elaborate chewing gum on the choices in life, and I'm not exaggerating. one of the greatest casts ever assembled in more than 100 years of film-making. Excellent work of all, led by the luminous Vanessa Redgrave as the die is mistaken Newport matrons, and Claire Danes as her much younger than himself. Daughter Streep IAMI Homer is as mom Show transaction; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman, circa 1958, and not to overplay the charm; and it's nice to see such great theater actors like Bostwick and Eileen Atkins promotes sharp, detailed cameos. Hugh Dancy, as well as on the stage, brings a big edge in a few clich√©d roles accidents rich spendthrift, and family problems are resolved, perhaps more accurately, than to allow in real life. But this is deliberately paced, visually magnificent meditation on the real-life problems, and you can cry on it and do not feel like you so recklessly manipulated. In addition to being a luxurious parade of 1940s / 50s cars.
