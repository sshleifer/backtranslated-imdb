Magnificent surprise of Spanish cinema. I never thought that moles can be such a great director, in the end, I really do not care much for him in the movie of choice. However, this film was absolutely fantastic, and is not predictable at all ... something I always enjoy! He did not use a large good press, and I do not think it will ever be released in the US market. We must be content with a DVD or VHS, if even that ... I do not want to say much about the story, because I do not want to spoil it for you, but basically a film about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah only for kicks and get money out of it (as sooooooooooo much) before he knows what he omitted in his life he did not count on.
