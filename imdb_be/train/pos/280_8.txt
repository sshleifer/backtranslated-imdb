Immortal is a very good game that brings some new elements to the tired genre of first-person shoot em ups. It tells the story of Patrick Galloway expert occult and formidable fighter, which is caused by one at his estate in Ireland to explore some amazing phainomena. The game takes place in Ireland after the First World War alone, so do not expect to find weapons, like rocket launchers.All chainguns or weapons in the game can be considered antiques, but the real fun of the game of his spell and the system they work on .Our hero duplicitous so he could use both hands at the same time: he reads the spell with his right hand and uses his weapon to shoot and left.So can cast spells at the same time, which, as you know, a lot of fun and also unique for this game! The graphics are great, and they can work very well on medium power P.C..Level design is also cool and atmospheric. Basically, the game revolves around the manor house and the Covenant, but there are many other places waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to the talent Clyve Barker game has a storyline and a free plot (something very rare for a first-person shooter) and I said to the great atmosphere and very terrible voice acting is also good, but not excellent. But the game has two major drawbacks. First of all, it's quite linear so if your mission says, for example, go into the room, all the doors in the house will be blocked except those that lead to the room of your mission, it can save time, but it limits your freedom of exploration. Secondly, the fact, all weapons antiques may not appeal to the majority of FPS players who are used to high-tech weapons. As far as difficulty is concerned about the game is very well balanced. Most of them are of medium difficulty, but sometimes it gets more difficult, but not frustratingly difficult. In general, an immortal great game. Definitely one of the best FPS out there.
