It's not my favorite WIP ( Â«Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous films in the subgenre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who for the moment have already prepared several MSZA. Obviously, the film tries to play with the established formula. The film takes place in a US prison, and not in the "banana republic", like most of the WIP films. I'm not sure if it was a wise move, but it is acceptable to change the tempo. Writer-director Demme really gets into his work, always digging new ways to present the familiar script. In fact, he is too ambitious for its own good. The director creates some surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious, but it's fun to see how hard he tries to put this film higher than the average wave of chicks-in-chains. But do not worry, Demme is still working within the parameters of the sub-genre. There is a lot of nudity and violence, that will satisfy the hardcore fans. The film is a bit slow, but it is very interesting. Toss well. Roberta Collins is a veteran of the WIP, so it needs no introduction, and Barbara Steel horn in a wheelchair cover crazy caretaker. Greer is too small though.
