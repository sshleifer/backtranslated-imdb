Emma is the best there is, in my opinion. Seeing another version (1996), which is also good, and to read the book, I think I can safely say with certainty that this is true and the interpretation is the true masterpiece of Jane Austen. One one thousand nine hundred ninety-six movie with G. Paltrow is good too, it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether. It is very light and fluffy, you can not see dark edges of characters, and if you just want a nice film that could have been done well, but the subtlety of some of the plot points, such as weaving Churchill / Fairfax hushed up so much, that practically does not exist. But if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more realistic and multi-dimensional, 1996. The TV version is the highest. Emma a wonderful person, but it is not suitable. Kate Beckinsale artfully showing little strange character. You see her eyes accidentally disgust at some of the more simple conversation Harriet Smith, but it does not show any remorse for having destroyed the Harriet proposal until this action has the effect of ruining their own family fortune in the final. You see it in the mirror narcissism and Frank Churchill that they will do harm to others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​he played matchmaker and having a new friend to pass the time with recovering from the loss of her governess to marriage. To Frank Churchill, is to ensure the promise of the woman he loves and treats her abominably and others to keep the secret. In the book, she realizes that all this devastating wake of all the blunders she made. And Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Pelty convincing in his repentance, but Pelty more children and stagnant while awakening Beckinsale is quite real and serious, and you can see the transition from the nursery, selfish behavior to good and thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer this one.
