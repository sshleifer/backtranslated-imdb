This film makes a strong comment about the Italian people at that time. The use of mirrors to improve the discovery of characters is wonderful, and I can not fail to mention the beauty and charm of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. Their mode of interaction is so beautifully and naturally, you can ask whether in fact there is a camera. The husband, in his brief role as perfectly portrayed as a fascist Italian who commanded his wife and children, but in its own way, a loving father. Beginners scene with Hitler at Piazza Venezia with all Italians incredible and actually contains the film historically. I loved this film and I agree that it is ridiculous, it is not better known.
