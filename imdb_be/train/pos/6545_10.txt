I really liked this movie. Most of the reviews were bad, but most critics thought that the film should be the idea of ​​the drama. This film has a bit of drama, but otherwise it's just pure fun and very interesting. Forget about Julia Roberts to be Pretty, Emma Roberts beautiful young lady is more to her than just that. Emma was so much fun to watch as Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I believe that she will go far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew can not be based on the books, but the story is still good. There is also a good mix of other character actors and supporting actors like Pat Carroll, Bostwick, Rachael Leigh Cook and Chris Cattani - will not count. I am surprised that Disney does not release this film. Some people may not like this film, because it does not contain sex, violence and abuse. This is a good family film, which is rare in this day in time. So take your family to see this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can not wait to continue.
