I started to watch a replay of the TV movie on a Sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another stupid airplane disaster flick. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Â«Pandora's Clock" is an intelligent political thriller, which goes far beyond the quality of most television films. He could just as easily made his debut on the big screen. <br /> <br /> In roles perfectly, including veteran actor Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and Robert Loggia. Zuniga finds himself in one of his best performances as a medical specialist who works for the CIA, and Fraser Jane Leeves is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and fascinating history everywhere. In fact, the last hour is so full of plot twists and suspense that you can not leave a place for a second. If you get a chance to see this film, wasting time - almost four hours. You will be well rewarded!
