Children, I took this movie loved it (four children between the ages of 9 to 12 years, they would give him 10 stars). Emma Roberts was the perfect in the title role. (We look forward to see more of this next generation of Roberts in the future.) After overexpose with the likes of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was nice to see a girl who did not look like she was working the streets. It was also nice to see the supporting cast, which included Tate Donovan, Rachael Leigh Cook, Bostwick and Monica Parker (with a cameo Bruce Willis). The final takeaway :. Cute movie <br /> <br /> (Note: I have not read the series of books, so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone.)
