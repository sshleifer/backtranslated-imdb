As a guy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. I mean, once you've seen how it goes from laughter to paranoia instantly during the season and after every small gesture he made to believe that he was a gangster, in the thought to myself: Well, he's a good actor, and he can get into the skin of a gangster, but after seeing it, opening his eyes and fighting for his life, I mean, I could almost feel the pain that he "made", we believe that he is going through. I was so moved by his performance, I immediately thought, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely better their generations, and even more. But they are now either old or dead (Brando), and it is normal that they make fewer films and their performance "lighter" than before. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other films, where it provides a completely different role. Can I recommend some of his old movies, where he gives a memorable performance?
