Great movie and a great example of how scary movie can be really shows the viewer nothing. This is a collection of four short stories that revolve around the residents of an old-fashioned house magically and their various heinous and terrible fate of all connected with each other by means of a wrap-around story of Inspector of Scotland Yard in the search for a missing star horror movie. It begins with the story of the mysterious writer, the protagonist becomes a bit too realistic, follows the story of two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over the wax figure at the museum, then the story of a sweet little angelic child, nothing but closing with a history of what happened to the missing movie star ?? and what he does with the inspector. This gorgeous printing that allows you to really appreciate the work Duffell director and that he was able to achieve a very small budget. Add to this the existing talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Ekland Ingrid Pitt and John Pertwee and you have a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. Just do not answer the phone when someone from Stoker Real Estate requires to offer you a deal on a beautiful home in the English countryside ??
