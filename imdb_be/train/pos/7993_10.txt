There are many reasons to watch this film to see the reality, whips Latin American involvement in the kidnapping of things, police corruption at the continental level, among the many realities that we live in a Latin. <br /> <br /> In the performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy continues to be a great actor, and that it continues this way. Dakota Fanning is only 10 years old, has become a great actress and I congratulate her. The rest of the film was a miracle, I have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope that they have happened from those who produce Hollywood to make a film entirely in Venezuela, where they show our reality better due to the delay, drug trafficking or political problems. They were a few films, they play Venezuelan soil (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly), they need to do more, just as they do in Mexico <br /> <br /> The song «Una Mirada». I hope he goes on the soundtrack, it's great. My voice is 10/10
