this film to see. the most faithful picture of what is happening in the world that I have seen from Darwin's Nightmare. Go it! and if you are lucky enough to open it in your city, be sure to see it on the big screen instead of DVD. Drawing up sharply and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through, but probably not fully. Joan Cusack countries and rest of the cast is good too. It is encouraging that John Cusack got this film made, and I believe that he had to use some of his own money to do it. It is a wild, absurd trip, obviously, made without the necessary resources, but still possible. Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, the SNL, even Bill Maher has not shown the courage to say that this movie says.
