My love for Chris Rock depends on his films, I hated it after Lethal Weapon 4, but I hated everyone in this film after it.I like him when he is not holding back, as in the dogma. Well this is it even better, entirely expected that it will be good.Laughed my ass all the time. Chris Rock delivers a sweet wonderful story, with the support of some of the funniest comedies I've seen in a while. I liked very much.
