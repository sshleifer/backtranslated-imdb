So, when I was a kid, I got this movie as a gift, and my sister, and I loved it. we would have seen it all the time. when our friends arrived we would sweaters and we are going to look big rock candy mountain and charming toys grandfather. I'm 21 now and I still love this movie, an old friend and I recently got together and watched it, we knew we had all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster, when we were little. One on the one actually bought this film and charming toys grandfather her 2-year-old daughter, because she wants to convey our love for this film. It really is a movie you can let your kids watch and do not feel safe, no violence, no profanity, but many beautiful songs and important lessons.
