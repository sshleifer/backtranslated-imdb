I'm not sure that this comment contains the actual spoiler, but I play it safe, so do not read it if you have not seen the film. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and so are all I work - and this is the point. I spent much of his working life in a movie, not as an actor. Such people are the heroes of this film _sung_: in illuminators puller, the air directors, lighters and writers, costume people, etc. etc., and all this talk, from their point of view, at least a large extent. Most of the actors are nuts and self-centered to the point of absurdity, and that the film spoofs so well, but you have to work with the actors to recognize that this film is a real life drama! Possible spoiler warning: in one big stage, the two wires, the two actors who both _discussing_ _discuss_ something personal, something completely "out of the scenario," with another actor, and they begin to make up lines, rehearse them and criticizing the performance each other. <br /> <br /> Since the film came in that it was 91, it became fashionable to do so, especially on television. But hardly anyone has done it so well.
