If you are a fan of a large ensemble casts Altman, as evidenced in major films like M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and less seen films such as a wedding, then you will no doubt entertain health. Centered around health convention, where two women running for president, Health, contains many of Altman's last 70th regulars like Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, as well as including a top star Altman newcomers Lauren Bacall, James Garner, and Glenda Jackson. How many Altman ensemble film, there are many subplots in this movie, but it's not overwhelming, as movies like Nashville or wedding, and she has a sense of Centering possibly as M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. All this is an obvious satire on health movement, filled with over-the-top, strange, contradictory characters, with guest stars such as Dick Cavett provides a sour note on the whole thing. Emphasizing the entire election process is characterized by pessimism Altman about politics and public appeal, but what is the most attractive in this film is pure fun, most people seem to have. This will be one of the last of Altman films like this for a while!
