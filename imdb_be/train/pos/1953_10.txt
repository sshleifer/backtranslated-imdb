After all, this film was based on the true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well-off, it was just scary how realistic it really was! Act that gave the film that push to greatness. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton depicted protagonist Patsy McCartle, which had two sons who she liked. Her performance did real life story come to life on the TV screen. It was very hard to watch some scenes as they were so real as to what happens when one becomes addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> Just watching it is very loving mother to go from sweet without worrying at all was difficult, but precisely. I know people who have gone through withdrawl, and it was very similar to what happened in the movie, from what I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought that it was very risky to the director wants to make a film with what happened to this woman. However, it was done so well. I applaud the director for creating this film. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this to anyone who knew who ever addicted to drugs or just to find out what can happen to you when you get used to them,
