"Really good story with a moral about brotherly love" describes this amazing film by David Lynch. This was particularly "strange", because he was not the kind of movie was to put out in the last 15 to 20 years old Lynch. It was dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Mulholland Drive), and it's the other way around. I know I disappointed many of his fans. Others were in awe of him. Count me as one of the last, and I have all three of these "dark" movies too. <br /> <br /> It was yet to true life story, in detail a trip of an old man sitting in lawn mowers from Western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his sick brother that he had not spoken to for years, but wants to see before the last stamps. Well, I think that the building - the old man behind the wheel of the mower 400 miles - still makes it "odd" kind of movie, so Lynch is in the nature of this! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays a major role. He's one of those guys, those wise, wise voice, restrained personality-wise, that almost everyone loves. Wrinkles on the face is said a lot of history. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after the movie was released. <br /> <br /> In the first 25 minutes of this film is not so much and not always pleasant, as it shows the main adult character and mental-challenge child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but when Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins its journey, the story picks up. I played it for a few friends, and they thought that the film never took, but I'm generous with him. I think this is a hidden gem. For them it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I have found that it is quite an exciting ride, but you need to understand in advance is not going to be disturbing Lynch history of crime. This is slow, and if it's okay with you, you could have it. Charm comes into the picture in some people Alvin meets along the way, such as willful young girl runs away and some of the good people of the city to help the old man, if he gets in trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan, is a standout in this regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing, but this is a joke: it only in the final few minutes of the film <br /> <br /> Iowa scenery pleasant. I lived there for several years and can attest to the hilly and rich soil. is good condition with good people .... like this film.
