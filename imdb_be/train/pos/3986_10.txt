I am a college student studying A-Levels and need help and comments from those who have any views at all about the subject's mother in the film, the mother. If you've been through something like this, or just want to comment on and help me explore more about this film, any comment will be very grateful. These comments will be used solely for the purposes of the examination and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any views at all, I'm sure I can put them to use, and you could help me get A! I also study "On Boy» and «Tadpole», so if you've seen these movies as well, I would be grateful if you leave a comment here on this page. Thank you.
