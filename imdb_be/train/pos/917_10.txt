I watched it in July, and even with a Christmas theme, found it touching and palpable. This is not for someone with the reality of the mind as it is full of fantasy and wonderful moments that sometimes do not make sense. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I just saw him in a remake of Long, Hot Summer, where he played a weak character. But in this case, the expression in his eyes around as Hank considered what happened to him, it was a beautiful and gentle. Bertinelli was a wonderful and beautiful, as usual, and very believable in the role. And Peter Falk as Max was wonderful and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including one where Hank knows who Max was actually in his life. It's not all ..... especially those who are not in "good health" films, and this is definitely one! If you want everything to be perfect and have the sense to avoid it. But I think it's well worth repeated viewing, so I taped it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs. :)
