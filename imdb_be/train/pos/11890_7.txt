It is rather dull film. Well-frame with realistic plays, especially a good one Depardieu as a boor and a bad boy with a realistic locations mood and arthouse connotation in all, it fails because the director does not take any position, standing or critical comments on the subject, he provides. One of the revered and regular working partner of France in the film with Depardieu - I believe that they did 7 times - Pialat can not participate. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for bad boy who will be hurt if they have finished a caring friend and a good husband around. Huppert, who plays with a careless philanderer honors shame offers answers like "I do not know"; "I love your hands"; "I like the way he makes love" to her inquisitive husband, who is trying to hit it out of the house, but palliates and rethinking, because ... I think he loves her. Thus, it takes and hope for what? What she will wake up and get over it one day. Things like this did not answer indulgent style docu-drama bowls with long speeches, and even longer scenes that do not add up. I know that the answers are not made up, but please, take a stand. Jules and Jim, etc., it is not. Last Frame as cold as in the movie we just watched this suffering and pain is only the most simple.
