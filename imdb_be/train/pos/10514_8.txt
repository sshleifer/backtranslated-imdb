Emma terribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I have not read the book, so I do not really know that much about the plot, and yet I still had predicted almost the whole plot. There were also a lot of scenes, which disappointed me because of bad writing or directing. The film though for some reason it is very interesting, and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes that I did not like, but most well-acted and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of his best performances as the heroine Emma. The film also stars Toni Collette (who have a good, but was much better) Ewan Mecgreger (which was also better, but it is still very good here), Alan Cumming (who I've never really been impressed and pretty much the same here) and North (Who performance, and wooden, at first glance, but is actually quite thin, even if it was not the right thing) There have been a lot better adaptation of Jane Austen's books, but this one is still very interesting and worth look.
