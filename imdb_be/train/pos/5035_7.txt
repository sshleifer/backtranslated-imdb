McConaughey in the horror / thriller? I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The story is told in a retrospective mode, and this applies to the otherwise normal and happy family of three people going through a very strange position. I can not say much more without spoiling the whole movie, I'm sorry. Just know that if you decide to watch it, you will, at least, with surprise. <br /> <br /> All the major players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job guiding the child, and its effect is amazing. McConaughey acting is solid throughout and meets the requirements perfectly. <br /> <br /> This film challenges you to think. Is dad was crazy? Is there a God? There are demons? How far would you go to right the wrong. And what is the "right" anyway? I still think. <br /> <br /> And so, I recommend "fragility". 7/10, and it is one of those movies that deserve and award a second or even third viewing.
