While I loved the ghosts home movies such as Poltergeist and Amityville, this is done for the television adaptation of the book packages Susan Hills huge blow to the Hollywood horror. <br /> <br /> With a brilliant gypsum (many of which stars palpitations and other TV drama), a lot of action, and fantastic settings (reflecting the life of the 1920s convincing), it has all the necessary ingredients to entice the viewer into what a powerful sense of history. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence, gore, or to send a shiver down the spines audience. Using its own view, The Woman in Black is a figure of fear and horror, and whose presence is never absent, as she is the first. <br /> <br /> The main character Arthur Kidd, an attorney learns about its invisible ghost on his mission to settle the estate. Widow dies and Arthur spends several nights in her sad house where he sees a lot of strange things that may haunt him for a few days. Some scenes are very disturbing and claustrophobic, especially a locked room that opens itself, which turns the generator off and closes Arthur in the dark. The film becomes more painful, the more you put yourself in the shoes Arthur, and his efforts to get rid of the ghost away. The author puts a lot of cooling additions to the story, an example of which is a tin soldier re-appearance. One wants to know the meaning of it all. The fact that we may never know that in fact a lot of the widow, leaves more imagination and makes it all the more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The widow, for the most part, it looks vicious and terrible. The scene after the generator winding down Murashko sent me, a woman who appears out of nowhere on an isolated marshy ground, howling wind ?? having been on such properties he can appreciate how to isolate it. And the scene in the hotel was probably the most horrible thing I have ever seen, one I do not want to look in a hurry or show older relatives. I often wake up at night thinking that she was behind me in a dream. <br /> <br /> The Woman in Black is an excellent TV movie and lost gem. I agree to some extent, Internet advertising for this film was completely blown out of proportion and could understand why people were disappointed after spending the best Â£ 50 on it, but I think that a clear victory hidden gems, because it makes such films as they overexposure, I think it's still a brilliant and fantastic acting, and I think it's the biggest story of the ghost of the last century.
