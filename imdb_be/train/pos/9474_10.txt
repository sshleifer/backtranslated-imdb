I have to see this film at a preview and was blinded by it. This is not your typical romantic comedy. I do not remember laughing so hard in the film, and yet moved by it. Laughter is not suppressed here - "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way» they're observing, laughter of recognition, small bumps I'm not giving away the plot, which is more than just a "guy falls in love with girlfriend his brother. "The whole family plays an important role in the relations here. Perhaps the best combination of laughter and warmth, as "While You Were Sleeping.» <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes much deeper than he had gone before, and the first time I really loved it. Acting strangely, the list of veterans of theater actors, whom I loved in other roles, but they merge to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest as beautiful as her mother, Juliette Binoche, bright and cheerful (who knew she was funny?), And even reviled Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touching execution. Soundtrack Sondre Lerche is a great addition, and I'm going to buy a CD, a second one is available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it.
