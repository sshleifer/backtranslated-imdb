Do not wait for the image of "truth." However, the accounts of these veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan require thoughtful consideration. <br /> <br /> The main advantage of the film is that it clearly reflects the words and the wounds of war vets and their post-war struggles to restore a degree of normality and functionality for their lives. <br /> <br /> My main criticism of the film in two ways: it is one-sided and against the war activities, but more than anything, to correct the serious deficiencies of Veterans Affairs and military assistance programs for those who 've suffered and still time suffering from war injuries. It is not fatal flaws of the film. <br /> <br /> As a veteran myself, I know that the terrible consequences of the war is real, and these young men and women to articulate it very well. These vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and suffering that most veterans experience and that ordinary people have to understand, because the horrors of war are all so hurt and anxiety.
