That's what the storage vessel should be. And Pushing Daisies justify these expectations. Beautifully designed and well-thought-out show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few shows left on the prime-time, that has integrity, and is good for the whole family and sparks your imagination. We are not talking about normal activities, sex, money, or the murder of angles of any other show on TV This shows that make you think and laugh, but, though the main story might seem impossible, the concepts real for all of us. I want what you can not have, hoping for someone to want us running away from his past and find family, even in the most unexpected places, etc ... <br /> <br /> I understand that ABC has basically canceled this great show at the moment, and is likely to replace him with some show as a point of integrity. I believe all will return to the money ... it's too bad that there is no other show on ABC, that actually make you feel good after watching.
