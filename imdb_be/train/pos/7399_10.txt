My choice for the greatest movie ever Lawton in the "Night of the Hunter", which is excellent in my canon. But perhaps it was supplanted by "souls", which is the most artistically Taoist film that I've seen. Thus, taking care of other presented leakage water and thus water can be done inspiration and comfort and cleaning, etc. It is the essence of Tao. It can be argued that in NOFTH shower threads and similar, Lillian Gish and that the first represents the purest form Christian both baths operators are daosizma pure form. I do not in any way oppose this interpretation. Both films are a visual delight to the integration of idea and image. However, the shower is a kind of unstylized sacredness of everyday life that I give her a nod. I tend both.
