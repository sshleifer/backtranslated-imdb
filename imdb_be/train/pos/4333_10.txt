I saw this outstanding film preview- large characterizations- witty and clever dialog- actors were fantastic- Peter Falk is up for an Oscar Paul Reiser was charming- photo was amazing Reiser was in the theater, when we watched the movie, and he gave a vivid picture of establishment of a film that was a long time dream of his to write a semi-autobiographical account of the relationship between sons and parents, or rather, between him and his father, this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion-supporting cast has been chosen well and gave the film a sense of the level, I recommend family of Phil m for those who want to see intelligent drama and great performances
