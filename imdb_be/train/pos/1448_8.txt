Across the country, and especially in the political landscape, people with any political ambitions, should take time out to see this movie. The film is called «City Hall» and with a little imagination, its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It just happened to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician by the name of Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) from enough sense to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort. his right hand is not that other, as Deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) as a bright personality that his ambitions are associated with his teacher, and both seemed to be intended for higher position. Everything points in that Cyrus Ku, while shooting the police did not ignite investigation spearheaded by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), who finds fault points to the town hall and mayor. A six year old boy and the death of a police officer accused of a criminal career is uncertain, freedom leads to an apparent cover-up of political gains and the city corruption involving trade union leaders like Danny Aiello played Frank Anselmo, corrupt judicial officers, judges Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses, Paul Zapatti (Franchoz), who are deeply involved. Also involved, Party officials, as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff), who works on probation in New York. But the relationship between the mayor and his deputy, who scolded by random shooting. Excellent car for Cusack and a sure bet to become the nominee of the classics. ****
