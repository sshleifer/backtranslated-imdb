Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot mystery. I confess I have not read the book, despite the passionate fan of Agatha Christie. Adaptation is not without problems, there were times when humor and were valiant attempts to get it right, there was a bit exaggerated, and the event that led to the final decision was rather rushed. I also thought that some slow moments, so some of the secrets of felt pads. Nevertheless, I loved how Hickory Dickory Dock was shot, he was very similar visual style to brilliant Kills ABC, and it really set the atmosphere than the dark-operation of the camera and dark lighting. Darker moments were somewhat appalling, it helped one of the most fascinating musical adaptation Poirot, maybe not as alarming as one in a two-buckle boot that gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the necessary ingredients, although not as confusing as Buckle My Shoe, and in a sense, it's a good thing. The action was very good, David Suchet perfect (I know that I can not use that word forever, but I can not think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) as Poirot and Philip Jackson, Pauline Moran make their entire justice characters brilliantly. And the students were great person and well developed as a whole, in particular, Damian Lewis, Leonard. In general, a solid mystery, but not ranked by the better. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
