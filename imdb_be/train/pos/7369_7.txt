Personally, I could not get in, "This is not a love song", his brilliant film and have a big storyline in this, I just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minuets to see how much is left on the film. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between the spike and the coat that there is close they depend on each other to survive in life. At the same time I want the relationship was more than that. Heaton in love with a spike, but Spike Ibsen't in love with the tunic, or he does not know how to love him. betrayal acts on both sides, have great influence on the two men. They are both devastated by the fact that the other escaped and left them at a time when they really need each other for survival.
