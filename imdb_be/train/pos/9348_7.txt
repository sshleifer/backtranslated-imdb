What we have here is the situation. The man is in trouble, and people want to help him - in contrasting ways. In the end, they are forced to let go. You can not fix people. Although various aspects of Reign Over Me is usually Hollywood that the message is not. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters in the 9/11 aircraft, which has since been held in almost psychotic states SPTSA. This is what makes the meeting Charlie, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who was his roommate in dental school and knowing about his tragedy, to see him on the street and are reunited. Charlie rides around on a little toy scooters - pretty bizarre thing to negotiate the traffic of Manhattan - with big headphones on a mass of unruly hair. Hair is the main Propyl Sandler, to show that he's crazy. And the use of music as an escape to get home each IPOD-have subway rider. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a catastrophe, but paradoxically Alan stuck with controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to envy him. Charlie lives as a nut teenage boy with a huge trust fund (insurance money from the tragedy), and starts dragging Alan off to "hang out", "eat Chinese," buy records, or watching a marathon Mel Brooks in the repetition of the house, Charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by an average housewife, alteration kitchen over and over again, collecting old vinyl Springsteen, who, etc., and play a video game called Shadow Collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room. <br /> <br /> Charlie laws are deeply concerned about it, but somehow disappointed, as we will see later. Alan has a new patient who propositioning him. Despair Charlie makes us see Alan. I am trying to help Charlie in part Alanya let escape from his stifling reality, but only partially making it more acutely aware of them. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler make an odd couple, but it does not matter, because it is convinced that they might need each other. Charlie desperately companionship of a friend who never knew his family, because in order to avoid its loss, he pretends that he never had one. So, if as a neighbor in the room Charlie slept naked and went to bed and had a horrible taste in music (not Motown)? Alan wants to get away from her neat, emasculation of life. He is under the thumb of not only his wife, but his dental associates who rule over them, even though it is the one who created the practice. They are white, by the way, and it's black. <br /> <br /> There randy patient from hell, which seriously disrupts things in dental offices, but it begins to look different when Charlie comes in and says that she is a baby. His libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any moment. He also refers to his chest, Liv Tyler, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists, begins trying to treat Charlie, when he admits that he may need help. <br /> <br /> mad Sandler scene a little too theatrical, so many plot devices (in fact, this film feels like to play in more than one point), but it has a few monologues, where he expresses his sorrow a relationship that is deeply touching. <br /> <br /> Charlie's not just crazy and boring, but dangerous and hard, and all of these efforts to help him start a backfire. The film is excellent in how it conveys a sense that people can not be made correctly. This is an interesting film - sometimes touching one - and this is the first time, 9/11, considered from the perspective of the survivor suffering. But there is an element of comedy seems tasteless far, many people are turning too wide and too big Hollywood interiors awful decor; Only Manhattan street looks real. There's a courtroom scene, which is absurd, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who is too good to be true. family problem Alan solved too easily with a phone call. Still, it's worth looking at the actions - control and subtlety Cheadle and Sandler in the serious role is almost as good as the one he had in the physical training Anderson 2002 Punch-Drunk Love, although it is clearly the best film at the actually much better.
