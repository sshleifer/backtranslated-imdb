Weak start, strong middle, a fantastic finish. This is my impression of this movie, anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in two films that I've seen it in --- Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. His role, however, took a completely different turn. It shows your choice as an actor, but nonetheless, I'm not really fond of the character he portrayed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> There's a kind of humor I call "disappointing comedy." His supposed "joke" and wit really nothing more painful and uncomfortable moments. Much like the character Bean Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are a number of other comedians who show similar characters too. I do not mean to beat them here, so that will not happen. <br /> <br /> But warned that if you're like me and you love annoyingly smarmy and bungling idiots Pegg shows only those characteristics for the first third of the film. This is really getting better, though. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that it is based on a true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The film's story stopped being annoying, and became a kind of triumph of the "little man" in the last third. I do not need all the films to be sugar and light --- but by coincidence, because this movie is even better, it also began to more and more happy ending. <br /> <br /> In addition, it was nice to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, playing the role so well. I liked the «Iron Man», but was frustrated by the fact that the nature of Bridges was a villain. Purely personal taste, of course, as his actions that was excellent. Nevertheless, it was a miracle there is a larger than life person view, the publisher Sharps. It was nice to see him in the role that I could enjoy. <br /> <br /> In general, then, I liked it! I just want me to come in 40 minutes late and missed the start.
