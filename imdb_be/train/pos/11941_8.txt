They are not journalists jawing Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in "His Girl Friday" or witty detective William Powell and Myrna Loy brazen lady of fine man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson surprisingly charming as amateur detectives in Scoop. Their witty eccentric more postmodern than after depression letter Elena, filled with ironic self aging and plain old New York anguish. Shades of the old mind are rare, for example, when he, like Sid, Grand Magus Splendini, speaks about his background: "I was born to Jewish belief, but when I got older, I converted to narcissism." Johansson, fresh from Match Point Elena as a bad girl, there gets to be relatively good, and sometimes ditsy journalism student caught in a murder mystery suitable for London: a serial killer. The plot is reworking his recent London thriller Match Point, up to the highest class of sins and "An American Tragedy" / place of Sun in boat "accident". In fact, Allen alteration Manhattan Murder Mystery, and Purple Rose of Cairo, to name just a few other examples. I still do not, if it recycles; I would like to see the new material at least equal to the original, and, unfortunately, it is only a reflection of his younger greatness. <br /> <br /> Allen as director and actor can not hide his love actress, since he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore takes middling comedy in the appropriate place down Allen canon, not great, but funny, sometimes brilliant satire : On high-end killer suspect, Sid (Allen) smiling, "I would be very surprised if he killed a man." This old Allen humor. Although there is hardly any bright literary allusions, as in most of his film he lards Savka with music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss, to tell us Lumberjack not lost touch of class.
