Several summer space tourists have actually been accidentally sent to the robot space. A ship oxygen ends. They were sent to whom the space station to get gas cylinders, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot of this movie is not possible in real life. But it gives a warm feeling anything is possible if you set your heart. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see these young actors who still look much the same, after all these years. (I saw this film for the first time in 2000, he was shot in 1986.) There are many people in this film who are still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The view was different from the open space. It does not seem unrealistic. It is about 2 hours, it works so fast that you will not even notice. You know that it's not real, but you just do not get sucked into it until the end. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good family film. <br /> <br />
