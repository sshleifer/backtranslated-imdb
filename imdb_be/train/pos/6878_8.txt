Tho, 35 years old, Groove Tube looks like an actual TV today! Specialty niche network (naked sport), a TV show about the drug Stoner called Dealers (ala Weeds, and even preceded the 1978's Cheech and Chong up in smoke), strange promotional beer commercials (beer shoes, no less strange than the Bud Bowl), dirty -minded baby clown Coco (shades of Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase doing slapstick humor (violent barbershop vocal duet) a year before his debut in 1975 on Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the infamous opening sequence, which earned Groove Tube initial X-rating, I still can not hear Curtis Mayfield in «Move On Up», without thinking about the nude dancing hitchhiking hippie ---- For these sketch-style films, see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the mood, Monty Python goes beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken, and all that Firesign Theater you know it is wrong.
