I noticed in the manual to the list of films in the Festival of Santa Barbara movie where I went when I was in Hollywood that the movie was screened. Basically there are elections for a new chairman of the Hong Kong triad Wo Sing Society is coming up, so you can imagine how much violence that will occur during this. The struggle between the "candidatesÂ» Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) to manage the oldest and most powerful parts of the Triad society. Also starring Louis Koo, Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai Mr Thus, Lam Suet as a Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as the Kun. There are some good realistic themes and moments of corruption, just about enough action, except, perhaps, when the police get involved, but the continuation followed, so it's pretty worth crime drama thriller. Very good!
