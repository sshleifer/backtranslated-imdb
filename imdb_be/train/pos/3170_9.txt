Author / Director / Co-Star Adam Jones led a large business. That is the idea I had once seen him feature film «Cross Eyed». Rarely independent film leave me feeling as good as it did. Skillfully written and masterfully directed, «Cross Eyed» keeps you part from start to finish. Adam Jones may not be well known name yet, but he will. If this movie had one or two "Actors Named" would be feeling Box Office. I think I still have a chance to get seen on the main stream audience, if only one distributor of the film takes some time to work this film. No matter where it ends up, when you get a chance to see it, you will not be disappointed.
