I watched as The Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing it in the theater. I've been waiting for this since before they started shooting. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers below the prices <br /> <br /> In general, it was good, but it also did not have the continuity of the first two. Identity and advantage as a graceful flowed between the peak effect of adrenaline to introspective drama. This film felt choppy at times. Building plot down times were a bit too drawn out. This caused the following to feel too obsessed <br /> <br /> Camera. Speaking of obsessive, trademark Greengrass shaky cam was present and very irritating to me. I've known him for saying / whine about nausea on the bulletin board, but it does not mean that it does not matter. All martial arts training the actors went through were completely wasted. Much of the fighting in the film absurd reduction chamber and to move the camera destroyed. It's cheap, director of student trick to make the film feel unsettled. I would expect these methods to be used in a horror flick made for secondary school children, but not in this chic, for adults, a series of actions. Too many extreme close-up as well. Some framing. Get some interesting shots. Constant Closeup feels lazy directing me <br /> <br /> Stories :. The story was very confusing at first. They shoved the new names and faces at you from the get go. He gave me the feeling that you get when you come to the movies late, and I know that you miss some important information. Felt rushed or pressurized for reasons of time. Once you catch up, but the story is pretty good. It's a pleasant trail leads along with Born. However, I do not care about all the latest stage of Supremacy (Land / Bourne on the phone), being in the middle of things Ultimatum. It basically makes the film a prequel half. I thought it was inconvenient <br /> <br /> Cast / Characters :. Star of the movie action. It is clear that there are only two originals remain. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. Their united was kind of strange to me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne who defend to and trust. When I completely missed something that they do not even say why they joined. The rest of the killers in the film have been pretty quiet. It seemed that the Gilroy / Greengrass / the one who wants to leave no open ends. Understandable, but disappointing. Seriously, Damon Clive Owen in Identity and Supremacy in Chokash .. These scenes were phenomenal. These killers are uninteresting as Castel (first fights a guy Bourne Identity). Throw in a whole deteriorated as the series went on. Clive Owen was almost an afterthought. This measure of the force of this first roll. Secondly, they are mainly traded for Chris Cooper Joan Allen .... It is not the same. This one trades Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 actors to be named later. Nothing against Strathairn, Scott Glenn, and Albert Finney, but they are not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series. But a couple of pauses that seemed long acting was right. <br /> <br /> In general, it was successful. I felt that they would like to receive a series of more in order, though. If they were circumcised or rearrange the slow part of the liquidated Scott Glenn completely, zoom, and took the camera away from the seizure of the victim, it would be ideal. <br /> <br /> endings SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not understand why they leave Bourne alive at the end. It was my understanding this was the conclusion. They clearly referred to the very beginning of the series, with its silhouette floating motionless. I thought it was going to be. Full circle type of ending. I did like Nicky response to the report, although <br /> <br /> WARNING Spoiler specifics -. Quote below with the film - <br /> <br /> Born in the last line of the end, "Look at it .. Look at what they make you give." to quote the first murderer, he killed, I loved it. The final scene was great. (Except that it Vosen {Strathairn} who shot Bourne. Why did he do it? Just revenge? If it was enough to kill, why not shoot Pamela Land after she facsimile of his top-secret file angry? This does not make sense.)
