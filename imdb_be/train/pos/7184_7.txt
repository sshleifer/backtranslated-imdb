I love this show, but I've seen the second episode of the first. After watching the first episode, I could understand why people were excluded on the ground. The first episode of humor is not the best, and they are struggling to start the series well. Nevertheless, I still love the light and humorous attitude shows. Symbols are developing much more after that episode and become really enjoyable characters. In the first episode, he did not really have a clear representation of the rest of the show, which is actually very good. This episode is not bad by any means, but as the show progresses, she is getting better and better, so watch more episodes before passing any opinion about the quality of the show.
