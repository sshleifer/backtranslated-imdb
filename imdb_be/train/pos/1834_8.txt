This movie is very touching. I do not care what people say about this movie, it's a very good film. Plays the role of Amitabh Bachchan's father dies have big, because he wants to teach his son how to cope with life in case something happened to him and Akshay Kumer was great in his role as the spoiled Aditya Thakur. Supporting role Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur was gorgeous. Priyanka Chopra was good in his small role, she was in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as brain-dead servants and Bohm Iran as window dressing tests have very good communication and comedy scene was fun. The direction is very good.
