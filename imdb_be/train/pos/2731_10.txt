Unfortunately, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but you know, one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson drew a sociopath (no conscience) extremely well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed person with anger and impulse control, which had a conscience, but he could not control himself perfectly. I agree! What is frightening and a huge movie. I have seen more than 2,000 films and would rate it in the top 100. My friend is a lifetime dealing with clients such as this regularly. My only criticism was an instructive story in the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal conditions, but only one in a million will behave just like the 2 losers.
