I was a supporter of Xu Ke (Tsui Hark) for many years after high school. This film is the best fantasy film in recent years. I do not think that the "action" the right genre, although there is already a lot of action and KongFu scenese. Wait, did I mention it ORIENTAL Moive fantasy? Please keep in mind that DO NOT use the Hollywood formula to evaluate this film. And for a guy who "pee" around, I do not blame you, because you are still young and need to know more about the "culture".
