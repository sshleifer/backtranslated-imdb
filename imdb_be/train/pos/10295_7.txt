Okay, so it's not a masterpiece, as the godfather, but it should not be. The sole purpose of this movie is, to make the audience laugh several times. If it can make the audience laugh a bunch of times, he reached his goal. I laughed out loud, and left with a smile. I feel like I got my money's worth.
