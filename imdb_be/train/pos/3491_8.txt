Acting is great, acting is good, the story is interesting, full of information about creating suspense ... but it's hard to cram all of these elements in the film, which has long been almost 80 minutes. If more time was taken to develop the plot and story line, it will have a much greater effect. Another 30 minutes of material would make a very good film, and then just a good one.
