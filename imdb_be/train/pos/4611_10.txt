Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Cantonese / English subtitles <br /> <br /> Once, five years ago, the world was obsessed with «The Matrix», and I was probably one of the only fifteen year olds left who still believed that "The Terminator" was better than "The Matrix." I was just a simple teenager, looking for a good action movie, and then there was a bright light on the television station, I never really looked at a small station, known as SBS. One night I saw in TV Guide that the film starring Jackie Chan - "Police Story" will be later. Being fifteen, and only saw the "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Rush Hour", I said ... "WOW amazing" and sat down to watch it, and all the while shouting "WOW Strange" as the film progressed. Two weeks after the SBS showed the trilogy "Police Story", I knew I had found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie Chan plays Ka Kui, the police in Hong Kong, which is a major drug busts of Mr. Chu (Yuen Chor). Secretary Chu, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), conducted by the police as a witness against Chu and Chang used to protect her. Things are going badly - reaaaal bad - when it Chu fired and he decides that he wants Fong and Chan dead <br /> <br /> «Police Story" is one of the greatest films ever action, and, of course, one of my favorite Jackie. Chan movies. It starts with a strong and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed. Everything in between is large. Nevertheless, some of the fun parts may seem a little tasteless more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> In the history, it is still one of the best efforts of Jackie. For the militants, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the cast and plot intensive "New Police Story". This is not the «Miracles», but maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> «Police Story» is one of the best works of Jackie. He got me hooked on the Jackie Chan movies, and should provide a good starting point for potential supporters Jackie. The bad news for those who see it first thing Jackie Chan movies do not come much better - 10/10
