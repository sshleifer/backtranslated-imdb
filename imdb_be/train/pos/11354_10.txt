CitizenX (1995) is a developing world response to Silence lambs. Where `Silence« terrorized peace of mind, `Citizen» exhausts and saddens us instead. This staging case Tchikatilo needs quite well due to westernized Rostov friendship between two traffic policemen, which are equal. <br /> <br /> CitizenX can also oppose (!) to death is much better than Kevin Spacey Life of David Gale (2002). <br /> <br /> People Machiavellian mammals, in which lie the limbic brain (lizard-logic). Why two children, who knew better, the death of the baby, they took a stone? Why bloodthirsty woman yelling `Li-lilililililii» in obscene acts of terrorism? Is my own term for this is `limbic dominance" lizard logic in imposing `the enemy." If you have the word 'enemy «/` Vengeance »in your dictionary, you can easily` limbic dominance. " <br /> <br /> In the WWII-ravaged 1980 Rostov (located at the mouth of the River Don near the Black Sea), nothing suppressed the urge to Chikatilo in `limbic dominance" overcome by his layers of civilization. Chikatilo (Jeffrey Demanov) 's easy victims were poor people, usually children, who rode on a long-distance train for fun, because they could no longer anything. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that the failure of the Council of rampant bureaucracy, cost the lives of 52 of the Lambs'. Rostov serial killer roamed free for nearly 7 years after police arrested him and let him go. <br /> <br /> The politicization crimefighting harmful to police forces around the world. While police usually suffers from corruption in the world, in the West, the capture rate policies can create chronic interagency rivalry, stymieing more coordinated fight against crime. . In the Soviet Union CitizenX, however, Victor Burakou (Stephen Rea) Killer Department 's suffering from a repressive bureaucracy <br /> <br /> Jeffrey DeMunn plays psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with impeccable but understated power - to the point of complete uncertainty. In real life too, Chikatilo was an experience of a life in harmony and evading capture. <br /> <br /> His pursuer, on the other hand, sticks out like a strange bird, these unplanned, naive flash. Perhaps the design, Stephen Rea gives a very strange idea as the main forensics Burakou. Russian accent REA is impermeable; and Burakou are humorous and grim, not at odds with each. <br /> <br /> So, Donald Sutherland, who goes with the picture. Col.Fetisov Sutherland Burakou boss, and at first his only fan is too restrained, patient policeman whose dignified carriage bears witness to decades of bureaucratic machinations. His awakening as a logical drive and still hot cop becomes the cornerstone idealism film. <br /> <br /> Ekland takes another turn as the vicious apparatchik, secretary of the Communist ideology Bondarchuk, the investigation control. Naturally, he canceled the arrest the most likely suspect, communist, in 1984, a man carrying a rope and a knife in his bag, supposedly going home :. Chikatilo <br /> <br /> He was soon replaced with another Moscow Burakou apparatchik, Gorbunov detective (John Wood), insisting that the investigation is now to focus on the `known homosexuals. The funniest scene of this sad, sad film comes during legitimized claims Bondarchuk & Gorbunova one stupid police reports seriously, `As I suspected, comrade, is fornication. I took a few pictures -. Key howling laughter <br /> <br /> 5yrs after the bodies began to pile up, in 1987, the police finally attempted extortion criminal profiles. Only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr. Alexander Boukhanovsky (Max von Sydow), who is called `CitizenX unknown." Later, he also observed Fetisov and Burakou that `... together you will make a lovely person. We agree <br /> <br /> nominated rates, spread over ten years, a perfect reflection of the institutional inertia of publicity -. `Openness' - it was not. The contrast with the Restructuring - `restructuring '- couldn't've was more the case. While Chikatilo still scour train stations, police plans were going to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> In 1990 Col.Fetisov was promptly appointed general. His nemesis Bondarchuk vanished scenes, allowing the investigation finally operate without political interference. Employees, communication, publicity - suddenly they were all available. Just one night the phone around Fetisov received his depressive forensic examination of the main access to the serial Task Force FBI Murders in Quantico, where Fetisov found staff regularly rotated from serial murder cases to prevent just such a psychological harm to researchers. <, Br /> <br /> Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensic chief now `Colonel 'Burak all of these changes in the avalanche of confession, which is the power plant of the watershed film scene. Fetisov is the most gentle apology I've ever seen in the film: 'Privately, I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife. I hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance, "he almost whispered. <br /> <br /> A HBO production, CitizenX film of the highest caliber. Not only is the exterior design looks authentically grim (shot entirely in most of the older parts of the otherwise spectacular Budapest), but the soaring soundtrack by Randy Edelman completely preferred - and often our only respite from the grim brutality. Those who speak Hungarian recognize many Hungarian accents and loans. <br /> <br /> actual murder in Chikatilo portrayed as dark, deviant behavior, born of the nature of the shortcomings and ignorance in such a harsh world. This makes killing seem to not-quite-a-beds - but of course they were. As President Kennedy reminded us, `We all cherish our children's future." <br /> <br /> CitizenX communicates well that murder is much worse and obscene than any revenge fantasy can mean. Serial rapists rape to dominate; serial killers kill dominate. So that some of the soldiers. Such `limbic Dominators do poor people <br /> <br /> Warning SPOILER :. ----------------------------- ------------------ This Chikatilo was the most prolific known serial killer in the world. Convicted, he was executed in 1992 in the form of all the death sentences of the Soviet Union, one shot in the head. Silly, such methods destroy any possibility of studying the deviant brain after death <br /> <br /> Conclusion :. ------------------------- ------------------------- ---------- best result is always the prevention of murders, not the prosecution. Punishment only ensure the failure of society to learn from the complex reality of the death of the victims, if we send even anecdotal evidence of how / why they died. Also, do not learn to feel sorry for the murderer, when they are dead. <br /> <br /> Vengeance Sun unkill victims. Rallying murderer blood is nothing better than a counter-dominance. - as soon as it's too late <br /> <br /> Vengeance on behalf of grieving is not justice for the dead - is alive peace (10/10)
