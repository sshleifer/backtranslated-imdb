Yes, it gets a full ten stars. It is clear as day that it fills a genius. The universe has sent Trent Harris young, amazingly strange man one day and Harris caught it on tape, in all that this discrepancy glory, that you just can not fake. It is a pity that it ended in tragedy for a young person, unless an alternative ending can be written in the history of this fellow. The remaining two steps in the trilogy do tell the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the role of young people, respectively. World supplemented contextualize and strangeness in the retelling, which gives us a broader view of a child in a strange vanilla America. Recommended for everyone!
