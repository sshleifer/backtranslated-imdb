Entering UFO "thing" aside. It was the best documentary I've seen. Factual statements Neil and Buzz ... a must see. Interviews and statements are public, because most of the information was confidential stamped in 1969 and released only in 2006, no documentary to date, has no detail or accuracy of such short 47 minutes ... Facts blow you away, and you will be delighted by the risks assumed be the first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz probably the greatest hero of our time. Ever seen a man to save his own life? Bet no. Neil save his life, if only milli-seconds separated him from death. It is amazing to watch. This is a parody of people do not know all the details associated with the landing on the moon, and the courage of those people were when facing imminent death, from a faulty computer ... 10 stars!
