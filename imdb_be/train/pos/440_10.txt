My most favorite film. Oscar-caliber work of all participants, both in front and behind the camera. The script is perfect and working relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a fully satisfactory manner, as opposed to the novel. The care with which the other leading characters tribute to screenwriter Peter Barnes were made and intensive visual beauty should win an Oscar for director Mike Newell and filmmaker Rex Maidment. This is the best job Josie Lawrence away and changed my mind Joan Plowright. After seeing this movie at least 50 times, I can not find no fault in this. Music, the famous composer Richard Bennett Kindred is a miracle.
