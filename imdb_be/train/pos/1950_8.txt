Diane Keaton plays a few "hard" part of it for many years on the big screen, but it is mainly known for "light and fluffy" material with Woody Allen, such as Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort, and it really does not matter that the competition was the year it was first shown. Try to find a scene in which she is not. And it was heavy drama, exhausting at their own pace and fought off the action, all at full speed. Makeup made it as far as possible the young, and she comes to 30s age group, even in close-up, but she plays half his age, and at a very fast pace. The film as a whole was quite well done, and put the shot well with a strong supporting cast, but Keaton was carrying the cargo.
