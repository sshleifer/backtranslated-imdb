It should be against the law to not experience this very funny stand up show with Eddie Murphy. I've never seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Murphy lasts for almost 70 minutes about Dicks, pussy, tits and insaults so many famous people, including his own "family." Among those who receive it are Murphy: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I never really laughed so hard, anything my whole life. I mean, when a man does not know who Mr. T, but still laugh so much Murphy as Mr. T, there is something about it. At the time I saw the show, I could not remember who Mr. T. was, but still laughing. Now I know who he is, and that just makes it so much more funny. Because that's what they're doing, Eddie - he can make these experiences so well that it does not matter who the hell is he trying to do, it's still fun. And on top of that we know that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please watch this ..
