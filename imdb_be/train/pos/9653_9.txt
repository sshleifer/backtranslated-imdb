First love is a very difficult subject to convincingly pull off the movie :. all-encompassing passion involved usually ends up as a pale imitation, or, worse still, a little funny <br /> <br /> Lifshitz avoided all the traps and provides a moving, sexy, thoroughly gripping story of love, catastrophe and possible foreclosure, while as a tangential touch on some of the deeper themes in human existence. <br /> <br /> the core story of Mathieu, 18, lonely, introverted boy who meets Cedric, Brasher, a great weekend, but just as lonely, while on vacation with his family. As summer warms up to, they fall in love, and when at the end of the holidays, we decided to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in disaster: Cedric cheats Mathieu, who, mad, trying to take her own life. He survives, and in order to get a perspective back on his life, he returned to the seaside town where they first met, this time disguised in the cold winter. <br /> <br /> If the story had to say, as it would never have the impact he makes: much of this is meant, all this happens inconsistently <br /> <br /> The complicated story you need to get a deep sense of passion experienced by the use of counterpoint and. time perspective. Fortunately, three time lines that are used (summer of love, after the suicide of a mental hospital and in the winter of reconstruction) are color-coded: warm yellows and oranges in the summer, almost frightening chill blue for the hospital scenes and warm browns and blues for the winter sea. <br /> <br /> and the main actors put in excellent performances, though, while it's nice to see Stephane Rideau (Cedric), which is used to its full capacity (I'm more used to seeing him in a rather sluggish -stretched AMD Gael Morel) Elkaym (Mathieu) should be set aside for special mention: you can feel his loneliness, his almost incredulous passion, his character destroyed the wall of aphasia. Beautifully made gestures to get through far more than could ever dialogue <br /> <br /> Topics touched on almost a classic of French cinema :. We find it hard to understand what is really a different feeling; Our difficulty in communicating in full; quicksand values ​​?? The film's title, "Almost nothing" (almost nothing) refers to all of them and, in fact, one of the key scenes in the film: In trying to understand why Mathieu tried to kill himself, the psychiatrist asks Cedric if he ever cheated on him? ? "Non ?? Enfin, oui ?? Ipa Fu maize VP n'était Rien" (NO ?? yes ?? once, but it was nothing). Cedric still loves Mathieu ?? He brought him to the hospital at the time of the suicide attempt (none of which we can see) and is desperately trying to contact him again as soon as he leaves ?? but he can not figure out that he had lost it forever, because what seemed to him nothing (senseless thing) whatever mother. <br /> <br /> While the film is darker, and the unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster would suggest, it is not without hope that we will see a slow, painful attempts Cedric to get back in touch with life, first through the cat he perceives it through the work of a local bar, and finally contact with Pierre, who could be his next love, but here the story ends: teenage passion for over the years, even may begin. So what was it? Almost nothing? Of course not, if you live it ??
