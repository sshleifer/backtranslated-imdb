Excellent and accurate movie ... McGovern has made great efforts to research and document his writing and it pays off. He is not afraid to speak the truth, even if it can make unfavorable reviews and comments from some who love history to be clean and sweet and glossy. <br /> <br /> Once again McGovern brings Christopher Eccleston, though not as high profile role he played in Hillsboro. I found this film to be accurate, well acted and well represented in Hillsborough, and I welcome McGovern for his piercing unapologetic writing. Well done, and my hat is off to the writer, actor, production crew. Great movie!
