A few years ago, I bought some $ 1 DVD, which contained two films each. One of them had three Broadway girl (alternative title for the Greeks if the word for them), and this, Happy Go cute. It is basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in Scotland and concerns of mistaken identity with one of the dancers hitch ride from limousine millionaire. Vera-Ellen is that the dancer and wow, that leg! Cesar Romero is the producer who takes a chance on it after the original leading lady goes away, because he thinks it meets the millionaire, whose car, that I just mentioned. And David Niven, the rich guy who, when looking for Vera-Ellen mistaken for a reporter who is supposed to be in her interview, but gets hampered Romero. What I have just mentioned, it can be confusing, but (mostly) only makes sense if you are ready to check your brain at the time of viewing this magical screwball comedy with great musical numbers performed by the exquisite Ms. Vera-Ellen. Romero may be a bit obsessed here, but Niven becomes funny stunned everyone. Imprint I saw was actually very good considering his age and the fact that it is freely available. And Vera-Ellen is doing very well with her lines, because it is not really an actress. Thus, on that note, I highly recommend Happy Go nice for movie fans who love the old-fashioned musical comedy.
