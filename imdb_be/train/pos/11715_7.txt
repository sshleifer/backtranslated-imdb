This cute little parody of the horror / comedy starring Cassandra Peterson Which Elvira: Mistress darkness, the most shameful horror hostess of all time. This was to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that he was picked up by NBC Network. They filmed a pilot for a TV series to show the busty beauty in black, but, unfortunately, anyone sitting never made it past the pilot stage due to its sexual references. This film, however, is very funny. Elvira is a modern Morgan Pride and Queen jokes. This film was followed a few years later bottomless "ghosts of Elvira HillsÂ», which was supposed to be a takeoff of the old movies of Roger Corman, but falls flat on his face. See the movie, not the much more exciting experience!
