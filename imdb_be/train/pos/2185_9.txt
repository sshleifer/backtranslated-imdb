Poor Basil Rathbone, selfish composer, who lost his muse. He was pretending to be for some time, buying his songs and his music from a variety of sources. The problem lies in the fact that two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mary Martin in words) was fortunate enough to meet and fall in love. And then they find out what they were doing. Complications occur, but corrected in the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin singing badly. Mary Paramount has signed a contract, and at the same time double as a regular on Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. For reasons that I do not understand, the audience in the cinema did not take, so she returned to Broadway and made a One Touch of Venus in 1944 and remained there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well. His ego is constantly lowered to mate Oscar Levant and again I am surprised that they did not make more films together. <br /> <br /> As with most cars Paramount Crosby, without any large production numbers, but I agree with the previous reviewer about the title tune is done as an impromptu jam session at a pawn shop. Good work everyone. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully original storyline and great entertainment.
