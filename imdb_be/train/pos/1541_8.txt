Just saw this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival, and enjoyed it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Large writing and direction, and excellent true interaction between the cast and large comic synchronization as well. <br /> <br /> The film covers topics that are universal and family separation. As a result, I can see the European, Asian and American audiences find all points of similarity between this film and their own lives. <br /> <br /> If all that was not enough, it has the potential to be the best date movie of the year underground ... someone to distribute it in the United States, please, <br /> <br /> And finally thank you Maria Flom! This is a really great movie.
