Well, basically it is the popcorn sci-fi film, but from the outset it is clear that it was directed with great intelligence. You can expect about 10 clich√©s, the film accumulated, but it provides only about three of them, and some of them have a twist to them, allowing you more time to know what the director does not assume that you are an idiot. incumbent Kurt Russell is really great and brings a depth of character that strange, useful. Recommended if you've just seen something stupid, and you want to restore your faith!
