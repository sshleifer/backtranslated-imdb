I strongly disagree with «ctomvelu» regarding the talent Jim Belushi. I happen to like a lot of Belushi. However, I was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene, because I was such a huge fan of his late brother John. But Jim has on-screen charm that was it very far - and he developed it well over the years <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of his early films. - the weight of the giveaway (this is not something that is true for most of us) - and I like that movie. Yes, it's a touching and moving, so if you are in pursuit, explosions and gratuitous sex, then you can pass it - is a warm film of the three lost soles who find each other. Do not get me wrong, I'm all for the above three keys to a successful film, but I also like a good, solid tale, like this one. <br /> <br /> And though Belushi and Kelly Lynch delivers excellent performance, the real star of this film Alisan Porter. - who are absolutely magical <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened to her career, but the one who is responsible for dropping the ball (agent father himself ??) should be shot. You could not ask for a more perfect introduction to famous than this movie, and even personal note was not heard from her since. <br /> <br /> Another sad story of Hollywood ...
