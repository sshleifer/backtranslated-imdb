I have to say that this film is a truly amazing and touching. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not so bad! it is so sweet to watch Dani falls and breaks my heart and still warms my heart at the same time, watching the fall of the court in love Maureen. However, it is even sweeter, watching as he takes care of Dani. I must admit, although I pretended to want him to fall in love with Danny in the end. it's just so cute, watching her fall for him I do not want her to her heart broken so badly. but the biggest tragedy I have ever seen in this film happened. watching him die made me cry all day long. I just could not believe it. However, no more loving relationship, as was shown in the movie, then Morin and Dani. they can actually make it through anything. I give this film 9, because I did not want the court to die, but he was still one of the strangest films I have ever seen.
