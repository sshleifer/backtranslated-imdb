Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the few original scripts written by himself Hitchcock, the film shows a great story structure. It starts with a rousing boxing match in which champion carnival "one round" Jack is losing bidder in the audience, which happens to be a professional boxer. The film is then slowed down for the development of the characters and enter a love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend and a professional boxer. The rest of the film is a sharp increase in a rematch between the two men, this time in the heavyweight crown. Even in this early film, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinema and prop placement. Headband bought for a girl boxer keeps popping up throughout the film, as a symbol of her infidelity. The only big detractor of this film is that the art of shooting a boxing match has not been improved in 1927, the final match, in the end, in the end, though somewhat disappointing. History, however, is that it carries the film to the end.
