I loved this film, in the first spot of the schedule seemed strange, with grainy shots, but I quickly entered her. There must be thousands of hours of footage shot and I really admire the work in cutting it down. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence can not be the movie for you, but there are some great signs here (and some real tossers). Technically, I liked it a lot, too, they had to use a new algorithm for deinterlacing, or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway, but I was not annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in the video to film transfer. (Open Water drove me nuts, mainly because there are cheap, advanced camera available at the moment, and I do not see any justification in Sun shells each, if you going to the screen in a movie theater). Unfortunately, this is my own little rant. I would definitely recommend this film if you've ever been associated with the music scene, he has some tragic moments, but most of them are funny, I could be accused of laughing at others misfortune, but it is a classic piece.
