The history of integrity, who acted as an excellent soldier, saving the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, according to the 1939 film "Gunga Din." Based on the free verse by Rudyard Kipling, the film brilliantly directed by George Stevens and stars Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen. The main role is played by Sam Jaffe, well-known in my era, as the boss, Ben Casey, Dr. Zorba, a name that has become synonymous with large, out of hair control. Say "Dr. Zorba hair" any of my generation, and they know what you say <br /> <br /> Set in India during shaving tion of occupation, the three soldiers -. Two romantic, excellent figures in Grant and Fairbanks, and McLagen like a big lug - carved out of the window -. in fact, three overgrown boys Gunga Din is a carrier of water, treated with some sneaky - verbally, anyway - on McChesney (McLaglen), but Cutter (Grant) love him if he catches Dean (pronounced Deen) is practicing being his soldiers to go and salute as he mimics the device during its maneuver, Cutter gives him some advice.. <br /> <br /> merry band of musketeers going to disintegrate when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces that he is going to marry a beautiful young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leaving the service. However, if Gunga Din and Cutter to cross Thugees, bloody cult led by a guru (Eduardo Chiannelli), Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit, and Ballantine insists on recruiting giving to help keep the cutter. It's a buddy movie, after all. <br /> <br /> Â«Gunga Din" begins lightly, with slapstick and lovely, broad comedy, in particular, Cary Grant, which is pretty funny. Both he and Fairbanks is so beautiful that it's hard to decide which one to look at first. Most of the film consists of a huge action sequences, which are very interesting. In the last part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense and thrilling battle. <br /> <br /> The grant has a spectacular role, Fairbanks is a romantic love, and McLaglen in McChesney, mainly because of its treatment of Dean of the Ganges, the most unpleasant character, although one expressed his soft heart in his love for his Annie elephant. Its softness emerges before the end of the film, in particular, is very touching, tear-jerking final scene. <br /> <br /> Always gentle and likeable actor Sam Jaffe gives an excellent performance as Gunga Din, simple, courageous man with a big smile, a powerful imagination and lofty dreams. Without much dialogue, Jaffe sends soul Gunga Dina great. <br /> <br /> It really is the ultimate adventure, massive coverage, with good acting, fiery scenes, great musical numbers and some beautiful cinematic images. Another of this wonderful year 1939. Highly recommended.
