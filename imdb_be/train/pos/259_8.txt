For the Danish film, I must say that this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It's in its class, but it has international potential. <br /> <br /> the movie has a big budget, and starring well-known actors of Danish and a few newcomers who play very well. This can be seen in those who love adventure and a bit of a "ghost" of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid to be happy!
