I rate it 10 out of 10. Why do <br /> <br /> It gives an idea about something, I hardly know - surfers surfing, because that's all they want to do; Nothing seems to matter as much for them as surfing; And this is not a temporary thing - this time, the lives of these boys * buried in the film a great history of surfing; I never moved, but I love surfing movies and seen a lot. Nobody taught me that this film is made * The film was very well edited. It flows well. The interviews were outstanding * This is interesting from beginning to end <br /> <br /> In general, this is about as good as documentary, as I've seen, so I have to assess the terms of this. since 10/10
