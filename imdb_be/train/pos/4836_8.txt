I saw the movie a few days ago on a video tape, and although it was hard to swallow it in one go (due to its length and stories), I really liked it. I was amazed at first, according to the scenario, and then to implement this scenario. The film takes you on a trip, but it's not easy, joyful journey; it passes through time and different political regimes and shows their influence on the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the inner logic of the film were followed; logic, which is the same as the logic of life, was quite illogical and confusing time, but in the end, when I thought about it, all the events and twists meaning. It makes no sense, but try to retell the story of how it is distributed in more than 50 years of age. I also really liked the character of Nikita Mikhalkov's Alex and the way he played, as some critics have seen, with restless abandon. What I did not like about it was the fact that I think he later played characters that remind me of Alex in such films as "A Cruel Romance» (Zhestokij Romans, which I really like) and to some extent in the "humiliated and insulted» ( «Unizhennye I oskorblyonnye"). "Sibiriada" shows, I think that the great film director Andrei Konchalovsky was before he went to Hollywood and made forgetting films like "Tango and Cash" and less forgettable like "Runaway Train." I would prefer "Speckled Hen" to them ...
