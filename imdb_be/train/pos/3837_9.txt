Back in the forties, when the film touches upon issues are not allowed in "polite" society, they turned to the codes that are supposedly floated over the heads of most viewers at the same time preventing those who know just what it was before. Perhaps no movie decade has been so loaded with innuendo, strangely obscure Desert Fury, a small gambling oasis called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the salon Purple Sage and the casino is awesome Mary Astor, in slacks and a sports mouthpiece; in city driving her handful-on-a-daughter, Lizabeth Scott, looking at the Technicolor, like $ 20 million. But listen to the dialogue between the two, suggesting that older lesbians and her boyfriend, caring companion (one can only wonder if the original script ai Bezzerides' made these relationships explicitly). Even more egregious is John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insanely jealous torpedoes. Add Burt Lancaster, as the town sheriff, stir, and sit back. Both Lancaster and (strangely) Hodiak fall Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak is not only the past with Astor, but he has a wife, who died under suspicious circumstances. Desert sun heats the ingredients to a boil hard, with the face and put the slappings and plenty of exchanges. Do not miss this hothouse melodrama replete with crawling exotic flowering, when it comes your way; it's a great movie.
