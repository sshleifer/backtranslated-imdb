I gave this film 10 is not because it is perfectly consistent film, but it is a pure ability to elicit emotions in its audience. The history of one-woman's-a struggle against all odds-old clich√© now, but very few films carried it with such warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> She also revealed another side to the African-American experience - showing that after the slaves were freed, many died on the way the hated "white man" and were insulting their own people. I believe this is an important point, since it is contrary to the pointing-and-white on black violence-and-win-at-Oscars trends <br /> <br /> Also, excellent acting performances. - especially ODA, which I will now have a new found respect <br /> <br /> Well worth watching. - but keep some tissues handy.
