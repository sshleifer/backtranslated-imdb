I never watched the show "next Action Hero", and by the time reading the other comments here, did not know that this film was a "prize" of the contest. I was just flipping the channels and came across this and found myself watching eagerly dare, all the way through. <br /> <br /> So, the plot has been done (the most dangerous game, etc.), but I had hoped, and almost got, "gotcha" - as the main character is going to beat a hunter in the end. I think high-tech has been exaggerated (GPS), and gave me a cold-sweat flashbacks Night Rider, but nevertheless it was not too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The main problem I had was the extent of SOD with this film (suspension of disbelief) that is required of the viewer. Do we really think that someone is flying a helicopter can throw countless incendiary grenades public bridge and NO Kopsov shows to investigate? Limousine can make countless donuts in the intersection of Las Vegas and NO Kopsov Sun show? Pleeease. Too much of this kind of thing. - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much <br /> <br /> The final decision was good, but the ending was disappointing, with after taste bad Star Trek episode. At least now I understand why the action was so cheesy - for Zane, who does not get nearly as much work as he deserves IMHO, with the exception - they were the winners of the reality show <br /> <br /> knock me out ..
