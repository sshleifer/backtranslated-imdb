The show began with large scenes secrets. I think that all of this in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After the show began playing short scenes from Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo. <br /> <br /> I think that Hanna Barbera Productions had to change the 20-minute episodes in short episodes. Some of the voice actors were unavailable. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable. I think that the voice of Velma changed after the first 12 episodes, because the first voice actress who played Velma was unavailable. <br /> <br /> A network of studios ordered Hanna Barbera, to make more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo, because the ratings were high. Thus, they had to do more short. I want them to be mysteries, like 15 episodes. Nevertheless, it is a good show.
