Easily the largest low-budget horror film of all time. I first saw this film when I was about nine years old, and I have to say that it scared the hell out of me. Now that I'm all growed up, however, I see this film for what he really is ... a work of genius. Everyone, or at least everyone with any taste, Snowman wanted to see happen around killing people, even if they will not admit it. I always found something really awful about the snowman, so, naturally, for the addict horror such as I, thismovie was a dream come true. Some people say that this movie is stupid or otherwise deprived of any intelligence ... is a film about a serial killer snowman, what the hell did you expect? The one who gave the film a low figure is obviously too busy to sit and laugh at stupid jokes and cheap Gore. I love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and by the time the film industry entirely wises and makes a serious horror film about a killer snowman (which seems to be impossible, unfortunately), I will always keep the big piece indie horror close to the heart,
