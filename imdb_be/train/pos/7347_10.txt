I have forgotten masterpiece Bakshi Fire & Ice on the old rent OOP videotape. <br /> <br /> Well, on the one hand, it's better than any other Conan-esque film you will ever see. Of course, it's cheesy, but who cares? It has stood the test of time, and the only way he looked cheesy compared to today's fantasy epics like LOTR: FOTR (. Though I love that movie) <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: After the battle between fire and ice, kings daughter kidnapped Jarols (ice) of non-human beings, while the only survivor from the village pursued saves her. <br /> <br /> Yes, it does not sound like the original, as a nurse, Betty, but it is not important. It really bring to life an interesting idea about the world of two enemies: Fire and Ice. And it is a success <br /> <br /> As for the scenes :. excellent. They are treated well, have a stunning suspence, and there is a lot of loud noises. Just check out the climatic battle, now it is the end <br /> <br /> action and dialogue :! Competent. In fact. They are not going to be nominated for an Oscar, but they are in order and not on the nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is very good. Filmed on 3D and rotoscoped (I think), it looks pretty good. Many background look very detailed and well drawn, and although the design of the characters feel a bit one-dimensional, they are OK. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great little gem neglected and will entertain you more than any of superfical «Entertainment». 10/10
