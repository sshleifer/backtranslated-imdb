I have 2 sisters and watched all 3 series Tenko and agree that this is definitely one of the better BBC series.The all the acting was very convincing in parts and although they drew the third series has been somewhat slower, it was compelling viewing and has a habit of evening do without it.No doubt that we will see it again as it is a series that I never get tired of watching watching.Excellent and full marks to the BBC for a series of brilliant and casting.First rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone, although some age restrictions should be considered first because some adult material.So grateful to the BBC for the release of the series on DVD and video.
