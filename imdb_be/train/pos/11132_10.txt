Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe has roused childhood. He has a strong fear and hatred of religion because of his traumatic baptism. He completes his job as a dishwasher and is to become a pickpocket for rich people. He meets a loser named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and two for the relationship. They go out and work together, helping each other. They are thieves. The two grow close and surprisingly fast can not live without each other. Nevertheless, there is something very important to Ratso Sun said Joe, and he can destroy any hope that they have survived the city together. This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is heartbreaking and shattering portrait is also very lonely people who do not have to lose anything except each other. Their story is devastating to watch, but ultimately, it is important for people to see. This is one of those movies where the characters are pretty much the same as it would seem, crazy people are sometimes found on the street. The difference is that this film from their point of view. Their life showed us, and it is devastating to see a pedestrian in this film is to treat them like dirt, especially when we were one of those people at one time. However, the film does not try to guilt trip you. Instead, it shows a rough side lifestyle fuss. It is not very pleasant and relaxing way of life, as well as many Hollywood movies portray it in such as milk money and beauty. A way of life to be a man pickpocket dirty, sandy, and ugly life, and it's sad that people degrade themselves as the character in this film, Joe does. What strikes me most about this film was that it came out in 1969, and it has stood the test of time very well. Today, viewers still find great value in this film, and will still love it and cherish it as much as critics and audiences everywhere made in 1969. The film was rated X, but what I notice about this film is that, that sexuality is portrayed in a much more chestnymy, realistic and effective way. Anyone who has had sex before will know how humorous, defective, and scary as hell, it could be that the film does not shy away from any of this. Sex in this movie can not be descriptive in what was once considered to be. Films that have been X rating, such as Midnight Cowboy, A Clockwork Orange, greetings, Last Tango in Paris, and Fritz PPC everything seems strangely tame compared with the shocking things that people can get away with a rated R today. The sex scenes in Midnight Cowboy will appear quite strong, but they are certainly not sexy. They are not graphic, but they are real, and it's something that people need to keep in mind when they see this film. Language course, used in the film, in particular, the word "fag" is used effectively and is not gratuitous. Violence is very shocking to watch even today, but again you need to plot, to reflect the light from the rogue. I am very glad to see Midnight Cowboy entirely from and still just as affected as it was in 1969, if not more. I can not recommend enough this classic and I hope she continues to find an audience, because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten <br /> <br /> PROS :. <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch. They never played a role like this before as they are completely different from the usual. You'll forget who play them for a few minutes! <br /> <br /> -Beautiful score <br /> <br /> Do not completely obsolete mannerisms or how many films of the decade off as today <br /> <br /> -Fantastic and fast work of editing <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br /> <br /> -To mature audiences only <br /> <br /> -The opening scene is well done, but they can be just a little bit stronger.
