The Lion King 1 1/2 very nice story to go along with The Lion King. It basically follows the original story of The Lion King, but with a couple of twists. In the film, ie holes are explained points of view of different characters. This story is an original story. <br /> <br /> How to go for, Disney is not all that great at creating decent of them. This one, which is the third part in The Lion King (Simba's Pride is the second.) In fact, the original idea is to it at the same time with the pleasure of the first. Timon and Pumbaa trail looking for the perfect place to live. After searching far and wide, they find the place «Hakuna Matata». Then they meet a small lion named Simba, and go through a lot of things that parents today go. <br /> <br /> I think it's a very good film, and I am glad to add it to your collection.
