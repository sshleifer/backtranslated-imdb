I try to watch every day most of the time, and although I watched it for the past 4 years I have not seen every episode. <br /> <br /> The show about Danny Tanner, who is the guy who makes the sport news. His wife was killed in a car accident with a drunk driver, and he asked Jesse, in Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession with his hair. Joy, adult child who does comedy and cartoon voice makes all the time to take care of their three girls, Donna Jo, they call it a DJ, Stephinie which is the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> they all live under the same roof, and no one to help them. <br /> <br /> Later in the show, Jesse gets a girlfriend, and then married her and have twins, Nicki and Alex. (This is beginning to happen in the new season) This show is awesome, if you like the Suite Life of Zack and Cody, so Raven, Boy Meets World, and modelersh, you'll love it. (He starts to become the best in the season finale) Careful, you'll love it!
