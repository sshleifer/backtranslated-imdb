People forget that there were a few King Kong ripoffs- Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), all of plunder each other but YETI stands on its own. It borrows only one element of King Kong, and that is to attract the animals with one woman. <br /> <br /> Yeti myth is based on the snowman (not like King Kong) and the archaeologists were fascinated by it, they do exist at the time, but there is no scientific evidence to prove it. <br /> <br /> This film is hard to find but it is worth watching. The first time I looked, he was on the "Elvira Mistress of the dark shows" in the early 1980s. He sent shivers down my spine, as a child, especially if YE angry. I saw him again, around 1:00 am on ABC about 2 to 3yrs ago. Seeing it again made me appreciate him more, he shares some good effects (for its time), and the story includes a mute boy and his dog, and angry businessman man who wants to kill YETI for their own purposes. Also, the music is pretty cool, it's very like YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and Yetians creates a large monster-like atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and half of 10.
