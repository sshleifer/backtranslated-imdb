For those who think that this is strictly a pot humor and immature, you are actually a meaningless one. Despite the fact that the show does contain its share of the pot jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and satirizes social problems, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. You just need to read some of its material a little bit more to get it. <br /> <br /> What I also love that not everything is the culmination. For those who are waiting for a joke formulated as friends (I love a FYI), you will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses the situation and other ways of achieving its humor, which is more realistic. We do not walk in this world, and not witty punchlines for all to say that in most comedies. Instead, Sarah Silverman Program makes it more realistic in this sense. <br /> <br /> So I do not take it as a senseless humor, because it is much more than that.
