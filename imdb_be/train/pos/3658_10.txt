This film is an allegory of the Gospel. It has the direct honesty and innocence, you can not believe that this was done after World War II, when Italy was ruined and devastated, and was filled with a huge homeless, impoverished population. It is a monument of the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as the endless creative resources of this land of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto Doestoevisky character like in "The Idiot", a modern Christ is finding his way in the big city. He fortified the goodness and purity of love, and his actions to change people he encounters, as many as operating dove miracle. The story is told in a natural way and simple style, but imbued with magic, almost a premonition of surreal fantasies of Fellini. This is one of the most inspiring, sublime films ever.
