I have very fond memories of this film, as I saw it with my two younger sisters when he was first shown theatrically in 1977, and I was eight years old. Apparently, he was recognized as failure - and now almost forgotten (pan-scan and video -. Which have never done justice to the picture or is it ambitious compositions Panavision now out -print) The film is very stylized (shades of yellow Scuba) and admittedly unevenly. Some of the signs and graceful sequences, and several other minors and unobtrusive. Sad blue camel cast (Io shades) and its blue song really friendly. Joe Raposo songs are for the most part simply beautiful. Definitely worth a curiosity that is probably (unfortunately) become totally unknown.
