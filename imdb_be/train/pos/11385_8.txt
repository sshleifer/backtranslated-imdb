This is your typical fun and colorful musical MGM since the beginning of the 50s, and it's definitely one to look better there. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by genre expert Vincent Minnelli and Gene Kelly star in the main lead. And he made a lot of movies together back in those days, of which this is one, probably their best known one. <br /> <br /> The film actually managed to win Oskara` during the year, which meant that beat films like "Place in the Sun," "A Streetcar Named Desire," "African Queen», «Quo Vadis", " blue veil "," Death of a Salesman "in this year. A real achievement, of course, but at the same time and a little too much credit for this wonderful, bright and interesting film. <br /> <br /> If it looks this film will surely be entertained all this, which is also due to its beautiful color film appearance and a lot of good characters in this film. Musical numbers and all beautifully done, that is not a big surprise if you have people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly on the job. <br /> <br /> But, in fact, it could not have been all that was said was in this film done in less Halve hour or so? I mean, we already know where the film is moving towards, but still he managed to stretch it all for as long as possible. Not that it makes the film drag at any part, it just makes it a little longer. The film could also, of course, was done with a few less musical numbers in it. <br /> <br /> One of the best musicals of MGM, which is not without its flaws though. <br /> <br /> 8/10
