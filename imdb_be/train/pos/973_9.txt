Wow! So much fun! Perhaps too much for ordinary American children, but in fact it is a stretch to call this film as a child, this movie reminded me quite a bit of time bandits - very Terry Gilliam all the way through. Although in general the story pretty much straight forward, Miike still throws in a lot of surreal and Bunuel-Esquire moments. The entire first act violently contrasts from the scene to a normal family life, child / with the spirit world of the protagonist and evil than following it. And while the ending is a bit ambiguous aspects that are common work Miike, in layers of meaning and metaphor, in particular, the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human stupidity, damn bitter. As manic and inventive fun as other great films of Miike, only instead of on top of torture and blood, he gives us an infinite number of monsters and Yokai from Japanese folklore creatively conceived with the help of computer graphics and doll wrapped in imaginative multi-faceted adventure, F ' n rad, and one of the best Miike!
