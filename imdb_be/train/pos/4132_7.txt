Comedy, which worked surprisingly well with a bit of British forces "Divorce Lady X (1938)." This is the first pairing of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon to this little film about the uncontrollable passion in the English Moors of the 19th century. And while Olivier and Oberon Sun is particularly well suited for eccentric comedy, it's all flowing along nicely. Oberon Lel, a young woman who ends up in pedantic Divorces (Olivier) luxury Logan through bad English fog prevents the trip. She does everything possible to annoy him - but, in a crazy way films are, he falls in love with her. And it falls on him. But a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when Oberon "Lady XÂ» (that's all it leaves Oliver in the note), as suggested by Olivier to be a married woman. To make matters worse, and more amusing, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier wants to divorce his wife who respects Larry thinks he should be Oberon! There is some good fight-off polls dialogue and fun study of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier doubt, with comedy, but in true Olivier, he is a professional, and delivers. He handles the eccentric turns, may not be easy, but with pleasure. Oberon was unimportant, as an actress, but it is usually quite competent, and, despite their respectable frame unloved, worked well with Olivier. It was filmed at the beginning of the Technicolor, which looks very primitive today (it looks even whiter than Michael Jackson), but perhaps printing needs cleaning.
