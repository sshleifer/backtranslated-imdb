DeMille movie glasses master goes to the west. Using three legends of the old west as its main characters (they probably never met), Gary Cooper, portraying Wild Bill Hickok, James Ellison, as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur makes a good Calamity Jane. History is only for De Mille hang some amazing action sequences on how big the Indian attack.Scenes like that very well done.If you do not mind a few more top performances of the actors is very entertaining western.Look for very young Anthony Quinn essaying the role Indian brave who participated in the battle of Little Big Horn.This part got it at least noticed in Hollywood.
