Acting in this movie was wonderful, but mixed with the truth about the state of many Africans in South Africa made it good. It was good that the writer isolated Boesman and Lena from others to flee their homes, so that we can fully enjoy their triumphs and defeats; conflicts they share as they grew up together and from each other. Worth a look if you put the film in its proper context.
