This film is cold, the naked truth. Often, we think, "Oh, no, it will not happen to me." But it is possible. Drug smuggling large sums of money, and people often unknowingly (or trick) to do things for smugglers. The story of these two girls, is the story of many young people who love them, just like an exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare. People need to know that these genera events can not be excluded, or exaggerated. - this is a serious problem in today's society <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to catch the viewer because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this film. This is a very emotional and raw. Well worth a look and, of course, will remain in your memories.
