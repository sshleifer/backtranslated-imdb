I do not mind all the walking. People are really going place then. He lent the air of authenticity to this part of the period, and some prospects for the Martians technology. I was also disappointed with the effects, in particular, «Thunderchild» stage, which I think is one of the most exciting in the book. But I can not praise this film enough for his loyalty to the history of Wales! It's about time. Actors pleasant and charming performances. In addition, this film is very much worth a look, to hear really great music by Jamie Hall. It was interesting to see the same actor to play as a writer and his brother in London.
