How big classic Bugs Bunny cartoon, this film there is humor at various levels. I just presented is my 10 year old daughter and 11-year-old son. Both enjoyed the film - is the destruction of laughing quite a few times ... and my daughter did not so much science fiction fan. The film made me laugh even though seen several times ... adult humor level (ie, humor that adults will simply due to greater life experience has not baudy or R-rated material can be found here) keeps the movie the same way nice for adults. For example, adult humor level Martian voice based on the characters of different movies / actors. Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and manner of Jack Nicholson; learned that Dr. Peter Streynzhlav seller. Special effects are surprisingly good for this film. The absence of the 10 best actors are actually working for the benefit of the film and the actors / actresses playing their roles well - in fact I would say that the producers chose actor and the skills to meet the role requirements of the cash draw power (excellent example is Wayne Alexander "Verne" character). I had to write this review ... kids play it on the 3rd time in 4 days for lunch now. Good for a rainy day or late at night on weekends there's-nothing-on-and-I-bored movie.
