It's not exactly a great film, but I admire the writers and director for something a little different. The main theme of the film is the fate and the small, seemingly insignificant things that can significantly change the future. In some ways it reminds me of the movie Sliding Doors, choosing instead to focus on a single random event, seemingly random things happen repeatedly, and each of them helps to build to a pretty conclusions. In addition, the odd bald guy seems to understand all this, and he said this during a brief scene - like he was some kind of all-powerful beings, but there is absolutely no explanation for it in the movie (as two guys who are fighting each other in the tower clock in Hudsucker powers). <br /> <br /> DVD-shell only shows Audrey Tautou. It capitalize its success in AMELIE, although it is only one of many actors in the film and there is a major role. The pace brisk, acting fine and imprisonment not bad. The only reason why I did not kill him earlier that some characters were a little uninteresting, and I think the film would probably become more stringent with a few less podagovorami.
