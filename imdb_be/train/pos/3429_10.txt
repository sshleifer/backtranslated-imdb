I saw this film premiered Friday (1/19) night in Park City for the Sundance and was incredibly moved. Sitting in the theater and hear first-hand the tight soldiers pass was almost more than I could bear. Others in the audience were equally moved and while we would like to turn, at least we could have done, shows how these men and women shared their experiences with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Riekhoff Sean HAZ and Gerold by Noel, all veterans of the war in Iraq and in the film, was present. While they can be at home at the moment, you can say that this war is still inside of them, and probably always will be. Do you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
