This dramatic film in all sense of the word. This indicates a tail that here, in Greece, in which we live, as the routine of everyday life, not realizing how boring. Of course, it has some extreme .. but every now and then a real life sorrow surpasses art.It deeply critical objectives we pursue and the entire social structure to build around them. The film has a more profound understanding of the Greek way of life, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have some fast food with the primary audience, this is one not the goal of anyone in particular, but while you're watching it, you feel that someone put the best words and images to convey their feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music either, but I did not want to hear anything else, when he played in the film. <br /> <br /> If someone had told me to say something against this film, I would identify the following, sometimes the transition between scenes, seemed suddenly to or more cut. I believe that the editing had to cut it to fit 2hours and a little to the theaters .. <br /> <br /> In any case, I could write more and more to express their opinion on this matter, but I believe that you have to see it and discuss it with a friend. a must see
