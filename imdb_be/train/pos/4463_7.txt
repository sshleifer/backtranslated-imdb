A recent preview HERE ENTERTAINMENT gave me the desire to observe many of the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties. Anchors Aweigh, of course, is less than the film city. The songs are not so good, nor the chemistry between the characters. But the film beautifully weaves classic favorites such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene in the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly comes out of it at the top of the forest, and then run down the stairs, while dozens of pianists play the piano, the best scene in the film, even though the scene in which Kelly dance with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify music pianists play. Sinatra is singing, "I fall in love too easily," before his enlightenment about who he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks with its mountains and non-polluting air (Can you imagine a Hollywood in the twenties, not to mention the middle 1940?), and piano music is absolutely gorgeous. the MGM, of course, had a nose for creating lyrical moments like these.
