Robert Stack never got over losing the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Kyle in "Written by the wind" to the 12-minute performance by Anthony Quinn in "Lust for Life". Stack plays a deeply disturbed alcoholic son of oil tycoon. He lived his life in the shadow of his friend, with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy (Lauren Bacall), who becomes the wife of Kyle. Sister Kayla, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who is in love with Mitch. Their story played out in glorious colors, under the able leadership of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the field of romance with some incredible films, including "Imitation of Life", "All that Heaven Allows", "Magnificent Obsession" and many others. <, Br /> <br /> not be mistaken - this is trash, and Stack and Dorothy Malone to make the most of their roles, Malone won the Best Actress Oscar. There's a strange scene, mentioned in other comments, where she wildly dancing to loud music, as her father collapses and dies on the stairs. We are led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy who pumps gas, because she is in love with Mitch. Mitch does not want to have anything to do with it. He is so in love with Lucy, that out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran, to avoid the bad. I doubt that he would have wanted to get today, no matter how much in love he was <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall are less interesting role here. - Mitch Hudson is a good guy who was cleaning Kyle spoil his whole life, and Bacall Mitch's wife, who finds himself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after years of sobriety. Sirk is focused on the more volatile fellow players. <br /> <br /> The Cirque hand, in the "Written on the Wind" is an effective film, and a big stage before the end of the mansion is particularly exciting. The director was present for this type of movie, and although he had many imitators, he never had a flat.
