I remember this movie. Rather intensively for 11 years. Good editing, I felt terrible for the St. Bernard. I watched it again, if it was relayed, but the signal passes Pluto, as I write this. Robert Culp. The culmination of his career. I'm just glad I do not live in the area. About the 70s. That decade. If they remade it, I bet it will be a very strong and bloody. So what are they waiting for? Great movie for pre-pubescent boys suburban. It was very intense. I think that it was filmed in Los Angeles. Of course, not made in Lodz New Jersey. Shot of Saint-Bernard was the best and, obviously, the most memorable way of the movie ... and then they left the corpse on the steps. Rotten kids.
