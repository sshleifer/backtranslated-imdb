This is a really funny show, made in a horrible sort of way, as well as a film by Tim Burton. It's worth a look, as it is much more creative than most of the show this season. Best of all, it is not the "reality" show. I wonder why the viewing audience as the show is ready to accept as a fact (that lacks creativity) and ignore the great show like this that actually have a creative bent. <br /> <br /> While some drive space, I think it's really unusual. Much nicer than the "ghosts" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest thing on the tube as "My Name is Earl." <br /> <br /> Oh, and the story and the music is excellent. If you like the show, which are a little off the beaten path, I would recommend it. This is not as strange as Twin Peaks was, but it has a serious kink to it.
