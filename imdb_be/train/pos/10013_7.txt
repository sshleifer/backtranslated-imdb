As one of the previous commentators said it was the basis of a great movie, but something happened on the way to delivery. Such waste, as Collette performance was terrible and Williams was plausible. I just kept waiting for him to get better. I do not think it was bad editing or need another director, he could have just been a movie. He came across as a Canadian film, something like the first few seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just a fake. You also need a bit more suspense. Something that makes you jump off your seat. The film reached then the moment was gone; like a false menopause. I can see as too disturbing would take from the "reality" of the story, but I thought that part was reached, when Gabriel was in the hospital, looking at the boy. This film should be cut by a Director who is trying to solve these problems.
