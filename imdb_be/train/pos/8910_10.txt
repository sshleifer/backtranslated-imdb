Most monsters Atomic Age movie I saw on TV as kid- and some of them, BLOB on, scared me outta Sparks. Movies like invaders from MARS made all too clear to us "trifle" that kids just should not be trusted when it came to such things as things burst into Homeworld; Drop only confirmed this fact. I remember fondly, late in the evening, spent stretched on the floor, watching as Snatchers body and Martian invaders and Blobs leaked to the unsuspecting public. summer was in the early 1980s, when the local science museum (Richmond, Virginia) led the Atomic Age classic every weekend. It was a 16 mm film, and most of them were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and press "colors" Blob faded to a weak pink-, but man, it was fun. I pulled together my mother, and she loved it as much as I do. It was there, in the museum of science that I really fell in love with the blob. The intention of the director, of course, to make money-, but it was the sincerity of all the participants, from the makers of the film to the "talent" (on the players) that made me fall in love with this movie. Trite? You bet. Cheese? They do not get any cheesier. But, man, that movie!
