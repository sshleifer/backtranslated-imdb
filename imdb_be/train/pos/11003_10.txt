Look, I do not care what someone says, like Cypher is not less than 5 movie stars. Cypher NO, I repeat not, B movie. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say, I am a connoisseur of the best in the world of spy films, and this film is no less than the top flight. I can not overemphasis how phenomenal this film. Cypher is one of the best spy movie ever conceived and ever made. The technology in this film over the space-time horizon. In fact, I must admit that the Cypher completely surprised me the hell out. In fact, I recommend this film to my colleagues, more than any other film. Other critics, some of which exaggerate the film, have no idea what the hell they are talking about. Do not listen to contempt. Indeed, for the most part, the Cypher reviews were mostly positive. And it is worth noting that Cyher not only a good movie, but it's also a fantastic film. Cypher is a kind of film that is so advanced and so beautifully designed that it is over the heads of most of the critics and cynics all. There's nothing wrong or cheap for Cypher at all. Again, film, backdrops, technology, story and acting are 100% of the world class at the highest level. Naturally, I will not give anything away. This is not a spoiler. Although this assertion of some critics that Cypher was in theaters, I believe, quite the contrary. Cypher is a film that seems to have been just right on a DVD-only release, but not in a bad way. Cypher is necessary to be the largest underground spy movie ever on the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Run Logan, Jason Bourne, and The Pretender, and Deja Vu ... beware! Cypher equally earns the honor of being placed in AONN Multimedia Research, 5 Star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher is a counter-intelligence in this best. Hands down, and hats off. Nothing is what it seems, and the truth is stranger than fiction. The future is now.
