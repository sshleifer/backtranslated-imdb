I used to comment on the IMDb, but I do not do that anymore. It happens that IMDb has become popular, and thus subjectivity killed dozens. What do I mean? This is someone that is not particularly fond of the movie and does not have any experience on the subject, watch some shit (or vice versa), and if he likes it, gives 10, and if he does not, he goes to 1. This, Of course, I can not measure correctly. Now for the film. I'm really sorry that sometime in the 10s, which for some very few films, because then I have to dial the 12 or 13, which is impossible. This movie is what I did not expect to see more never in my life in any other film. It is simply fascinating, and it's not just a way of saying; it really is. The last 25 minutes have energy load, visual rejoice and wisdom -The words in the title role guys-, that actually ... there is no possibility of the match. I do not hold movies, rarely I have found some meaning in it, but this kind of film you have to buy and hold, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times, the years go by. I got nothing more to say. This is the real goal of 10 for me.
