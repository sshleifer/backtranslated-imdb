This film is a stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical audience that GÃ©rard Depardieu is one of the best actors of cinema in the last 50 years. His productivity shocks, entertains, fascinates and angers, while leaving you breathless. This movie was filmed in the early days of his film career and very raw, but still able to transfer skills Depardieu. A must see for any fan of Depardieu and currently his best early work.
