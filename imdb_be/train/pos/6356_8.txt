I thought, How the Grinch Stole Christmas was pretty good movie.It was not terrible, and it was great, but it was nice watch.I felt like Jim Carrey was a bit annoying times.They did the Grinch, it seems as special education person when he needed to be evil and insidious, but still it was kind of retarded.I did think the scenery, if not inside the cave Grinch, was beautiful, and there were a few parts where I laughed, but most of the time I thought that it was just annoying.This film may have been "yes" a lot better if they changed the face of the Grinch, and they would Whether included some more laughter scene, because most of the humor is not funny .I like How the Grinch Stole Christmas anyway, but it's not something to admire see.
