One of the best films of Fred Astaire and Rogers Giner. Great music of Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> Stunning songs include «Let Yourself Go», «Let's Face Music" and "Putting all my eggs in one basket." Last Song entered Astaire play jazz piano, and then cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings «Let Yourself Go» with Grable among backup singers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (Hilliard then) singing two good songs and plays Mousy sister Rogers. "Get away from me," is a song that sticks with you for a few days. She also sings, "But where are you?" lively and fast-paced, this entry in the series Astaire-Rogers is one of the best s. The classic and surprisingly beautiful ending, "Let's face the music and dance" it is one of the most famous among them. Rogers is one of the greatest dresses in cinema history .... shimmering sequins number that swirls around her feet as she dances (weighted hem), and also a little to see through. Just great. It's a number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters recreated in pennies from heaven. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott, seems an odd choice as a friend Aster, but he also appeared in their Roberta Irene Dunne. Fortunately, he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grabe and Ball would have a large part in 1936, but they have a few scenes and make little impact. Allwyn has a big role, but only in order. <br /> <br /> Rogers is one of his best solo numbers in the series «Let Yourself Go» .... Jazzy and knocks, it's a great song. <, Br /> <br /> Fun all the way, even though I was tired, "We Joined the Navy" after the third time ....
