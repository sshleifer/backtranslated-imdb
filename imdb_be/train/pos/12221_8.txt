This is a good piece of work. There is very sexy and attractive site to hold my interest throughout. Its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made for TV: Full screen, and although there were a few sex scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but boy did it close!). Strange, too, since Netflix shows that it was rated R. <br /> <br /> However, it tickles and I want Alicia Silverstone has done more movies like this. <br /> <br /> One reviewer Netflix said that it was part of a series, but I could not find out what number that is. I would like to know, though, because this movie was so good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 8/23/2005
