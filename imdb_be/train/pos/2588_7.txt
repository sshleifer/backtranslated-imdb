Brothers with psychokinetic powers (so, actually) fight not only for bias Debra Winger, but in fact a secret from his childhood, which left them in trouble on their own. <br /> <br /> There is a surreal touches (fire brigade, act as a Greek chorus singing), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is excellent, just as An American Werewolf in London, used every big Wolf song they could get ~ but the fire ~ and I do not think I ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting your own trailer for rockin 'to "She's a lady" ~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> The best line is missing in the section quotes the way ~! Once you have a clown, you never go back "<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered a DVD from the USA), and if the comments written on the kind of people who would be more than happy with the Stamp Blond -nya put you ~ give it a try :)
