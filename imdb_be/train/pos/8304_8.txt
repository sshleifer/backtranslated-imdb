I caught this film late at night sitting / Sunday morning with my brother. We drank. This is one of the best films for the broken I have ever seen. From the "luxury" ocean liner actually being the "roll on, rolls" pair, complete with all the cast iron to the door with adhesive sticker speak to employees, they see the same door used for something else in a different place - this film is a rock !! Continuity is so bad, you can not help but notice he slaps in the face with holes. In the final scene, he jumps on a lifeboat with a ferry in the distance. Cut his son and new girlfriend (ships with the public relations director, who knows kung fu and used to be the police, but was fired for these things her way - the truth) on the ferry is very fast from the explosion. ...... Then, dad there hugging them. HoW ???? Who cares, his magic. There is no one softening for this film. Casino size with a large bed with a table in a casino. when pursued by the villains there is only one place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the villain, who, instead of checking for a table, go shoot four fruit machine and a small corner bar (corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They go straight past the only hiding place, thus allowing our Casper, get around them and "take them." <br /> <br /> Get some friends over, get a few drinks in, put this film, and howl.
