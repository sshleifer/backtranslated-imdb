Do you like really inventive comedy or you love "in Wedding Crashers," if the last stop reading the answer now. I can not believe that this film is not higher than the rating. Basically Meadows plays a character not unlike Austin Powers.There so many ingenious moments in this gagorama. Coarseness - Leon plays himself on the porch, a former boyfriend cheat food. , Oh, good. To lunacy- inspired clown sex routine Broadway, voice over. Meadows big as a nursery, but very sweet natured Leon. Some great lines of "do not blame Van," "bizarre sex deaky world" too much. ,, Why this film was not huge, it remains a mystery. Much comedy.
