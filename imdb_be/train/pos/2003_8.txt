The main problem of the first "Vampires" movie is that none of the characters are not sympathetic. Carpenter has learned from its mistakes and this time used the cute vampire hunter and charismatic vampire. Una vampire, of course, the coolest vampire as Deacon Frost blade. Unfortunately, while there are some good thing as cool slow motion restaurant scene (why not use more of the Carpenter ??) this film is not as good as it could be. I expected to see strongest vampire in action and at least one more good strong choreographic fight sequence (for example, within the city), and it left a bit disappointed. While the income of "dead" faster than its predecessor, it still pulls a bit in some parts (though not as bad as "vampires" did). Just as "Vampires", but the climax of the film towards the end is not very intense. <br /> <br /> Most of vysheperechislennoga may sound like a "dead" a bad film, but it is definitely not the case. It is usually nice and one of the best records in the genre. It is neither a banal remake of Dracula (as almost any other vampire movie there) and not an unreasonable action spectacle, as the Blades II. He could have used a little more excitement. <br /> <br /> I'd really like to see a third party made by Carpenter, but it probably will not happen. <br /> <br /> WARNING Spoiler ending was too predictable. Una had to get away-, which would have made the film quite unusual.
