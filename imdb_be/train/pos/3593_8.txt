Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school with arrogant frowning and 2 x 4 at its shoulder. She is ready to fight anyone, especially her father, who pays for the boxing lesson of his brother. Diana decides boxing will be a good way to focus his anger. <br /> <br /> I like the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas Adrian excellent. See how their emotions in relation to each other, in the form of a square circle.
