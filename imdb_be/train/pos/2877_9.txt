I do not think I need to tell you a story. After all it has been said for many years. So I just share their feelings. The first time I saw Cinderella, when I was five years old. Ever since I was a Disney kid in a good way. Animation for children and now it seems old-fashioned, but that's part of its charm now. Now, in the age of High School Musical and computer generated images, it seems that people have forgotten the essence of genius and magic of early Disney films. Fortunately, I was born to it, so I was introduced to this classic. And it does not seem to matter how old I get, I turn back to the fact that five years of watching it on VHS. Which is the real magic of Disney.
