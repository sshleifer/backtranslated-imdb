Sudden Impact is usually regarded as an artistic failure Eastwood at the time in his career, he has created a good reputation as a filmmaker. The reason is not really the film itself, but the attitude he takes the side of lynching, which he seems to support. In some places really should be more willing to death, than the original Dirty Harry movie. One could argue if it SO- in the end, this is a film about guilt, justice and retribution. For me, in the end, is more sympathetic than sympathy. However, in view of all these considerations is easy to overlook that the sudden impact of a very well made film. Forget about the "go ahead punk, make my day scenes", the iconic, but not original. But look at the view of San Francisco taken from the air, the increase in the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes is quite spectacular. Or look at the brilliantly made a scene where a character Sondra Locke visits her mentally ill sister in the hospital. Eastwood makes great use of matching faces. So in general, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood as director. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on the screen, although in an action movie discussion ideology. In addition, I think that this is the first well-developed film directed by Eastwood. Although Eastwood has immense talent as a director, drama has always been his weak spot (see Play Misty for Me, Breezy, etc.) Thepace narrative leads to visual elements that are well integrated into the film and do not distract from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog.
