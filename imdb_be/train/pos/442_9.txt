This is what I call the film growth. Each character is unique and the best in the final and it's all because a woman knows that the place they have chosen a "bath of love." Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedy, really shines as a woman who brings about all these changes. Even the people in the film are from selfish to better men. The book was very faithful to the novel, which is a plus in my book, as I librarian. The scenery spectacular and the message of true love.
