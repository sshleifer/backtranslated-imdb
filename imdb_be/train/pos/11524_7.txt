This quaint little film, and I agree that there are some of the brisk acting in it as well. <br /> <br /> He tells about the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Las Vegas magician and part of the next of his dreams, partly drugihov about dreams, and all the hardships of show business. I thought that the film was magical, and he has a moment or two of real magic, which make it all worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is stunning, like a magician, who has never been, and his teachers Max makes a funny and touching relationship. <br /> <br /> Not all, perhaps, but if you like movies about travel, I think you'll like it.
