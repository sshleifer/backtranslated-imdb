This is a great film about the traditional working-class family in the North of England. Filmed on location in Bolton, it stars James Mason, as a father, which is the dominant force in his home. Or so it seems. Cleverly, the film based on the play reflects the complexity of family life. The supporting cast is terrific as well, a lot of familiar faces support.
