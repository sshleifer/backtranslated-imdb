Eddie Murphy Delirious, surely the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life. When I saw him for the first time about 2 years ago I was in stitches for weeks afterwards. To date, I've seen it 17 more times and I still laugh my ass off every time. For those who do not know, Eddie Murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian, before he was a Hollywood superstar. There is not a dull spot in this part of the genius, unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, which was released in 1987, which is in the middle of the apartment. If you are not the person who can not stand the abuse, then I would not advise you to see how you are likely to hear the scolding some form every 5-10 seconds. I gave it 10 out of 10, because it shows the greatest comic genius of them all at their best.
