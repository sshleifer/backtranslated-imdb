I first saw this film as a boy and had recently bought it on DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart brings greater depth the role of Chip Hardesty, hard-working and determined FBI agent. His life in the Bureau is interspersed with his family life, which is not all rosy. His wife (an excellent portrayal of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his work, and they even separate for a time; Chip's best friend and fellow agent Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) was killed in a shootout; Chip son, Mike, enlists in the Marine Corps during World War II. Despite all this, the family continues with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are very exciting and a semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. And the music of Max Steiner says it all; loyalty, courage and honesty. <br /> <br /> This country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women, the FBI, and, yes, J. Edgar Hoover, as well. If Mr. Hoover observed a type of vigilance, we could have avoided 9/11 surge of crimes against children, and many of the corrupt politicians, we should have to put up with the date of its passage.
