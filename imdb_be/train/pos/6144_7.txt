I saw it when The Wonderful World of Disney, as a child, so I do not remember much. As I watched it recently, I sat and thought: "This is the strangest thing I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> «run» the scene look like something caused by an overdose of LSD. Cartoon characters mostly oddly colored / articulated version of The Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters. Some things are not Disney I noticed: the children threatened by knife point and prostitutes (during the song Portobello Road) <br /> <br /> It was very interesting, although the musical numbers were long, and I see a little. Children get bored with them. In addition, the subject manner was a little dark, seeing as it was set during WW2.
