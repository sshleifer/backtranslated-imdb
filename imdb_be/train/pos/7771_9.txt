The absolute summum in the work of the cunning Dane Douglas Sirk (sort Detlef Sierck) Written on the wind makes our lustful attention in each frame tasteless. For its fairness famous opening sequence, with leaves blowing in the baronial foyer Texas mansion and the wind slicing calendar page flashback, the film shrinks in its 99 minutes the whole family affair, which was as a fuel, such later, small-screen fake, like Dallas, dynasty and Falcon Crest over their long-term runs. <br /> <br /> combination of wealth and dysfunction theme of Americans in our dollar-based society, to find irresistible. Brother and sister, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are spoiled, troubled the heirs of the oil fortune Hadly; boyhood chum Rock Hudson Lauren Bacall and groom are reasonable outsiders who are trying to keep a lid on the pot covered. (It was rumored that the story was based on marriage Holmann Libby Reynolds Tobacco money.) As always, the losers are all the scenery to chew - and spit out the best lines (Malone, her performance as Oscar Arrest drunkenness nympho with Jones Hudson receives a fireworks explode from them). Hudson, while good, can not compete with all this over-the-top emoting; Bacall started strong, but growing recessive, and only the convenience area. it does not matter; with the sequence of the subscriber units, captured in extravagant hues, Sirk provides an object lesson in how to get overloaded with melodrama set in a magnificent consumer paradise late '50s America. No one has ever done it better.
