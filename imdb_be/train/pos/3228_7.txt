David Webb Peoples met Paul Anderson ... if it already sounds strange to you, you're right, because it is. <br /> <br /> Peoples known for his scripts with the moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc ... He covered these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and to a large extent in all its screenplays have something along those lines. <br /> <br /> The first successful film Paul Anderson was violent thriller, No wonder why there is all his other films! But tight thriller with moral consequences! <br /> <br /> The script peoples is quite obvious in the first half of the film. Soldiers trained from birth, not taught to kill, and will never have a normal life. They are replaced by better, genetically engineered soldiers and Todd, one of the first soldiers left on the planet and left to die. There he must deal with a group of refugees, some want him to stay others hate it, and there is an interesting drama here. But then ... <br /> <br /> ... bullets begin to fly as new soldiers go to the planet for military exercises and try to score all the people. Big, strong, sonorous effect occurs and the script peoples Anderson turns action-festival. Hard to believe that the script was written in a way, but the end product is better than I expected. Fascinating, somewhat, though admittedly, not very thought-provoking, and excited at once the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence
