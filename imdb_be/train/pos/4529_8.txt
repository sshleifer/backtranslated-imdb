As is well known, among the long-haired teen is incredibly interested in this quiet tirade Mr Graf, in the summer aristocrats like to travel in an exclusive and wonderful places to escape the heat, and hordes of rude people with their ease. Such strange traveling around the world and takes place in the "Three Ages", charming and elegant unit silent operation directed by old hands, namely Mr Buster Keaton and Eddie Herr Klein. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this German Count liked the first segment focused on the Stone Age because of the affinity that this aristocrat feels about this ancient time. preferring that the second segment, which takes place in Rome glory (it should be incorporated cause collapse of the Roman Empire, i.e., Barbara, or the same, German). Of course, the third segment takes place in the course of our time, but this Teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago, should be classified as current. <br /> <br /> leitmotiv that moves, Mr. Keaton and his companions to travel and endure weird and funny scene in three different ages, it is the search for love, a very difficult question to understand, for the aristocrats who prefer to search for money and own interests. Each time the "Three age" is shown at the Schloss theater, it's always a pleasure to watch a funny, witty silent film (even for the serious German Count), creativity saturated gags and gadgets, puns, lapses and acrobatics, visual and amazing techniques the absolute silence of the delicacy, which is ideal to carry a variety of rough and the summer period of deprivation. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will allow me, I must temporarily leave because this German Count must flirt with the old Teutonic heiress who does not look his age. <br /> <br /> Mr. Graf Ferdinand von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
