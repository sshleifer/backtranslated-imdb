The history of the FBI, as told from the perspective of the agent Stuart through flashbacks interwoven with the story of his personal life. Stewart and Miles (his wife) is quite good as Hamilton as a major agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to participate. It's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different films, we get glimpses of who's who cast a mobster. Some of the episodes are too long, some are too short, and some just look out of place (schools sequence daughter of Stewart). In general, it takes too long. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to look at her beautiful production values.
