If the little hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherited a magic ring from his uncle, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of the evil dark lord. If the ring end up back in his hands, he will restore its power and destroy Middle-earth. Frodo and his loyal friends go on a quest to destroy the ring with a group of soldiers. This underrated adaptation of the classic novel, because it covers only the first half of the story. Despite this, it is an epic and amazing animated film. <br /> <br /> Animation beautifully made of Rotoscope, which tracing of live action shooting. Bakshi worked well with a low budget, it was given. The film also has a grand score of Leonard Rosenman, corresponding to each scene. There are several plot holes by using a script, but it must be justified, given the original deal was to make the book into two films of the trilogy, much had scored in the first. My biggest gripe, some of the characters design, Samwise was a little too blunt, while the other hobbits act completely normal. The other characters are really well written for the screen and the voice actors do a great job, I was glad that Legolas is actually a bit more useful to the plot. In rotoscoped Orcs more funny than scary, while the Ringwraiths are terrible and dreadful. <br /> <br /> Another problem lies in the fact that the evil wizard Saruman called Aruman, thanks to writers. Overall, I think a little bit more money and the best writers have made it much justice, but there is something charming about it. Bakshi made a valiant effort to make screen adaptation of the classic stories. The film suffers badly from blighted movies live action, but it's still a great film for lovers of animation of all ages.
