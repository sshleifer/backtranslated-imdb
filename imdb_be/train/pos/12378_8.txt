In the hands of a more experienced director, this film would have been considered a masterpiece of horror. Despite Michael «Death Wish» just passable direction of the winner, the film interesting, original and more than a little scary. <br /> <br /> The script bucks more than one horror stamped on his back (a few can not shake), including Chris Sarandon as the boyfriend of the heroine, who really listens to her as she insists that terrible things go down. Burgess Meredith as beautiful as lovably crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner is haunting the young Beverly D'Angelo, her mute and broken lesbian lover. John Carradine makes pen-to-work, sitting in a chair. And watch out for a short cameo by unknown, in-the-time Chris Walken! This film is a terrible and creative. The plot twists are excellent, if a little predictable. The culmination of which I will not give any details, a matter of concern and very great. Again, best director could do more with it, however, it's pretty decent. - at least those with a sense of seventies horror <br /> <br /> If you like modern excess body count of torture fantasy, you won 't like it. There's almost no gore. Direction rather spartan. The effects of small, although there are some gorgeous makeup at the end - the majority of which in fact it does not make up ... but perhaps I have already said too much <br /> <br /> I is a bit rating. higher than its quality can justify, but I enjoyed it as much as any "8" is a film that I have seen.
