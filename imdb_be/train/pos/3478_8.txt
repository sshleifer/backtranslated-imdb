It was actually my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought that each episode has more of an edge to it, and the villains were a lot of creative thought put into them (and even very scary and believable as well). Some of the best episodes were «I Left My Neck in San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Screams Under the Sea", "Vampire, The Bat and The Ugly" and "If you want to Creature Star». If you've never seen these episodes, please. The series was a bit of variety, though, as there were other episodes that does not give up, have the same edge to them, such as the «Rocky Mountain YIIII!» And «buys Scooby Chief». Just like the series in front of her, she was very well together, an interesting story, and brilliantly painted. As everyone says that, although it would be much better off without Scrappy Doo. The character was a tedious and distracting to the story, which is told.
