Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking gangster who turns himself into the police and illegal gambling (for reasons that seem unclear to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thugs who frequents pool room and spend their free time jealous of Frank. Being in the right place at the right time, Tony bullpen with Frank and sent to prison ... where they form a bond that can not fully be friendship, but it will do for now. <br /> <br /> This film came to me under the name of "Frank and Tony," that annoying, because I see the alternative name "Mean Frank and Tony Crazy", which would help to sell the film better. I believe that it is a tribute to the "Dirty Mary", but what do I know? I watched it shortly after another Italian crime film «Violent Professionals», and I must say, the two complement each other very well. <br /> <br /> The Italians have always lagged behind the Americans in their budgets and production values, which is a real shame with this film. It is considered the movie "Grindhouse," which unfairly lowers it to the b-movie (or worse). With clear sound and images, this could be a Hollywood hit, I suspect. I found that the story is very interesting, the characters (and the actors) are better than the national average, and in contrast to the «Violent professionals" story is pretty clear. - not too many secondary characters <br /> <br /> If you like the mafia movies or crime movies that you have to give it a try. The film about the Mafia, which is actually from Italy (as a more authentic you want?) There are as many as you can ask. Of course, this is not "The Godfather", but it should not be. This is not a drama, it is a light comedy, heavy action as the other movies ... «Die Hard With a Vengeance" from the perspective of the bad guys. Well, not really. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, this film made me want to check out other movies with the director and gypsum principles. Films, except "Escape from New York" (where VanCleef played "Hawk") and ordinary cult films. What's more fun than finding a lost classic?
