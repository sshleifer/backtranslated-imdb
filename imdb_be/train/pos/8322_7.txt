IQ is a cute romantic comedy starring two great actors who seem to click well on the screen. The plot of the typical guy's wrong for a girl, guy gets girl format, but makes a strong point that should be loved with the heart and not the mind. Adding Albert Einstein and his team provide excellent comic geniuses. Overall, a good movie. Not great, but good
