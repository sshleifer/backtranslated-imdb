The original DeMille film was made in 1938 by Frederick March. Very good film indeed. Love Hollywood remakes brings us a very interesting film starring Yul Brynner. Of course, he was brilliant, as it almost always seemed to be in all his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a genius. However, the film as a rule, to get a little long in places. He does not move at a pace of version 1938. However, this is a fun film that should be seen at least once.
