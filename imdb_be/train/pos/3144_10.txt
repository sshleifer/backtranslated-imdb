This is one of the best comedies ever been on television. Season one was hilarious, like most of the following season. The only reason I give this show on 9/10 because of a bad last season. The only good part of the final season was ending. My favorite part of the show were scenes carved in the imagination of people, often show the characters in the famous TV shows and movies from the 70s. This is a rare show that I loved every character (except for the last season ... too late to try to develop a new character and the fez was not nearly as funny). Reda toe-ass comments never grew old, and not the stupidity of Kelso. Bravo Fox to maintain such a good show for so long, far too long.
