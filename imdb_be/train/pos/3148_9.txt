I love this show. Period. I have not looked for a long time, probably only about six months or so, in fact, but it is now my favorite show, and probably will be for quite a while. I love all the characters, except I do not really care about Donna. I'm not quite sure why. Just..don't I find it funny, and I do not think that Laura obstacles very good actress. Besides her, I find that the rest of the cast very well. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, who played Eriksen parents were very funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I do not really hate the 8th season. I still watch it, and it makes me laugh. But when you compare it with the show early seasons, its..not well. Randy awful. The final was decent, nothing amazing, but good. =] I think it would be better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but oh well. I have a fourth season on DVD, and someday I hope that all eight seasons on DVD. Some of the most hilarious episodes, in my opinion, were the "Dine & Dash", "Grandmother Dead», «Red & Stacey», and "band", but I love every episode I've seen so far, which is the most them, I think ,, =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend. =]
