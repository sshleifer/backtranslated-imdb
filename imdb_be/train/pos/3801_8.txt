This CGI animated film based on the animated series French 2D. Series briefly worked for Cartoon Network, but its launch has been so short that its inclusion as one of the potential candidates for the Oscar for best animated feature film at this year left the majority of the people I know, there is a "Huh?" It's a story about Lian- Chu, courtesy of the heart muscle, and Gwizdo, brain surgery, which together with Hector their farting fire dragon, he is more like a dog. Travel the world, offering his services as a dragon hunters, but never paid. In their lives comes Zoe, a fairy tale loving niece of the King, who is going blind. It seems that the world consumes a huge monster, and all the knights of the king sent out never returned, or returned when they return to the dust. In desperation, the king hires a dragon hunter to stop the world eater. Zoe knows tags along ... <br /> <br /> What can I say something else, why this movie is hiding under a rock? It really is a nice little movie that is completely off the radar, except in the unlikely event of an Oscar contender. Its beautifully designed, fantastic-looking film (world it takes place has a floating earth and crazy creature) that constantly had me going "Wow" on it. English voice cast from Forest Whitaker as the Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard), and Rob Paulsen as a Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi) is first rate. This is a great script that does not tell his audience, using some real expressions usually heard in animated films (not Disney or Pixar). It's all very well done. <br /> <br /> Or is it cool? No, some of the bits are too long, but at the same time it damn interesting. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see it. Its one of the best animated films, beginning in 2008, and will be on my list of good surprises in 2009.
