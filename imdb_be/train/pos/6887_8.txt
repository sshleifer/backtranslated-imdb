This is a unique and daring film. It is energetic, with a highly developed characters. Very good performances. <br /> <br /> I like directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dare look inside yourself, ask questions, and dig beneath the surface. By the nature of the film, he almost requires the viewer to look inwards as well. It may take some courage to do this. I can see how some close-minded people might find it quite disturbing. Nevertheless, I found it to be suggestive, much more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr really original director with a vision. I'm curious to see what he will do next. <br /> <br /> Watch it.
