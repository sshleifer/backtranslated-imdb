Flock unfairly maligned as the lesser robbery «Se7en». There really is no reason to compare the two, except, perhaps, for a similar decoration in the final battle. <br /> <br /> Now that it's out of the way, I'll go in why Stae very interesting in several respects. Basically it is a piece of drama, rather than a full-blown thriller about a very vigilant social workers, who watches for sexual crimes. In the beginning, you can clearly see his work gained the upper hand over him. Expressed in two stages, where the first he interviews the offender and slaps him around, and second, when a woman tries to pick it up and all he can think of is it the standard questions of its profiles. <br /> <br /> Gere very well and Errol Babbage, the above-mentioned social worker. His way to carry out their work not unlike the police, he carries a gun and constantly check the newspaper and the right unit officers with the information when some of his "flock" may be responsible for sexual crimes. In addition, he is a man who has lost all the happiness of life, and his only relief seems to come from demanding their lynching on his flock. Twice you see him smile once, when he asked for forgiveness for the treatment of a partner in a rude manner, and another after he shot down a member of his flock. <br /> <br /> The suspense film, The Flock is not so successful. A bit confusing and some annoying plot holes, but it has a number of striking set pieces. <br /> <br /> Overall, Flock is a solid drama about a man who carries dehumanizing work and in the end he has to work in order not to be swallowed by the abyss, he surrounded himself. the world we live in quite a sore spot, and then you can distance themselves from the worst happier that man. Flock gets this point well.
