This is just another example of the absolute genius of Gene Wilder. He wrote and starred in this terrible secret. No one could do it better. The suspension was palpable everywhere. I want Mr. Wilder decorate us with another one. I've enjoyed everything I've ever seen Mr. Wilder in Russia, but I had no idea how to really talented, he was, until I saw "Murder in a small town", and this number later. He really has a firm grasp on what the audience wants and how to deliver it in writing and, of course, in his brilliant acting. His subtle mind comes a shovel. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves secrets and / or work in the Gene Wilder film. His star just gets brighter and brighter.
