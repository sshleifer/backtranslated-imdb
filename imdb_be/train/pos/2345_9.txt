I really enjoyed the first episode, and I'm looking forward to more. A little soft on the crime front (it is almost an afterthought, and not disturbing or specified), but thought that the angle of the romance was magical. I will watch again for sure! <br /> <br /> I hope that they will have a big role to aunts, what wonderful actress and it was somewhat underutilized at this time. The actress, who played assistant / waitress (also from fascinating, I think) is very sweet and bubbly and comes off as nice and sweet blunt instead of dull and annoying, which is very nice. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
