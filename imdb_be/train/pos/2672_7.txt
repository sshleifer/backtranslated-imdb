"Journey of Hope" tells the story of a poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope, downward spiral into despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this film is Oscar winning pretty well made, it is not in fact, and has many implausibilities. Most of the 1.7 hour run time of the film is to get on the bus, get off the bus, get on the boat, out of the boat, get in the van, get out of the van, etc.; time that could be better spent, or leave whole. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who have a general understanding of the crime of illegal immigrant trafficking. Which are quite fascinating and watch, but overrated.
