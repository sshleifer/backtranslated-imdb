For such films as `Anchors Aweigh», few of them have been awarded many honors like Oscar heat for a happy hour. Or 1945 was besieged for a year or a good movie, they are still suffering from the shock down Billy Wilder's' The Lost Weekend », they wrote something, starting with A in the voting for best picture to please even the musical picture of fair public. Since Gene Kelly was appointed to this performance, not his role in 'Singin' in the rain, it had to be something wrong with secretly rigging systems on MGM. Of course, the studio is on best behavior during this tour much lauded the big studios of Hollywood and convenient for those who stayed on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> However, a sailor with brilliant musical talent gene and Frank Sinatra, is certainly a pleasant farce, despite the need for more people to yawn a preview for the musical because today's audiences will not be attached to the unnecessary performance. There have been many more pieces before and after, but in this case all the enchanting scenes Kathryn Grayson, could be eliminated. Before viewing `Sun Kiss Me Kate», it may be necessary, Sun opera enthusiasts to watch any of her movies with remote control in hand. <br /> <br /> If you need to practice picking up women in 1949 in `About the city", it is possible that shore leave lucky sailors should not promise to listen to Jose Icherbi and tie on the piano for the entire color rendering of the heart `Suzy ' . Few lucky to get a screen test at MGM studios gold. Then some of them are even luckier to attend. There are no regrets to be had about the successful test, the Susan Abbott or Kathryn Grayson, but it makes a continuous, entirely opera enthusiast hope eventually pink slip to be distributed to both of them. <br /> <br /> But all star talent and a good form of higher average score thrown in with a small but funny story of a large fleet is intertwined with the young ambitious fleet boys is good for later turns wartime morale, making `anchor at least not questioning the wrong MGM movie of choice. Direction keeps both cast brings the story in excellent color cinematography. Every time someone breaks into the music or song, the film makes for a joyous occasion. <br /> <br /> A natural highlight of the film cartoon adventure Gene Kelly in a fantastic, had finished in a brilliant dancing with Jerry the mouse. It is a well-deserved career masterpiece Kelly number, and it's nice to know that he thought about it before Fred Astaire began taking dance on the walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> This is not quite landed triple flavor rainbow sprinkle, chocolate waffles, cream and cherry and banana split ice cream, but it is a square piece of hard sugar, which somehow ultimately melts in your mouth and in spite of feelings of guilt, still a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> rating: 7/10
