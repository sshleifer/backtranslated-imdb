It is easy to notice better performance in Pierce Brosnon. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. In fact, when it was actually being bad? I think this film is incredibly underrated! The use of colors in this movie is something very different in the modern world of cinema, where each film has a blue filter payback. I also love how they used the song Asia. Proving that even what was once thought of as a kind of cheese can be really cool placed correctly. <br /> <br /> I did my first feature, when it came out. Being that my film was a hit man film, I had to check something in the genre, which was released. After seeing it, I'm sure it was some kind of effect on me through the process. It was pretty cool when my film was on IMDb, it would recommend this movie if you liked my. Like any other concern I have no idea what makes it even more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
