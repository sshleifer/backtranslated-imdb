I loved this movie. I am Mexican, and was the least offended them. In fact, I think this film should be shown to the police headquarters throughout Mexico. It is a sad truth that our police system is rotten as a 3-month-old corpse. It angers me to read in the news, as the murderers, thieves and other mucus go free by paying a fine or ridiculous to live like kings inside a prison cell. We have to have someone like Creasy, the character Denzel Washington. The bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Thriving kidnapping industry here (at least in large cities). I really want real-life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as he did his excellent work on Creasy. It would be so wonderful (Unfortunately, I have offended!). MAN ON FIRE is a thrilling film that you can not miss. It can be difficult to some of you, if you are not used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do it all the time while watching American movies), but the effort will be well worth it. Some editing a little fuzzy ... like as TRAFFIC, remember? (Another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico). The movie starts a little slow, but the pace picks up furiously in the second half. I swear, you'll marvel at the way you look Denzel Washington sent the wrong artist. Its implementation is not that other, as Excellent. The ending (no spoilers, well !!!) a little sad, but I'm sure that you will enjoy anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best films in a year. A "must have" for your DVD collection! 9 * 10
