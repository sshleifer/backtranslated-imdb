How can you say that Urban Cowboy was, and still is the best document of life in Texas for a period of time. Consider the following example: Men beat their wives, getting drunk in the bars at night, getting married, to settle a fight, commit adultery, and compete on the mechanical bull. Try to name a film that reflects the real life so vividly. They do not make them anymore. It seems that the current films are always about people with lots of money, they live in huge houses, drive expensive cars and do not work. This film has scenes of celebration about getting a trailer for Pete's sake! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I look at it, at least once a week. No kidding. I dissect this film from beginning to end. feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary. Consider the following scene: Bud see Sissi - they parted - he hums peacefully and waves, she flips him the bird - it returns half the peace sign honking his horn, then to add the effect of tears <br /> <br />. Kidney mom calls it ok. 18 hours after it gets into the city on Sunday to see if he has a job yet -. All he did it drunk and put (x2), with the help of his aunt and uncle, who cover it <br /> <br /> «You all live like pigs" Think about why you need this scene. Think about it. Was it necessary? Can we not understand it, do not show the dirty sink? God, I love it! <br /> <br /> Cisse allows Wes, to help her ride the bull. Only a few days (or perhaps the next day) after Wes just crap feet of her husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissya remember Wes? Oh, and in the box you beat my husband to another night, so let this lesson go, not to talk about what she seeks solace in him later in one of many fights germs and Sissy, which, by the way, everything will be in public places - <br /> <br /> Jill's wedding reception in a photography session (O mankind) may they, at least, to organize or move chairs out of the way. "My legs Sweatin 'Mummy» <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you do not put a scene like this in the movies, to try to show an understanding of human psychology. This is a documentary film about real life. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to cut the uncut ....
