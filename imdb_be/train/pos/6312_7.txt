Before George Clooney directed by Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", they starred in the film. George Clooney was also involved in this film as a producer, and Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believe in this project. Potentially, it also seems like a beautiful and interesting project, which is in the same line with the film remakes such as "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but for some reason this movie is only half successful, or at least it's not as good as it could be. <br /> <br /> in the film the characters are constantly playing some excellent well-known actors, but a shame that the characters do not really give enough space for development. Even if they have the potential they could have turned into a fun and enjoyable characters, they are now only signs that gently entertained, because basically some of the more bizarre sequences that are in the film. The fact that they are playing does not change much on this, despite the fact that they prevent their characters from ever becoming a common hole or maybe even annoying or anything like that at all. <br /> <br /> This, of course, in connection with the writing, that the signs are not used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignotiÂ» works much better than this film does. The film belongs to him too much simple plot and predictable way of storytelling. <br /> <br /> However, the film is just another very fun to watch, perhaps because of the very prostate. This harmless caper movie in which you just have to worry about this story. In this regard, "Welcome to Collinwood" another film that works and just serves its purpose well. <br /> <br /> This is a film that you will not regret watching once you've finished it, but it also 'is a film that you can really easy to do, without seeing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
