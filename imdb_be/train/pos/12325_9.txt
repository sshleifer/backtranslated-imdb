I first saw this movie when it was handed over to the BBC about 1988, when I worked for the UK 2000AD. My buddy Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. Up to this point, I really only saw Kung Fu Shaw Bros films, with their harsh lighting (so the audience could see the movement clearly), so it was a revelation for me to see something that looked like it was the light of Ridley Scott comes out Hong Kong. This was also my first introduction to movie Tsui Hark (pronounced, apparently, "Choi Sound"). <br /> <br /> However, all smoky, backlit exterior and ambitious special effects (animation? Hong Kong in the movies?) in the center of the Chinese GHOST STORY is a simple and moving love story, made all the more real outstanding acting talent Leslie Cheung (what a tragic, tragic waste of life!), and the beauty and elegance Joey Wong. Presented Joey gorgeous, but it was her ballet gestures that give it character unattainable eroticism is difficult to analyze. And while Joe is almost 20 years older (Gawd, who among us is not?), It will always enduring image of the actress. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises, but they let the fact that this film was based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling about 1700! It's a bit like complaining that Romeo and Juliet has a predictable ending, and only copies of West Side Story. (I just wanted to get it off my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, Chinese Ghost Story is the quintessence of romantic tales. It has high tragedy, because we know that Cho Sin Sin and visit can never be together. It is about growing up, because none of us can not make it until we have experienced great losses. We are talking about the victim as the victim is a necessary component of true love. A comedy in the style of Ma did not hurt, either. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Chinese Ghost Story, trying not to watch it through the filter of Western culture, and you get it just fine,
