To project a low budget, the film was a success. The history is interesting, and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who now stars on "the net" TV show is sexier than ever. The seats were ideal for Ganster plot and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget film can avail the best editing transitions and more special effects scenes for the gun, but the music continues to this scenario moves. Despite the fact that this film has its share of problems, such as continuity, I have to say that I wanted to stay in the next film director. If your student film, you can learn something from the director's commentary.
