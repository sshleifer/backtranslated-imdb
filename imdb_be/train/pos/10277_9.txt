It's almost perfect film. Ideas will be repeated Mamet, but never said so succinctly. This is really a failure of confidence, the human condition. The film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, no one to blame. Is there anyone alive today who has not seen this game in our society every day? The film is very structured like a thriller Hitchcock. In addition, there is no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, destroyed, and everyone involved in the game. What could be more accurate? <br /> <br /> Do not miss the soundtrack. It's great.
