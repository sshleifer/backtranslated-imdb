I sat down to watch "Midnight Cowboy", thinking that it will be another overrated 60th / 70th movie. Some of my favorite movies come from the 70's, in the same vein as "Midnight Cowboy" ( "Taxi Driver," "Mean Streets," "The Panic in Needle Park," etc.), but there is much, much too high of these, as well, which we got a strong reputation among critics for being innovative - unfortunately, the vast majority of them do not stand up as well today. I kind of feel that way about «Easy Rider». (Though it too, this is one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> So, I did not expect much from "Midnight Cowboy," but I got a lot back. This is a touching story, well-made and well-told with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman and Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best - it's a little funny sometimes (it sounds like a cartoon character when he says - perhaps because Lenny / "The Simpsons" connection), but Hoffman is quite convincing , Half of the budget of the film went to his salary, he only became a major star in Hollywood. Opposite it is the second beak Jon Voight as Joe Buck in "cowboy" that the North is going to the Big Apple in hopes of becoming a male prostitute. Soon he was naive ways to put him in trouble, and it pairs with lame swindler named "Ratso" -., Who offers to become a "manager" Joe for a certain percentage of profit <br /> <br /> In the film for a long time two hours later, but it never really seems to be a very long time. Some movies may have a tendency to pull, especially some of the films that were made in the 70s, because (as was said in the "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls") directors were movie stars in the 1970s, and sometimes they got too passionate about their stuff going on too long, exploring the characters / scenes / etc .. it does not matter. Just a single scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the party drug. - it makes the movie seem very outdated (by analogy with the odyssey of drugs in «Easy Rider») and actually harms its flow because it does not need <br /> <br /> In addition, the "Midnight Cowboy" with 'it is a near-perfect movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its flaws (retrospective slightly sticky and never used as they could be, for example), and some of the scenes a little bit difficult (for example, the gay movie theater sequence), but if you can cope with its contents "North cowboy "a really great movie, uncompromising study of the life on the streets in the late 60s / early 70s. This depressing film, and by today's standards it might seem a bit outdated, and heavy on the liberal point of view, "life is terrible, and so on," ... but I still love it, and, in particular, is extremely touching ending will stay with me a long, long time. <br /> <br /> it is highly recommended. One of the best films of the 70s. (it was technically released in late 1969, but I still classify it as a movie in 1970 he also won Oskara`, being the first -. and only -. pornographic movie to make it was later re-rated R on the back) <br /> <br. /> 4.5 / 5
