I have seen, The Big Bad Swim at Temecula Film Festival in 2006, and was totally caught off guard, as far as I was involved in it. <br /> <br /> The film centers around the lives of a group of people who take adult swim class for different reasons. Humorous idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for major changes in the lives of students. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the movie was how real it felt. Rarely characters are treated so well in ensemble pieces. I enjoyed the scene in the class very much, and the drama that took place on the street was very acute. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and in the end he left a very strong feeling, as well as attending school or summer camp - where you will quickly find friends, form strong bonds and make discoveries about themselves, but must leave too fast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that the character of Paul had a very strong and unusual introduction that made you want to know a little more about it than is ultimately revealed. I suppose you can not meet with everyone in the class, but ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I found the film very well rounded and very enjoyable. See if you get the chance.
