Carla is a secretary who, in fact deaf without her hearing aids. If it turns out to be overloaded at work, it can hire Paul to help her. Paul has just been released from prison, and his past is not entirely behind him. Say too much more about the history that has many twists, it would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this film for me, as the sound is used to indicate when you can hear Karl and when it can not be - a sort of "point to hear" (eg, point of view). The first stage, which is set up, as well as the early development of the character of Karl and Paul, it was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later, some of which were difficult to follow and / or stretch a little trust. There is also some unpleasant violence. Back to the positive side, the cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing, but it may not be looking for. He is seen at the International Film Festival in San Francisco on 4/28/2002.
