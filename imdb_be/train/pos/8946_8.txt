It can not be a fairy tale female witch on a mortal man, in the world of mortals. Its "community" is open to its members, but it hides its magic mortal. Hmmm ... this is starting to sound familiar. LOL. This is not your typical movie. Very "campy" speech, Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things from getting boring. Kim Novak is always nice on the screen, but I found its combination with James Stewart unusual (but not fatal in the history). <br /> <br /> With the newly renewed interest in all things Witchy and dark, this film deserves to be discovered and rediscovered the old and new audiences ...... it's still HOOT!
