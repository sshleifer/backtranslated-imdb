This film was very good. If you are one who loves to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The action was very good, although I thought that the actress playing Julie would more emotion for her line. Alan was very good, and I thought that was a strange cinema. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time my friends and uncontrolled crying. It was a complete success, in my opinion, and would have to do it on the big screen. I give it two thumbs up! I would definitely say that if you have not seen, which then rent it out. If you have seen it and do not like to go and watch it again because there are parts that are completely unrealistic. I also liked how much the film was shot around and on the territory of my school campus.
