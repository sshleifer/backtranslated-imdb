I went in a straight forward story of the sad / happy-type drama with a good guide and some good performances. This is me. What I did not expect was an allegory for the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 miles trip on the mower and turn it into a microcosm of the human condition. <br /> <br /> If you have not noticed, watching it again, paying attention to the age of the people Alvin meets, the area it passes, the reaction of people to give him, he kinds of discussions (one of the first pregnancy and children, one of the latter is outside the cemetery). Last path he chases down achieve a partial this context, as it narrows and his fear and anxiety mount. Recently, mechanical damage can be regarded as death and miraculous revival of its engine, belonging to an afterlife in which he reaches the desired reunification. <br /> <br /> I just hope that some of those who branded it as slow juicy melodrama take the time to see a more holistic focus.
