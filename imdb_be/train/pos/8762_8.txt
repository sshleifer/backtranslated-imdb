"What would you do?" is a question that will stick in your mind for a few weeks after seeing the emotional ruined palace. You will also leave wondering if Alice (Danes) is telling the truth or not - a question that has remained unresolved, and rightly so. It is particularly well acted and beautifully shot film. Despite the fact that the time of slow his pace is a reflection of the storyline - but a lot of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat; wanting to know what will happen next. The ending, too, will leave you to imagine yourself in the shoes of the main characters, who brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman performance is commendable, too.
