I saw this film is literally more than 100 times ... it is absolutely jam-packed with entertainment !!! Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As a supporter of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebman (Up The Academy, 1981) I never thought that the actor can capture the "intensity" as Shatner and Liebman in those roles, until I saw Boothe how Jim Jones! As I understand it, Powers Boothe, Jim Jones ... this film captures his best performance !!!
