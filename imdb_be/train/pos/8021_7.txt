Third Muppet movie, perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, with a gang of taking them modest musical college on a bright (while flying) lights of Broadway, is usually filled with naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt was unsuccessful and Kerman (leader of the group and author of the show) blows its top; so that others are going their separate ways, so he will not feel responsible for them. Himself Kermen friendly young wannabe fashion designer to make ends meet, serving food in the lunchroom of his father (the old, then there is a line in particular winding nya-sequiturs!). We get the usual occasional appearance of various stars Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as the scammer), Elliott Gould (who was also in the film Mappaet [one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as herself ?? having her portrait in a posh restaurant replaced Kermit, sporting a fake mustache like the famous entrepreneur ruse to attract publicity Muppet show), Brooke Shields, and even directed by John Landis (possibly in a funny scene of the film as a Broadway producer to whom Kerme n is the current StreetWise and friendly and fun donning shades and afro wig!). Other Muppets more or less to pass therethrough typical steps c (unfortunately) less space for a given gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy has something acquired taste with me, the scene in which the last spies on what it takes to be Kermit affair with a waitress ?? and especially its violent reaction to it ?? undeniably funny. What's annoying, however, in itself it is a culmination of the show (after a rather excessive belly in which Kerman gets amnesia and ultimately taking advertising on Madison Avenue), which, instead of the expected procedures catchy, Sun procures anything more original than wedding ceremony Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy!
