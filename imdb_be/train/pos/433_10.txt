This is one of those rare films that's fine and convincing, dignified and brisk, the real gift. I think that is a prerequisite for any trip to Italy or any vacation at all, because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience (yes, find the magic). I especially loved Josie Lawrence and Lottie Wilkins, but every lead and supporting actor in this movie perfectly. Next costume, if you turn to fashion and costumes, which are very good. I just want them to release it on DVD, because I'm wearing my tape version out! <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth your time, just make sure to settle in to watch him, without any interruptions.
