The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance from Christopher Lloyd, whom I love from the previous films. The film was a great family film, anything that you are worried to show his younger children, a good storyline, lots of laughter, carefree and enjoyable. If you want to entertain children, without being bored to tears this fits the bill. Kid pleasant and not difficult for a parent to see how.
