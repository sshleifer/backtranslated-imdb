Squint is very original and funny film. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and truly reinvents it in a good way. This film is a smart, concise, and consistently entertaining and funny. As a writer / director, Jones has full control over their characters that are both absurd and cute. History, of course, that you have not seen before, which is good. This is a unique and fun, and can work in a visually fantastic elements, as well as the long-lost farce genre together to form a heartfelt comedy. <br /> <br /> A very promising first film.
