Before I watched this movie the TV, I do not know a lot about one of my favorite actresses. After watching, I realized how sad life of Lucille Ball really was. He had this great moments, but I do not understand how it was boring. This film was very good and told the story of his beloved Lucille Ball is very good. I highly recommend it.
