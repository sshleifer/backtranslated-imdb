Now it has a name, identity, some of the memories and the lost friend. All he wanted to disappear, but still, they followed him and destroyed the world that he is unlikely to be built. Now he wants an explanation and get ride of people, how to make it what it is. So, Jason Bourne is back, and this time, he is here with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is not the modified script in the world, but its themes are very smart and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, like every Hollywoodian movie from the late '90s, «The Bourne Suprematy» is the story of a super-hero. Jason Bourne project as Captain America, who went completely wrong. In the first movie, the hero displayed his abilities, and he took them into the second. Now he is fighting against what he considers as evil after a person close to him was killed (his girlfriend in «Suprematy») them. It's all part of the history of the super-hero, including the nature of a (realistic, but still impressive: he is almost invincible). Superpowers <br /> <br /> And the interesting point is that evil, he fights all over the world (there are no boundaries in the Bourne films, symbols do not go from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), it is as and in the best season of "24," the American enemy, who is convinced that the fight for the happiness of his country completely blinding him. . Funny how "crazy patriots" are now N.1 enemies paranoid Hollywood stories <br /> <br /> In addition to all of these interesting topics, the film is not flawless: a female character for Nickie Parson is now completely useless and direction rather banal, when it comes to the dialogue scenes. But all this does not matter, for "The Bourne Ultimatum" is a fighter. And the scene is very large. <br /> <br /> All are talking about «Waterloo scene" and «Tanger persecution" and the right of every human being. I especially enjoyed the fight in Tangier, reminding him of exaggeration in my madness and works Tsui Hark. Visually inventive scenes, a lot of smart part of the action and a good reflection on the contemporary American subjects: "The Bourne Ultimatum," by far the best film in the series and a very interesting and original film action.
