The very first image of the film shows a ridge in the early morning autumn mist, and my thought was: "It's almost too beautiful." And it goes like this: The images of the landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic pictures, each of them perfect in every details. Even the girl's, the car my father - all nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. It may seem old-fashioned and escapistic, but it fits the story, which is itself silent beauty of what is happening on the border between life and fable, between the Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute. Extreme frugality of the film, with a simple, slow story, only one actor and almost no special effects, had a strong magic. So I think it's sad that this avarice is given in the last minutes, when suddenly two additional actors (the girl as an adult woman and her son) will be introduced. Another disadvantage is that the music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate: I could not get English pop song with a French mountain glory. I went to the movies with their two young daughters, but I recommend it to adults as well, given that they appreciate this kind of cinema. Obviously, not all do.
