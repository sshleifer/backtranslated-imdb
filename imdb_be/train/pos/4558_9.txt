My Left Foot, In my opinion, this is a great biopic about one of the world's most talented writers and artists. Performances were cuts, the soundtrack was great, and the casting was made. I thought Christie (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, although I could not understand what he was saying, most of the time. In addition, when he threw a tantrum, I was a little scared. Besides, it's just so boring that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a die-hard fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or biopics, I highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world's most talented writers and artists. You are in for a real treat and a good time, so do not miss this one.
