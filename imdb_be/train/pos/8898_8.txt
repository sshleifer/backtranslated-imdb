In the 60's this is a great movie (I saw it completely in one night) of the hippie movement in the late '60s. Although the name would suggest otherwise, the first 5 years of the 60-ies are not very important in this film. <br /> <br /> The film's protagonist, Michael, a political activist who goes on the road in the United States against the Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend, brother Sarah.Michael, in Bryan, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). He returned from the war and changes in the "Tom Cruise was born on the Fourth of July" looks like and then Hippy.His dad is a pro-Vietnam War type of guy (which is a surprise !!). Michael's sister Kate pregnant by artist Rock & Roll, and runs away from home and went to San Francisco during the summer of love. The ending is very bad (the father becomes a liberal and everyone is happy), but I let it slip away from my voice (the rest of the film is very good!). <br /> <br /> performance the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely brilliant. All the main events of the sixties in the film as murder on JFK and Martin Luther King Aswell as the large hippie protests in the summer of love and Woodstock! Look closely at wavy gravy "Woodstock SpeakerÂ» (What do we mean breakfast in bed 400.000!) As an employee ambulance to Woodstock! <br /> <br /> In the end, the 60th a beautiful film about a beautiful decade! 10/10
