This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of the classic novel known to me. Presentation of the Court of Chancery as a "character" in the drama perfectly. Actions amazingly, from the sinister Tulkinghorn to Dedlocks, Smallweed, Hook, Miss Flite, and the two young lovers. But this web of the office that holds it all together, and the cinematography is excellent. What mistake did the BBC to make copyright law, which means that this version can not be seen in the UK in the video or DVD for many years? I tried to find them, but in front of a stone wall. In the end I received a copy of the DVD-Canada.
