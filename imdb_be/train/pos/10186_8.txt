Well, I know that this project does'nt India in a good light. But the general theme of the film is not India, is the Shakti. Force commander, and the power of the mother. Relations between Nandini and her husband and son to swallow you in their warmth. Then things go terribly wrong. Interaction between Nandini and her father in law - the power of their dysfunctional relationships - and her life changed strengths of the film. performance of Shah Rukh Khan seems to be just a cameo, compared with plausible despair Karisma Kapoor. It is easy to get caught up in love, violence and redemption of life in this film, and find yourself with a sigh of relief and sorrow in the climax. Musical interludes strong, credible and well done.
