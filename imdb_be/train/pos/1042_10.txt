American woman, her European husband and children returned to her mother's house in "Watch on the Rhine" in 1943 film based on the play by Lillian Hellman and starring Paul Lukas (which I think repeating his stage role), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Kuluris, Fitszherald Geraldine and Donald Woods. Antifascist, a worker in the underground movement, wounded many times, and would like the Nazis, Kurt Mueller (Lukas) needs a long rest in the estate of her rich mother-in-law. But he comes to the conclusion that there is really no escape, as one of the houseguests (Coulouris) with suspicion as to his true identity and are more than willing to sell it. <br /> <br /> Great performances abound in this film, written by a very select liberal point of view of Lillian Hellman. It was, of course, a powerful propaganda machine at the time it was released, as the evil of war and what happens to people in other countries to achieve security of the American home. great controversy today the film is that Paul Lucas won an Oscar on Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca." Humphrey Bogart was a great screen presence and fabulous Rick, but Lukas grows as Kurt. Monologue it of the need to kill it turn inside, just to mention one scene. <br /> <br /> While it's not what one thinks of as a Bette Davis movie, it gives performance skills are faithful and loving wife of Kurt, Sarah. Her acting tug on the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and gentle. <br /> <br /> In the last half hour of the film in my tears with honesty of emotions. Lillian Hellman's not everybody's cup of tea, but in contrast to the "little fox", she wrote some really nice, great characters and great story gave the casting and production value at Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.
