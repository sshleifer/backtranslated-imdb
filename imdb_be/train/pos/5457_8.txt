This film is one of the riskiest black and white films of the time in the early 1930s to Hoyts Code was enforced. This is the story of a beautiful young woman moved to New York and make your way to the top of the business, using his body as a tool to get there. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays a young and beautiful Lily Powers who really does a pretty good job with her performance. Lily moved to New York City and makes its way up the business place, sleeping with all men. Stanwyck does an excellent performance as a strong woman who uses a man at one time deal, hardly any emotion to them to play them as if they were pawns. Lily Powers woman who does not love her only power and money on his mind. <br /> <br /> I thought that this film to be a little bit different then the other films I've seen, because it is unlikely that the background music heard. I believe that it is only because it is when people were first introduced in the live sound and dialogue between the people of the film. A few times the music can be heard during the beginning, as we have shown, as she makes her way up the chain. Shooting and various scenes was something fantastic! The director of this film has made all the right angles and all the right tricks that makes this film full of realism. <br /> <br /> This film all together are good screening of the end of the film was not as good as it should have been, but it is not to spoil it. Baby Face was his slow moving scenes throughout the film, and possibly a few predictable details, such as who is going to sleep on the other. But this attractive film that you can watch more than once, and suggested to some people and friends.
