All dogs go to heaven most Cutest animated film to have a dog in 1989. The previous Don Bluth film The Land Before Time (1988) was successful. Dogs are so cute, like little mice. Oh, I just want to hug them when they are cute. Where was I? Oh, yes. His great animation, great characters, when they are perfectly voiced songs and cute and touching. It was opened in November 17, 1989 on the same day as the Mermaid Produced By Walt Disney Feature Animation. <br /> <br /> The part where Charlie Got Killed Carface was so unforgivable. Mean Carface so because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame on him! Love Survive song performed by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All dogs go to heaven Best animated film ever.
