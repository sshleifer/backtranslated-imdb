I did not expect that a powerful filmmaking experience «Girlfight». This Indie; a low-budget, no famous actors, director of freshman. I have heard that it was good, but not as good. <br /> <br /> Located in a modern, ethnic, working class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama made an unusual job capturing the day to do a one-day struggle of urban Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, is seething with anger and snaps at his high school peers, getting into trouble with school and her friends. She raised her single father, who seems to love her and her brother, but applies a strict, sex-based double standard for their children. Double standard parents illustrated by the fact that Little Brother, it takes boxing lessons at a local gym, but Diane refuses such classes. Running errands in the gym to meet Little Diana captivated the boxing. The kid does not like boxing, so he and Deanna trade seats; He gets money from her father, then gives it to Diana to take lessons in its place. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's a good feeling film, like Diana grows and learns about himself through boxing, meets a guy, and looks at some very serious problems in the forehead. There's no risible, "everything that can go wrong will go right" permit a la «Bend It Like Beckham». Reality and related personal problems too big for pet permits, but in my opinion, «Girlfight» is the best and more satisfying film for him.
