It's good the film's director, John Cromwell, who was not a great director, but who did some excellent films, including a version of Â«The Prsoner Zend" 1937. Located in London that only Hollywood can manage, atmospheric, but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see it on DVD, I've never seen him before, and being a big fan of Bette Davis wanted to see her in the role is considered one of his early big. So I bought it. Well, it looked fine, but I'm sorry to her London Cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, not to be mistaken, but then it makes one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It was not as disgusting as Dick Van Dyke "Mary Poppins" cockney accent, but close. <br /> <br /> The other was starring Leslie Howard, and he did it perfectly. He was subtle and clever actor Supporting actors acquit themselves well. Worth seeing, despite the vocal gymnastics Mrs. Davis.
