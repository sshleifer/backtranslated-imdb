There is something about the Pet Sematary, I have never felt anywhere else. Maybe the fact that I was a child, when I first saw that made this experience so memorable. But as I continue to watch it over and over again, it never gets old, and I never get bored. With the opening credits of this terrible opening song to the end of a very chaotic, there is something with intelligence, boring and scary at the same time, and it keeps ringing in my head: sometimes dead is better! <br /> <br /> I do not think that it would be useful to link the whole story again. All you need to know, it starts with the point A (the most ideal situation for a happy American family) and step sinks to point B (which, believe me, is the end of all joy). Music is perfect, the story makes sense, cool special effects, and Pet Sematary is the last place on earth I would. As I said, sometimes dead is better!
