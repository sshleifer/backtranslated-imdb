is not a "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Thelma and Louise," but it's a great road movie. it sets its two protagonists gently and easily. Viewers will learn the underlying tensions quickly that it is a tribute to the director. there is a young French (English) speaking son who wants to do well in France, has a French girlfriend, and who drink alcohol, parties, as do young men. And there's his Moroccan Arabic (and French) speaking father, who stands in awe of his Muslim faith, with generosity and wisdom of older and who deny the new culture around it (eg, mobile phones). the film could explore very powerful politician - the odd couple drive through the former Yugoslavia, through Turkey, and then through the Middle East to get to Mecca. these are areas where the Muslim population were involved in the war, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators pursued torture and execution in order to retain power, and where religious communities are in constant mortal combat with each other. while the film moves through the space and possibilities with only hints of such programs. relationship between these two key to this film, and faith, politics are the backdrop. it seems to be saying that we are all human, and need to understand and care for each other, to have a good control in the world. This, of course, is not a "Natural Born Killers" and the better for it.
