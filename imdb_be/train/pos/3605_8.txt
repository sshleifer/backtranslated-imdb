girlfight uses the well-known formula, as someone pointed out, however, I saw a lot of films that do not make it good or not this worthy of trust. I believe that it is ultimately easier for women to empathize with the character and thus feel more moved by the film. <br /> <br /> film encouraging both mentally and physically, even if your life and surroundings were very different, and I think that the audience can still get a lot of seeing it. although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general, this is a film that gave me the spark. <br /> <br /> so familiar plot / total. the actors are good. but I thought that it might spark that makes it above average, in my opinion. it made a great impression on me, and I know I'm not the only one.
