North Africa in the 1930s. For a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for the meaning of his life and a beautiful Trappist monk escape from its crisis of faith. They will meet and passion will be mixed, but do not even sand Diviner know that if they find the happiness or misery, here in the garden of God. <br /> <br /> The plot is purely a scam, but the film is still very fun and enjoyable to watch. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer is the perfect screen couple. It is, quite simply, beautiful, and Boyer provides the most efficient, low productivity, allowing his face to make it responsive action for him. <br /> <br /> supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in the role of Count pretty, who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, talkative guide (all "Arab", he and others say the film pure nonsense); Lucile Watson as a gentle hegumeness; Alan Marshall as an honorable young French officer; Tilly Losch as dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic porter; John Carradine as a mysterious sand Diviner; . And wonderful Sir Aubrey Smith, a wise old priest <br /> <br /> The film connoisseurs recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones and Granville Bonito (nuns peering over your shoulder) as monastic girls; skinny Nigel De Bruler as the Monastery of the lecturer; . And Ferdinand Gottschalk as a porter, all uncredited <br /> <br /> The color films of the 1930s are rare and a pleasure to watch, and this film is no exception - as the colorful cinematography, as the desert itself. GARDEN Allah was the first Technicolor film that will be shot on the spot. Yuma, Arizona gave filmmakers the sand dunes, they might desire, but polluted drinking water, and 135-degree heat was soon the company in the uprising. If the daily aims to show Boyer face burned bright red tomato, producer Selznick finally gave up. The rest of the movie was filmed on a sound stage in Hollywood.
