Although critical of slander, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This is a film that should be watched carefully; some funny bits are made in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention is paid to them. For example, to monitor the use of Michael Keaton with the price gun at a pet store ... and for years a documentary style, which appear at the beginning of the scene. This is one of those rare movies where humor hits you unexpectedly, even if you know that it's a comedy. Hekerling, director, really sharp here - If you have enjoyed her best-known films (.. Fast Times, at Ridgemont High, Clueless, European vacation, etc,) you need to give this kind of <br /> <br /. > Michael Keaton extremely likeable in the lead role and a supporting cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) fine. Highly recommended.
