What are the chances of "Mermaid" helium balloon travels with Yuba, California (November 8, 1993) and landing in 4 days (Nov. 12) at MERMAID, Prince Edward Island (Canada. Approx. 4000 miles). This is a great movie. It is based on a true story. This film not only helps children cope with loss, but older people as well. I hope that everyone will enjoy !!! roundel
