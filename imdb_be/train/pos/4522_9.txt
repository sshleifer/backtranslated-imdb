This one took me by surprise because I was often disappointed Pasdar in the past, but he caught the perfect balance in this work, avoiding farce and pathos, while providing a sense of humor and real emotions. Always-lovely Julie Waters is stunning here, and those who are not her scene in 1983 Educating Rita, remove it immediately (great movie). The rest of the secondary characters are well played, as well as many amazing eccentric, not to exceed the top. This is one fun.
