it was really good for the film's budget. I put it far above your average B-movie action. Sean and Karin comes in this film, and they did not seem shy of cameras. Watch for cameos Joan and Jared. I do not think the producers even believe that, but the prize-winners deserve this much. <br /> <br /> I'll be looking forward to greater involvement of Shawn and Corin in the movie entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed real, and the nature of sexual Corina was quite stubborn and points. It is also linked with the action sequences and performed with confidence. It was a great idea to throw Billy Zane as clever and witty villain. His charisma on the screen is always a pleasure to watch. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good. Action sequences were not cheese and seemed to connect throughout the film. Of course, there were some shortcomings, but that comes with the territory. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a good movie, given the budget and the fact that it was made for television. Sean and Karin did a good job considering that they are new to the game. I hope that Joan, Jared and the rest of the next action Star cast get their chance to join them and co-stars in the entertainment success <br /> <br /> Judgment :. *** / ****
