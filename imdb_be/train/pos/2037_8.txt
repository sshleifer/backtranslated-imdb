Christopher Smith is an obvious fan of horror and it became clear in his debut horror film «Creep». «Creep», although a little loose information, prove that they are worthy of this bloody classics. Slightly less glossy than the last US horror (The Amityville Horror remake House of Wax remake), this dark and spooky story worth Kate (Franka Potente) through a maze of underground tunnels and abandoned railways as she and several others along the way, try to run a killer striker . Although some of the bad reviews are planned this film, I really believe that on a tight budget, and for the production in the UK with the first director of Smith's time that «Creep» really lives up to its name. It provides a fast paced bloody action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too quickly, as the history of spotty in some areas, but with a great location and the best character of the reaction-na-na-late I've seen in a while «Creep» delivers some of the scenes, which, of course, nightmares.
