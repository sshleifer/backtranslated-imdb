I suffered through "Lure" on the cable one night just as it started, and I thought, "Oh, why not?" I'm glad I gave it a chance?. <br /> <br /> "Bait" is not perfect. It suffers from too much shouting directions and sometimes stupidity. But in general, this film worked. All the elements are aligned just right, and they are pulled from what otherwise might be pretty ugly film. <br /> <br /> Most of it, I think it is related to Jamie Foxx. I do not know who Fox is seen at the lead, but whoever it was made this film great benefit. Plausible and surprisingly likeable, Foxx glides through the movie, smooth as butter, and funnier than hell. You can say that it works on instinct, and instinct does not fail him. <br /> <br /> The story, while still actually ties together very well, and there is even a character arc through which Foxx character grows as a person, again, they could have slipped through without kakoy- any of this, but it only makes things a lot better. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the low rating for this. Maybe I just caught this move on the right night, or vice versa, but I would give it a 7/10. Bravo, the MSSR. Foxx.
