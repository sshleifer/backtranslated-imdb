This colorful slasher film. That's about it. <br /> <br /> It is a mysterious element that scream made so popular in the slasher movies, but I never care about such things. Find out who the bad guy is not interesting, given that all the keys are misleading in any way. <br /> <br /> The scene of death was inventive and Gorey, returning memories of the 80's horror movies like Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about this film, it is difficult to accurately determine the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS, where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> People who do not like slasher movies are not like this film. How simple. I really enjoyed it, and I plan to watch it again, waiting for more of the same. <br /> <br /> --MB
