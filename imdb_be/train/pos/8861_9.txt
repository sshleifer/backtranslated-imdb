Andy says: "No one was hurt, everybody wins." Before he says it, we know that the opposite is true: It's not hurt, no one wins. This is a new strand in American films, or perhaps an old strand brought in the end. Think "Eastern Promises," "There Will Be Blood," "not old."

Kelly Masterson's debut script as close as Hollywood movie will ever get in a Greek tragedy. Paying tribute to fellow veteran director Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet efficiently and soberly turns grim history in a beautiful, old school character drama. Opening shots, although obesity accountant dog-styling his trophy wife, have the form and paintings by the Dutch master. On the contrary, condo drug dealer looks more Mondrians line. Great performances all around. Only Albert Finney's character Charles feels a little more acting, wide-eyed and mouth agape almost constantly. But then he is in trouble deep, deeper than any of the problems that most of us will never know. To compensate, Marisa Tomei super hot. But, of course, you do not need me to tell you that. Why her character Jean would like to be with a guy like Andy, we never said, but that's okay. The action of the character in the end. Unique and Magic Touch music Carter Burwell making this wonderful movie masterpiece. Do not miss it.
