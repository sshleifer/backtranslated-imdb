I enjoyed the film and effective Confucian criminal drama, the old order to survive the threats posed by daring young hungry man is without a doubt, represents a modern society. I thought that the final scene was amazing and could not figure out if we were sure that the big D was punished for being greedy or was it part of a long plan. I loved the scene, and this time in the Chinese film, the violence was not choreographed martial arts festival. On thing that always amuses me about HK films is that the main influence on the British seem to have had this type "yes, sir" and "sorry" to the local language and its funny that long after we're gone , they are still there.
