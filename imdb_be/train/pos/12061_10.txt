Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror, processed diamonds, and one becomes completely fascinated by its sheer brilliance. This is nothing less than a diamond !! This is a film April, eeriness, cooling expectations and gloomy atmosphere, and I think I can say with certainty, one of my favorite horror movies of all time! And, of course, it contains perhaps the single most flat-out scary sequence in the history of horror! Every time I see a movie, and it gets to the point where you know it is bound to happen, I'm trying to remember exactly when I'll be scared out of my mind, but it can never happen; I never get it right, and I consider myself to be terrorized like the first time I saw it !! Now, I must say, to scare jaded horror fan like the ones that are not nothing but a pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the Brits know their details, they are proud of the art of action, they do not need any special effects to capture the atmosphere, they rely on the power of the potent stories and horror (in this case) suggestion and expectation. Each element is impeccable from a plurality of parts, which act stories threatening to atmosphere. Pauline Moran, of course, could make the devil a whimper, that's for sure !! As a final note, if you, for some insane reason, do not like this piece of insanity, then you truly do not know what horror is all about, and, frankly, do not deserve to know this too. Thank you!
