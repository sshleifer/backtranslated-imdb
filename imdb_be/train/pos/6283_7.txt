As much as I love the big epic pictures - I'll spare you name-dropping - it's wonderful to kick back with a few beers and a simple wave of action time. Movies where the plot takes over a predetermined threshold units. Movies, where dialogue is not so cleverly written that it binds itself in endless knots of purple prose. There are hundreds of films that meet all the requirements ... but in my opinion one of the best Gone in sixty seconds. <br /> <br /> This update is a film that shares its name. He also shares the ethos of this, but not quite this performance. Whatever was great about the original has been simplified. Whatever it is ordered also amping up due to the large budget. Often these kinds of efforts recipes for a complete disaster - see pug-ugly Italian remake of the one that blew it - but here, thanks to the warehouse primarily great actors, Sixty succeeds <br /> <br />. plot and most of the dialogue is not so much to write about IMDb. Often you'll have a scene where the same line of dialogue going back and forth between actors, each of which will articulate it with different inflections. Many people find it annoying; I think it raises a smile. Each actor gets a chance to show his definition of style here, with Cage, Angelina Jolie and Duvall Leading the pack, of course (and it should be noted that it is also fun to see Mrs. Pitt did not give first billing here). The chemistry between the good ol Â»Saint Nick tall (see inspection date) and Angelina leads to a couple of good moments <br /> <br /> villain is not even a little scared. - I saw Chris Eccleston play the role of tough guy before so I know that it can deal with them, but I think he was deliberately sent to its role is insignificant, so as not to detract from the action. We know that the characters are going to be successful, one way or another; we just sat in the car with them, enjoying the ride. I think that many of these scenes have been played with the language before that time in cheek, that he went over the heads of many people, giving it a bad rating. In fact, I would not mind some of the fourth wall breaking winks at the camera: it's just that kind of movie <br /> <br /> All this style and not much substance - that often depletes my patience when. not satisfied * only * way - would be unnecessary, and the action was not. And for the most part, it is. Perfectly true. I noticed that it seems to be a general tendency to use a fast cut extreme close-up of arrows guide the actions of these days. I personally believe that this kind of exhaustion of things. I prefer movies like this, where the tricks is large enough to not need artificial tension increases raping Tight shots all the time. I was told that Cage in fact, many of the car stunts as he could go without losing its security (in real life, I mean - his character clearly does not care), and it shows. A person can actually move the car, and it is put to good use in a slow-burning climatic finale, where he manages the Mustang to the ground in the country - and FUN. - possible way <br /> <br /> So, yes, this movie is not "an epic, life-affirming post-9/11 photos with mandatory social commentary" effort. Walk unevenly, some scenes were cut and not all actors to tow the line. But the car films rarely come better than this. So if you hate cars ... why did you even read these comments? <br /> <br /> I would have taken him for the many iterations of "sluggish and tiring" (guess franchise) on any given day. 7/10
