Going into this movie, I've heard good things about it. Based on this, I was not really surprised and not disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies. I was laughing couples here and there-- nothing too ridiculous. Perhaps my favorite part of the movie, when he's dancing in clubs. I totally have to try that next time I'm in the club. A pair of stars here and there including Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, the chick with the X-Files, and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance Thandie Newton in the frame. She, of course, be in the previous film with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a throw, you'll either enjoy it to the extent, or find it a bit boring. I might add, Kirsten Dunst magic in this film. : 3
