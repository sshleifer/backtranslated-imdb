It looks like "On the town" is a musical about sailors on shore rest falls short of recent classic with a view of stimulation and quality of the songs, but it does have its charms. Kelly has three magnificent dance: one with a cartoon mouse Jerry fame "Tom and Jerry", one with the little girl, and the sequence of fantasy where he is a Spanish lover decided to reach his lady on a high balcony. Sinatra playing the shy, inexperienced friend Kelly, and Grayson, a woman who serves as a love interest for men who do most of the singing. Iturbi provides some fine piano playing. For nearly two and a half hours, it's a bit too long to light music, but it does not pull.
