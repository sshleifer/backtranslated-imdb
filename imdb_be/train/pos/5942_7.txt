I liked Batman: DEAD END, I thought it was a theatrical feel to it, and that gave Collora chance could make a thin film. This trailer is not quite give me the same impression. The storyline, or potential storyline was pretty good, but due to the current and special effects left me feeling like it would make a good television film or television show. <br /> <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not that a good Superman. I actually thought he was, in his brief appearance, made a decent Clark Kent. Unfortunately, I do not think Superman is that a positive effect. The lawsuit Kent wore disguises its size. Batman may have a body builder, but not Superman. Supes sun toned, no doubt, but not in bulk. Anyway, I did not care about all its posing and its transformation from Kent in Superman seemed cheezy. Now this may not only be O'Hearn wine, Collora, may have to take some of the credit for the poor script and direction. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the special effects for the flight were cheezy. Superman flies through the sky. When it was obvious that this Superman was flying close to the ground, with telephone cables and structures that are visible above it. I do not think there is any full body shot of Superman flying. It is obvious that the harness and rigging support O'Hearn should be located on the lower part of the body. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a good trailer. I would probably have to pay to see a movie ever made, and would be sure to catch it on television. The storyline, the alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman jealous attract Lois Wayne, Lex and Superman beat TwoFace united and join forces between Batman and Superman, a good one. I am sure that with a big budget and approval of a full film Collora and the company even O'Hearn can deliver a decent film. Of course, one is better than most comic book based on the shit comes out of Hollywood lately.
