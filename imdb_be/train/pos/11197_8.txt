Another silent love triangle film by Hitchcock, but is not a mystery, but it is very in English, is very well developed and photographed. Sleek fighter Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) enlists circus boxer "One round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson), to be his sparring partner, in part to save the beautiful but fickle Mabel (Lillian Hall-Davis) nearby. There are many character actors and grotesques ?? at the wedding of Jack and Mabel minister, standing in the aisle of the church registers shock at the sight of a very high and very short men, fat lady, like Siamese twins, who, of course, argue about which side of the aisle to sit, and the wedding feast of fun. The rest of the film is Jack loses Mabel and boxing his way back to the heart, or something like that. It was a different era as a whole, with the audience in an evening dress and boxers dressing up, too, when out of the ring. Camera angles, the pace, the use of signs, cutting ?? all very stylish and powerful. The camera-work and editing the last boxing match is very exciting. good appearance Brisson to good use in this one; his smile is not forgetting about what is happening around him, he is in Hitchcock's Man with the Isle of Man, and therefore is not annoying. But can such boxers dimples?
