I swear that I could watch this movie every weekend in my life and never tired! Every aspect of human emotions captured so magical effect, the script, the direction, and the overall feeling of the film. It's been a long time since I saw a movie that really made me choke with laughter, reflected sorrow and feel each addressing a feeling that comes through in this very fine work! We need more movies like this !!! Mike Binder: you are listening to ???
