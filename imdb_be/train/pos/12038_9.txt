Yes, a real classic! This is what the British are all about drama, realism and minimal use of special effects (and more bloated budgets). The last time I saw this drama, when it was last screened on British television in the Earth 1994 really should consider all love scary story, there are no big names, but at least the big acting.Sadly copyright now belong to someone unknown and how so this great drama, is unlikely to be on the air at any time soon.I itself recently acquired Woman in black on VHS, so now I'll be able to enjoy this truly great British drama. You have to try and enjoy it too! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
