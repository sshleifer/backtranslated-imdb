Okay, I admit it - I'm a goof-ball, and sometimes I really like the silly comedy. While I have seen more movies by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than almost anyone on the planet, I still have a soft spot for lingering comedies that is not trying to be difficult, but this is ridiculous. Several of these films that come to mind Monty Python and the Holy Grail, UHF, started the Revolution Without Me, Strange Brew and movie Bill and Ted. All of them do not have snob appeal, but only zombies or professional critic can not love them. <br /> <br /> While Bill and Ted BOGUS JOURNEY is not as good as the original film Bill & Ted, it's still a lot of fun. In addition, unlike the original, in fact, it seems to improve with repeated viewing. I remember when I did not like the movie the first time I saw it - perhaps because another film set a high standard for a laugh. But, every time I see it again I am amazed at all the great moments - especially those involving the Grim Reaper. And by the way, this header is about as different from Bergman in the seventh seal, as you can get !! Attached to a lot of laughter, this film features some great music - one of the ways that this is actually better than the first film. Kiss anthem in the end, that's fine, but as the rest of the hard rock tunes - if you are not an old curmudgeon like De Nomolos. Large viewing for children and adults.
