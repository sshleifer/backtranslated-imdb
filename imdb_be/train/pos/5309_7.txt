The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. He is full of comic characters and interesting situations, ranging from Blyth, innocent beak (appealingly played by Edward Furlong), who likes to take pictures of almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include one PECKER Matt ( "he is a thief, but he's a really nice guy"), a sister beak Chris (who is addicted to sugar), and Catholic grandmother's beak, which detects the life of the Virgin Mary statue in her room. <br /> <br /> film gently makes the point about how everyday life has a lot of wealth to offer, and it is possible to make the point, without being too heavy-handed about it. There is always a risk when making posts about the value and dignity of "ordinary people", sliding in a reverse "holy" - but "Pecker" avoids these pitfalls, allowing viewers to get a point, allowing enough respite for viewers to compare this message with his thoughts on this subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film mainly because it is a lot of fun.
