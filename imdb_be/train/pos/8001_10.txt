Of course, one of the best films I've seen for quite some time. Wonderful direction and flawless actions make it very interesting and often moving film. Denzel Washington plays one of the most attractive and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the actors performed beautifully. Christopher Walken, of course, a fine in the part, although not as often as I would like. The history of the ultimate greed that turns biased against childs innocence and love. It is also a film for fans of thriller, as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and retaliation. Location Mexico adds a sense of seedy and corruption, which in itself is sensational. All in all, a really exciting movie from start to finish. It is highly recommended!
