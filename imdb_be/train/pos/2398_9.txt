I really liked this movie. It took quite a dark story of a Macbeth- Shakespeare and wrapped it in a bizarre, often funny and touching contemporary yarn. <br /> <br /> The prestige before the director has brought the most different worlds of contemporary New York and Macbeth of Scotland together under one roof. Opposite worlds act <br /> <br /> really bring out the suspense and comedy to play and you have to love Harold Perrineau as a chorus, of which there is in the game, but actually helps to jazz things up. Ending stands out among the small indie I've seen in this closure and originality.
