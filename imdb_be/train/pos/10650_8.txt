I made this film last weekend, cranked surround sound system, and got some great sound special effect. This movie is a great movie rental, a special influence, which is enough to scare my fiance, but I noticed that some were looking at the computer surprise. I do not go to the cinema and see it, but scary late at night do not want to leave the cinema. I would recommend it!
