I'm glad someone made a movie about how hard the heart to risk a second time. Or the third. This film is exactly what it promises to be - beautiful, funny, and it gives you a good feeling around your heart when it ends. The site can be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell a story, and they were still used. The actor was perfectly although Scott Wolf is not like the father of eight, even when he is in a suit. Thus, the spark in all the right places, supporting plaster lovably support and, although you can probably predict the entire film, which you would not want to change the channel. It's just the right kind of entertainment for a Sunday evening.
