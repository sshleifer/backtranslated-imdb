This film is quite interesting horror anthology film (through Tales from the Crypt), written by Robert Bloch (Psycho author). This is good fun for fans of horror and has a wonderful cast. The film should also be required to show a doctor who fans as Jon Pertwee (Third Doctor) has a funny role rude and unpleasant stars horror!
