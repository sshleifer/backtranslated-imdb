Sammy, Curr metal rock god, they tried to stop him, they tried to stop him, tried to censor his music !! (Just like the real life of Dee Snider from Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) died in the fire, Seaya Cure was supposed to play on Halloween at his old high school dance .. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan, and the only one who knew how Sammy was, and what he felt (or he?) Nuke, a DJ at a local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives a single copy of the last record Saoy Eddie .. But if Eddie tries to play the recording backwards, he finds Sam to talk to him from the dead, and tell him what to do to get back on the bullies in I School who hate him and his music .. Everything works until Sammy begins to kill !! Great movie and a must see for fans of heavy metal Hairband, with great sound track for Fastway, and just in case you do not know what the songs sound like and know Fastway and do not like them, they changed it the voice of a little and there a style and it sounds like a well-known Cinderella, Ratt .. or whether a real horror movie? Well it depends on what you call a horror movie, I was a real horror movie is a slasher, with a lot of kills, or just scary .. This film is not lacking deaths, but it can not be called action, comedy, drama , suspense or thriller, so that's why I believe it should be terror .. so if you want to «« Roll, Rockin 'Rock N in the middle of the night become your soul !! "The Summit Curr and Trick or treat is for you .. I mean" what are you afraid of? It only Roll Rock "N"!?! »
