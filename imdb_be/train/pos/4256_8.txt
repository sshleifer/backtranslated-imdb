Such a great movie! Very heart warming. It is impossible not to fall in love with the character of Gigi. He is beautiful, like a child, and grows into a tangible artist. The entire film revolves around him. He lives in a wonderful world ?? live life ?? curiosity, desire and expectation. There is an older brother, who tries to steal his glory, but in fact remains in the shadow of a lifetime. My father was very stereotypically Italian and as a mother. I wanted my father to come and be reunited with his mother in the last scene ?? and they cry and laugh. I would also like that, at least something redeeming about the elder brother. His personality seems to have been completely defeated. Passion and fervor ?? It is the key to life. And looking through the camera ?? focusing on small details and savoring the subtle details of life.
