I love the occult horror, and the great British Hammer Studios, which was one of the greatest films from "The way the Devil" (1968), he proved to be more than capable in the field of Terror. This is the tenth episode of the occult Hammer short a running series "Hammer House of Horrors" (1980), "Guardian of the Abyss", is really a terrible record in the series. Directed by Don Sharp, who had previously enriched creativity Hammer with "Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and «Rasputin: The Mad Monk» (1966) and, moreover, sent two 'Fu Machu "movie starring Christopher Lee, it is undoubtedly one of the better known names among HhH Directors, and it also provides here. Antiques dealer Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles upon a mysterious old Scrying Glass. Scrying glass happens to an object of desire devil worshiping cult who want to use it for their satanic rituals. If he hides a beautiful young girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), which should be brought into the cult of the victim, Michael get into deeper problems with the cult and their sinister leader (John Carson) ... Although it's not one of my absolute favorite episodes "Hammer House of horrors" (the best is obviously a brilliant seventh episode, "The Silent scream"), this is a very horrible and atmospheric one. The plot has a few interesting twists, and remains in suspense and paranormal throughout the film. Ray Lonnen makes a good presenter, young Rosalyin Landor convincing as an innocent beauty, and John Carson truly awful as the leader of Satanists. In general, the "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and terrible tale HHH, and my fellow fans Hammer should not release it.
