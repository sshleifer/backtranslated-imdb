This is ridiculous. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but man, it's ridiculous. Kline and field great. (Her toss-off line, "God, you're so disgusting," as she climbs into his window - a large Kline ran out the door after the review of Teri Hatcher - too big), Robert Downey Jr. and Cathy Moriarty are not working together flawlessly - until he learns who she really is ... a soap opera of all, when one was one <br /> <br /> scene near the end of the Chinese in the dining room were my children, and I was rolling on the floor - this scene alone is worth the price of rent. <br /> <br /> does not solve all the world's problems or show seemy underbelly of daytime TV (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
