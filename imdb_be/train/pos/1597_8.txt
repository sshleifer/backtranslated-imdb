This kind of film for snow Sunday afternoon, when the rest of the world can go ahead with their own business, as you go down in a big chair and soft for hours. Excellent performance from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently paddling along the section. There's no threshold to cross, sun hazardous water, just warm and witty paddle through New York life at its best. Family film in every sense, and one that deserves the praise it has received.
