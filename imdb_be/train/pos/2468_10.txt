I went to see Hamlet, because I was between jobs. I thought that 4:00 would be great, I was a supporter of Bran; Dead Again, Henry V. I was completely absorbed in the direction, acting, cinematography, this film seized. Like other reviews 4 hours pass quickly. Branagh plays Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. When I watch this movie, I was always trying to find flaws, I looked at the inconsistencies and did not notice them. How he was able to move into and out of the room with all the mirrors a mystery to me. This film was shot in 70 mil. It's a shame that Colombia Sun released a version of this on widescreen VHS. I have a DVD-player, and I would do it through any day of the Titanic. So Colombia, when you listen to put the movie the way it should be observed! And I do not know what happened at the Oscars. This should have swept the Best Film, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Cinematography. What movies they see? I was sorry Branagh at the Oscars, when he made a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They were supposed to give a tribute to what we Branagh is one of the greatest films of all time.
