It was a true classic, if they chose ALMOST NO ONE ELSE to John Abraham. This guy is a terrible actor. Whether it's comedy, drama, tears-jerkers etc. He stinks. It seems that at some point, Priyadarshan is understood too, and pretty much he was jumping like a monkey, in order to make his solo scene a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> He is the only noticeable drawback (there are a couple more annoying TID-bit) is absolutely hilarious film otherwise. Best comedy to come to Bollywood Hungama so, IMO. As Hungama, this sitcom was carried on the shoulders of a brilliant script and, of course, Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best result to date. He is better to be the shoe for the best comedian in every award function. AK has always been good at comedy, but he takes it to another level here. body language, facial expression, and just the way he delivers every line. This performance genius. Packed theater going nuts for almost the entire length of the film, and I do not think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood film here in the US. <br /> <br /> garam masala entirely one "lead" character. It is incredibly favorite stars 3 + Beautiful girls, I thought I did a pretty good job. Rather, they all make their debuts. Paresh Rawa hard as usually, although its procedure is itself after some time. Razhpal Yadav his typical very annoying (it more patient-top act in each film). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> as a whole is definitely worth Dekho. I would say that it is ridiculous No Entry, and that says a lot. Maybe there was even better, if they choose someone a little more qualified s than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
