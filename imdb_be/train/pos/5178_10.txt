By the Tuscan sky, I saw the work of the tender Diane Lane in the film otherwise lark. Campers invited to the camp of their youth and experience as adults. Each of those who return, it seems, is looking for what they have lost, which makes it so realistic. Maybe you had to be a tourist to get it, but in the words of one character who notice all of her clothes were wet, "so camp!" In order to win and fight on your friends with a terrible dinner lady and the early morning bell ... it amplifier. After the exciting activities at the moment, it seems trivial. Extraordinary ensemble cast makes the best one-two-dimensional roles and make them true. Bill Paxton, Diana, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when he first fell on it !!) beautiful scenery, bright colors, comic music (including variation Hello Muddah) and the comic actor's turn marked director Sam Raimi makes this movie you you can pull out again and again, like looking up an old friend.
