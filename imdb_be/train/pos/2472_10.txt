Kenneth Branagh shows his excellent skills in both acting and writing in this insightful and thought-provoking interpretation of Shakespeare's most classic and well-written tragedy. Kenneth plays the role of Hamlet with the expressive emotion that causes tears. Kate Winslet performance and high notes.
