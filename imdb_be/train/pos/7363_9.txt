This is not a love song. <br /> <br /> My one word summary of the film will be 'perfect.' <br /> <br /> it probably will not apply to the public to watch the massive movie ?? it <br /> <br /> a film that makes you participate. You observe, think and question. <br /> <br /> The comparisons can be made with the Deliverance (Subject / Subject) and <br /> <br /> possible with Blair Witch Project for general shooting style. <, Br /> <br /> However, this film stands unique against both. <br /> <br /> cinematic effects (solarization, freeze-frame, blur, etc.) <br /> <br /> have seen before, but they are most often used effectively in this <br /> <br /> the film to support the natural tension of the plot. <br /> <br /> duties raw, menacing and plausible. <br /> <br /> The real theme of the film about friendship; name really gives <br /> <br /> the game away. It's probably not the kind of friendship that most <br /> <br /> we experienced really want to. <br /> <br /> This is a love song.
