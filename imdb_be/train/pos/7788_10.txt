I love Ashley Judd and I think that all of her great movies. Ruby <br /> <br /> Paradise is one of her best. This is a very understated film that you really have to look closely to appreciate it. Story about a woman trying to make it on their own, refusing to succumb to the temptations that make her life easier. Some of her films such as Kiss The Girls and a time to kill, probably did better at the box office and video rental. They were very good movies <br /> <br /> In addition, but do not take the time to really look in Ruby, and I think you will agree that this is one of Ashley Best. <br /> <br />
