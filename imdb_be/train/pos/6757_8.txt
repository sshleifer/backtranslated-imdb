Dana Andrews is "Where Sidewalk Ends» in this film in 1950, which also stars Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays a New York detective Sgt. Mark Dixon, a policeman with a bad character, who got into trouble in the past, for beating suspects. If a person is killed in a gambling club, owned by the bandit, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner to go investigate. Scalise is accused of killing Ken Paine (Stevens), who now left the club after a struggle not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but the victim. Dixon believes that the victim has won a lot of money, and was killed by a gang of men. He goes to the Paine and, not realizing that it has a plate in his head from the war, knocks him to the floor and accidentally kills him. Now he has to cover up the murder. As a further complication, it falls to Morgan; her father (Ken Talley), who went to Payne's apartment after he saw Payne hit his daughter, was arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> It's really stunning, gritty noir with some good performances. Uneven weathering Andrews beautiful and convincing as a tough yet nervous detective who must stay one step ahead of their colleagues. The film reunited him with incredible Costar «Laura", Gene Tierney, and it looks great, as a model with a bad taste in men, who apparently used to having dispersed. Little does she know that she got another on their hands. Ken Talley does a terrific job, as her father, who protests his innocence, despite some evidence reveals. Karl Malden very tough boss Dixon. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well-directed, which is developing rapidly and absorbing film is ending. Net Hollywood and putting yourself in the place Tierney, I doubt that will react in the same way. Minor criticism for the film, written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I did not find it as impressive as "Laura," but something in this world. If you like film noir, is a must-see.
