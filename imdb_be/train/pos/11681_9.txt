Many of the reviews and comments that I've read about this film say that it's pretty hard film and the performance of Clara Bow. Though the storyline was pretty typical for later Silents Clara, I still find a few stirring the heart and incredibly fun. Clara played carefree Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves ... not to mention the fact that this man was married! Clara lack of modesty was a shocking day, but I think that it gives sweetness and overall fun of the film. Although not exactly a brilliant storyline (all typical, actually), this film is a good showcase of Clara ability to make the audience laugh.
