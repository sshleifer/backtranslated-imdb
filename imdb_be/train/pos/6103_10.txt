I saw the movie recently at the Boston Film Festival. The film was very interesting and it's something that I believe that the world, and America is ready to see black. It has comedy, drama, great soundtrack. It's all around a good movie. These characters were well developed, and the film was a wide range of well-known actors such as Wood Harris (Remember Titains, paid in full), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000), and excellent Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean sea). The film addresses many topical issues in today's society in a short period of time, and does it with class and kindness. This is not just a story about life in the hospital, but this is a story about people and their personal journey to the discovery of who they are or who they are going to be.
