"Slaughterhouse Five" was the best before this imperfect. But the screen adaptation of the «Mother Night» is very faithful to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intention. Fortunately, this is not Hollywood or ROSCOP idiotized a la the movie "Breakfast of Champions." Another good thing about this film is that you do not have to be familiar with the book to follow him (as I think you are doing for Slaughterhouse Five). This is probably true breakfast of champions, too, but they did such a poor job that you are better off just reading the book and seeing the film! Nick Nolte has done an excellent job in this film.
