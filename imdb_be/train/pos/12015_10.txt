I thought at first that the film will be your typical western film, however, it was very interesting and kept me fascinated right up to the very end, which was very unusual. Charlton Heston (Sam Burgade), Â«Midway," "76, had past experience with Coburn, (Zach wire)," Deadfall "," 93, and Zach never forgave Sam and stop at nothing to make sure that he caught with him and paid him back. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), "portrait of a Woman," "96, managed to get into this situation, and was among the sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone. Sam Burgade had to make some very difficult decisions and I was very surprised at the conclusion. This is a very interesting film and the acting was excellent.
