Downey another must see! If you are obsessed fan like me, you've got to see this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into this life, which he left 26 years ago. Alex is re-incarnation of Louis Jeffries, especially business lawyer happily married to Corrine (Cybil Shepherd). Louie kill their one-year anniversary of when he was hit by a car. He demands to return, only this time in the body of Alex Finch. Enter Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion and a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film 15 years ago, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as reincarnation, and if so, how often do you meet the same life soul after life. I do not know the answer. But I know what you need to see this film. It's a riot, and Downey looks so good in a tuxedo. This film makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. He just gets recycled.
