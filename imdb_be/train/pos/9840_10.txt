Limerick born again: <br /> <br /> If a person can come back from the dead <br /> <br /> And live in my head <br /> <br /> Revenge of the little girl, he would have received <br /> < br /> for a murder he met <br /> <br /> for the guy who is now in the bed of his wife. <br /> <br /> For me, Born Again is a very undervalued classic episode that is part of what is defined by The X-Files to me before I started watching it. I have seen several segments before, when the show first came, and I was too young to look like part of the Jersey Devil, but I specifically remember watching this episode as a 11-year-old and the future is absolutely crawled by the scene where the guy gets He suffocated on the bus, and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you that I could not sleep for a few weeks! For this reason, this episode has a special aura about him now factor horror that I've since grown to enjoy. It is enough to allow me to look through some of the obvious flaws in the plot, such as why she had to wait until she was 9, before her early life spirit really began to collect his revenge. Or what she was doing just casually sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You might think that her parents were worried. And perhaps they were just, we really did not see that part of the story. And there was with Telekinesis? In addition to adding a really cool factor Carrie to have a terrible history, there really was not any kind of a good explanation for this. But even with its small flaws, in my opinion, this is a classic episode, and has little to no reason for me to not like it. 10 out of 10.
