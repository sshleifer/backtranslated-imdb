Dragon Hunters must be the most beautiful animated film I have ever seen. It was terrific. The film is about a couple of crooks in search of some available money, their amazing fluffy blue dog, says the fire, and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and they go on a quest to go to the ends of the earth, to kill the peace turkey, impossibly huge dragon. But, honestly, it does not even matter what the film. Because the jaw droppingly gorgeous. Heaviness in this fantasy world is different, so blocks of the architecture and the scope of the land around the float in the middle of the cathedrals and castles and villages, and there are forests with floating lily pads. The world is so creative, so uniquely beautiful, with some fabulous muted look to it. The world looks like a set of magnificent paintings. Mobs visually stunning, as well as fire dragon consists of digging evil red bats. Some of the plot is not very original, as the protagonists do not want their farm a la mice and humans, and does not seem to be able to make it in the world; but the gorgeous graphics, some seriously sinister scenes, dialogue and emotion evoking make this movie spectacular.
