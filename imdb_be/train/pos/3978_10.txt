I had the pleasure of reading a book in Martin Torgoff "I can not find my way home", which is full of information about the drug culture of America, covering the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff !! I found it to be an outstanding representative of this documentary. I especially enjoyed watching the movie clips from the hippie era, and the 70-stoner culture. The soundtrack was great. Who compiled it was certainly in contact with the melodies of each era. We hope that they will package them and sell them as a set of CD. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested, in the 1960s, experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. The only thing that lacked any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the film «Blow»), who was allegedly responsible for most of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's 80's.
