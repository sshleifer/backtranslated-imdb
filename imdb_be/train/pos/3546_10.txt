One of the best musicals ever, this is an example, where the producers and director did not hesitate to choose the actors for their talent, not for what people might expect. Lighting and set are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (it has a special name that I can not think). Dialogue is also unique in that it does not use contractions. The film is well paced, well-acted and interesting from beginning to end. The real joy of music. Such an array of songs of the first course, from beginning to end, which is well organized and executed. In addition, the music is very original and very catchy, and I think that is superior to many musicals thirties through the sixties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals that may have only two or three. Not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie. Another quality that every time she sees a fresh one.
