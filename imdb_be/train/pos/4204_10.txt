and those who are watching this film will agree. This film was directed by in those days, when the plot, character and theme credibility really matters. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is in great shape, as the scammer «Moe» she survives under Farm in New York, acting as an informer for the police in New York. <br /> <br /> The only movie in which I saw Peters "Niagara", and it certainly proved her acting ability here, complete with a Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately menacing as the anti-hero who must discern what the right thing is, despite its need for cash. <br /> <br /> Taking pictures is brilliant. Neon, metro station (although it looks cleaner than the real thing!) In the harbor hut, where Widmark lives as a transition. Excellent use is made of the city, with "Lightning Louie» in Chinatown; many tastes and appetites of the cities considered here; the political climate of that time is intrusive background. 10/10.
