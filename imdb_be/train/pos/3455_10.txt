Steven Spielberg (24) has two wonderful episodes of the series 1971 under the name directed "psychiatrist", starring Roy Tinnesa. One episode was about the unbalanced 12-year-old boy and the other a young man living (K Gallager in his best performance), who is dying of cancer. Both episodes were stunning, visually unlike anything else on television, and emotionally complex and adults. "Psychiatrist" The creators were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created «Columbo", and released his first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted on the first rank, experienced television director for the first season of "Columbo", as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smythe. But Falk agreed after watching the Spielberg of the Kla Gulagher episode < "Psychiatry». br / > <br /> Spielberg says on the DVD with the "Duel" that he liked "Murder by the book" Steven Bochco in the script (based on the Levinson / Link story), and he tried to make the production look like a million dollars a feature, even thought he had a lot less money to work. <br /> <br /> This episode «Columbo» far more visually style th and makes better use of the audio track and background music than almost any other episode of «Columbo», even though the number is always top directors. Spielberg has managed to retain most of Falk and Cassidy from hamming it up too much, but both actors still a lot of fun . Spielberg also receives excellent support work of Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All performances are freshness and vitality about them. The only episode of "Columbo", which was very close, and it is directed "at dawn" with Makguen episode (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think that two episodes of "psychiatrist" and this episode of "Columbo" suggests, Spielberg has not developed technically all that much as a director. He was great from the beginning. In «Combat» DVD comments on the 1962 episode guest starring Albert Salmi, Robert Altman said that the episode was pretty much as good as it has ever received as a director. Perhaps the same applies to Spielberg.
