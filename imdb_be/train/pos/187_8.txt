Marion Davis star in this wonderful comedy "Show People», issued by MGM in 1928. Davis played goof with Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with his father (Dell Henderson). Clunker they arrive at this hooting - Davis defiantly south suit. Davies gets the job done in a farce, and not what it wants, but it brings her success. She meets a small slapstick star William Haines, who immediately struck with her. Well, Davis then gets a job at a prestigious studio ( «High Art Studios») and lands a job at a stuffy period pieces. Beautiful, but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her the ropes, how to be a typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davis abandons his slapstick friend and father to a good life, but, of course, know that this is not who she really is. Marion Davis is beautiful in everything, for it - provocatively - starts a gamut of emotions required of a "serious" actress. William Haines his usually excellent comedy itself, and there are cameos Charlie Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other well-known stars of the day, including film director King Vidor. This is a silent film with a few "sound effects", as sound pictures were just coming into their own. Treasure movie.
