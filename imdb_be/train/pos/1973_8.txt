I never trust the opinion of those who are on the film. This applies to the critics as well. Of course, if it receives positive feedback that everything is fine and plus, but most of the films that have received critical raves I hate. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, an entertaining movie. It takes you out of your life for a few hours, but a fictional character ... that being Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is amazing in this role, just as it was in the first. Anyone who says that she is terrible in this film must have felt the same way at first b / c it is again acting the same way as it did in Basic Instinct 1. Katherine is her, and she plays it to perfection . Its large ships, as well as in the first. Who can forget the first film, when she tells the cops, "If you're going to arrest me do it ... otherwise get the F ** K out of here!" Great scene, and believe me, she's doing it again this. I was fascinated by it. Her outfits as she smoked her cigarette, believe me, it is worth the price just to see the work of Stone. I can not wait for this movie to be released on DVD, uncut, because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And so, there are many tricks, as in the first, including the finals!
