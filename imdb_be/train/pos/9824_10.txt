This film is a sterling example of a state of erotic B-movies: bad porn movies free hardcore sex. The plot of this is not so bad as these things go; it includes a female lawyer is trying to prove to her lover guilty of murdering his wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves much to be desired. Bad action, bad direction, looks bad woman, bad sets, bad movies, bad sound and bad sex scenes. The filmmakers have to find the difference between obscene and erotic. They do not even have the common sense to have naked Gabriella Hall or a love scene. <br /> <br /> How dumb is that?
