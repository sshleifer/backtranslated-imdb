I'm really looking forward too, saw this film, as it was advertised as a must-see film for people who love nature films. The film shows the different climates and animals associated with them, starting with the North Pole and down to the south, as the film progresses. Footage from this film is often breathtakingly beautiful, and many times I wondered how on earth they could take some of the shots under water or in the sky. Still beautiful, most of the shot I've seen in the TV series "Planet Earth", narrated by David Attenborough. I found the story Attenborough Planet Earth to be much better than the story of the Earth. "Earth" is a simple film. He misses much of the scientific information covering Attenborough in his series «Planet Earth». For example, the Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is the perfect nursery for young humpback whale, because there are few predators. Earth will tell you that a good nursery of tropical sea because the water with low oxygen content and does not contain sufficient nutrients to support very large animals, such as large sharks, etc. For me this is an important distinction. This, together with a much superior voice Attanborough making planet Earth is much better documented than on Earth. Nevertheless, however, I think that the Earth is worth looking at the beautiful video, and the fact that it is easier to understand, making it interesting for children too.
