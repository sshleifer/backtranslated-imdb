It is such a shame that because of its name, this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend It Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports movie. Touching storyline and clever without being sentimental, the jokes are laugh out loud funny, and the characters are well acted. Parminder heating and Knightley brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in great performances, both on and off the field. Anupam Kher beautiful as Jess worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so strange evil in "Ride with the Devil" comes across as good as the good guy for once, make full use of your wonderful Irish accent! Even if you do not like football, go see this movie. If anything it will make you smile.
