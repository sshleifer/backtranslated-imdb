I've seen it in the movies MK2 Hautefeuille only one night after his first public projection in Paris. Very beautiful film about three teenagers 15 years, all of them are just about the same psychological stages. Many scenes allow us to return to our adolescence and our first feelings about the sexual relationship. one can imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feeling lesbian girls, but even in this case, it is not likely corrupt history. Sometimes you may find the film a little slow, but that's what creates the intimate atmosphere. I finance the young actresses of talent, a special mention with Floriane and Marie are very convincing. There are a lot of small details, but this film also allowed me to learn that synchronized swimming is: impressive!
