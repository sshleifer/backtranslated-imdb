Having lived in Ontario all my life, in the same city that Marlene Moore grew up, I heard stories about it from their parents, grandparents and family members. So when I learned that they will make a film about it, and that will be the beginning of the shot on my street, and her house very close to mine, I was thrilled. <br /> <br /> If you've read the book nod Bye Baby, which is about Marlene Moore, you get a completely different image of her as a person, it is considered awkward beautiful people who really had the opportunity to get to know her, except her own family, are often abused her as a child, except for one of her brothers. In addition, if you live in my neighborhood, and smart enough to listen to those around you, who knew her from school, you will find that it really was wounded before she even set foot in the establishment, it has always been defensive, and that it would seem as an unwillingness to learn in the school environment was really embarrassed about the fact that she could not. <br /> <br /> Marlene did not deserve the life she has been given, with the lack of help she desperately needed to obtain. It was the government, and the people around her, which helped later in her death, without trying to understand its needs and why she did what she did. I still consider myself to be outraged that she was put in jail for self-defense from a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said, "They did not know what to do with it, so they locked her in the side, and he killed her." I believe in it with all your heart. <br /> <br /> Marlene rest in the world, you deserve it so much.
