Bromwell High nothing else, like a diamond. Pilot script and perfectly placed, this stinging parody of students and teachers in South London public schools leaves you literally rolling with laughter. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. Symbols perfectly caricatured section British Associations (or, to be more precise, any company). After antics Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "main characters" for lack of a better term, the show does not shy away from parodying all possible topics. Political correctness flies out of the window in each episode. If you like the show, who is not afraid to make fun of every taboo imaginable, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!
