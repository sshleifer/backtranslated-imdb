I do not watch soaps. My grandmother is still watch that one of the watch glass. I made fun of them when I was ten (it was so easy). <br /> <br /> But this film takes a parody and it spells a new path. I found that the story is pretty damn funny. Fashion 80 - shoulder pads, glitter and polyester - just top it off. Huge hair, high heels, and theatricality -. That combination <br /> <br /> And all the actors just go to town, chewing their parts and throwing them in a big pile of good screenplay. Salt, Kevin, Elizabeth - excellent! Whoopi - excellent! Robert Downey - nice to see him back when he was a potential to the tabloids. And Garry: why do we have to wait so long to see it in the movie? Leesa Gibbons - it was not lacking, but good idea to include it in real life entertainment reporter (and where you apply for this job, anyway?) <br /> <br /> It is true that I could have done without. Sally climbing drainage pipe. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times? Since everyone has a comedienne Carol Burnett, so I do not know who and I do with him now, I could spit nuts if I had them. Apparently, this is what you do when you have fun in a high-rise building in New York. I'm just grateful that they do not pull a few of the flagpole. <br /> <br /> But it was cute, it was funny, it was the plot twists and turns, after it had loans that end to what was common, it was the clothes worthy of a second glance, it was a great throw, and he has personal memories for me. Indeed, what else is needed?
