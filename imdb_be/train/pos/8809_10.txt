This document has really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the September 11 attacks. This film was skillfully combine and is this disaster as more than an attack on US soil. The consequences of this disaster preview of the different countries and perspectives. I believe this film should be more widespread at this point. It also helps in the healing process, to finally see something other than news reports about terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are actually funny, but not offensively so. This film came highly recommended to me, and I turn on the same feeling.
