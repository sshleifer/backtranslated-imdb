After seeing and liked the last film "Nodes" Greg Lombardo (he co-wrote and directed, which show how well), I decided to check my old job, and this film was well worth the effort and hire. Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue in cheek, excellent take on Shakespeare's favorite, updated and moved to New York. I was struck by the underlying wit and intelligence scenario and marveled at how the plot in the film production line is the most recurring theme of the play - and very reasonable in this. The trials and tribulations of life in Manhattan parallel many of Shakespeare's plays, and Central Park are rarely put to better use than in the woods around the castle of Macbeth. Mr. Lombardo, obviously, has a fond place in his heart for New York and New York stories (knots funny and warm floor comedy about six thirty-something New Yorkers set out in the first place in the magical neighborhood of Brooklyn, Manhattan offices and the center of the attic thrown in for good measure), and spent a lot of time around the plays of Shakespeare. The film is good to walk and history reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama of Macbeth core. It reminded me of Al Pacino's "Looking for Richard" - another great Shakespeare. "Play the movie" I highly recommend checking Macbeth in Manhattan.
