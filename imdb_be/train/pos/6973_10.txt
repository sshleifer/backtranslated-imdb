BSG is one of my favorite series. I was lucky enough to start watching it, as the series has come to this final season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible trip it was! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed that the pilot on Hulu, I knew exactly what I was in for only by name - Caprica! Though, some things did not add up, if you compare the two series is still beautifully made. There was no mention of holobands in Battlestar Galactica, or mention of virtual worlds, but maybe I did not get far enough in the series for them to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show for anyone who loves the world, the technology and alternative imaginations of our world. This show is very exciting and will make you want to see more!
