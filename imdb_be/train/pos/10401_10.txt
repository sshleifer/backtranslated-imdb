Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. "The Thief of Bagdad" was my favorite movie as a child, and he never ceased to amaze and fascinate me. I loved this movie from the first moment I saw it when I was a boy of six who started reading the "Arabian Nights." I remember walking into the room with a TV in the middle of the battle with the giant spider Sabu and be instantly beguiled. <br /> <br /> Rarely is so much beauty, magic, wonder, and was captured on film. Sab and John Justin well as evil characters, Conrad Veidt is a thoroughly wonderful as the evil villain Jafar, and Rex Ingria joy to watch as sardonic gin. Photo Perinali is one of the best uses of Technicolor. One of the three credited directors Michael Powell, the director, who was rightfully declared the critics, but often forget their audiences great films, including "a matter of life and death" (aka "Stairway to Heaven") and "red shoes". He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles. <br /> <br /> As with all great works of art, the beauty of "The Thief of Bagdad" lies in the details. Each frame has its own magical charm. History is never late, and the characters and their actions are always involving. Here is a film that will never grow old.
