I would not say that this is a bad film; in fact it is quite typical for the type of film that "poverty row" studio produced at the time. Filmed for monograms, Bel Lugosi is very effective in its roles is somehow mad doctor-scientist masquerading as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bel and his henchmen have a nasty habit of stealing the young bride, and, after their deaths, his wife Bella injection with serum taken from their bodies, to keep her young. Lugosi's more than up to the task in making it enjoyable film, though, the film suffers from an ultra-wooden steps of Co stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Coffin (good name for a guy in a horror film) is especially bad in this case. I saw him in many movies and television shows, and it is always the same; hard, wooden and completely unconvincing. Walters Miss only a little better, but it is also not enough acting talent to make her role believable. However, the viewer can enjoy the beautiful Lugosi plays another dastardly scheme only to be thwarted in the end! Despite the bad actions by some of the "disappearance of the corpse" is an enjoyable movie for everyone.
