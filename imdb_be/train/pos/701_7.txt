I do not know what kind of an exception, so I think it was much better that it is not released much. Do not misunderstand my it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer, so I think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film. You can say that it was an act of love for her. Actions (outside Dominica) is a bit cheesy and the quality of the movie is not great either, but really low budget film it well. There was a time when the storyline gets confusing and there are parts that are tightened, although I do not feel that strongly detracts from their ability to understand the film. If you like Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I say go for it. Gag reels were gay, I will not spoil it, but there's a particular scene that makes the DVD worth buying it just so you can watch it again and again. If you like this movie, then check out The Pink Mirror, the film is also carried out by Jagged Edge. I know that the supporters of Dominique enjoy this little piece of heaven.
