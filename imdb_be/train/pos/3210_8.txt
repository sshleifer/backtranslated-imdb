Soldiers are not as bad as many of them made it out to be. I found the film to have some of sacarstic, cynical humor as that Verhoeven Starship Troopers in. Lack of dialogue and over the top action is intentional and adds to the atmosphere of the comics <br /> <br /> One of the specific details, stands out for me a bit. - Todd has the names of a few tattoos Space War Company Â»d on his chest, and one of these battles Tannhauser GATE. For those not paying attention to it, Tannhauser Gate mentioned in the last lines of elegiac Roy Batty in Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd could have fought beside the android troops Roy incredible, to say the least. Maybe writer David Peoples was nostalgia? <br /> <br /> I'll give it 3 out of 5.
