When I saw the trailer I just have to watch the movie. And when I did, I kind of had a feeling that felt unsatisfied. It was a good movie, do not get me wrong, but I think that most of that already in the trailer, if you catch my drift. It went very fast, and it rolled on, so I was never boring, and I enjoyed watching it. Humor was absolutely delicious. My first contact with laziness (..or-something like that).
