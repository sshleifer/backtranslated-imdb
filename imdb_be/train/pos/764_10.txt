Without a doubt, Beat Street the best film about Breckin scene. Everything about this spot on, clothes (PUMA), music and most importantly dance! The storyline is a basic, but hey, what is there to tell the story about? The whole point of the film, to show that children do at that time, what mattered to them. This shows that young people in general are good, all that mattered to these daily children was music, dancing and friendship. Watching DVD recently, I was plesantly surprised at how well it has stood the test of time! Clothing was not to look older (perhaps because Puma is now having a massive comeback), the music still sounds fresh, and dancing is still fun to watch. The film is all 10-25 years should see as part of their youth culture.
