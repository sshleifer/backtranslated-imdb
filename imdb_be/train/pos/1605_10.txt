«Moonstruck» is one of the best movies ever. I have this movie on DVD! The movie deals with the New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with (Danny Aiello), an angry brother of her boyfriend (Nicolas Cage), who works in a bakery. I am glad that Cher won an Oscar for this film. Nicolas Cage and Aiello great, too. Direction from Zhuison (aimed "Fiddler roof") is fantastic. «Moonstruck» is a great movie for all to see and laugh. A must see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 Stars!
