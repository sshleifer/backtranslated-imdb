Chuck Davis and attention Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago, when I was not jazz fans. There is an exhibition to go to the end of June in Paris brand new Quai Branly Museum, named LE Siecle DU JAZZ, not to be missed, as a special entertainment NINE pieces of jazz films, including the well-known sequence of drums phantom female. I saw Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr. - almost all of his film appearances, and I can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr. was dubbed in the film. It was some progress, as in most of his other appearances he was killed (mostly Howard Hawks is a big dream). 2. Krupa probably christened Cook PL. I could recognize his style, because it is already finished tomtom use (and abuse) at the beginning of his career, namely - in 1937 at the Hollywood sing, Sing, Sing sequence - and eventually got all that was possible , what we call in French "and CAISSE ClaireÂ». 3. The sequence of the PL, at least as shown in the museum, not censored.harry Carasso, Paris, France
