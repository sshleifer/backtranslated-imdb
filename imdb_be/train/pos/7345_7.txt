I picked up the film at a flea market for 4 bucks, of course, to get my money's worth!. Could care less about hot babes, but the animation just blew me away after a steady diet of The Simpsons (Unfortunately Groening). The best part, facial expressions. Recommend several views with some cool tunes, good friends and a couple of cold!
