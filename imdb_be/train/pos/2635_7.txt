My opinion: It's funny to take the LION KING, posing as a sequel. Surprisingly funny. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the Â«Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another interesting chat on video, it's worth a theatrical treatment. I do not understand why Disney released it straight to video, and produce bad films as "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland" theatrical. These films are best seen in the video store (near the "New issues"), rather than see their theater posters outside theaters. <br /> <br /> This is one just a parody of the first film (although the events in "Simba's Pride" has not happened yet), at Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa in (voiced by Ernie Sabella) point of view. We see them making fun of the events in the first film. Original voices from the first film, Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, who said to return to their roles from the first film, while Kavner and Jerry Stiller to give some hilarious comedy relief as Timon mom and grumpy guy. <, Br /> <br /> It is not that sound fun. Maybe not now, but go see it for yourself. The fact that it is not so serious her story makes it more enjoyable. It's kind of like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa <br /> <br /> Evaluation video movie :. *** 1/2 out of 5.
