Good movie. It tells the story of a boy's imagination, talking about how trapped we are in social situations and extreme measures must be taken to behave differently. Or at least feeling that you have to break all the rules, if you want to break one. If you want to express your love to someone you do not know how you would do it without creating pressure social situation? Also, we are talking about fascism solutions over other cultural life, about what kind of culture that is stuck down our throats. What makes a Disney or a fox or suicide right to decide what is our choice. There is one not allowed to drink your morning coffee on one myself. Should we listen to the cries of NRJ, see stupid tabloid headlines and outdoor commercials, before we even had our morning coffee?
