I went to the end of it, and I almost cried, "No, no, no, no! It does not end there! There are too many unanswered questions! The engagement of the dishwasher? The disappearance of Mona? Helmer rebuke? The "zombie"? There was a little brother to save his father? And what about the head ??????? Â»ARGH !! Then I read that at least two of the cast members have passed on, and I have to say that I know that this probably would not be correct to view Lars von Trier, but I'd love to look past the actors replacement only to see the end he had planned! Of course, it would be difficult to find someone to play Helmer as a character deserves. Elmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think it remains to be seen more self-absorbed, oblivious, self-righteous character on the screen! But, I could not notice the change of actors .... I just have to know how it ends!
