If you know the story of the Great Gray Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than ever in the Great Gray Owl. But in this movie, there is no real action scenes. I think this film should be nominated for an Oscar! Welll go see this movie, it's a classic!
