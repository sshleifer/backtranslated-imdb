This film is a beauty that is hard to describe. Maybe it's the lack of superfluous dialogue, or maybe it is absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just the legs Meena Mumari, but it is a joy to watch this movie over and over again. I've never seen another Indian film that comes close to it, and only a few from any country to compete perfection.
