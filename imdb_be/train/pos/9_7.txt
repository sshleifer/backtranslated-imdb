The working class is a romantic drama from director Martin Ritt how incredible as they come, but there are moments of pleasure in the main charisma stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (as an emergency). She is a widow who can not move on, he is illiterate and closet inventor - you can probably guess the rest. Adaptation of the novel by Pat Barker «Union Street» (! Best title), so laid-back it borders on bland, and editing the film a mess, but it's still nice; ruddy hue of blue-collar fantasy. There's no overture to serious problems (even illiteracy corner plot just a tool for the subsequent history of love) and no real fireworks, although the characters deliberately a bit colorless and wire softened to an interesting degree. Finals pure fluff - and cynics will be hard to swallow - although these two characters deserves a happy ending, and the picture will not really meet any other way. *** from ****
