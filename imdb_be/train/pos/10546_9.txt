I happened on this movie, because I was free, this new release from Blockbuster and you need to grab something quickly as stores close for the evening. Plain white cover and the title intrigued me. I (relatively speaking) of the "old" lady and my son, a young man 30. I love movies that are sheer entertainment, such as The Sixth Sense, Interview with the Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a graduate of the film and has a very specialized foreign films, such as film director Bergman or Duke. As a rule, we hate each other's choice of films, however, we both looked and did not like the movie NOTHING! It was unlike any film we have ever seen. We both cynical / critical type of personality, and we tend to crack on movies while we see them - but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It is our opinion that if this movie was promoted and shown in mainstream theaters in the United States it would make it very well.
