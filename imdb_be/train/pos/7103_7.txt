I was very surprised by this movement. Even if they are clearly not enough results budget still you have to be impressed that the film took 7 years to make and still turned out good. The action was pretty convincing, and the story is really captivated me. My only complaint would be that the ending was really a bit too steep for my taste. But hey, if your audience is left wanting more, then this film succeeded. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend anyone in Hollywood to see Antonella Rios, which is a great Spanish talent (something hard to find now days with all the bad Novela over current). Antonella Rios really star on the rise.
