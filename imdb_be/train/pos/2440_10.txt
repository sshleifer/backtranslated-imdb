WOW. I saw this movie at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan March 12, 2000 Both stars were present and available for questions later. WHAT FILM GORGEOUS! Although set in Ireland among the Catholic / Protestant antagonism story could happen anywhere between the two groups of people who hate each other. Horror, how quickly people can get excited when they are given a chance to express their hatred and anger was woven with beautiful moving love story drizzled with humor and fun. If one does not get picked up in the US, it would be really boring. <br /> <br /> As for the stars and supporting players ... freshman. They call Orla Brady Irish Meryl Streep, I heard. It is my opinion that it is better than Meryl Streep. They should call Meryl American Orla Brady! And Liam Cunningham sustained a simple and powerful image and a private individual involved in the political war was brilliant. <br /> <br /> see this movie.
