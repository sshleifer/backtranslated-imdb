Unlike some comments, my positive. The film wraps around the dining table with a group of friends, some you like, some do not. Some of them relate - mother, daughter, son. Their story is not a smooth, happy with everything and everybody, the type of life - just like real life. Some of the story lines do not develop, they just happen. But as real family and good friends, they stick together. Wants-to-be parents who buy the baby is a - hole! Are you happy in the final. Poor Delmar lingered between a rock and boulder, thought of himself, her mother, her son and tries to maintain a lifetime together. It does not end with a call or go home in the Â«Burbs and all live in a dream world, but it is a very real portrayal of life of people living day after day, month after month. Overall, this is a good story and a great movie !!
