Saw it as a spectator previous accident, I watched it twice already. I thoroughly enjoyed it, not stupid thought provoking posts not just good fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and just feel good film is highly recommended for those of us who just like to enjoy your movies and do not cut them great fun for the whole family here. I do not understand, Rosie Alvarez played by Vanessa Williams, she is beautiful and very stuffy. Songs like one boy and one last kiss is really nice to listen to and press the feet to Jason Alexander is the complete opposite of his character in Pretty Woman ans very well. Tyne Daly still sticks out in my mind from the Cagney and Lacey, and her voice and accent still that memory in it. In general, I just loved it and will be looking to buy it if it is available
