Good action and an interesting plot. Having seen the original, I have to say that it was interesting and showed improvement over the film. Good shot .. meaning .. though acting would be good to see some more expansion of the scenes, and not on the background of the story. Fun to watch the movie and keeps you constantly alert 7/10 of the right to vote, I think!
