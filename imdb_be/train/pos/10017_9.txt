I absolutely loved this film! I do not belong to all the other comments I've read about it. I completely captured every second! <br /> <br /> I found the story fascinating, intense acting and direction dot. I literally jump every time the phone will ring closer to the end of the film. Despite the fact that there was nothing "scary" about the story, I quietly on the edge through the entire movie - and for the rest of my evening. <br /> <br /> I found that there were so many wonderful choices made ... casting, script, little bits of humor sprinkled in it. There were so many points where the film could have gone for a cheap thrill, but it never did, and that for me to put this movie before so many mediocre thriller, released recently ... and for the last number of the year.
