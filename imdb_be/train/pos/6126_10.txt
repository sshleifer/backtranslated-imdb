I saw Jack Frost for Â£ 4: 00 at my local store, and I think it looks pretty good for a low budget movie, so I bought it and I was right, that's good. To start the movie about killer snowman, so that is something to laugh and how it looks ridiculous in comparison with Snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The action was good, and the line said Jack Frost me laugh, "I only fired for the smoke" and "World most pi ** ed by snow cone" as funny and the camp is that ? Tale in the beginning it was quite funny and ridiculous too, "Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack put out the eyes with candlesticks." If you are looking for the horror B-Movie Comedy is full of puns then check with Jack Frost. 10/10
