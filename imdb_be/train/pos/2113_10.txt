Location shop around the corner clearly stated at the beginning of the film, Balta street in Budapest, but it really can be anywhere. A small number of sets reflect the average European design, but it can be to shop around every corner. The film is not about Budapest and leather goods retail business, and the highs and lows of love, reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Clara Novak are sparring partners at work, but their anonymous letters to each other full of hopes and aspirations, and romance, and the story unwinds, to bring these two aspects together nicely. Hugo their spouses, the store owner, has problems with his wife, it is only the voice at the end of the phone. Ferenc yad vadasi has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur clothing. Mr. Pirovich life is centered around his wife and children. Pepi Katona "playing Santa Claus" with the girl for Christmas. You may even feel that the quiet Flora Katchuck, staying at home with his mother dreams about someone. <br /> <br /> The script masterpiece of comedy and drama. She moves effortlessly from scene to scene. This is one of those quiet films that repays looking again and again, simple but profound. Dialogue reflects the nature of the truth, is not common these days. <br /> <br /> All the great action. Even the minor characters, like a waiter in a cafe and the police on the street is perfect. James Stewart and Sallavan play off each other. He was really getting into his stride as an actor and then gives a sweet and sharp performance. Sallavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days. Some of her other films should catch. Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan strange. His moment of truth is very touching. Gold stars on all sides to the performers. <br /> <br /> This is a well-worn phrase, that they do not make them like they used to (not clear remake of "You've Got Mail" was terrible), but in this case it's true. Director Lubitsch is not in the mode of farce fortunately, but put the classic film of the spirit, charm and warm humanity.
