Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to oppose South Africa's white minority is regulated in much the same way as Gandhi tried to resist colonialism of the British Empire in India. Film Richard Attenborough's Cry Freedom is not about Bike or apartheid as much as it is about Donald Woods, the white liberal editor of the newspaper, who risked his life trying to tell the story of Biko. Jarring film has a point of view after the switch Biko dies in prison of tortuous conduct in the hands of South Africa's "police". Woods played by Kevin Kline, is to choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about Bike or allow his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, to make him forget about the books. In this case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a change life friendship between Biko and Woods degenerates into standard numbers to flee across the border yarn after Biko's death. Oscar-nominated Denzel Washington is good only in his fourth film as Biko, but that something is wrong in a film that tries to portray the apartheid struggle, focusing more on the white families exams for more than half of the film. Attenborough would be better served topic, focusing on Biko's rise in popularity, instead of the beginning, where Biko befriended Woods. Perhaps the black actor in a leading role in the 2 1/2 hour film is not quite favorable for a large box office, but the film was a huge box office bomb anyway. Film policy side, the film is still entertaining and sends a message or two, though, in the PG-sanitized fashion. *** 4 stars.
