Eccentric comedy about the romantic mismatch in New York. Peter Bogdanovich, obviously in love with all the women in his paintings - he honors them - even Audrey Hepburn (of course) to put a label above the other, because, after all, she is a princess Bogdanovic, probably fell in love with the movie 30 years earlier . He takes her in love close-up, gets right to the pages between her and surprisingly hard-boiled / scrambled Gazzara, and allows it room to shine in everything. Love connection, made in the course of the film fast and funny, although I get tired of TV-style klutziness John Ritter. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten, and grounded, earthy, sensual Patti Hansen all fun to watch. But this is actually Valentine Hepburn, and she was absolutely glowing. *** from ****
