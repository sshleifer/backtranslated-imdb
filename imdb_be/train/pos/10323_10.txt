This is a very interesting film. Some of the reviews I read on this forum have been written by people who seem to believe that the film was an attempt at serious drama. He was not do so .... It is a very enjoyable film, made in an ironic manner. All the actors are obviously happy to entertain us. Sequences fight live, vigorous and, above all, not gratuitous. The so-called "Green Death", is used in a few cases, not as I read in one review, "horrible." Several reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between Doc and seas near the end of the film. Hey, lighten ... Again, I would like to remind one and all that this is a funny movie. Each phase of this "struggle" was named, which added to the fun aspect. Actors did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of those martial arts films. Ron Ely looks great in the movie and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another nice touch is the only way in which the ultimate fate of the "bad guy" (Sea) is considered. I promise you that if you do not try to take this movie very seriously and just look at the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in the most pleasant way.
