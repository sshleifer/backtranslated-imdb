I am from Romania, I will try to speak English. All I want to say about this movie, it will be my number one all the time. I saw it above 30 times, at least, and will see him for years. It has all the little things I like in a movie, it's very touching makes me cry. Shows the entire mass of twisted love of things and questions about love and reality, and these things are important to different people. It so happened that for me this is important most of all, love, the human soul, it is the inner being, and that I see in this movie. Maybe for me it is much more than a movie, it's proof that, in my opinion, it could indeed exist, and that you are more likely to make the best of every moment you live with your soul mate. It's a long way from reality to fiction, but .. if. What if all the capitalism has disappeared and the economy goes down, will fall? We would all be concerned about other issues, and my thought is that on your death bed, the more you remember, not wealth, not an adventure, not a country that you have visited, and the people who remember you. Her friends and your true love and the hope that, after you die, everything will be very god damned and people would be well and to care more. Watch this movie, and probably it will guide you through your life, as it did for me :) Hale from Romania
