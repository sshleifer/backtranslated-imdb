Picking up immediately after the Moscow showdown Supreme is the greatest adventure Born and its final culmination. During the tight, 115-rpm performance film takes Born in Russia in Madrid, Paris, Morocco and finally New York. Damon trained hard every inch of the killer Ludlum imaginary, it is the most dangerous spy in a movie right now, and this is backed up by the emotion of his character that makes him so believable, and it's really a great way to Damon manages to combine these two polar opposites, themselves, that so breathtaking. In this third Bourne is on a mission to save his soul and, watching him Ultimatum delivers the high-octane performance, you'll find yourself sweating and shortness of breath on his really powerful industry ideas and pull-offs; just pay attention to two large car chases and fight scenes as realistic as Bond against the show back in '63. Director Greengrass has outdone itself with this compelling thriller, and it is probably just as exciting as the movie thrillers get; currently favors for supporters of Bourne and the new generation of the standard spy-thriller.
