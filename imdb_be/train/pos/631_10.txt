This film has all the fantasy film should have, romance, smart jokes, great acting and a fair dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and was converted to it original story (based on Neil Gaiman's novel, which I am now looking to read), and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most striking things for me was actually as a self-contained story. Unlike many science fiction fantasy movies out there right now, which leaves open the end and it was such a purely fantastic, satisfying in and of itself, without the need to continue. <br /> <br /> original. Fun. Feel OK Fantasy.
