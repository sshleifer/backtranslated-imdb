Mother is one of those movies that you know is good, maybe even great, but it's like eating vegetables or doing math homework is childhood. - too much work and a lot of pain to invest in <br /> <br /> potentially unpleasant story in many ways: the death of a character in the first half, the romance of December to May, the idea of ​​people being deceived his wife, and then changed to your favorite his mother, a collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-something characters seeming indifference of adults to children in their lives. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but the throw back to the English collection (usually due to TV) movie from the late 1980s - it has a moral weight, which never lets up, producing a pulsating enveloping melancholy. <br /> <br /> Mother flawless, but it's part of the problem; if a movie deal with so many sensitive issues, has some disadvantages - the inconsistency of the script, some of the smaller actors - it takes the edge off, but if such a film as a perfect step, the experience of watching his raw and painful. Even technical quality - lighting, editing, etc. - to make the viewer the pain; London in this film is bright and open, filled with harsh, cutting light. <br /> <br /> If you are tough as nails, or one of those super-sensitive people who enjoy torturing themselves evert sad movies or novels, you will enjoy the Mother. Anyone between them, give him a miss, or be prepared to squirm. And keep in mind: as tough as the film from beginning to near the end, the worst to come <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the mother asked the daughter what she can do to fill up. for him (for sleeping with his friend), and my daughter calmly said that she thought about it and wanted to hit her. Mother agrees with that, they both are, and - instead of well-primed slap - daughter squeezes fist and delivers a kick boxer. Argh !!!
