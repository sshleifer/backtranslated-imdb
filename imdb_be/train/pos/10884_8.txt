shredder for film, this film is actually better than many in genre.yes is predictable resident nut job goes to booze killing, people dying, chatter yada.however have some good positives in this film.first away, I like mask nut job wore.it defined horrible, to say the least, and perhaps the only (although I have not watched every slasher ever made) is also poor with the genesis of something I have not seen before, and he, he finally He meets his end is a new concept, as I also really liked know.i weapon bar used Sicko g ~ d, for most of murders.the kills himself not as clearly as the most genre, but that'a small concern.the film does not take itself seriously, something most crushing suffer enough from.oddly, while watching the movie, I thought of the beginning of the "Friday the 13th films, which really took the seriously.there few concerns about this movie.in several scenes, the killer suddenly carries Chong resemblance to one of our horror icons.by this, I have referring to his movement and his reaction after his shot, as well as the way in which he is more concerned walked.of Asti, but the scene is very close to the end, where Mr. crazy bears more than a striking similarity (actually complete rip off) another famous titan.and horror in the last scene, we have a bastard again, looking much as 1st horror icon I mentioned.in the fact that the last scene of almost total rip-off with another icon in the chopper genre. these scenes were weak and unoriginal (obviously) .by the way, the film is set in Australia, so if you have youngsters for the chicken with an Australian accent (like me), you'll be heaven.if you do not, than maybe just grate on the other you. one great thing about this film: beautiful Kylie Minogoue (just do not get too attached to it) is not one Aussie accent, kindly Molly Ringwald.overall, there are more reasons to watch than not.i liked and had some fun.so, I should give the "Cut" 8/10, that may be too high for some people.
