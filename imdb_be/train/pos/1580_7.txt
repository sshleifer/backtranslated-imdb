This is not another searing look at the Holocaust, and the intimate story of the events that took place on a small street in Berlin, and some of the people who were involved. The film begins at the moment in New York, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta lamp) is in mourning over the death of her husband and family all gathered in her direction. daughter Ruth Hanna (Maria Schrader) slowly discovers that her mother was raised Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), and so it goes to Germany and localizes the 90-year-old, who tells her about the events on Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena says about Berlin in 1943, when the Gestapo keep all Jewish husband in a building on Rosenstrasse street despite what they are supposed to be immune to married to an Aryan, and for nine days a group of women will wait outside and scream for their release. Eight years Ruth (Svea Lohde) waiting for their mother to come out and have nowhere to go, but she meets 33-year old Lena (Katja Rome), who takes it. Lena's husband Fabian (Martin Feifel) is also inside and in the end, she is trying to communicate with Nazi officers to force them to do something. <br /> <br /> This film directed by Margarethe von Trotta, who was making his first feature film, nearly 10 years after work on television and while this is clearly not one of its more provocative efforts, she remains one of the most revered directors in Europe . This is not one of those Nazi movies, where we consider the terrible acts of inhumanity to Jews, although we see some heavy treatment is granted but instead it is rather small retelling events, which means life and death of the people involved. This film does not try to shock anyone or open the door to a debate about the circumstances, but he just wants to do is just to shed light on a small, but real life event that occurred during the historical period. Part of the film strength comes from his actors, and there are some good performances that shine through Rome and especially young Lohde, and it's always nice to see Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) in a key role. This is not a great movie, or something that's going to change their views on the Second World War, but when you consider that innocent people have been killed because of the events that took place, I think that one of the reasons is important enough, to recount the real history.
