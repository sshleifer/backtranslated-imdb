As the story in my family is my father, Milton Raskin, he played piano for a group of Dorsey. After Sinatra joined the crowd, my father was with him for several hours. Then, at a certain point in time, my father said Sinatra, he was really good to be associated with such a small group (group), and that he must venture off on their own. By the time Sinatra was enough credits "under his belt" to do it! Dorsey never forgave my father and the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have a few photos and record in this regard, and as Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> I have seen almost every film Sinatra more times than I want to say, and his films never grow old. ,, Thank you Frank
