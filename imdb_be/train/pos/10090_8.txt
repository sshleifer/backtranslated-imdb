I was prepared for the arrogant Talky soap opera Diploma Travel, but was pleased to find a rapid script, which underlie the moral, excellent images of all the actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense, and beautiful cinematography - there's even a shot of majestic stone Buda recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor in her most beautiful nice and helpful, before she succumbed to hysteria gaspy that marred her later work. All supporting players around him, and I wonder who taught all these elephants. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the sequence of the Stone Buddha, you really can discern that this Vivien Leigh in long shots. Its shape and the way it moves is different from Taylor. The only spoiling this sequence are poorly made survey process, where the background is moving too fast for the horses for a walk. <br /> <br /> If you want to eat for the movie thinking that nice to look at and never sad, spend a few hours with the Elephant Walk.
