I felt obliged to follow the 1983 Timothy Dalton / ZIL Clark adaptation of "Jane Eyre", because I had just written an article on the BBC in 2006 "Jane Eyre" for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So, I went to watch it the way I would have come to do your homework. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed at first. The lighting in this version of the bad. All / all washed out in bright white light klieg, in some scenes, casts a shadow on the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> And the sound poorly written. I felt that I was listening to high school game. <br /> <br /> And the pancake makeup is too heavy. <br /> <br /> And many do not fully convey the mood of gothic novel. They are too fussy, too Martha Stewart. I just can not see Rochester Bronte He was such Martha Stewart internal mechanisms. Orson Welles Rochester lived in a cave, like darkness, very handy Gothic mood of the novel. <br /> <br /> And yet ... all these objections ... is not only the best "Jane Eyre" I "have seen, this may be the best adaptation of any novel I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This "Jane Eyre", despite its technical shortcomings, brought a sense to me read "Jane EyreÂ» for the first time. <br /> <br /> criticism of this product says it is too close to the book. who admired the book and it is not necessary for me to be any less "wordy" or any less "Christian" or any sexier up loyalty to this version of the novel Bronte actually wrote is his best asset. <, br /> <br /> Bronte wrote a hell of a good book. There's a reason it lasted 150 years plus, while the other, a raincoat, sex cial and simpler texts disappeared <br /> <br /> For a long time, "Jane Eyre" fan, I am biased against Timothy Dalton in Rochester Rochester, fun, beautiful Sun;.. Jane and Rochester's famous ugly pair of literature and. Timothy Dalton is nothing if not stunningly beautiful. <br /> <br /> But Dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as Rochester. it just blew me away. I've never seen anything like this, his utter devotion to the role text, the dialogue, and love Rochester Jane. Dalton Rochester brings the pages to life on the screen trembling. <br /> <br /> Rochester is meant to be a bit scary. Dalton scary. Wells was a terrible band down, also, for example, when he shouted: "Enough!" After Fontaine plays a short piece of piano. But Dalton scared more than once here. You really can not say when it will hurt Jane, and himself, in his desperation <br /> <br /> authoritativeness of Rochester, his humor, his anger, his vulnerability :. Dalton transmits all, sometimes seconds apart. This incredible <br /> <br /> And that's the key thing. - the actor performs Rochester to pass, that he spent more than ten years of his life in despair, lonely lives with an ugly, life, destructive secret. <br /> <br /> No other actor I've seen try this part does not pass, the black hole of despair, like Timothy Dalton makes. Current favorite of Toby Stephens is not even trying. Dalton hits it out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton performs Rochester singles bar, I would say, "This guy is trouble. And do not even look at it. "He that radioactive tamped down with agony. <br /> <br /> ZIL Clark not only in general, it is best to Jane, I saw that she was one of the few manufacturers that Jane was ready to throw the book throws Jane No, people who know "Jane Eyre" only version 2006, Bronte * nya * describe the handsome, rugged Jane with finely arched eyebrows and Pouty lips. Most likely, Jane Charlotte Bronte, indeed, the poor, the simple, obscure, and small, and not very much. <br /> <br /> ZIL has a small mouth, close-set eyes and a little nose. It is indeed "a little." She does not model. And she is the best Jane, the most faithful to the book. <br /> <br /> some disclosed its cold or boring. No, it's true to the book. Jane Bronte sun hot mom, she is protected, deprived teenager internal passions come out only at key moments, like the ZIL do here. Books Jane someone, you must look slowly, carefully, patiently, observantly, if you want to really plumb its depths. You have to watch ZIL, here to find out who she really is. <br /> <br /> I would like to have seen more fire Zela in one key scene, but this is one scene with the five hours she otherwise very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its proximity to the text, this version, as well as any other version I've seen, shys from full explication openly Christian themes in "Jane Eyre". Christianity is not accidental subtext in "Jane Eyre", it occupies a central place. <br /> <br /> Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, thus giving her a subversive, anti-cultural ways to read, and to live, it seems doomed, pinched life. It's Christianity and the Christian God, who convinces the poor, simple, inarticulate Jane its equivalent, it is necessary to live to its ideals, and its rejection of the key proposals of marriage. It is not fully clear. <br /> <br /> Either way, Charlotte Bronte wrote a great, complex, rich novel, and this adaptation of his, all those that I have seen, mines and honors affair better than any device I've seen, and it says a lot. <br /> <br /> other versions, which do not fully appreciate the book, finally sick to look in many places. If you do not care about what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse or hypocrisy culture built on appearance and money, your adaptation of most of the book is that people fast forward to get to the kissing scenes between. Jane and Rochester <br /> <br /> This version, like the Bronte novel, understand that the whole Bronte wrote - about the experience in Lowood Jane and her relationship to St. John - this is part of what makes the relationship Jane Rochester as explosive and memorable as it is.
