Excellent endearing movie with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser joining forces as a father and dad. <br /> <br /> The Pope shows one evening to say that after more than 40 years of marriage, my mother (Olympia Dukakis) left him. <, Br /> <br /> rest of the film reflects the father and son on a day trip to get the views of the pope from what happened. With them, the daughter can play detective. <br /> <br /> The history shows the adventures of a father and son in their discussion of life, that was why my mother complained to his father, as they discuss their philosophy of life. <br /> <br /> We see an unexpected fishing and play pool, leading to almost a fight. Both men seem to escape from everyday life. <br /> <br /> End depressant, how do we know why my mother suddenly gone. It becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity. It's never too late to change.
