I love Cyril Tudor and maybe that's why I enjoyed the film so much. Two days before the premiere, I went to see him live. I saw the trailer and video «Zmeu» before the film, and I thought that all this figure .. I was wrong: instead of a good film, I helped a great one! I FELT film. it was boring .. it was funny .. but most of all in the photo LOVE .. I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so I will not :) I'm not a film critic .. I can "t describe it more than words .. My kinda vague description of all because the game has left me dumb .. thank God for the keyboard :) thanks Tudor Giurgiu, thanks Popistasa Mary, thank you and thank Ioana Barbie timbered Cyril. Encore! :)
