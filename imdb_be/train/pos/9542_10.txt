Do not be fooled by stupid names of people, this is one sweet ride! The true successor of Tetsuo the Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, this gem begins with a bang and is baked on a thick blood to the credits roll. It seems that the aliens have captured the bodies of people and their modification in the military machines, which are then used to fight with each other in the twisted games to entertain their species. Battle Winner eats those who lost lives. That's basically it for the story, but who cares if the blood is a good thing? I have no idea how many buckets of slime have been used, but it is disgusting to watch. There is an interesting and effective use of stop-motion, when the jaws are in the process, and loves to care distributed to all creatures and makeup effects. CGI is a bit limited, but it does not really detract from the overall quality of a single bit, at least for me. It was really fun and stomach-turning film that deserves a lot of praise and has truly earned his place in the stack Cult Classics. Find and watch, you will not be disappointed!
