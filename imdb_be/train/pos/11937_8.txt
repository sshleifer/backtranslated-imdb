It was determined the case with the angels in the distant. It was on TV last night, and I guess I have not seen this film, as the second year in high school, and I am now in my 4th year of college. Although the film has a lot of shortcomings, it is just so pathetic that you can not help but sit down, look at it, and enjoy. It's fun too. Danny Glover talks just on top of that you can not help but laugh out loud to him at the time. This adds to the film, and I'm sure that this is exactly what the director wanted. You really feel for the characters in the film, even if the development is not the best. You must see. I would highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
