What can be said about the film, which has one of the black, the most nihilistic, and sometimes the most successful -I do not say "sympathizers" .. I have to say charismatic villains in film history, and the best sword fighting from the moment Flynn and Fairbanks was in its heyday ? This is an epic of hard, sometimes stupid, incredibly brave and honest man to fight for their honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth had great villains. Jessica Lange was very touching, tender and sensual.
