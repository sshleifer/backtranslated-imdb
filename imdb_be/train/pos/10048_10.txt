Every once in a while it will become a "favorite movies." I will mention the Titanic, and at least a couple of people giggle. I do not pay attention to them, because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears of the movie itself. And they are too embarrassed to admit it right now. <br /> <br /> I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the film has not lost its power during these five years. I cried again .... in all the same places. He led me in 1997, I remember a movie that nobody would have thought of breaking even it became the most popular film of all time. The film, which burst into the public consciousness like no other film I can remember (yes, even more than the Star Wars). And today many people do not even recognize that they enjoyed it. Guys, let's do it right - you do not look cool if you're a disgrace to this film. You look like a torn cynic. <br /> <br /> A lot of the film is not perfect, and this one has a few drawbacks. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the story surrounding the two lovers come together a little too neatly. However, all is not so distracting, it destroys the film. <br /> <br /> Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet wonderful. Leo is one of the greatest actors of his generation. Wait until you see it in Gangs of New York, before not to call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The film really belongs to her, and she held it together nicely. <br /> <br /> James Cameron turned out that many thought was impossible, recreating plausible Titanic. Sinking scenes were terrible, just as they had been that night. How can someone say that the consequences were bad for me. I was completely transfixed. <br /> <br /> This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port at Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, "flying". "Iceberg, right ahead!" Screws hangs improbably out of the ocean. Screams convict after it went down. And this is the end, which brought even burliest people in the theater to tears. <br /> <br /> Music, who was also a victim of the success of the film, is a key component. Cost James Horner was just perfect. And the theme of love was beautiful and tragic. version of the pop song too bad Celine Dion had to destroy this great little music so much. <br /> <br /> I must confess, I'm a fan Titanic. Thus, I relished the opportunity to see the ship, we will never see it - in all its glory. Perhaps watching him sink influenced me more than some because I had such an interest in the ship my whole life. However, I doubt that many of those whom I saw were crying titanium buffs. I applaud Cameron brought the story of the masses in a way that has never humiliated tragedy. . The film was made with such humanity <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said it better than I could ever have: Open your heart the Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.
