I have never laughed and giggled so much in my life! The first half kept me in the loop; the last half of me to come fully come unstuck! I think I giggled for 15 minutes after the tape has been finished. <br /> <br /> His timing and delivery of its history are almost equal. And although he says quickly, you catch every joke. Which is probably why my "laughter Center" was so depressed, it took an additional 15 minutes to laugh at all <br /> <br />.
