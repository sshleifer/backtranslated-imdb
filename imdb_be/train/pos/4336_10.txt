Thing About My Folks wonderful film about relationships - especially adult son and his father, but also the fact that the son of his wife, his sister and his mother. Paul Reiser wrote the semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is funny, poignant and meditation. This has led me to reconsider my own relations with my now deceased father and my adult son. Peter Falk well as the father of Paul - the role could not have been better cast. I hope that Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser recognized film awards in the following year for his efforts - Falk and his performance Raiser for his script.
