The clock on the Rhine started as a Broadway play Lillian Hellman, who wrote the movie and saw it open on Broadway at the time when the Soviet Union was still associated with Nazi Germany that the infamous non-aggression pact signed in August 1939 So much for being that Hellman was only an echo of the Communist party line, the line does not change until a couple months later. Lillian was actually a few months ahead of its time with this work. <br /> <br /> watch the play on the Rhine took place from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson, the butler, Eric Roberts, as the youngest son, Lucile Watson, as the family matriarch, and the most important villain Kuluris George and Paul Lucas. <br /> <br /> Lucas pulled award hat-trick in 1943, winning the Oscar, Golden Globe, and the New York film critics for Best Actor. Probably when Tony award was in there, he would have won that as well. Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom the Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy and Dude Madame Curie. Each of its competitors was a box-office movie title than he was. Isolation of Lukas for, as a rule, view the Academy provides round the field. <br /> <br /> Jack Warner knew why Kristians not repeat her Broadway role of the wife and Lucas was given to Bette Davis. Davis attended not because it was particularly dramatic role for her, but because she believed in the film and just wanted to be associated with it. This is the same reason why she made man who came to dinner, much easier to play than this one. <br /> <br /> Davis is the daughter of the late US Supreme Court, who married a German national in the days of the Weimar ago, after many years of being homeless on the continent of Europe, Lucas Davies, and their three children in America, which has not yet It entered the European war. They are made welcome Lucile Watson, who delighted, of course, in the end of the meeting with his grandchildren. <br /> <br /> fly in the ointment there is some other guests of the house, one of Davis' former days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband, also from Europe, the Romanian diplomat and aristocrat George Kulurisa. Coulouris is a glutton, and a spendthrift, and he smells the possibility of double-dealing, when it is suspected that anti-fascist background for Lukas. <br /> <br /> His suspicions are absolutely right, this is the reason that the family was the tramp they become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded. His health was not the same. His family loyally supports his decision, which he does. These decisions affect all other members of the troupe. <br /> <br /> To add a little more to the game of Broadway, including some lovely fascist creature was Dashiell Hammett, who was Lillian Hellman significant other. Coulouris playing cards creation Hammett was at the German embassy with such vile types, Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde, the Fillmore, Erwin Kalzer and Rudolf Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris truly one of the most revolting characters ever brought to the screen, as in any case Runmanian account. It was a metaphor for the country that have adopted the Nazi appetite, and then just canceled them without losing a step of Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lucile Watson for Best Actress in 1943, but lost in Katina Paxinou For Whom the Bell Tolls. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay, and the film itself has lost the Best Picture for that other antifascist classic, Casablanca. <br /> <br /> While this element is firmly planted in those specific times, look at the Rhine still packs feed antifascist message carrying the repeated indefinitely.
