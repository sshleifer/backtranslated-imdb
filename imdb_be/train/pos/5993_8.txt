Cure uses voice over, is to create an intense mood. Although, VO accounts for all lines of the film is surprisingly does not take away from the visual history. The use of several types of film to add a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combinations would be & W and color worked well to improve the jumps in time. The ending will make you jump, despite the possibility to foresee the result. I especially enjoyed the thrill of the unknown film. Close the window for the love scene is also excellent and reflect the stylish eye. A piece of a relatively short, but does a lot. Tight editing really helps to show that a short film can do. Worth seeing more than once!
