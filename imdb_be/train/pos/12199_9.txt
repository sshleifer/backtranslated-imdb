The first secret to guess what the original film was like Wells. This makes it a real adventure - see the incomplete skeleton and use of cinematic forensics, imagine a beautiful woman once supported <br /> <br /> If you do, you will see and experience, perhaps one of the best films. secrets ever. Secretly go, a fairly common story :. A simple diversion, a jealous husband, as a diversionary tactic <br /> <br /> What is quite miraculous Wells location history in the artificial eye to see a dark, dark world is multifaceted, first true film noir, but also darker. It is not obvious, twisted world if you do not think about the camera. What we can see at first hand, someone creates a dictionary that later became commonplace. <br /> <br /> For all the celebration, Kane was successful because of the high drama and history. Eye Camera shocked, but experimental. Wells will go from there to explore the mysteries of the descriptive and self-reference of Shakespeare with that eye. Othello and Macbeth both started in this period, and I think they are part of a common vision with it. <br /> <br /> noir feel here based on the fact that people are not responsible for their lives, even a little bit - they manipulate the random factors in the environment. So, telling the story, Wells has to make the environment in the nature. Several characters as suspects in secret. <br /> <br /> Thus, we have the well-known lighting, blocking and angles we know (and has since been seen countless times). And we have deliberately closed sets: park, boat, picnic area, an aquarium, Doc, a conference room, Chinese theater and Funhouse. I'm sure that was cut by the barbarians were lots and lots of "external" narrative is not a character, but with these strange environments. <br /> <br /> My own solution to the mystery is that the curve is made, among other iconic environments introduced as suspects. In other words, Black Irish manipulation (which we know from the notes and one scene, by typing in the union hall was an aspiring writer) was neither: the power of the human plot (park or civilized option in the courtroom) or nature (picnic or civilized option aquarium). <br /> <br /> Instead, it was a matter of deliberate whim of the gods for entertainment. This, of course, self-reference to what makes Wells: putting these people (including myself) through hell for their own whim, the case highlights the Beijing opera set up with Wells alloy. And, of course, leads to the Funhouse, where the environment is just tinkering with perception <br /> <br /> For more information about self-reference:., Of course, there is a deliberate comment on his relationship with his soon to be exwife. But I believe that a strong subliminal comment on their own environmental ridicule the environment in which he worked as a studio environment. Certainly Wells was also tightened with, and in much the same way as his character. And the twist took the form of the murder of the film, leaving a rotten corpse, mentioned at the beginning of this commentary. <br /> <br /> Poor Rita comes from China ties it all, the Chinese Theater, is expected to top canola, loss of women. Investments in the environment outside of everything.
