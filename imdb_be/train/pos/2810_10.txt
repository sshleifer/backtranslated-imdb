This documentary is incredibly thought-provoking, leaving you in a long life of two lovers who are in the final stages of AIDS. Past footage of more than twenty-plus years together really bring their last moments at home. <br /> <br /> If this movie does not make you feel pain and agony of these two remarkable people, you do not have a heart.
