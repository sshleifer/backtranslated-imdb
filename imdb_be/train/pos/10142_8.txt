Maybe it's just because I have a strong fear of the hospital and medical staff, but this one got under my skin (pardon the pun). This part of the patriot, not afraid to go over the top and satisfying as they come in terms of a film location. Not only do I consider myself to be a sense of a lot of hatred for screwer and a lot of sympathy for the «screwee», I felt myself cringe and feel the pangs of disgust some joints that are truly rare and beautiful thing for a few jaded viewer terrified as I was. Some parts are very reminiscant with «Hellraiser», but come off as a tribute and not an imitation. This is a heavy hand piece, which does not offer the viewer a lot to consider, but I like to be attacked by the film once and a while. This part brings him and does not forgive. I liked this a lot. Do not watch while eating pudding.
