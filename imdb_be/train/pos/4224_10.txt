I love this episode of Columbia. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon in it, and it is beautiful, a successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, the American version will give Agatha Christie. It is delicious, to watch the fight, dear author, who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in the tone of an accident. She blames her husband's niece, nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge her death, as the police refused it. I would love for someone else than Mariette Hartley play Veronica. I never wanted to Hartley nothing personally. And, of course, with Columbo, have some laughs, like when he asks Veronica to belly dance class. Abigail Ruth clever detective himself, and it coincides with the jokers Columbia has always played a great Peter Falk.
