It was a Saturday night and a movie called BASEketball on TV. I have always wanted to watch it, but it did not bother him when he was in the movie. Boy was I wrong. Words can not describe how funny this film starring South Park creators who share a natural chemistry on screen when the ridiculous. I wrote down on repetition film the next day, and exactly one week after viewing it for the first time I've seen it 7 times !!. Im obsessed with it, and I know who appreciate and Trey Matts work will appreciate this film. MUST SEE, THIS IS MY # 1 COMEDY all time
