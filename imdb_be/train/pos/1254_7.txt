the work of Ed Harris in the film to its normal level of perfection, that is, he steals the screen from those with whom he shared it, and that includes formidable Sean Connery. The film, which is more than a little hypocritical, comes to life only in the scenes when Harris questioned the lawyer for the other convict. It captures the spirit of a master class on the artistic management. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors are all skilled and reliable Connery as Fishburne, but the story is not entirely packs wallop. The plot is largely dependent on the assumption that there will always be a black prisoner mistreated and forced white police officers. This is the engine that drives the story, right or wrong, and makes you feel a bit cheated at the end. <br /> <br /> However, it is necessary to look to see Harris in action.
