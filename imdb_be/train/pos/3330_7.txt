I was not only an extra in this movie, I have to see him in Boston sold out cinema. More than a thousand supporters of the Boston Red Sox / Farrelly jammed themselves in the cinema next to the Boston Common, to watch a comedy about them .... .... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star of this sweet comedy about love and passion. The love between two young lovers. Lust for the Red Sox winning the World Series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he's the best actor for the role. It is quite funny and gets the most laughs. Barrymore on the other hand, it is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes I felt the support of actress Skye Jonah would be the best actor for the role. In general, all the fans of Boston Red Sox will love this film. For the rest of the world, it's just a funny movie.
