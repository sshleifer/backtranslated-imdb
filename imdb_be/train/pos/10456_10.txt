This film is not about entertainment, or even a movie you want to see to pass the time. This film is really a manifestation of true love that can only come from God. One can not help but be deeply affected by watching this film. We have several aspects of love, which contributes to the value of this film. There is the divine love of God, perfectly painted. The love of God is superior to the mind and the heart and endures and eternal. There is love in marriage. While the main character struggles with his wife's illness, he realizes that through the love of God, that he loves his wife more than he could have imagined. He knows that he and his wife is one and can never be separated. Finally, you have a love child and a parent. Children in the family to come together and understand that nothing but questions, that love conquers fear. Dear friends, love is not love if it does not come from God, because God is love, and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know that you love them. Love does not do any good, unless it be given more. I pray that this film can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it. Amen !!
