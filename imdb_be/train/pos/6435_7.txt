I think that most people who posted comments to this film does not understand, like watching a movie and / or have little sense of elegance. First, to evaluate the film that you need to understand the extent to which all the film work together. Modern senses require a lot of drama. No, I do not mean greater installation characters and stories, but they seem to require emotional trajectories that are largely or very tragic comic. This thin film. Its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are not just in this film. This beautifully shot film that makes the most of combining sensuality, politics, human weakness, venality ... you name it. The world it's set to be a strange and misunderstood today ... a world in which, if you have, you should flaunt it now and loud, even if you only think you are. <br /> <br /> Many people today do not realize that the Victorian society was not really Victorian, as people understand that term today. <br /> <br /> This film helps set the record straight.
