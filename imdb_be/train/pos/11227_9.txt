Hidden Frontiers-is more than a fan fiction- well thought out and organized a series of holding the worlds of Star Trek alive and growing. With a little fan fun project is currently well-known series of the net; Latent Frontiers has a little something for every Star Trek fan in it. Set in the late Star Trek: The Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager Time Hidden Frontier line takes on the themes and issues raised in the other Star Trek series with established histories with the help of well-developed characters, scenes, and story arcs. Star Trek Hidden Frontier took on the history of the social context that Gene Roddenberry's failed to bring to the screen and shows the development of the characters in the long-duration space assignments - real things that happen in the immediate vicinity, as well as an exciting space wars and conflicts Sci -fi addicts know and love . Done in the studio "Green Screen"; Latent Frontiers brings rollicking cast regulars on the screen and into your hearts. A large ensemble cast of actors play well together and lovingly give their time and energy to the project. Resourceful use of green screen technology, props, costumes, and make work to make the worlds of Star Trek Hidden Frontier fun and believable. Hidden Frontier has gone where few tread go into the world of science fiction, and prospered when they got there. Hidden Frontier offers an excellent bonus feature of a well-designed site, interesting discussion forums, access to creative, productive and existing staff and fun weekly chat. I highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch.
