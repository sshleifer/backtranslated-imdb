Robert Taylor, like a mad buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson main character in this film. In the beginning I thought that Charlie would end up redeeming itself as John Wayne or James Stewart seekers in the bare spurs. But as the film goes on Gilson continues to do more crimes, until you realize that there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger Sandy Mackenzie, who wants to stop the hunt, because he understands that the buffalo will go fast, and it becomes repulsive act of murder. Gilson natural killer which makes no distinction between animals and humans. Debra Paget as an Indian girl, an amazing character, taking into account the self-imposed censorship of the time. It lies Gilson fully retired, even though she hates him. The last scene is frozen Gilson, unforgettable.
