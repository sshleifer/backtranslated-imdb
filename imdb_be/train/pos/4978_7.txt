Good Shirely Temple short. Child actors screaming their lines seemed the norm in this day and time. Perhaps being "seen and not heard," you need to be compensated. In addition, it's fun. Given the era of film, there are certain aspects of things, from a social point of view, that hit me like a very progressive and liberal. I will not go into them here, I'd rather not spoil it for you, but let's you watch it for yourself and see if you notice these elements. Already on, as it was its easy to see from this brief fascination that has developed in the Church. This makes it worth a look if you're a fan of Temple. For others, its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you wait for a good night's warm glass of milk on the stove.
