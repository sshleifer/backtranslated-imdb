I assign it and Babylon 5 as the best science fiction television series made. Both stand out in my mind, because in contrast to the earlier series Star Trek, there is a consistent evolution of the plots and characters. If you look at the original Star Trek and Star Trek: TNG, they had a great show, but there was no common theme or plot, which connects all the episodes. In many ways, you can usually watch the show completely out of sequence, it is not difficult to understand what is happening. This was less the case with the Deep Space 9 (with huge battles, occupies the entire last season) and other TREK show, because there was a larger story that has united them. This sequence seems to have developed as a concept with Babylon 5 and found it even more with SG-1. The bottom line is that, in many respects, this series was like watching a family or a long novel takes the form slowly. Of course, there were a few "one-off" episodes that were not related to the others, but it was very small and far away from each other and were usually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> And speaking of funny, I loved that SG -1 retained from time to time light mood and was not terribly serious. So I really enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love Homer Simpson - it is really very bad, he slowly disappeared from the series next season <br /> <. br /> to truly appreciate the SG-1, you have to watch it from the beginning and see how intricately work areas. This sequence gives the show restlessness. And if you do not like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, sci-fi, perhaps, not the genre for you.
