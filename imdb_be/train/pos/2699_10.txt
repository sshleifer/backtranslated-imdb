There are other reviews here, so I do not have to say how great it is, or what it is ... I mean, I've heard about this film many years ago, before it was given. I can not even remember how, I just know that it was through the Internet. Distributors went under before it ever hit! As I complained and mopeds for many months. Please note that this page has a link to buy the film, and only the selected area is a VHS from Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Babelfish Alta Vista translation. I know that it is PAL format, and they really change the text on the screen in German and there is a tiny bit of narration in the beginning, which was also dubbed in German, but as cheerful and campy, like this film, it's really just making funny! If you want to see this movie and you have a place close by, making the conversion is so worth it! It cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the United States from Germany. Believe me, it may seem like a lot to spend on the film, but if you're in a sugary bi-clicking you will blow-out money left and right number of conversions for your friends!
