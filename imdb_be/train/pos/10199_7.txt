As a child, I loved this game. I played it a million times during the spring of 1993 my friend Andrew. I played Axel and Blaze, and he was not Adam and no matter how often we played, we never seemed to get tired. Then Streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forget that this one existed. <br /> <br /> You play as ex-police Axel Stone, and Blaze Fielding Adam, who rushed forces to take on the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work later in the old and corrupt city, headed by Mr. X. evil Beating all the bad guys and boss-end level of a lot of fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my favorite because you can throw the villain down the hole into the river. Do you even have a chance to become the right hand of Mr. X at the end of the game (for the price). This leads to the "bad ending", in which you become the boss of the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery, because you destroy the syndicate on the road to r-X, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Streets of Rage also has a truly fantastic music. Composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute wonders with limited Sega Genesis technology. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are outstanding melodies. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner I am proud of the fact that it is always on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, this is a kind of make the first few outdated <br /> <br /> Pros :. <br /> <br /> The average graphics, but a nice background presented in the comics, like .. progression bar that fits tons of games <br /> <br /> Great melodies <br /> <br /> It is easy to get and hard to put down <br /> <br /> Cons :. <, Br /> <br /> significantly inferior to much more complex street Rage 2. <br /> <br /> Poor enemy AI. Baddies often moving away from you, and not to engage in battle. This is especially annoying with 5-level boss. <br /> <br /> The lack of combo moves. <br /> <br /> Lack of decent weapons. <br /> <br /> The bad guy patterns are repeated far too often. <br /> <br /> B- Graphics Sound Gameplay A- B- Lasting Appeal B-
