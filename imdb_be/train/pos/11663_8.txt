The Secret of Kells is an independent, animated feature, which gives us one of the legendary stories surrounding the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript from the Middle Ages with the image of the four Gospels of the New Testament. I do not know what this book really exists, but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much easier. There are several stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be, who wrote and how it has survived for 1000 years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to Brendan, an orphan who lives in the Abbey of Kells in Ireland with his uncle, Abbot Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson). Abbot Cellach build a massive wall around the abbey, to protect the villagers and monks. Brendan does not love a wall and not the other monks. They are more focused on reading and writing, the abbot Cellach has no time for more. He is afraid of "northerners," those who plunder and leave towns and villages are empty and burned to the ground. <br /> <br /> Once the traveler comes from the island of Iona, near Scotland. This Brother Aidan, a very wise man, which carries with it a special book, which is not finished yet. Abbot Cellach grant him a residence permit and Brendan buddies with him. Aidan Brendan has special plans. Firstly, it needs ink for the book, but it requires a certain berries. The only way to get them to go beyond the walls and in the forest area of ​​Brendan's borders. Seeing that it is the only chance to continue his work for Aidan, he decides to get back and forth from the berries to his uncle notices his absence. <br /> <br /> In the forest Brendan meets Ashley, a protector of the forest. It allows you to pass Brendan berries and along the way it becomes akin to his company. She warns him of impending danger in the dark and not disrupt it. There are things worse than the Vikings there. From there, Brendan met with more problems with the book and the impending invasion of certainty. <br /> <br /> I like the story so much more now that I know what it is. Knowing now that the Book of Kells, and that it contains, the animation makes sense. I'm sure you've seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago, with frilly borders, colorful pictures and extravagant models, creatures, and writings that adorn the pages. Much like the opening frames of Disney Sword in the Stone. Animation here contains many such designs and patterns. This creates a very unique viewing experience, where history and animation almost try to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> I could not take my eyes off the incredible detail. This is one of the best 2D animation I've seen in recent years. This is a bright, stimulating and full of life. Symbols are constantly surrounded by design, sheep, and samples of the trees on the walls, and in the air just floating around. This enhances the film. <br /> <br /> The story is satisfactory, although I think that the end may be stretched a little more. With the implementation of a total of 75 minutes, I think it could have been something special in the final act. It does not give much information and not rely on the value of the book. We remember that it is important, but do not fully understand. We are told that it gives hope, but never why and how. It was really only the absence of the film. Otherwise, I thought the story was interesting, but completely keep up with the animation. <br /> <br /> I think it is good to a certain extent. Animation can carry a film so far before it falls short. History is missing a few pieces, but it's an interesting look at an exciting part of the story. I would recommend looking at the Book of Kells only briefly, to get an idea of ​​what I was and this film in question. I think it will help your browsing experience much more. It is very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that is definitely not to be missed.
