Herman Jos√© actor plays the role of football soccer entrepreneur who receives the pass two African players and trying to sell them for very little money a rival club Benfica (club with his heart), FC Porto, so these players are not playing well, and he wanted the FC port I was unfair to it. But it happens that these two players when all is well and FC Porto sell them for big money to a foreign club that makes good business sense. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without great predecessors in big films, is a very good and funny comedy, showing all the rivalry that exists between the North / South of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). strongly recommended
