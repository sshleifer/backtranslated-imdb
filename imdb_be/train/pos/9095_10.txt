Charming, funny movie that gets durum everything. I saw a screener of the film recently at work. It was so nice to see this film, unlike all the bad horror pictures I see every day. So much so that I decided to write in. Not sure if this film will be in theaters, but I hope he does. Its a good movie to see one of his charming and has some funny jokes. The acting was terrific (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf. Direction was pretty good (not the film that was to be more directed). What really makes this film stand out, I think it's a letter. It was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish and banter between characters, smart and has a good rhythm. As an aspiring screenwriter, I notice things like that! (I'm a moron.) In any case, very cute film that I recommend.
