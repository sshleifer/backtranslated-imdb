This is a very dramatic and disturbing film. There are many sites and turns. History and the director opens the question marks on death row or alleged crimes committed by black people. This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher and subtle sounds great James Newton Howard. The strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this one Do not miss the "TRUTH Crimes" or "Hurricane". My wife and I gave 8/10.
