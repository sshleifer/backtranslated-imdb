Very good drama, though, seemed to have some empty areas, leaving the audience to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life to be so for someone who can neither read nor write. This film just gave the real world: a wife who suddenly sole breadwinner, live in relative and their quarrel, restless child who gets knocked out, and then, as a rule, falls out of the school, the fool is the man who accept nest egg and bought a beer with him. 2 thumb up.
