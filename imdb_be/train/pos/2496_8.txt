A lot of garbage - no where even close to the trash. Nya original? that's the last thing that could be said "2.4 childrenÂ» .Predictable? Of course not! Although it was a bit unusual series for the BBC, it was fun, funny and witty. I especially liked Belinda Lang and John Picard - which I believe preformed wonderfully.Gary Olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members..I never entirely new, why it can unicellular to read here today of the death of Gary Olsen a relatively young age. I wish they would do more of this type of comedy, there are many more (and show them here in Israel) .Thumbs way!
