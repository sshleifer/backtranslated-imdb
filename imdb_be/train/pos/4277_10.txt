"Yes Tamo PEVAÂ» is one of the best films I've ever seen. Tragicomedy with very profound consequences for the future of humanity shown through the eyes of a seemingly very simple and ordinary people with God forgotten Serbian province just before the outbreak of the Second World War. I saw him in a small theater in Russia, where the film was very limited distribution, and I had no chance to come through it so far. It is such a pity that this is a great movie almost forgotten now. I was looking for VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and unfortunately - could not find a single one. I would be very grateful to the other supporters of this little gem of a movie-making for inducing way to purchase a copy.
