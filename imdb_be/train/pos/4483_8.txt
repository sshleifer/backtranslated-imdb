All musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) will not miss a step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) does not miss a note. Scenes with them very well, showing how much talent can add some uneven plot. Sinatra's "I fall in love too easily" is an indication of his later and better future. «Mexican Hat Dance» Kelly with a young Mexican girl's gorgeous. Kelly, of course, received his nomination as best actor. And there bushel really funny lines like: "Do you think that the Navy take dope?"; "Do you think that somebody sings brands sleep?"; and "We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid." Thoroughly enjoyable film, just the thing to shake off dust on the recently completed World War II.
