This is not "free", but clear, faithful remake of the classic «I Soliti Ignoti» 1958 Monicelli with Toto ', Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale, etc. And this is the reason, it's good, it copies all of the interesting characters and the plot, even in the details (for example, the scene where the photographer steals a camera from a local market). <br /> <br /> I was watching the wonderful old version many times, and I knew by heart all the gangs and the end, but I still enjoyed the "Welcome to Collinwood," which has its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how life and the way young thieves in 1950, Italy in 2002 to adapt to the United States. Things have not changed. 8/10.
