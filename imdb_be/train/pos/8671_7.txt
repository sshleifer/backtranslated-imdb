Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> In the past PPV in 2006 <br /> <br /> Smackdown brand. <br /> <br /> The results of matches ahead ******** <br /> <br /> We start the show with the Inferno match. Kane vs. MVP. It was a good match. Nothing about wrestling here. It was about the video. Overall, it was not bad. There were a few spots here close to Kane gets too close to the fire, but in the end, Kane defeated MVP with a battering ram in the fire back in the first place. <br /> <br /> Good knife. Continue to <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announced a new match for the tag team titles :. London and Kendrick will protect against: Regal and Taylor, Hardyz and MNM the ladder match !!!! Let's go <br /> <br /> Match two: Fatal four matches stairs. It was a complete massacre. Based on three of the four teams here, one would expect chaos. The spots were amazing. In total, the festival spot. One point Jeff went for poetry in motion and moved to London and Jeff hit the stairs! Shortly afterwords, Jeff installed on the top rope with two stairs about how the CMA was going to kill Jeff, Matt makes the save and Jeff get into the "swing" shot Joey Mercury! Mercury hurt. His eyes closed quickly and burst open the hard way. Mercury takes out a match and still have the Nitro. He's going to fight alone for the title! Regal and Taylor then seize London and SUPLEX his face in a ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro slaughter place, dropkicks through the ladder to nail the Geoff! Excellent! In the end, London and Kendrick retain the tag team titles. That match !!! <br /> <br /> It was madness. I can not understand why WWE Sun announce it until now. Buyrate increase hugely. I am sure that the replay value will be good, though. <br /> <br /> Mercury suffered a broken nose and lacerated to the eye. Currently, he is in the hospital. Get well soon baby <br /> <br /> In no case will not be anything else here on top of that <br /> <br /> Next: .... Miz vs. Boogeyman (UV) It was nothing of the match. Will ever fight Boogeyman? Miz sucks too. After the madding crowd, it kills them dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. It was a strong match. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit a superplex killer at one point! Benoit struck out eight German suplexes too! Benoit wins with a sniper. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Helms vs. Young-Cruiserweight Championship title match. It was a good match. Unfortunately, stupid fans do not worry about it. WHY? Handlebars and Ian are very talented and have fought well. I agree with JBL. He spoke to her in the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate it or get out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. Match Undertaker-Last ride. Is it too much here. It was a slug festival, with some exceptions. Kennedy at one point Taker dropped from an upper stage to the floor. The spot was great. The response was disappointing. The final spot was Kennedy Taker tomb stone on the hearse and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. They are both hard worker. Nevertheless, Kennedy needed this victory. Undertaker should be lost. Creative screwed up again. <br /> <br /> The stupid thing is a miracle next. I love women. Not so. At least, Tory was not here. It's refreshing. Judging by the crowd, Layla had to win. WWE wanted Ashley. Consider your bathroom break. . Next <br /> <br /> Main Event :. Cena & Batista v Finlay & Booker T. It was also nothing match. Emphasis was Cena v. Finlay and Batista vs. Booker. Batista and Booker can not work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The finish was unsuccessful. Finley does not hit Batista with a chair shot to the knee and Baptiste sold entirely shot and finished the match. Lame. Nya main event caliber at all. <br /> <br /> In general, Armageddon would kill less, but the ladder match was the main event here. It is worth enough money right there. Several others were hard. <br /> <br /> The last word: Good PPV match with stairs be a lifesaver. Smackdown good show just is not enough convincing. Smackdown need to stop giving Cena toe. Smackdown Let stand on their own two feet. This show proves that Smackdown is.
