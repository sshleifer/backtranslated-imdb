I just got this video is used, and I watched it last night. We began to act very bad (hey, hey ------ ------ twister), but was very good soon after wards. Tornadoes looked very fake, and many CGI effects were very quaint, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside swells around and sucked were very well done and about on par with films like Twister. Scenes of destruction were also very well done too. The story was very well written, and it's refreshing to see a film like this mad from the same old "formulas disaster" films of this genre seems to be delayed for 30 years. <br /> <br /> While this film was a very strange mix of FX and the current quality of that dignity and in my book.
