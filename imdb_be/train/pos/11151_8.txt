The only reason I knew Midnight Cowboy because he was a critic of the AFI Top 100. For the top 100 is not very well known film; in fact, I had to look hard to find a copy, I received the DVD version about half the price. Surprisingly, it was only rated M15 + (uncut version). <br /> <br /> I doubt that many will pay attention to this survey (a comment), so I'll make it short. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the strangest films I have ever seen, in part due to the use of the installation, art shooting (very art house) and an unusual topic. There are many things in the film I still do not understand (I've seen it twice), and it makes for an emotionally confusing movie. <br /> <br /> filming and acting was very good, and this is even more than life characters that make this film memorable. The main character, Joe Buck, a "cowboy" from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets a crippled con man Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo and, of course, they become friends, who are going through the usual antics. What makes an interesting movie, two characters are so different. <br /> <br /> I feel the film does not develop a relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection, even though the ending is, of course, very sad and tragic. You probably already know what's going on by reading the reviews, but it's pretty obvious from the outset. <br /> <br /> I personally think that the film is beautiful and sarcastically explores his major themes. Deliver mankind (shown in the darkness of city streets, breaking down position). Most of the characters in the film, there is a law (a conman, giggolo.etc) until you can not love them. Joe Buck dear, because he is so naive and optimistic, while we begin to feel sorry for Ratso later in the film. <br /> <br /> I think the film has been rated so highly, because it was, of course, very innovative for his time. At that time (and even now) is definitely not a typical film (full art-house). At a time when the cinema was dominated tired westerns, musicals and drama film with such an unusual topic as Midnight Cowboy jumps. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I have to say that I really liked the movie. Imagery passed as fabulous. I especially liked the scene at the party, music, pictures, etc. stay in your mind for a long time after the show. However, like in the movies for entertainment, this was a bit lacking (actually not my style of the film) to the thrill. This is a film that will be savored and appreciated, rather than cheap thrills swing action. <br /> <br /> While I would hardly consider himself qualified to analyze this film, the characters and their motives were very interesting. From what I understand from flashbacks, Joe Buck was sexual abuse in childhood by his grandmother, though she still seems to have no relation to the story. He carefree young stallion who suppresses his dark memories. Religious connotations in the film are also confused. Some suggested a homosexual relationship between Buck and Ratso, although I do not see where they got the idea from. The theme of homo-sexuality in general, more than touched on in the conversation, and then in a collision with Joe Buck lonely old man, but it has little to do with the main plot. <br /> <br /> Of course, from a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (it has more than 70's feel to it than a 60 feels) and revolutionary for its time, referring to the subject of several other films dared do. While it has a simple, sentimental story to it (disguised hard edge) the beauty of the film in the country, often psychedelic sequences.
