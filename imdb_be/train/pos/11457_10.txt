As the jacket says the film «Gorgeously shot and masterfully edited," and, yes, it mesmerizingly beautiful. The ever that we take in mind the rocks and in constant ebb and flow of the water framed by ephemeral work with Goldsworthy hands, so that they very ephemeralness they point to ages <br /> <br /> And so the beauty of his compositions to pursue us with only a touch of melancholy weave - or in the words of Matthew Arnold «Dover Beach»:. <br /> <br /> Listen to you! hear lattice pebbles roar that pull back wave and stroke, during their return, in a high chain Begin and stop, and then start again with a trembling cadence slow, and bring eternal note of sadness in. <br /> <br /> at some point towards the end of the film Goldsworthy says that "the word of doing their job, but what am I doing here, says much more. "As WordSmith I have not offended and did not for a moment I think he's indiscreet, because the combination of form and time, and the changes and the texture and color and composition that Goldsworthy carefully and intuitively create, really something more than just words , you might say. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, he notes on "that is here to stay ... and what is not." This is his theme <br /> <br /> I think that artists once in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral, even the greatest works of art in comparison with the vast space of time. and so they began to reflect this understanding of works of works that were deliberately ephemeral. The idea was that, emphasizing how short-lived, even the most powerful people work, a sense of premature art would be manifested. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some efficiency Goldsworthy work is like that expression. He carefully makes some form of straw or leaves, where the wave will reach it, or has it in the river, where it will be crushed; and in the process to merge both the composition and the ephemeral. <br /> <br /> And the transient and timeless essential for us to understand our world and our place in it. And it is very important that the work can be done in the context of nature, so that what is set within what is natural. Thus, the walls are made of stone and stone eggs that Goldsworthy design silent and hard until we know that they are not monuments of eternity, but instead will remain for some indefinite period of time and then disperse and return to a state so the same as what existed before we came along. <br /> <br /> This is an art as art must seem spiritual. <br /> <br /> in a sense Goldsworthy work in this inarticulated understanding. This experience is purely time and form. In a sense, his work "answers" the famous poem «Ozymandias» Shelley said, even as the tide washing work away, and even cancer dissipates expression, even as the art of living, thanks to our experience it. In the same way one thinks about Sand painting Tibetan so carefully compiled and measure, and then just as they are so beautiful and valuable is over, they are given to the wind, so that we might know that all of this flow. <br /> <br /> However, in today's world, these works of art bring in photos and videos. Goldsworthy is an experienced photographer (If necessary, I would say), and all his work, even unsuccessful, he tells us, is photographed, so that he could look at them in a more reflective mood, and see what he did and what he does not. <Br / > <br /> This film production director Thomas Riedelsheimer with a beautiful and properly pursues music by Fred Frith will be missed. It is one of the most beautiful documentaries that I've ever seen, and one of the most spiritual.
