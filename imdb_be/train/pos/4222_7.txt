I like this episode very little, Ruth Gordon is good if not a bit unnatural, as it has always been. As already mentioned, the music is very good and it has a moodiness that does not exist in all the episodes. <br /> <br /> But one of the main portion of the hole there, so wide you can manage a fleet through it. It was found that the light does not work in the repository. Do not you think that is very smart Columbo or the rest of the police thought to check if the light bulb work? You would think that in a rather short period of time they would have unscrewed a light bulb and so found a note. Of course, this TV detective fiction, and various holes can always be found, but it seems to be too conspicuous. <br /> <br /> It really does Columbo, to be a hidden genius, when the light is not working but the "death bed" certificate goes on Undiscovered, apparently, for a few days.
