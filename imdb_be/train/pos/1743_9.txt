After having seen many Greek films that I feel very suspicious in relation to most of them. But after watching this, I felt surprised. Movies perfectly without much attempt. You can not say that the script is so great, or the picture is perfect, or something technical. This is a true story, and it occurs in the Greek rural areas, in places forgotten by God. The film is like a punch in the stomach, and I really want to make things not as it is. This, obviously, talks about xenophobia Greek people (ignorant) to something else. this guy's problem is not that he is a former convict. The problem is that he is not one of these people. It is different, and they do not want them (which is why all the good things that he does turn a boomerang to it). As well as talking about the apathy of the people, because there are some people who are opposed to hunting the King, but they did not dare to speak their minds. After all, you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the religious community and tries to act like God says, but at the same time acting as unfair to the king. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or belief in accordance with the established system. In the end, you can have a positive lesson from this very unpleasant story, but it means that you can understand and be a part of this society, only if you want to be one of them. If you want to be different and even alone, you have lost (and it is not far from reality) I think it is tragic that the story is real, and it must be for all the bell. No comments for the main actor, because he has already won, and I think that his game was great. Small comment for Hatzisavvas (played by police), he, like a dinosaur, he has played many roles, and I am sure that this role has been very easy for him, but he plays so well that you can not deny his great bravo, I would definitely recommend this film is for anyone who wants to see a good Greek film.
