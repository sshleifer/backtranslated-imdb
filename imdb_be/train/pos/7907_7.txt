I do not agree with this opinion with a rating that was given to this film, and I think this is an example of how short-minded majority of spectators are in the world. In fact ... you forget that the movie is used as a native art before some tycoons have tried to make it just entertainment? This movie is not fun, at least, is not as simple entertainment you get on films such as Titanic and Gladiator. He has a style, it's different, it's shocking ... This is why most of you hate it: because it is not trying to be pleasant for you. It's just a story, it is a very strange one, I admit, but in the end, only a strange story. This is not a great story, not even a big job movie, but I think it's worth 7 star rating only courage as a writer and director for a shot of history, which is not to please the audience, so the sale of billions of copies and making big studios richer. This movie, to me, in a European art-like film made in the United States, and all those involved in the commission of which he is worthy of respect. Let it be for the courage, or be his unique sense of humor.
