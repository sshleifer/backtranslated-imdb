Darius Goes West movie with the image of Americans that everything is possible if you try hard enough. It's great fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who had never expected, but wanted to see what was beyond the boundaries of his beautiful city of Athens, Ga. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His old friends Logan, Ben, and a few other good friends decided to make a wish come true Darius. They started small - Ben & Logan's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness of the state of Darius: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and to raise funds for the children to take Darius to not only see the ocean, but to see these great United States. To say that young college buddies managed to raise hope and awareness to this terrible disease would be an understatement. They have realized the dream of Darius, and then some. They put their lives on hold, showing love, care, and tons of fun to Darius, Darius helping to see how he, in turn, can show the same features of the other suffering from DMD. Darius went on a Red Cross volunteer - sitting in a chair, collecting money (together with their buddies) outside the local grocery store. His beautiful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is a hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys Oscar - no one deserves it more. March Sweeney.
