"Written on the Wind" is irresistible, surprising strange film, as only director Sirk could have done it. The film is immersed in a bucket of Freudian symbols melodramatics strange and colorful contrasts. The connection between financial success and moral decay is the main theme of the film. Sirk, seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to watch the movie as a prime example of what can be done with Sirk vulgar material. The palette of colors is particularly impressive. Acting in the film too much. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall terribly charming and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (she deservedly won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar Plan), which manages to keep the film in boiling point. Kudos pulsating through Frank Skinner, brilliant cinematography of Russell Metty (in every shot a masterpiece in itself), and the production design department. In addition, the tune title beauty. It is an unforgettable film.
