Lily Mars, Smalltown girl who lives in Indiana, dreams of making it big on Broadway and its aspirations were brought up when a successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown to visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway notice it, but he's just bored with their antics. If Thornway returns to New York to host his show, Lily follows (unknown to John, of course) and Thornway ultimately gives her a small role in his next show, just as a favor to her family, but Thornway She begins to fall on this young girl and flowers of romance, which makes the leading lady in the show, Isabelle Rekay, jealous. When Isabelle gets tired of the romance of John Lilly is controversial with the show, she leaves, and John decides to make Lily a star. Isabelle returned later and Thornway forced to tell Lily that she returned to her small bit roles in the play, which can also pose a threat to the romance. Very magical movie and a refreshing change to see Garland put comedy touches in her role (her reading of Lady Macbeth, while it should be a sense of humor, never threatened her singing career) I enjoyed the character in Heflin (Thornway) more when he was annoyed Lily, not to be romantic. The film should be more predictable and scenes were not collected that well together, but very enjoyable film. Rating 7.
