NOTHING (3+ lost its 5 stars) Another strange room from the director of the film "Cube". At this time, there are two main characters who find themselves and their house is transported to a mysterious white void. There, there is literally nothing outside of their small two-storey house. Intriguing, to be sure, but I thought it was a comedy tone is created for the film from the get go it was very ill-conceived. There has to be some sense of humor, of course ... and I have no problems with humor, which was ultimately derived from the plight of our two heroes (their final "showdown" was definitely a beep) ... but I really think the film would have been much better if he was more rooted in reality in the beginning. After watching the movie I was watching "Manufacturing" feature on a DVD, and a short trailer at the end is almost completely devoid of "stupid" comedic aspects ... It looks like a completely different (and slightly better) movie. The last half hour of the film, where things are really starting to come together ... it seems on the way to the recent film «Primer». The actors are good, if they do not overdo the comedy chips. They are really very plausible they have more "normal" times. I was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment halfway ... but he won me through. (And continues to look past the credit for the final scene ... just do not ask me to explain it.)
