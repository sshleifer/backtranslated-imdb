Aah, Miracles on bends! What can I say that has not been said about this great show? Nothing! This is without a doubt one of the most well-written show I have ever faced, live action or animation. The new material will be too dumbed down for my taste, and some of the "mature" things I have to drive the child out of the room for. But Miracles on bends. <br /> <br /> Stories are very interesting and plausible. Some of them can even be stretched to an hour or two for a movie. Episodes like the storm and its chance to sleep very dramatic at the same time enjoyable for both children and adults. Then there's the purely comedic episodes, such as the bluest with Bala Bloods and Stuck on you, where the emphasis is on the fun. I can laugh myself to tears a few selected ones. <br /> <br /> drama aspect sorely lacking in most of the show is currently (at least those that are not specifically adapted to them), especially in cartoons. In an episode of Stormy Weather, for example, Keith Cloudkicker decides that he is going to join the circus air, but Ball said that it would be too dangerous. In the big battle episodes, Ball yell at Keith to stay away from the cheeky given to which Kit screams "NO! You can not tell me what to do! * NOT you just * * * * MY DAD *!» And buries his face the pillow. the next day he goes to the air circus. This kind of drama is a rarity in this film, and will be welcome to those created in the moment. <br /> <br /> the characters have a lot of depth to them. Bali is quite a lot as it is in the jungle Book, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness. Rebecca tricky business woman, whose ideas about getting money in the As as good in theory, rarely good in practice. Molly cute little girl, but you can not let that fool you. It can be a real hellion time. Set Cloudkicker darker character than the others. He does not trust adults a lot if they They do not apply to him, and he has a tendency to break off relations See his expression in the robbery and lightning when he grabs the hook:. he looks like he's ready to put it right through the pirate <br /> <br /> in the end, it is drama, combined with the very real chemistry between them. characters, making the show No. 1 in my book. The relationship between the ball and the whale is very real, almost father and son. This is well illustrated in Quito All that ends with Keith when Baloo China takes the word for it that Seymour animal abuse in your aquarium instead of siding with other adults. Relationship Bala and Becky, too, really, because the motivation for Bala comes from the desire to redeem ol »Sea Duck, do not necessarily want to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he really got Duck ago, he'd still be doing the job for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> So the sea, not to mention all the other aircraft in the series, it is quite realistic developed. plane functions are not changed once during the series (continuity, as it is hard to find too), and unlike most other "super-jets" of other cartoons, it does not have any other weapons on board (except for mangoes!) and relies instead on this great skill cunning pilot to get out of trouble. It is difficult to think of the vehicle hero who has a gun turret, laser gun, or a gun somewhere on the board. And the fact that they use their head to get out of trouble so hard to find in the cartoon at the moment. In addition, he was just so damn cool design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Ever. Period. Definitely worth all ten stars!
