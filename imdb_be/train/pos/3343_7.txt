My daughter gets really put on me when I am referring to Drew Barrymore, how to look, as if she had been hit in the face a pan, not to mention her chin Dudley Dooright that Jay Leno die. How great, then, when I found in «Fever Pitch», that I really like Miss Barrymore; Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably best described as sweet, light comedy. To be absolutely stereotypical, girls love the movie for its romantic charm and vulnerability Jimmy Fallon, and the boys like all the male bonding and the image of sports mania. <br /> <br /> my sports-hating wife, my teenage daughter and I all found something to like in the movie. It says something in itself. It's a nice way to spend a half hour or so, and this is probably a really good date flick too.
