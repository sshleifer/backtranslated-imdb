Do you like to solve puzzles? I enjoy challenging stories? This is for you. Brilliant, intelligent film by Francis Leclerc (son of legendary French Canadian signatory to Felix Leclerc). Screaming photo editing and clever words Leclerc, greatly helped Roy Dupuis, who dythirambic starring. <br /> <br /> In Moscow, Alexandre Tourneur, the animal in his 40s, who had just woken up from a coma after weaning someone unknown. Tourneur struggles to remember who hit him when he ended the suffering of a deer on the road. During Combats he has strange behavior and it seems that something took over him. <br /> <br /> I do not scary, but very mysterious and well played film. I have a hypothesis about the final (I think that the Indian cause of the accident), but this ending was open to any explanation. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it 9.5 / 10
