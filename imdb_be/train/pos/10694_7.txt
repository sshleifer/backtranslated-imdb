I had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this film reflects the fact that many of them, unfortunately. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy, as well as very unfair. With robotic floor, hustling for gifts, to lie and betrayal, I have experienced all of this in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm saying. And now my qualifications: Here photojournals of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It includes thousands of photographs many hot Russian girls I met, black comedy, a scam, I was involved in, and the story of my robbery and the emergence of the Russian national television <br /> <br HTTP /> :. //Www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like a reality show.

Russian woman who plays Nicole Kidman in many respects similar to the bustle and Katya in my photojournals. <br /> <br /> May 3 bride looking for a trip to Russia happens to be very interesting and will sell, why they do not make a movie with my bride in search of adventure in Russia? However, there is one actual impossibility in this film, and it's the way that guy orders a bride from a catalog and having it arrive at the airport. It does not work that way at all, so I do not understand why the media loves to perpetuate it. There is not a single Russian bride site introduction that works this way, and I challenge anyone to find something that does. The fact is, you can only order a Russian lady CONTACT INFO (email address, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From there you meet, then visit it, and if you want to bring her to your country, you have to start the immigration process to the INS office, and wait for a month after that. Here's how it works in real life. You can not just order her to come to the airport. US Immigration would never let such a thing happen <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> -.
