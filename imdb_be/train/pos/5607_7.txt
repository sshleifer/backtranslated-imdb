After I watched the tenant and interpret it as a horror movie. It uses many of the tropes of the genre: a sinister apartment, suspicious neighbors, ghosts, mysteries, hallucination. The hero's life, Trelkovsky, seemed to be surrounded by evil, secret forces that are trying to drive him crazy. <br /> <br /> The last time I watched it, I challenge this initial explanation. If this film is a horror movie, it's just horror in the sense that the novel Kafka's horror. In fact, this film can be understood on a literal level as a lone person gradually becomes crazy without any external influence <br /> <br /> Polanski did in his career three films devoted to madness :. Disgust, which I do not particularly like because the development of the madness of the heroine never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, in which the heroine mind from evil forces; and tenants who might be the best study of paranoia ever made into a movie. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky young man who rents the apartment where the woman killed herself. He becomes obsessed with her and starts to become slow: he wears her clothes, putting on makeup, she tells how she is. But is he spirit possession, or he's just letting his wild idea to get the best out of it? It is this oscillation between the real and the imaginary, and that Polanski never decides what makes it such a fascinating film. Many of the events in the film can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be normal causes, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> While it's not my favorite film Polanski is still a good example of his ability to create intrigue and reflect the madness in very convincing terms. And from a technical point of view, it is a miracle, too. Suffice it to say that he is collaborating with the composer Philippe Sarde and legendary film director of photography Sven Nykvist (Bergman DP) in the making of this film. Walked slowly and sometimes uninteresting segments can make the film difficult to use, but it is an experience, nonetheless.
