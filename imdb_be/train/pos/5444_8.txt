Class reunion very underated comedy gem. It is 1982 and 1972, Lizzie Borden class of high yield for there 10 years reunion, among them the usual stereotypes, Hank baby fat and botanist, etc., but the former students for a bumpy night, one of them classmates Walter Baloer, class weakling who was the subject of comedy pranks on the rest of the class at graduation evening, and since then in a mental hospital, Walter runs away, and is now planning to avenge the insult ,,,, <br /> <br /> in spite of the dark room, it's really just an excuse for many very funny jokes and set of parts. To say too much more would spoil the film, but if you enjoy movies Naked Gun & Jet you will love it, and that other movie offers music cameo Chuck Berry?. Much comedy that deserves a wider audience.
