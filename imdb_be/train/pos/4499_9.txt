This is an exciting story about intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more pleasant to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a clear picture and crisp sound. My only reservation that the plot has some incredible moments, and that some of the strong accents of Manchester is difficult at times. Fortunately, even missing a word here and there will not spoil the fun: the protagonists perfectly cast. Robson Green brings a mysterious smile, go aground, temperament and athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for his boss's wife in the hospital, where he had just started to work. Francesco Ennis is one of the brightest 50-Isha women imaginable; its actions its beauty rivals. (Love scenes between these two show better than words how little age difference is important for them!) Each of the secondary characters are shown sharply and beautifully portrayed as well. The combination of meaningful dialogue and excess hot makes this a wonderful miniseries. Russell Baker noted in his opening remarks, you can not be morally improved by viewing the "Reckless" - but you'll have a lot of fun. (Continued from part of the set DVD box, yet provides a wild hearty two o'clock isolation. You do not want to miss it if you enjoy what it was before.)
