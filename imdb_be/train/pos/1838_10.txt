Waqt is a perfect example of chicken soup for the soul is not exactly. Broth, unfortunately, lost its real taste thanks to all the excessive breeding and side dishes that went into its creation. <br /> <br /> What is surprising and disappointing for Waqt that it comes from the director, who stood aside from the usual cliches of Hindi cinema in his first enterprise, but who gives him a second outlet for all formulas stereotypical films . While Vipul Shah had the conviction to show something as improbable as the blind bank robbery in Aankhen, he just can not induce life throughout the packaging station, which is based on something, how to think like a father-son relationship. Taken from guzharatskoy games Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, Waqt really is a clever story with social message for backup. Mature look at the relationship of father and son, the father's unconditional love for his son and the son's responsibility towards his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who set all their own empire from the ground up is a rich life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son Aditya (Akshay Kumar), never had the need to fight for anything since he got everything in order and spoon-fed life. body care Ishwar has only spoil him all the more. <br /> <br /> Aditya wants to become a superstar, but does nothing to make his dreams come true. At the same time he married his beloved Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible person, but he was disappointed. Aditya is still in its blissful best leading a carefree life. <br /> <br /> tensile strength finally collapses when Ishwar Aditya expels from his house. A sudden change in relation to him a loving father to him and he is now waiting for his wife Aditya partitions. He has no choice left but to seek livelihood of his wife and unborn child. He is becoming a separate person, but the rift between him and his father grows. <br /> <br /> The history of a simplified and uncomplicated script has a very simple approach. It can be easily identified and associated with credible characters like father and son. If you are not one of the two, at least you could meet people as they are somewhere in real life. <br /> <br /> Add to that the ease of handling director Vipul Shah from the script. With a family affair, as any other director in his place would have added tons of melodrama in the production of both cinematic laws of family dramas Bollywood, turning the film into a compulsive sentimental. However, Shah is leading to easy handling of emotions for most of the film. <br /> <br /> The exact example of his unpretentious trends noticeable in the pre-interval scene where the father throws the son from his home in a rather flippant manner. The purpose of the scene is achieved without blotting the brunt on the audience brains. The same applies to the scene in the second half, which is now separated son's father are frivolous conversation. This is what distinguishes Waqt by Kabhi Kushi Rubber or EK RISHTAA and actually puts it a high level in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after all of the points difference, one might ask, where's Waqt is still not able to? The problem is that while Waqt distinguishes itself from others in its league in terms of treatment, it is amenable to glitches in terms of packaging. That the director of speeding up the song-n-dance every now and then in the first half. There's a kind of Johar Shaadi song, Chopra kind of Holi song, father, son Dandia disk song, the song is a dream and a dream come true song induce yawns enough in the viewer. Imagine ... a father just drove his son out of his house, and a son dreams of a song in the Moroccan mountains with his wife. From the place! Crazy! and the audience seat. <br /> <br /> The film is just pulling in the first half and the actual story begins in the second half. The director spent too much on unnecessary items Waqt. Many spoke of the pursuit is not bad dog sequence, but no more than any. However taandav dance Akshay Kumar's ridiculous. Imagine that he has the right to hunt the stars in the film with the (unintentionally) hilarious acting. Add to this a lot in the final climax of hunting stars, where the son is bursting with emotions. It is so archetypal! In addition, the editing pattern can be reversed to hide the reason for his father's change of attitude towards his son. <br /> <br /> Well Malik music is excellent, although there is no need to work. The camera-work SANTOSH Thundiiayil is competent enough, though not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia came with a good dialogue for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Iran and Bohm Razhpal Yadav make or light moments in the film is very effective. While Razhpal Yadav had to go overboard with his comic theatricality in many films off late, this time it detract from his character and completely discreet. His cold expression perfectly complimented with over-the-top theatrics in Boma. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah is convincing in the role of mother. Should not be taken as a reprimand, but it is flawless in both the game and the "looks" of her character. Priyanka beautiful and fulfilling its role well. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main deserves applause are Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is particularly expressive in the scene where he was a doting father intentionally berates him, to make him aware of his responsibilities. While Bachchan are a bit dramatic in a pair of scenes, his brilliance strikes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In summary, the station, like soup, the ingredients of which is tasty and healthy, but the final recipe is something ISN Â»t so appetizing.
