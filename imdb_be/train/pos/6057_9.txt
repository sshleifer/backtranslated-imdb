Of course, because it is super strange sound and imagery, it is an excellent home theater "show" disk, but it's also a touching drama, as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that are interwoven throughout the film will keep all interested spectator. Young, old, boys and girls alike will find that deep down we are all fans of the car, especially high performance Indy car, which are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. Soundtrack by Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder perfectly matched to the visual and content. I do not want to give away the ending, but the final sequence of driving Quincy Jones "Days Like This" just can bring tears to the eyes. Rejoice!
