I saw this movie on TV late at night years ago, but it was a disturbing experience that has stayed with me to this day <br /> <br /> preconditions may seem a bit banal -. Due to the earthquake, hidden underground store toxic nerve agent in a small town above the hills are broken, and a trace amount of a substance, finds its way into their food. Residents of the city are beginning to lose its ability to exercise restraint every whim and desire foundation, Vita through our minds from time to time, and we usually know that we just do not have to act on. <br /> <br /> the pace of the film is slow, but for me it just added to the creeping unease as citizens behavior begins to unravel slowly. There are some very disturbing and surreal scenes that remained in my memory all the time. <br /> <br /> This raises interesting questions about what we might be able, if we succumb to our wildest instincts. Do I like it? I'm not sure what "fun" is the right word. Does it makes me think? Determined. I still think about it. Scary stuff.
