You know, this film is not so great, but I mean, come on, it's about an angel who helps a baseball team. I found the storyline to be cheerful in any case, the father of the child said that he will take it back, when the Angels win the pennant (because he knows that they will not) Kid begs him to fake God to help the Angels win, God It helps continuously (with the help of an angel by Christopher Lloyd, RIP), and in the end, his father does not take it back and went on his motorcycle right that children face. It is a fun, yet Danny Glover does not accept it, and this one. <br /> <br /> I think the advantage is that the old lady was left alone to die with her stitchin 'projects and its history. A real winner here, but God. Because later he got a job as a writer for many lottery show. <br /> <br /> In the film, the children, he gets 7. The blind film about the secret, stupid faith and nature "of God," he gets 10.
