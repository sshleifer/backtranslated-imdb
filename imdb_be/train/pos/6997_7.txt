One thing is for sure ... you do not watch this movie if you are having a bad day. The story is based on the sad event and well worth a character that has to live with sin that he could not cope. The history of drip fed to you, rather than the usual dumbed down explanation, so that keeps you wondering what's going on. In the end, the point stick together and speeches are meaningful. All the characters were in order, and Smith made another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There's no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked, but if you just take and buy in agony, then it is easier to accept the fact that he decided to do. If you agree or disagree is irrelevant. Journey it takes you on a rather interesting, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> quite good film, which, unfortunately, leaves you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like where you have to think, and not just watch the explosions and fighting.
