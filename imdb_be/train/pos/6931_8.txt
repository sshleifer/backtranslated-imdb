Prior to 1955, five years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann completed six films together, the four of them westerns. Their connection was evident from the start, and that was conceived as little more than a Universal progrmmer became like a cult classic. Buff period will revel in the fact that the former were more than ten well-known names on loans - not counting Ray Teal or "Anthony" Curtis, who later became a Tony. Maybe ten years later, "psychological" Western is well entrenched, but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab in a mixture with Cain and Abel, not to mention the decision of a number of other issues along the way, and continue to provide regular Western on surface and full credit to all concerned. One to add to your DVD collection.
