It's a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes), but he had a lot of famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words, a lot of ground to cover. <br /> <br /> It was a soap-operish times, but had some visually dramatic moments and capped off the locusts attack at the end of the film. It was amazing to watch. Given this movie about 70 years, the crew of special effects in this film did a poor job. <br /> <br /> Paul Munio and Luise Rainer was cast award in their day, and they do not disappoint here, and gives strong performances. The only problem is trust, like all Asians play Caucasions and some of them, Walter Connolly, just do not look real. I would like to see a remake of this film with all Asian actors, rather than the PC reasons, but simply to make the story look and sound more believable.
