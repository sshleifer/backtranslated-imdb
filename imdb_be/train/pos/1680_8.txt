Well made and stylish at the same time, finally understanding this thriller will work best for Giallo fans not interested in the genre than later entries Argento that go overboard in all directions. <br /> <br /> For those who like these crazy Italian thrillers, they will appreciate George Hilton and turns it takes character and the fact that he put later. The camera-work is fresh Tir graphic violence and odd, but appropriate selection and entirely inflated score as well. The less you know about the history, the better, to make it work. <br /> <br /> The only thing lacking in the preservation of this matter, a large Sergio Martino directed Giallo, that history does not have that extra sexual or psychological or both, to put it over. This is a routine mystery, the characters are well defined, but to live or die on the plot is not in accordance with their own advantages and disadvantages. <br /> <br /> The recent DVD (2005) Release a beautiful view and is definitely the way to see a movie, if they never get art house screenings, which seems unlikely.
