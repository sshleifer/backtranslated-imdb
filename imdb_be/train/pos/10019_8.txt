When it comes to movies that I can be very picky, and I will complain about anything and everything that is done properly. While each film has its flaws, The Night Listener was extremely low cost. <br /> <br /> If you've read the last review (it was difficult, since half of them were written in large letters, and it does not contain any factual information about the film), you may be led to believe that this film is not It was too good. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in the same overview, you discovered the cause of this author for contempt. He / she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or smokes crack brigade ... apparently) <br /> <br /> Thus, despite the fact that I've never written a review before, I thought that this film deserves one based on its merits, rather than sexual orientation of its director. Let's look at a brief list of the first: 1. Large plot? Absolutely. I will not give it away a bit, but the plot is very attractive, and certainly not what one would expect on the basis of advertising. It's a thriller, horror Sun, and it should be approached as such. The story is really impress you, even more so because it is true (and the plot so stay very true to the actual events). <br /> <br /> 2. Excellent responsibilities? Oh, yes. Robin Williams has long been freed from the shackles of comedy casting type, and since then it has flourished in serious roles, for which many people have written to him from just a decade ago. He once again reaches the higher form in his role Listener night, playing the radio, which is becoming more and more excited and confused when ... well, I'll let you see for yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent direction? Of course. Now, unlike other poster, to which I say, I actually know something about the direction. I sutdying art direction at the school now for 3 years. Of course, I do not think that makes a lick of difference (the only thing that matters is if you like the direction of), but I thought I should just install again, I basing my opinion here on how significant and attitude. .. for example :. Sun director of sexual orientation (or presumed drug habits of the production team, LOL) <br /> <br /> direction of Patrick Stettner was moody and dark, and he allowed the corners and lighting to help create those so sought-after feeling of "tension and release "but not dirty, the camcorder's fast-paced work and quick cuts we so often are exposed today. Some people can really show you a story through the camera, while the feelings of others as if they have to make history with the camera. I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to simply use the camera as it is supposed to use that as an eyeball, through which we see everything. <br /> <br /> 4. The lighting, cinematography and editing? Excellent all around. I have written so much, and I could go on about those last three things for another ten points, so I'll just wrap it up. <br /> <br /> In short, go see this movie. Do not listen to people who have alterior motives trashing it, especially if they are so stupid that they unwittingly reveal that the motive 1/4 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show! -Ben
