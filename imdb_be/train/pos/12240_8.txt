If you're the kind of person looking for a realistic film, or one with a strong and believable storyline, this movie is not for you. Neo - you will hate. However, for those who love the sweet, slightly eccentric comedy, then you will have a good time watching this little film. <br /> <br /> Tony Randall works in the IRS, and he explores a very good farmer who never realized that it is necessary to submit an income tax return. However hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is thrilled to have a company. They dote on him and treat him like one of the family ... and there are plans to obtain it tied to his daughter, Debbie Reynolds. It's really all the story there. But the film gets high marks for a fun script and a decent action. Really good little curiosity from the end of the 1950s.
