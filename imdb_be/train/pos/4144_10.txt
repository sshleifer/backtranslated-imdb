For some time I was caught in a trap, where I discovered that watching independent and foreign films and lie to myself that I loved them. Thick passing buses is an exception. It's true. It is the best 'bad' movie ever. <br /> <br /> Â«harmfulness" of this film seems to come naturally. Halfway through the opening monologue of Satan, the word "hell" is at the bottom of the screen. Glamor Brigitte unshaven man in a wig and thrift clothing store. It takes an eccentric pair that keeps trying to score one ever friend to go down the stairs. Jesus goes to funk soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In any case, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost their possessions for advising project lords film. But sincerity is how bad it is, what makes it so great. It seems that the creators knew it would be bad, but never forced him. <br /> <br /> Do not be duplicated at a loss, fatty delivers. Very highly recommended.
