Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, the Rostov Ripper, who killed 52 people in 8 years of age, mostly women and children. It shows, as a result prevents the Soviet bureaucracy has been difficult to investigate crimes. This makes the work of such a brilliant way that he will not leave, no one untouched. In the beginning it may be a bit slow pace, but it really grabs you as the story unfolds. I can only say that next to "Silence of the Lambs", it is certainly the best film about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to say which actor performance stands above the rest in this film. Stephen Rea is really brilliant, as an inexperienced medical examiner, who is responsible for the investigation. the performance of Donald Sutherland, as it is cynical, above, and the only person in the Russian government is ready to help him, as excellent as Rea years. and what about Jeffrey DuMann, playing a serial killer? DuMann brilliantly I created a character that causes compassion, not hate. Yes, he's a monster, but he is also a sad figure, an oppressed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his colleagues ... He was tortured, embarrassed and extremely vicious. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the well-made docu-drama where the actors are still more important than special effects. He deserves at least 9/10, maybe even more, if you ask me.
