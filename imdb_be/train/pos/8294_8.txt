This movie has great action scenes. Now it is true that the actor is a little rough. But if I wanted to see a movie based on the acting, I would watch the movie stuff Like American Beauty. But if you want to watch a movie with the true martial arts in it, and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air, like many movies around now kills over a matrix. Then watch this. Now, it is true, the two main stars in the show, where as a child to show the power of Ranger and another member of the pronunciation of the show was a bit part in the film. But wait, the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li p ** S pants. And tricks worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit and admire the metal.
