I've seen a slew of '80s shimmering horror "over the years, from the debris as" Terror on Tours "ridiculously fun gems as" bachelorette party Massacre 2 "Some way I managed to keep it to put a one-time, which is strange, because this is probably the most popular and got one. Well, I finally caught up with him, and this is easily the best of this terrible mainly (but almost always to conquer!) Subgenre. The plot (which was largely filmed in the movie «Black Roses») refers to the discrepancy mulleted named Eddie, who ridiculed everything in his high school, his taste in music. He loves 80s metal, especially his idol Summit Tek (play at the end of the big Tony Fields.) After Semy killed Eddie favorite radio DJ gives him the final entry in Saoy. After Eddie plays recording backwards, he discovers that he is a little harder, and bad things start to happen with those who mock him. Does music Saoy in? "Trick or Treat» well done and a total hoot. The special effects are awesome, even if it does feature typical 80s laser beams. I grew up in the 80s, and while I was not a fan of heavy metal music, I remember the urban legend about playing records backwards to hear the sound of Satan worship. Ha-ha! I also remember being told by my elder brothers and neighbors who, like the KISS, Ozzy and worship Satan, so it is very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio DJ and anti-rock priest. If I saw this film as a child! While the film seems to make fun of popular communication in the 80 years between the alleged devil worship and heavy metal, the viewer never knows exactly why Sammy Teck back from the dead, who created chaos and murder, who gets in his way . This is the weakest point of the film, but if you can not help but notice that this is a load of fun.
