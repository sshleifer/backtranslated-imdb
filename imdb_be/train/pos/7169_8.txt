Typically, the "children" of the film have some irritating quality to it that makes it very juicy and unbearable for someone over 13. But then again, that before Holes hit the scene. Of course, he has the same moments, which often give the film his children above qualities, but this film does a good job to stay away from such conventions. The acting was decent, and the restless dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other tourists were more realistic than most movies try to portray. What I particularly liked was the fact in this film that the film did not try to break your heart or make you cry. Emotional strength was a little more natural than most would imagine, like as The Shawshank Redemption, in many ways (who also have a similar hole, redeeming ending to it). The only down side? The fake looking lizard. In general, however, 8/10.
