I must say that I wanted to see this movie for a long time, and I was not disappointed. Actions Dominic Monaghan is fantastic. As part of insomnia myself, I can relate to how the story develops. I have never experienced anything like this, but a few moments of waking dream overlaps, and it can be scary. It was a great film, worth every penny. I hope one day I can work with Tess herself, it would be an honor and abroad. I can recommend it to everyone. Maybe not small children as they may be frightened. But if you are insomnia, like me, you'll understand the world of mystery and fear. You'll love it. <br /> <br /> F.
