I first saw this video 15 years ago. I thought it was great then and I still do. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and lover of English romantic poetry as Coleridge rates high with me. Anything that can detract from the beauty of poetry and the power of stories will not get my vote advantage. In this case, it works well to attract viewers, especially high school students. This history is well illustrated for the generation that grew up on television. In addition, the voice of Michael Redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and power to him. Okay, so it was not a big budget for the project. So this is not Star Wars, and no CGI in it. But who can dismiss Dore illustrations in the framework of the presentation? Note above that in just four lines dismisses video, like a piece of trash, is extremely unfair and slow wits. I am a producer, but it is not my reason for this comment. Most likely, I defend the work of artistry, which I think is important at all levels. He is well suited to bring a poem by Coleridge students in a way that evokes gratitude and this arouses sympathy for the lesson, which gives an ancient mariner.
