I had the honor to see this film at the Film Festival Rotterdam Intenational. <br /> <br /> «Xizhao» or "souls" is $ 200,000 lowbudget film about a father and his 2 sons. Father has a traditional bath somewhere in the traditional Chinese village, where local, mostly men aged, come to relax and go for a swim. Father the son: and the "retarded" son who lives with him and his son, who lives in a big modern city, and who comes to visit him. For this son of a traditional village, sauna and "retarded" brother, seem strange and annoying, but it varies according to the movie. <br /> <br /> While the story may seem like a cheese or a cliché, it's not. With very high performances, especially parents and "late" son (sorry, I do not know their names), and a large cinema history was touching and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see this film to make. This is a great alternative to mainstream Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br />
