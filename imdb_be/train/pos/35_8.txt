When I saw the DVD box-designed for this and the terrible figures of Red Queen, I was sure I was in a big disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I loved it. Corrugated nonsense, of course, unforgivable that such a complex separation must be rushed to the point of almost being able to read subtitles, not to mention take a ridiculous explanation. These quibbles apart, however, the film is a dream. A fabulous house in a fabulous dress in beautiful settings, all in constant motion and is accompanied by an excellent account of Bruno Nicolai. It can not be Morricone, but these lighter parts of it may also be true. Really nice with lots of colors, lots of sexuality, some massacres and minimal police intervention. Super.
