This is not a film critic, but rather to comment on how we are blind to our past. <br /> <br /> I recently watched parties and judicial truth, like watching a remake or sequel-- except that it was about Iraq, and not in Vietnam. It looks like the Party because of its one-sided message, both films show how joyfully hasten to participate in the conflict, based on false grounds, and to allow our young and bold (and often naive) to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering. Both the film effectively shows that the mentality is injected into the minds of young and willing to make them effective killing machines, but training falls sorely lacking teaching diplomatic and policing skills needed to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they supposedly fight. This ultimately is what lost the war in Vietnam, and is likely to lose the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the movie is so one-sided that could easily be passed off as a left-wing propaganda. Not me, mind you, but those who seek to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced view would speak to a wider audience.
