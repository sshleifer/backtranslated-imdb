This is not a bad film. It follows the new conventions of the modern horror film that is in the movie, a well-known actress running for their lives in the first scene. This film takes the old agreement psycho killer on the loose it, and manages to do something new and interesting to him. In addition, always nice to see Ringwald back to attack. <br /> <br /> So this may be an example of that genre has become. Cut affects all tracks, and really scary in some parts. I liked it, I gave him eight.
