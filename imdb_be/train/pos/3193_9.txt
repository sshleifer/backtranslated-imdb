Short, who begins the film is real footage about a guy named Gary, apparently, he was taken by accident in the parking lot of television stations, where Gary works in Beaver. Gary a little "different"; it is a simulator and driving an old Chevy named Tara (after Fawcett). And filmmaker receives a letter from Gary after a while, inviting him to return to the Beaver to get some shots of the local talent competition, he has put together, including the stunning Performace Harry Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh, my. Two shorts that go Story Gary, the same one you have just seen, only the first is represented by Sean Penn and second Crispin Glover under the name «Orkly Kid». If you're in the mood to make fun of someone is definitely a movie to watch. I doubled over laughing through most of them, especially the performance Crispins, which can certainly stand on its own. When it was over, I had to rewind the tape to once again see the real Gary and all his shining idiocy. Although Olivia was in the spotlight, I would like to see one of the "fictitious" short take a stab at Barry Manilow Gary embodiment, whic h was just ridiculous.
