This movie was a classic. I would like to say that this film caught the best of the working man who learns from his mistakes. if we are all together and learn how everything in this film made. It was an important part which shows how the family is an important part of life, and how pride can make you lose something important in life when we can not find Â«BIG Throat" and swallow pride.
