I'm from Belgium, so my English writing is quite poor, it is a pity that ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those little-known films, plays only once on television and what seems to disappear into the air, I Views my collection of old VHS video and came across this title, I looked it up, and it was the IMDb score more than 7/10, it's pretty decent. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that it is very good with the film, and that is why I am puzzled. This is the only film made by the director of this ...? How could he have not done a lot of movies, then a pretty good one ...? Someone with a lot of potential to be forced to make another film, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would really like to see him pull his act together and make another good movie like this one, please .....?
