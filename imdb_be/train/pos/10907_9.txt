I was flipping around the TV and HBO showed a double blow to the incredibly terrible disease, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey, that looks like fun," - really, I love documentaries - so we started to look at. At first I thought that Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but it turned out that because of his condition, he never went through puberty, hence, a high voice and a smaller enclosure. He was on a crusade to raise money for their cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a great sense of spirituality ... I cried watching another, laughed, got up to get another towel, then cried again. After Jonni Kennedy "the time is up," he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he learned his lessons from this life, and he was free. I highly recommend it. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.
