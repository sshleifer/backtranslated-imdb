It is not Michael Jordan <br /> <br /> Think of all the amazing NBA players whose careers lights dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth. Their names can work as easily from the mouth of the public, like Russell, Coase, Bird, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, the list goes on; but the volume gets turned down a bit, for the Stockton and Malone, Charles Patrick and all the other great players who always lost headers Michael. <br /> <br /> I've seen it written that career Gretchen Mol in pylale in light of the cover article in 1998 issue of Vanity Fair, who predicted the inevitable superstar for Ms. Mol. Later it was said that she was more bloated. I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that for some time after I saw "The Devil's Advocate" in '97 or '98, I would get confused, which she played Mary Ann Lomax. Was it or Mol Theron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was the one in "2 Days in the Valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol was in "Donnie Brasco," "Celebrity" and "Rounders.» <br /> <br /> By the time I saw the "thirteenth floor »(Mol) and" Sweet November "(Theron), I pretty much had them in order, but I still put them in the same box of mental file. Both were very talented and had a sweet face, these types of body, short blond hair, and so on. <br /> <br /> Theron, however, it was suggested more work. I loved her as Sarah Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was downright horrible. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the "Monster" was released and from that moment until the transmission of the Oscars, all filmdom knew who "Best Actress" award will be. And deservedly so! Theron was Wuornos. The only way to get a clearer idea of ​​what the real Wuornos made teak will somehow reproduce the digital video head Selby closed in. And for a major talent to make themselves physically unattractive! unheard of! <br /> <br /> then in 2005 year's "The Notorious Bettie Page" was released. Mol speech was unusual. Maybe she stood in the shade Ms. Theron. It was like a ballroom for the victory celebration for losing presidential candidate, no one came, and no one cared. It is seen as a continuation of the old fairy tales, once promising actress with reduced career does Nudie part in the «B» movie. Ho hum! No, no, no! Wrong! No matter what you may think about the film (and I love the movies of the fifties), if you miss it you're missing one of the best performances of the year. Ms. Moll was as much as Bettie Ms. Theron was Eileen. Unfortunately, Eileen, a publicity film, the more sympathetic character. For some reason, immoral, a sociopath murderer less uncomfortable for us than the naive, simple-minded, uninhibited, religious women, the most capital crime was to live her life fully trusting and completely exposed. Bettie Page was one of the symbols of the fifties. Her photographs and movies never sexy, never pornographic, but it is presented as almost a caricature of all things curly. There was not any sense of realism, only a parody. Ms. Moll captured the essence of the character. She got 20 pounds to add some excellent it is usually slender figure and when she posed for photographers in a variety of film, her body was Bettie-x. Her full frontal absence of any constraints exactly fit all that has been published about Betty. Cinematic nudity usually reflects eroticism or sexuality. In this film all about innocence. Seeing Gretchen / Bettie nude I did not want to jump her, but instilled a desire to protect her from the horrors that people can inflict on one another. If you pass on this film, you will be missing one of the best performances of recent years. By the way, shame on the MPAA for giving this rating R.
