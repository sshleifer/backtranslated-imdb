This movie is a great way for the series is finally over. Peter (boy with puppeteer III) is all grown up and now the puppet master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppet and learn the secrets of Toulon, but instead she listens to the story of the dolls. Most of the film footage of the Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III of, Puppet Master 4 Puppet Master 5 Curse of the Puppet Master and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... But I believe that Paramount would not allow them to use scenes from 1). Personally, I want to puppeteer Vs. Demonic Toys, finally, will be made, but the way the movie ends, they are basically saying, "This is the final film in the series ..."
