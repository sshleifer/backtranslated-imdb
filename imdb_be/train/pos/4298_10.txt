This film is awe me so much that I watch it at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find it empowering. And I always find the nature of human and real. This is a film that shows you the gritty reality of life in Los Angeles, since repeating helicopter searchlights scanning for danger, hidden so close to a normal life is carried out on the characters. In addition, a film that shows how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and give you to make a difference. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, whether intentionally or not, has a powerful impact. I found this film to be a lot like the film Short Cuts Robert Altman. Both had a star-studded roster full cast of actors and actresses, and both films allowed you gradually see how the characters relate to each other and influence each other, for better or worse. Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message (of hope in the face of the desperate reality) than the film Altman, though I found both of them are intriguing in their own way. This movie is definitely a must see !!!
