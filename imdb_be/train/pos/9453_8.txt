Deliverance is an exciting, driven, and sometimes disturbing tale of James Dickey, it turned into a brilliant film by John Boorman. It is about four businessmen, courageous and moving Mego-behavior that you spend in a canoe off in the mountains. There, they are confronted with the dark side of every man and every kind of the worst of human suffering ... poverty, sodomy and even physical violence! These four men intended to travel on the river adventure and risk, but their trip soon turns into a violent odyssey through the hidden and mountain land, completely alienated from all forms of civilization. All of these elements actually make Eliminating one of the most horrific films I've ever seen. Just about everything that is happening with these people, you pray that you will never find yourself to be in a similar situation. Net talking movie, Deliverance is a very important film, as well. John Boorman best (closely follows Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very powerful film, and it contains several memorable scenes, which are already signs in countless other films. Ponder stunning "dueling banjos" score and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual "squeal like a pig" rape scene. All the actors Deliver (haha) committed acting performances. Especially Jon Voight. Should see a picture of the movement !!
