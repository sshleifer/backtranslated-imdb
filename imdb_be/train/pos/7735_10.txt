Great interpretation of the novel by Jim Thompson, is a neo-noir thriller has all the necessary elements - crazy ex-boxer turned tramp, alcoholic widow with sinister desires, ex-cop turned petty swindler and steal portion for death. Nevertheless, the film never crosses the country in the clich√©, but remains fresh and intriguing. Performances all great, especially the role of Bruce Dern as an evil sleazeball, Uncle Bud. There is intense uncertainty in the movement of the film, which, intentionally or not, added to a grim proceedings. Highly recommended.
