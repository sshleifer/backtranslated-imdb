When I saw the animation for the first time (I was 15, maybe) I was really impressed! It has a completely different style compared to Japan's animation and I kind of like it any more. Tho general impression of the movie more sinister and dark colors ... not ... colorous. Characters do not speak a lot, no long and boring conversations this and that (as in Ghost in the Shell) .With his dark paintings kinds of strange animals and a sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient Scandinavian stories full of violence and heinous creators, fascinated by forests and deep caves, they lived dragons, throlls, orcs ... and one mysterious hero to stop evil ...
