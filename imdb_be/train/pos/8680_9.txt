Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer really lost a player on a short animated film market. This market is largely dominated by Looney Tunes Looney Tunes shorts and coming from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able to release the hidden gems as "the spring", an amazing story about the most beautiful time of the year. <, Br /> <br /> In the environment shown here, spring is not due to natural cycles, but fabricated. And who? According to a small male elf living underground. Every spring, when the snow begins to melt, they begin to work. They start cutting rainbow rock columns, then reducing them to rubble and use the locks to make it to the color of the liquid, which will move to the ground and taking herbs, flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the cartoon reflects the production of spring, but the second part is a little different. Old Winter is back, and he is trying to extend the winter, destroying the work of elves. So from this point, we are helping in the fight between the elves and Old Man Winter. <br /> <br /> Music is heard perfectly delicious. Melodious part sticks in your head like paint spots on a paper sheet. The second part of the melody of the waves, and they are great with the action. It is simply FANTASTICO, Giorgio! Animation sequences are also pleasure. Colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown in a solid, Epic medium. The concept itself is brilliant. Elves draw characters, so Father Winter, which effectively reflects the cold and merciless sense of white season. <br /> <br /> There is a strong message included here. The battle seems lost for the elves in the end, to one end of the elves come jump into action, and this leads to the victory of the Elves during the winter. Thus, the point: only one person can make a difference <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "the spring" great lost classic short cartoon era .. What's even more remarkable is that the director of this cartoon made its debut here. And who is "the spring" Director's Cut? This is some kind of William Hanna ...
