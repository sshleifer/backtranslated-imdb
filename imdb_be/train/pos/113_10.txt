I have not seen this movie for about 5 years, but he still will not let me live. <br /> <br />, is one that I seem to always mention first when asked about my favorite movies. There are certain movies (works of art, like the film "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch a place inside of you, a place well protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make lifelong impression on the viewer, not unlike changing life events, such as the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This film is "shook" me when I first saw it. He left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
