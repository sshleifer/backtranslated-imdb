That is very French about this film is the time required to create the two leading characters. This may require a bit of patience, especially since none of them "attractive" in the typical definition of Hollywood. However, after the "Robbery" beats, the film rushes forward quickly, perhaps too quickly sometimes. But it's a real roller coaster ride, and if you get too close does not look all very plausible. Kind of movie that you know Hollywood would spoil up.
