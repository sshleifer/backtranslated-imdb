I must admit that I was basically lost during the first hour or so of the film. There was some slightly amusing humor, but at best a skeletal plot and a general feeling of meaninglessness, which was on the verge of making me think that I'm wasting my time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I enjoyed it. There was no moment of blinding realization and not suddenly a dramatic scene that grabbed me. In fact, nothing happens, it is very interesting in the whole film. It was like I just suddenly realized that the film had to be largely meaningless - and that, in its pointlessness has its charm <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman starred in the role of a nameless actor who finds ". small project "to jumpstart his career. He will play a supermarket manager and spending the day in the vicinity of the supermarket, to examine the role. There he meets and due to Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - cashier, who wants more out of life. He helps her prepare for the interview, as if she auditioned for the role, while she introduces him to the real life. It's really funny to watch "his" (for this purpose, as a symbol is identified in the credits) to be overwhelmed by the visit to the local target store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were great together, a strange but plausible kind of combination of romantic, but the father-daughter chemistry. If you get lost in the beginning, stick with it. In the end, it turns out perfectly magical film. 7/10
