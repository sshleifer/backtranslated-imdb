Steve and Jane try to warn the police and residents, but no one believes in them, while the blob will absorb a lot of people, it becomes more and more. <br /> <br /> Â«Drop" and the cult classic science fiction, This is a low-budget film with many actors and actresses ham (with the exception of Steve McQueen), terrible consequences, but also excellent and very good, but very funny. This is the first time I see a classic (I've seen in the remake of the 1988 Kevin Dillon), and I highly recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and sci-fi B-movies from the 50s. The film is the subject of my review of the number of 1,400 could not be better. . My vote is seven <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ( "Drop")
