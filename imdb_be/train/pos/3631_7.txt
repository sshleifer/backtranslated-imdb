The film actually has a pretty good story, but linked in several key areas. It's almost as if the director cast the movie together, without spending the time to make some significant cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a pretty decent job in her role ... but something is clearly not enough of a few key scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5 hours the film could be reduced to about 2 hour movie. And, perhaps, it would be much better if the film did not have the feeling, as if he had been thrown together. <br /> <br />
