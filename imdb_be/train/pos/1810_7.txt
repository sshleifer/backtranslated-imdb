I can understand why some people like this movie, and why some people do not. For me, though, I really like, even if I noticed that some of the good bits and the not so great bits. Animation was really great, like a dream, Charlie. Characters were mixed bag, being better Anne-Marie, at the end of voiced Barcelona. (I was physically sick when I read what happened to it) In addition, Carface is very convincing villain, especially voiced by Vicki Teybeka excellent (I especially loved the "I'm surrounded by idiots idiots") and together with Rasputin and Warren T. Rat, perhaps the most memorable of all the villains Don Bluth. Charlie and Itchy only lacked the spark, but I loved the king Gator and his song. Some of the film is very intrusive, like Annabel "you can never come back", which is like me scares until now. Unfortunately, some of the bits I did not like so much. The story was tendency to clumsy and absent-minded, but Disney's The Black Cauldron was suffering from the same problems. There were also some dark scenes that young children would find upsetting, but the ending is very bitter. However, the biggest drawback was a rather soft songs and they sang. None including, in particular, do not stick out, with the exception of "Let's Make Music together" and "Love survives" and Burt Reynolds can not sing and Dom DeLuise did much better singing. All in all, watchable movie that could have been more, but certainly memorable and I would definitely watch it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
