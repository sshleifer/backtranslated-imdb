I've never seen it on TV, but rented a DVD through Netflix, as soon as I learned that he was available. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. It's funny and the animation is beautiful. This level of quality I would expect only from a feature film, so I was surprised by some of the bad comments on it. Maybe the DVD release has improved animation? One bonus to the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I'm a grown man, and I appreciate that it is for adults. It is not only children who love cute animated character. It is not "obscene", as some claim, but I can see where some parents do not want their young children to see him. I am very disappointed that it was canceled. I want them to produce more episodes. Or perhaps a movie.
