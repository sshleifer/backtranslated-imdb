This is a very, very early in the Bugs Bunny cartoon. As a result, the character is still in the transition - it is not drawn as extended as it was later, and his voice is not quite true. Furthermore, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs little unusual. Elmer some poor sap who buys a pet shop Bugs - no gun or desires for its part, to blow the rabbit into pieces! However, despite this, it is still very enjoyable film. Early Mistakes were definitely more blatant and rigid than his later incarnation. In later films, he tangled with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and the others, because they started - they messed up with the rabbit. But in this film, it is much more like Daffy Duck in the late 30's and early 40-ies - the jerk who just likes to annoy other !! A true "anarchists" instead of the hero of the latest cartoons. Although it is not among the best Bugs Bunny cartoons, it sure is fun to watch and fun to see how it has changed over the years.
