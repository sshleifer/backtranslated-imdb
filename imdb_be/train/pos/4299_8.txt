Your video store, you can find this gem. <br /> <br /> human condition in our time LA. A lot of exaggerated drama, just break event that can happen to any group of people for a long time. <br /> <br /> do not help you to understand the joy and despair of urban life. <br /> <br /> The direction and cutting the upper class. Cinema and music are very particular about the mood and situation. AND CAST !!! <br /> <br /> Excellent casting and excellent acting. Not one off or out of character. HN <br /> <br /> And it's actually not so much anti-depressant, as one would expect. I gave it a 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> If you do not see, DO!
