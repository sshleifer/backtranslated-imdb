Steve Carell has made a career with drawing a little odd straight guy, the first on «The Daily Show», and then in various supporting roles. As of Virgin, Karel found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Karel plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who lives in a quiet, solitary life. Andy bit strange, but in an awkward good guy like that way. One night, while communicating with co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally discovers that he is a virgin. His staff, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) is initially tease Andy about his situation. But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for the worthy man, Andy, and they decide to help him, helping him to terminate his virginity. And so begins the search for Andy adulthood. Andy is the quintessential innocent, and most of the humor comes from its naivety in situations he finds himself throughout the film. Some of the humor of gross output of crude thing, but most of them is brilliant smart comedies. In addition, I found some parts of the film is actually a very touching how Andy feels the development of both romance and friendship, perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the film as a love story or drama; is rolling in their seats comedy. However, every good comedy I have ever seen has enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be «The Wedding Crashers» from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar sense of humor, but perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of his jokes. I especially loved the ending of the film, which I thought was the perfect way to finish the film. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of "Something About Mary." Very easy and fun; it leaves you laugh and smile, what you need to feel when you are done comedy. I would highly recommend.
