Every now and then a film advertises itself as scary or scared, even though they usually do not. Most modern horror films fit into this category. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are those films that not only cause stress and adrenaline to pump your veins is more difficult than usual. They actually scares you to a level you've never experienced. <br /> <br /> «Halloween» a film. It takes so many risks that would make most manufacturers juggle movies. But almost all of them work. "Halloween" is impressive in its simplicity and terrible in general. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting some children on Halloween night, while the madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental hospital after brutally killing his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, crazy, later known as Michael Myers, begins to kill the local population adolescence, and in the end he comes after Laurie. <br /> <br /> It sounds familiar, does not it? Just another brainless slasher filled stupid teenagers and a great lot of gore. . Nha chance <br /> <br /> I think that James Berardinelli puts it all in his review of "Halloween": "Because of its name, Halloween is often grouped together with all the other movies splash inhabiting theater on the whole territory of the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, while Halloween is considered to be the father of modern slasher genre, it is not a member of the ... »<br /> <br /> He has a point, for a number of reasons. In the first place, it's horrible, while most of the entries in the teen genre shredder mute Gore-holidays (possible would argue that many recent are mocking, but most of them are not able to as well). Secondly, there is almost no violence (very little bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary, and it belongs to the very few on it (in fact, the number of the body is quite low). In fact, one could argue that this is not really a horror movie, at least not by today's standards, with the highest number of deaths that can be killed in one film, each gorier and more sadistic than in the past. It draws on ideas for scares and skills. Third, while some of the characters can do stupid things (sometimes sealed their fate), they do not because they are stupid. The characters are real people, so instead of having to think about what the characters are dying because they are idiots, we were afraid, because they make a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why the "Halloween" is a big deal because it's so easy to believe that this is real. Nothing hard to swallow in the film. There is no supernatural, no ridiculously creative story elements, or "inventive" kills, or whatnot. Instead, all of the set and the camera (except for the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just set the camera on the ground and says the action. What do we get the feeling that we are actually seeing a murder takes place right in front of us. <br /> <br /> horror, perhaps, the most difficult films to do, because in order to do something terrible, everything must be perfect, and ideas will never work twice. It's a hit or miss game, so if I tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter (which I do not), they seem to be primitive (especially since they were repeated with little effect again and again over the years). <br /> <br /> Speaking here is not a plus point because it is not necessary. This is a film about the terrible ideas, not a film about the dramatic conflict of the characters. Actors act like real people, not characters from history. Nothing more. The exception is the one who plays shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary to people do not say anything, but simply to kill, but it's hard to pull off (and even harder to keep people from asking why). But the guy pulls it off, and a terrible result. <br /> <br /> This is a film Carpenter through. He sent his co-wrote it, co-produced and wrote a chilling account of this. It shine people and his later film «The Thing» supports this assertion, although it's not as scary as "Halloween." Unfortunately, his success is drastically reduced, as is the case when the lure of big money for less freedom benefited with large manufacturers time "recognizes their potential." As well as this movie is not without flaws. Known for the opening scene is a concern, but not very scary. And not a lot of panic run on the first part of the film. This does not mean that it's bad, it's just that there is no reason to fear «The Shape." Fortunately, Carpenter mainly uses this time to create a relationship between the characters and the audience. While there is no intimacy in this regard, it is consistent with the objectives. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that this is confusing, when they die. But once the film gets into the Halloween night that if Carpenter kicked things into high gear, and it never stops until you reach the end. <br /> <br /> While the "Halloween" could be spoiled only slightly so. This is a very scary movie, and a must see for those who love horror movies. Keep in mind though, this movie will scare the living hell out of you!
