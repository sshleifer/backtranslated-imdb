A soldier can not have Lucas academy action or special effects, but it certainly makes it for me. I will not tell you what it about, I'm sure you've already read the summary. This is a great doomed futureistic thriller / science fiction film. Kurt Russell does not say anything, he usually has a terrible drone or look on his face, but it corresponds to the character. There is a lot of action and fight scenes; some scenes are unrealistic, but the Hollywood pretend ground that we must have to avoid our normal life. I have not seen a soldier 2, but it's one he's one of my favorites. I was lucky to have a wife who digs on procrastination movie; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who loves a tough guy / sci-fi movies.
