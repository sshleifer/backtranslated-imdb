Zane and Boehringer will keep you on the edge of your seat. I do not usually go for the military / war movies, but it's worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was also a sense of humor. Boehringer character proved to be heroic and honest. Regardless of what you do not know what he got back. <br /> <br /> character Zane developed throughout the film. He was not just a suit, he certainly proved that he could be a hero, and to handle a gun. <br /> <br /> End through me a little, though. It does not really go with the action throughout the film, but I'm glad I saw it, though. <br /> <br /> it's worth checking out.
