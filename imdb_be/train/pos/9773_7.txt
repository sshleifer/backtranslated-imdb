The plot is really terrible, the atmosphere is really depressing, unusual for the production of low-cost, like this, and, at least for the German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, mystical thriller and slasher film are mixed together. Development of the plot and characters are large, many are very close to reality, without the studio atmosphere. This may be an ideal, but unfortunately, some things were a bit disappointing that need not be, as a rule, for low-budget films: <br /> <br /> 1.) Cast sometimes no more than on average, nearly every actor looks like a man in the street. Some of them are doing a good or very good job, but some of them act like bad actors of the German court show! But I was very, very disappointed actor Mathieu career! His actions (through a lot of his old movies, his acting was good) here was below average! But this may be the reason why he is now involved in a bad German soap or soap operas on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) Dialogues sometimes soap opera level. <br /> <br /> 3.) Poor sound, sometimes very difficult to understand what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and was glad he could rewind and hear it again. This is due to a variety of (large facilities, like a hospital or esoteric group) and sometimes strange dialects actors! <br /> <br /> But on the whole, this is an interesting film, worth seeing it, far beyond the commercial films, which are often more terrible.
