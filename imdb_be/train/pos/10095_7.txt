My parents took me to this film when I was nine years old. I will never forget it. I've never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two years old when she made the Elephant Walk) Remember, I'm nine, so that the feelings are not sexy, I just could not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at her feet, like a puppy, and look at her. She began to show its age (she was almost seventy-four), but I still believe it to be one of the most beautiful and exciting women who ever lived. <br /> <br /> I have seen several times in the movie, so and it's juicy melodrama. What saves him, of course, the beauty of Miss Taylor, magnificent scenery, very impressive crush an elephant, and a well-made point of human arrogance in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> In general, good -spent couple of hours, watching a movie channel or rented video.
