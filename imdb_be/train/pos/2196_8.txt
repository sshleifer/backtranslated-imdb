Barbara Stanwyck starred in the original game, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. With star McMurray, probably the most famous "Double Indemnity," with Stanwyck, as well as his popular television show "My Three Sons". Keep an eye on the young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movie) and too fabulous Pangboren Franklin, who filled almost every movie to put on film. Of course, it works in a beauty salon on the ship! Add a sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and clever banter in the beginning. each plays Maggie Ella Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in the "holiday" and «My Man Godfrey». In «Swing High», the tourist meets Maggie soldiers leaving the army. Maggie misses the boat when it leaves port and gets confused with a soldier. Dashing 20 Quinn has a small scene in a local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) playing the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth), and Skid together and try to figure out how to get back to the States. Some good singing Lamour. Good (but short) acts as the performance of Cecil Cunningham «Murph», wise, considerate owner of a local parlor in Panama. While others complained how bad it is, it was not so bad, and even a little exotic, with a fake to the locale setting of Central America in the first half of the film.
