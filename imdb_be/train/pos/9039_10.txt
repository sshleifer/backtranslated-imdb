I grew up in southern West Virginia; I'm about the same age as (or maybe a year older) Homer Hickam, author of Â«The Rocket Boys," a true story book form the basis of this heart warming film. <br /> <br /> I'm so closely linked to the West Virginia Coal threads and a stunning effect of Sputnik was at that time (October 4, 1957) on all of us. Rocket Boys continued to make great life for themselves. I went on to get his degree in physics and computer science. That's because the Sputnik woke up a lot of young people in the "Science" Gap U.S.S.R. was in the US at the time of the Cold War ... <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it will touch the core of your beings <br /> <br /> All :. Get it; look; recommend it to friends ... who will thank you many times.
