I just finished watching Dressed to Kill, which is written and directed by Brian De Palma.the DVD was like «R» rating of unrated version and chose version.i version.since I unrated still to see «R» rated version, I I can not be completely sure difference.there, but very graphic graphic female nudity including scenes of explicit expression of self-satisfaction in this version.i guess you could call this scene a soft core porn.if this kind of thing can hurt you, I would to invite you to view «R» nominal version.but I digress.Any Cams entar here it refers to the unrated version.this this murder mystery / psychological horror / suspense movie.there very little violence and blood.there but one death sequence note.the act of murder rather graphic.however the blood of himself, he does not look real. it reminds us of how 70-slasher look.i to believe that this was done deliberately offset the very act of violence, to give the scene the same budget feel.most la violence, or rather the possibility of this, implied.the film very well paced. as far as I can tell, every scene was the goal, which I find very rare, when couples Compared with many of today's movies. In any case, I also thought that the action was good, especially Angie Dickinson.and Micheal Cane turns quietly understated performance in his role, which works brilliantly in this film case.the also has a big twist to this, in my opinion, although some people might find it predictable.the only complaint (and it's really more observations), I have something that I thought that the character played by Nancy Allen could be fleshed out more, especially given that it has a fair amount of screen time .But I think she does a good job with those items she given.and it really does not take away from the quality film.the film also has a strong moral to it, what is even more important today.but film does not hit you on the head it.I also liked the musical score, composed Pino Dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music of the original Psycho.to me, this music really raised movie.i thought this movie was great. for, me Dressed to kill (1980) is 10/10
