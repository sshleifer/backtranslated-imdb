I myself am a kid at heart, that is, I like to watch cartoons, so far! I remember watching Bugs Bunny, when I was a kid, it was my favorite so far. I thought that the person it was a great "new" shows on television, and what my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching him when I was younger," and I'm like, "Dad, Bugs do not exist when you were younger. " Thus, I believe that it is certainly encouraging for more than a generation, maybe 3. I love the show, it's great for kids and adults, well, everything. It's very funny, my husband and I, in our 20's, I love to watch the show, and we are not against any re-runs. This show back a lot of memories, happy. I love Christmas special also with Tweety's Tiny Tim, it's cute. I can not pick my favorite Looney Toons character since they changed over the years. When I was little, it was errors, of course, and Porky Pig. Pepe's cool, I've always loved it. In fact, I must say that all my favorite. I give this show 10 out of 10 because it is a great show for all ages, very funny voice is incredible, the only drawback is that, unfortunately, came to an end two decades ago, but re-runs great!
