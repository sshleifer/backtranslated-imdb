One would be very exhausted not really evident in the precious stone of the film (and I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies too). The actors are excellent settings, location and environment, deep emotions, reminding, sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite) - it was just wonderful. Element of people (imperfect) also weaves to create some drama and lead story, and allows hearty resolution. Alok Nath such a great actor, so openly with the emotions of characters he paints, he almost steals the show from the young stars. I highly recommend this movie for those who like real songs - those that go beyond the physical beauty of real love - as one of the best movies out there, Hindi or otherwise!
