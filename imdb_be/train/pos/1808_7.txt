All dogs go to heaven animated movie kid, like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and all hell prominently in the plot, and even the kids will get very little adults scratching their heads why this film was made to feel like some kind of gangster film. The film itself is not obvious, in any case, it's just a strange combination to make a film in his childhood on. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog possessing half the casino with her partner Carface (Vicki Teybek). After getting drunk (A dog .... drink ... in the movie baby. It just sounds weird.), Charlie deceive and killed the Carfax. If the sky, he finds a way to return to Earth, but it will no longer be permitted in heaven. He still returns to Earth and meets up with his old friend Itch (Deluiz House), as well as plans for payback Carfax. At the same time, the Carfax has little orphan Anne Marie in captivity because of its amazing ability to talk to all kinds of animals that help to predict the race. Charlie and Itchy release it, and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about myself. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few Disney-nya that will appeal to both children and adults. Children will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation, while the adults will enjoy the pleasant, sweet storyline, and more than usually developed characters. One thing that keeps it down, it's a musical. As a rule, it is a good thing, but the music is frankly awful. They tend to jump around, sounding almost ad libbed, next to which there is no tool support. In fact, this is probably the worst songs I've ever heard in the animated film, but fortunately, the rest of the film is strong enough not to fall apart because of some bad notes. <br /> <br /> At the end of this film works, but I truly hate. It's sad, but happy, but more sad than happy, and makes the film feel the need to continue. Given how poorly done it was a continuation, I would like the ending would not be justified to continue and it would have been wrapped in a beautiful, super happy ending. This is one of the few films that I feel this way about, but I do. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good family film, the odd bargain topics, but nevertheless, good fun. <br /> <br /> My Rating: *** a ****. 85 min. G.
