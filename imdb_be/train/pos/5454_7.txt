This is one of the most daring and important films from the so-called «Pre-Code», made in Hollywood in the 1930s. Unlike some films Pre-code, which is sometimes dabbled in things that would never have been allowed after 1934-5, this film fully immerse themselves in a very dirty even entertaining story from beginning to end. Traditional morality in the late 30's and 40's was definitely not evident in this film, as the film is, in fact, a cunning woman who sleeps her way to the top - and without any apology on the way. This "wide" and enjoyed the sex and used it on every person who could help her to become rich - is that you just never have seen in films made by only two or three years later <br /> <br /> the film begins with. Barbara Stanwyck works in his father's Speakeasy. Besides the fact that her boss, he is also her pimp, and encourages her to sleep with a representative of the local government, so that it will allow illegal bar act with impunity. It is not clear, especially here seems as if dad was "rent" the body of his daughter for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after almost raped and attack the man smashing a beer bottle over his skull, Barbara had enough and head to the big city. It does not hurt that still blew up and killed her father, but her feeling that she was a vicious themselves, and there was nothing to show which was an incentive to move. <br /> <br /> Despite the depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job in a huge mega-bank. It starts on a rather menial work as a clerk, but in a space that seems to be just a few weeks, she sleeps her way from one job to another, to another - until it sleeps with the head of the bank and its future son !!! It all ends in tragedy, but Babs does not seem too shook up about the death of these two men. In fact, after a while, it can insinuate themselves into the life of the new director, and once again it is on top (perhaps more appropriate than one). <br /> <br /> At present, still, it's a great film because it was so rough and repents. Barbara played 100% and a sociopath - a woman with no morals and no conscience - only the desire to squeeze as much out of life, it could not have with anyone she hurt in the process. However, brave writers and producer of "afraid" and thought it was important that the tack on the end of life. Given that this woman was so evil and insidious, her change of heart in the end was a big disappointment and distracting from the film. In many ways, it reminded me of the end of Jezebel - once again, an evil man in some way to "see the world" and the changes in the not too convincing conclusion <br /> <br /> My advice. try looking red-haired woman and down. Red-haired woman is very similar to a child's face, but there is no magical transformation in the end - the leading lady really deep skunk! At the bottom, the film is very similar to the redhead woman, the roles are reversed, and the person (John Gilbert) played the same insidious character. Both classic and a little better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome curiosity is often a short period of ultra-sleazy Hollywood films, and in this light, it is worth a look for moviegoers. In addition, fans of the Duke to take note of - John Wayne plays a very small role in the film, and it is very unusual to see a very young Wayne plays the traditional role.
