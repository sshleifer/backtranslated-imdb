It's a good family show with a large cast of actors. This is a good break from the reality show blitz late. There's nothing else quite like it on TV right now or if you do not consider Joan of Arcadia as a similar, because he has a lead character a teenager too. Anyway, Clubhouse is worth a look, because Sumpter gives the protagonist (Pete Young) kind of likability and naivet√© that is attractive without being overly sweet and pleasant. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, and Uinningey Kirstny Brown complete the rest of the main cast, and each of them stunning in their roles. I really like how Pete Brown Kirstny sister Betsy; it is completely pills, but she still takes care of her mother and brother, despite the fact that she hates to show it. It may take a few episodes to really find his feet, but the Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long time, so check it out people - you'll be glad you did!
