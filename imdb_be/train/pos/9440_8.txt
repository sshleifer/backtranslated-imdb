"Freedom" is one of the best exploitation films to come out of this remarkable decade of the 1970s, from which so many other exploitation films came. <br /> <br /> A group of friends sent a canoe down the river in the afternoon, and they are victims of a bunch of toothless villagers are largely trying to ruin their lives. It's awesome. <br /> <br /> We were treated to anal rape, beatings vicious, bow and arrows murders, shootings, bone fractures, etc ... much as in 1974 in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," to say that «Deliverance», is likely to be immature. It will never happen, and can not, even in the dark days of 1972. <br /> <br /> «Deliverance» is a very entertaining ride and packed with action. It is one in a huge pile of exploitation films come since the beginning of the 70s, and (possibly) sits on top of the heap with him is great acting, great cinematography and excellent writing. < br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
