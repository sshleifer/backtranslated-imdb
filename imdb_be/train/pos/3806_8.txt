This film took my breath at some points, I just love it! <br /> <br /> I admit that iconic dialogues and the story could have been done a little better, but hey, it's just a simple (short) story of a couple of guys who are trying to kill the dragon, there is nothing more to it! <br /> <br /> overall design, atmosphere, beautiful scenery ... everything is just magical! <br /> <br /> They put a lot of love in this film. The character designs were great and funny. Bit Tim Burton-ish, if you like. I can recommend this film to anyone who is interested in great design, is displayed in a simple small but beautiful story.
