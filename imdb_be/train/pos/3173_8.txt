Representation is a terrible thing to waste ... especially if you have talented actors. Writer / director Jones wasted no time, siding the viewer with its main character. <br /> <br /> The one who shared an apartment with slush will cry with laughter. Anyone who arrived while the meter maid includes a ticket on the windshield will just cry. We all wanted to thwart a terrible wig with a human head. This is only a fragment of what's in store when viewing «Cross Eyed», cardiac film, which should be a stepping stone for Jones and his wry sense of humor, and front and rear cameras.
