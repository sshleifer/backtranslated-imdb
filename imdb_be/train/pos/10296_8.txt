Pretty funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has it as a news reporter, temporarily gains the power of God and the destruction of sunken ships. Curry returned to familiar ground here and looks to have a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend and put things charming and influence. History is predictable in the extreme, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman, as "God") is great and makes the film worth catching. GRADE: B
