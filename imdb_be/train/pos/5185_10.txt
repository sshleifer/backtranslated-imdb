I watched this movie more than 100-200 times, and I love it every time I watched it. Yes, it can be very corny, but it's also very funny and nice. The camp is shown in the film a real camp that I actually was present for 7 years, and is shown as the camp is actually a great place to spend the summer. Anyone who has ever camp wanted to go to camp, or send a child to camp should see this film, because it will bring back wonderful memories for you and your children.
