This story is familiar to long-playing Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s, the only difference is that two cats instead of one threatened to evict, if they do not catch a mouse (Jerry). Meanwhile, an unnamed source ( «Butch?»), Who live in the house with him, so it really cares "Mammy Two Shoes", who can not believe that they have a mouse, in spite of two cats in the house. <br /> <br /> In any case, the one who catches Jerry can stay while the others receive the shoes, so the competition is on! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is familiar territory, I still enjoyed it because it was quite original cartoon gags to make interesting. Not only do you have cats, competing against each other, but Jerry in the equation, so it was quite a good gag would definitely recommend if you're a fan of Tom & Jerry.
