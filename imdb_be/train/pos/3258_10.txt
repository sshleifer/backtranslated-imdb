I happened to run into this movie one night, so I decided to look it up! I was very happy with the film ... I thought it was a great story. It's a great feeling, knowing the dead one back, and you get that second chance to say what you mean! And the wife remained faithful for 23 years !!! I thought it was a great movie !!
