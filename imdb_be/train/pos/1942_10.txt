I consider myself a huge fan of the movie. I was sick on the couch and popped in the movie. Right from the opening to the end, I looked in awe at these great actors, I have never seen, say, a great word. Shooting was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hope that this message is heard any bad comments written by others. The director has a beating heart, and with its actors everywhere. Thanku for making a movie like this. Just uncomfortable enough, pretty good characters, which are imperfect and graceful all at once. Just perfect. I can not imagine it without the 10 lines in total, so I'll just go on to say that I want more of this director, more than from all the actors in this film, and many others from the author. I do not want it to end. end
