My kids just happened to stop in this movie that night, and all began to play it really affected my interest. I had to lead the bowling league so I had them write it down for me on DVR so I can watch the rest later. Well, I just finished watching it and the front part of the shirt should be washed after crying buckets. It was a great movie, but I could almost feel the pain and suffering of these girls feel. And I never in a million years would have guessed why Alissia went with this beautiful girl in antisocial Goth. This is probably why my shirt was soaked, because I felt the same pain that Alissia felt. I would not have looked for this film, but I'm sure glad that I have seen. Very touching, very moving. Great for those who love good drama or tear Jerker.
