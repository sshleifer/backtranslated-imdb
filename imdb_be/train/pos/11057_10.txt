I was 10 years old when this show is on TV. Until now, it was my favorite. The actors were very realistic. Bastedo was simply gorgeous .... I just order the DVD (15 episodes). They do not have supernormal abilities. They just had excellent human skills (strength, hearing, vision). The 3 actors were very good in their rolls, very believable. There was a good story in each episode. At that time there were no special effects or explosions all over the world, so the script is suppose to be good, and characters performing were great. There was no fancy stuff, just as in other shows. They were not trying to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I highly recommend this TV to anyone that is good stuff.
