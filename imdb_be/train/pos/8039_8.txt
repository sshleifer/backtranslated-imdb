Sniper gives new meaning to the real war films. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, a lot of shooting, all die, Bam Bam. "Sniper" takes the war to a new level or refine. The film, of course, conveys all the emotions he strives for - helpless people in the jungle, hatred and ultimately trust between Beckett and Miller, and the peak time when they pull the trigger. It would seem that a low-budget film making for each defect with action, suspense, and thrills, because when it comes to that, it's just one shot, one kill.
