In 2054 in Paris, Avalon, the computer system was formed, it manages the city and when the young woman is kidnapped, Detective Karas (Craig) must go against the Avalon, to find her. <br /> <br /> Renaissance is an excellent combination of film making mixed with conceptual futuristic story that illuminates the screen in an estate with a shocking noir theme of ideology and conceptual installation, which should please many. <br /> <br /> Pixar is an animation wizard. Their numerous Oscar movies are endless magic of Toy Story to the mystifying Wall-E and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them from their perch. Renaissance film is not intended for young audiences, though, and as the Persepolis 2007 to bring a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make the older and more complex film, its target the older generation. <br /> <br /> in 2005, Robert Rodriguez has produced a shockingly brilliant noir Sin City, which shocked the use of green screen with an excellent balance of a picture in black and white with the odd splash of color and a year later, Christian Volkman took a similar approach with this in equally visually overbearing course of making the film. <br /> <br /> picture Volckman but full-on animation, but it is not realistic for most half of its strengths 1 hours and 40 minutes of work time. The character's face is well painted and, in particular, the film should be the best ever for the shade. The fact we never know when it is night or day does not matter if a person just by looking at the pebble as a shadow merges through their expression. It's almost the judicious use of a helpless error, and subtly directed well. <br /> <br /> For those who saw Persepolis you have come to the conclusion that this is one of the best ever animation directed to screen for a simple but very conceptual art style from the satrap <br /> <br /> The Renaissance equally on terms with this picture, and in many cases its rivals with more powerful graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood. One scene in particular where Carp is beautifully shot out of the darkness. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a curious and persistent political control, which keeps the account to every citizen. Paris, the course to the mysterious Avalon, which we do not see nearly enough to get the essence of his true reign. Renaissance controls the narrative around the attempt weary police to rescue a mysterious woman, and then we see the tired and sad policeman Craig rescue attempt while fighting with other elements. There are many things wrong with the scripts, not to mention tired, irritated cop routine is now old, but there are plenty of excellent adrenaline and springy banter between the characters, to keep him alive right up to the shocking amazing shots the last couple of stages.
