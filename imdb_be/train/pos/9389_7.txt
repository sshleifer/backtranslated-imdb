Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage gets involved in a deadly crime, not the first, knowing this, and Domino, leads to increased danger, adventure and misadventure in the wild abandoned American West of the 1990s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and Cage takes mix with his usual sarcastic wit and careful ease. <br /> <br /> Is the story over? Yes. Dennis Hopper is perfect like crazy, almost cute killer? Yes. whether Cage chance? Well, you have to look and see. He never allows, and it took me by surprise when I first saw it. On the second viewing yesterday, I was amazed at how well it holds, how well it was built, and how dark and it was funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) is known more of his work on television, but with sharper and this film, he shows his hand deftly with sensational stories. It saved his humor, by the way, and cartoons. In a sleazy bar, the police is questionable. And do not miss the truly inspired episodic Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
