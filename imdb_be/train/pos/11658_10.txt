The first animated film from Ireland is also one of the best animated films I have ever seen. His real warts and all history, unlike any other candidates for the Oscar or any other movie this year or any other year. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is Abbot of Kells, a village in Ireland builds a wall around their city to prevent Viking from destroying the city, if they are ever attacked. His nephew Brandon, a young monk who is doing everything it can, but it meets the wrath of his uncle, doing things at one time. If the legendary illuminator Aidan came from the destroyed monastery, Brandon drifting towards him and his warm personality. Unfortunately his Uncle Aidan Brandon offers to teach how to cover. In order to help Aidan work on his great book, saved from their destroyed monastery, Brendan goes into the woods to get the material to make ink. While outside, he meets Ashley, wood spirit, with whom he develops a friendship. Unfortunately, the Abbe finds out that he went through the wall, and there's hell to pay. But lurking in the distance are the Vikings ... <br /> <br /> Forget what you think you know about the movie you're wrong. Even the fact that I have explained, this film does justice. His simple story with so much more going on. This is a great film about trying to find his way in the world over the next demons and find the beauty of the world outside the walls. (As the film says that the world is a dangerous place, and does not cease to be, even if you are building the wall). <br /> <br /> Its a film that treats its audience as adults, and is engaged in all of life, including the darkness. There is death and decay, joy and happiness. It is not covered with sugar. People are dying. Monsters lurk. (It freaked some of the children), but in the end, there is hope. Open the darkness in this film is quite different from anything in any recent American film. Forget about the "sadness" at Pixar film, it is the real thing, and its refreshing, and it shows how even Pixar became homogenized. <br /> <br /> His squire-Tartakovsky (Samurai Jack) animated film, who look actually based on Celtic art period. His film, which looks unlike any other. Here again is another movie that takes a movie frame and use it in all possible ways. Images are intended to fill the available space as much as possible. Often the film to manipulate things to make it look like a page in the legendary Book of Kells. Its breathtakingly beautiful and is best described as the art alive. <br /> <br /> Director Tommy Moore has fashioned a film that is a masterpiece. I can not say more than that. His masterpiece. Its one of the best animated films I have ever run across.
