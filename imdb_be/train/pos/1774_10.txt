Specifying the provisions of the comedy world alight with a "Father Ted" Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan subsequent creation was forgotten stone for the BBC called "Hippie" Although the pair created a way six scripts were written only Arthur Mathews. <br /> <br /> Set in London in 1969 by Ray Purbs, hippies, is the editor of the anarchist journal. His friends his fellow apartment, very laid back and cannabis smoking is Alex, his "girlfriend" is a feminist Jill and not too bright Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was beautiful, like Ray, but he is well in all that he is. This sitcom was a feeling of «Citizen Smith» about it. Ray was very similar to Wolfie Smith, trying to break up the company, but fail. In the end, this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and until now has been repeated on terrestrial television my memory is not too good sitcoms, but I remember two episodes is very clear that the first knife is "protesting hippies", which I thought was a great start - where Ray is a protest against the sandpaper and the episode was "Hippie Hippie Dippy», which I think was the episode 4, again very clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, sitcom received a negative reaction from the audience (I can not understand why). BBC ordered another round, but Arthur Mathews decided against it because of the negative reaction. Well, I can not wait for DVD <br /> <br /> The best episode :. Hippy Dippy Hippies- Series 1 Episode 4.
