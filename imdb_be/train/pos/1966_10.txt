I'm not a regular commentator on this site, but seeing how underrated this film, I try myself to write some comments and observations on this matter. I had the pleasure to watch this movie, perhaps because the cat is all that I wanted to be, I will not post spoilers or discover the sites, but there are things that I really found surprising as it manipulates people, it's just so magical. this is a very underrated movie, I do not have arguments here, I usually go to enjoy, and then little to say about this when you go to the cinema to have fun, and I really enjoyed the 1h53 I was left in a dark room. be sure to see again and again, until the pleasure is not quenched. let's try not to be so critical about it. thanks for reading.
