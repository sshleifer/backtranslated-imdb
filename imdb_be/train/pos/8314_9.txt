The film was actually a romantic drama based on the three sisters who had no desire to become a famous girl group. In its beginnings, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler named satin, whose sister is after, because she believes that it is "a great time", which would give her anything she ever thought, what she wants from life. Although he may be accused of killing her, he really only kills its spirit and will to live, then it becomes a drug addict and eventually dies of an overdose. History is not the life of the street or the Italian mafia who is trying to buy Stix away, it is threatened, it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life, as portrayed in the song and the style and character, which was a life time for young women who are trying to be "discovered" at that time.
