Fine story with a lot of great shots. Eyecatchers here three houses with D.R.E.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the guy accompanying them. Traci Lords convincingly plays the female half of vicious business couple who intends to poison the world Antrax. Original in this film bra bomb, put on the captured D.R.E.A.M.-member team. Of course, it is saved with the member, three seconds before the explosion. Although obviously borrowed from James Bond "Goldfinger" and "You Only Live Twice", the culmination of this always works well. In general, a good watch, James Bond is here replaced by three Charlie's Angels.
