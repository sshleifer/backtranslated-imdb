The first film von Trier I've ever seen burst wave. Of course, a good movie, but it is definitely worth in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells the story of a young American of German descent who wants to experience Germany immediately after World War II. He gets a job that his uncle arranged for him as treasurer on luxues train. Because of his work, he travels through the almost completely destroyed Germany, meeting with the killing traitors and hunt for former members of the Nazi party. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle narrowed consciousness by focusing on the job as well as he is the treasurer of the train. By coincidence, the main character to participate in the bombing and terrorist group named "shifters" They put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer is taken from scene to scene the person who is trying to put the audience under hypnosis, and then expects to wake you up in a new place. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe !!
