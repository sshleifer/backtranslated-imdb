I do not understand your objection to this film. It's tight, exciting continuation character created in "Basic Instinct." Only part of the story, which is a little unrealistic, is the fact that Sharon Stone's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date <br /> <br /> Spoiler ALERT :. In the course of the film, we are three theories about what's going on: 1) the nature of Sharon Stone is killing all these people, because she was mad (Risk Addicted); 2) crooked cop David Thewlis is killing these people to frame character Sharon Stone; 3) analyst David Morrissey is killing these people for revenge. What worries most people about the film, it seems that none of these theories do not always explain how the "real" story. (Although the analyst to a psychiatric institution for the murder of a police care, the only murder that happens on the screen.) <br /> <br /> I think it's a brilliant plot device in the spirit of "2001 A Space Odyssey". Not only is real? Blonde really crazy, really crooked cop and the analyst really wants revenge. What is important is the interaction between these and the other characters in the story. Like real life, things are much more complicated than anyone thinks that the reality is much more complicated than in the movies. Get over it!
