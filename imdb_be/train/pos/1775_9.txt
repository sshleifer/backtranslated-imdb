I often wonder why this series is so much closed. I thought it was brilliant and very reasonably written and executed. I think that in time will be considered in the light it deserves, that is, if they ever release it. Many up and coming young actors appeared in the comedy and it all went to great things. Perhaps this fact will make people aware of its value and should be issued. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Serafinowicz and last but not least, Julian Rhind-tutti with the hugely successful Green Wing. Authors Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comedy writers of the modern era. Anyone that can lead to comedy as a father, Ted could not be able to write something worthy of publication. If he ever published, I, of course, buy it.
