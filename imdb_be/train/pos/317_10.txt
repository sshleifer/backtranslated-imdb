Telemundo should definitely consider making the DVD collection in Nove Xica! I know a lot of people, myself included, who would like to be able to purchase Nova Xica! This is a very interesting Novela, which is set in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors and beautiful city where Novela going beautifully. Xica contains many stories of that time period. I would like Telemundo TV show it again, even if it was 2 in the morning. I highly recommend watching Xica, if he ever again shown on Telemundo. I emailed Telemundo is a million times already, to show Nove again, but my prayers were answered. The only caveat statement of Xica is that sometimes contains some harsh scene so I would recommend that children under the age of 14 years do not look Xica. General advantages of Xica 10 out of 10!
