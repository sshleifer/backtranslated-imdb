Yes, it is. In fact, it's somewhere in my top 20 favorite movies. Number 15, I think. In any case, I'm not usually one for the sites, but I think that the regions are better in anime and RPG video games, (Final Fantasy 7, for example), rather than a movie. But it has it all. Bright images of planets, stars, very well written script. Despite the fact that it is not really for children, they can still watch it, it does not contain graphic blood, guts and silicone. But I do not think they're going to figure it out.
