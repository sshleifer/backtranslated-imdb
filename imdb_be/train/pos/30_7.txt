Old family story told of two young girls, their grandfather brought back to life after 16 years, he predicted. <br /> <br /> People are killed and blood is shed and rat scooted more and naked bodies enjoy. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is a suspect, but we know that she is not a killer. Is this Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? This Evelina back from death to revenge? Is this a conspiracy to steal the legacy? Beautiful color in this thriller from Miralem, who just took another Giallo, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> The only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance, that some shots were cut. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they're trying to save Kitty.
