Tess of the Storm Country was Mary Pickford car I was going to get for some time. I finally found a VHS copy for a reasonable price and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her typical passionate, innocently sexy image with the wrong side of the tracks of a girl who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time the stakes are higher: a false accusation of murder, illegitimate child (and following a case of mistaken maternity) and contemplated suicide <br /> <br /> You can see why Pickford would like to repeat this history .. real morality tale, view, she loved to act in controversial topics are not always clearly spelled out. the viewer must pay attention and pick up on hints to catch all that he had in mind for the first viewing ?? although more or less explained in the end. <br /> <br /> On the basis of a single negative I can do relatively Hersholt and dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, looks like 6-2, 200 pounds (more close to Mary, of course!) Is sent fleeing in panic when 60 pounds of chocolate lab charges at him! Then, to top it (or, perhaps, to justify his confused dog fear), he manages to hold him to the ground and somehow hurt him so much that he is still struggling to get up much later, as has a bad storm! This is the same attractive laboratory who sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and arms with Mary! But Mary later throws boiling water in the face of Ben, who just slows it down! Well, I vented about Ben and chocolate lab! In addition, the film was quite touching and certainly had my attention. The supporting cast Pickford was a strong and believable. This, of course, among her best films.
