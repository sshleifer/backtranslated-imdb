It was the first of Panahi's films that I've seen, I've seen him at a film festival in Melbourne. I was completely filled with different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared with Australian children and also at other levels, such as in a similar manner. I think that maybe if more people could watch movies like this, they could see people as individuals and to avoid racism, which can often be fueled by fear of the unknown. There are obvious differences between the major political Oz culture and Iranian culture, but I found a more subtle differences between the characters, that specifies the movie so well on the screen, is extremely interesting. There are idiosyncrasies in the characters, which seem to me so unique. I found that it made the characters compelling viewing.
