My favorite movie of Jackie Chan will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), and then this film in 1985, "Police Story". In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-cop who busts the notorious crime lord and his band, and then designed a girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) to protect that person, so that it can turn state evidence. As the story continues, the gangster sends his thugs to send Lin, but Chan takes matters into his fists and feet, while maintaining girlfriend Maggie Cheung in fear. As "Drunken Master," "Police Story," has a lot of tricks and signature over-topom martial arts / action choreography, Chan became known, ends up in a battle in a crowded mall. In his role as director, Chan superior to perfection, giving the charismatic and funny performance that enhances the action. While the light of the total of slapstick humor, "Drunken Master" in the heart of the "Police Story" is just that, history of police, gritty cop thriller that is often copied for many years in the future. <br /> <br /> 10/10
