Mariska Ernst, one of the most respected Austrian director at the time, made films, full of beautiful scenes, tender love and respect all that is dear in life. <br /> <br /> At the present time when people need to hear about it, they associate the name with Marischka Sissi trilogy (1955,1956,1957). However, he made other wonderful films as Das Dreimäderlhaus (1958), assigned to the Sky (1958), and, of course, that, MADCHENJAHRE Einer Königin showing young years of Queen Victoria. Despite the fact that deals with a slightly different topic than Sissi movies, I do not see much difference between this film and Sissi. They are remarkably similar. <br /> <br /> The film is almost identical. Style, music, photos. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton PROFES, Bruno Le Monde! <br /> <br /> In a cast ... Romy Schneider, one of the first leading roles. It was a great introduction to her role Sissi, since this film was made one year before the first part of a trilogy about the Austrian empress. In addition, the film where Romy playing with her mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marishka was not the first director, who threw Romy playing with her mom. Romy debut in WENN DER WEISSE Flieder Wieder BLUHN (1953) was her work with her mother, too. Thus, there were some voices that Romi began her career on the basis of Austrian fame her mother. In fact, there is some truth in this. <br /> <br /> Again, as in Sissi, this film shows love very dearly. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small hotel in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles. And now ...? That it will be shown how? Just sex ... But the only thing that is based on love? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernst Mariska for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people might call them kitsch, but I will never give up to get involved in these films. They impress !!! Alas, far underestimated!
