some people think that the second series was where Scooby was ruined..i disagree totally.the quality of the show did not go up or down, and scraps, to win my opinion, a very good chrecter.i looked at the polls on 72 and jumpedtheshark.com % people said, scrappys second series was scoobys downfall.OK load so said so, but 28% still can not be wrong.I do as the majority of the episodes focused on comedy.i thought the show would go to waste, when he was the same 5 people / dog solve the mystery in the same formula.scrappy was a breath of fresh air in show.sure, some people are disabled, but if patchwork figure was introduced in view DOUBLED.Back show.All episodes and segments were very funny .i was Intriguded of shorts and Yabba .But at the end of the day its a moot point if you like patchwork or not, it depends on your point of view, no, of course, not the fact involved.But in my opinion it was a great series that has given rise to tire shows the new formula and rent life.Nuff said.
