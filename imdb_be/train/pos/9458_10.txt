This elevation of the film. It flows at the desired tempo throughout. The accompanying music is perfect and very pleasant to the ear. Humorous part of the fun and made even more generally woefully tragic film. <br /> <br /> However, despite the many comments about the tragedy inherent in the story line was anything but depressing to look at me. I thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that I had not felt for a long time. That is, it's great, and yet without all the common attributes of modern films, such as; sex, violence and unwanted effects. <br /> <br /> «Dan in Real Life" lacks nothing, because without regular vices. It has fully managed the plot, which is not needed, and in fact would have been destroyed, any further embellishment. At the same time, this topic is quite an adult. This work of art in and of itself, which encapsulates you completely, and you will want for nothing more than it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that feel a little «Waltons», but it actually make perfect sense in the long run because they contrast more dysfunctional aspects. Iridescent breaks for tragic which then gives to the idyllic, which turns into a dark etc. It is an undulating landscape of emotional cinema creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. Peaks and valleys are gentle, but more than enough to satisfy them teach. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this film, no matter what the genre is usually used. Set aside any prejudice, because it must be seen!
