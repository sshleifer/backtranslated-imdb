Creep straight up a serious horror film set in real time, which wants nothing more than to show people attacked on an empty subway platform in the mutant within 85 minutes. And it does just that. Nothing more, nothing less. Directed by Christopher Smith pulls drama as he plausibly could, by the introduction of a number of characters that actually have a reason to be on the subway after it is locked. It also leaves the origin of the titular Creep deliberately vague (illegal experiments taking place in the 60 years under the earth hints at), and a bit of mystery works for the most part. Unfortunately, he undermines himself until the end of the part is actually holding back on the spiral endings, where there will be more genetic malformations (they hint as well). Yes, you heard me correctly - I would like clich√©d twist ending! Franka (Run Lola Run) Potente good as terrorized the female role, and the other actors very well.
