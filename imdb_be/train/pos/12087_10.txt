I took a chance on Â«Hardcastle and McCormick", bought for the sum of the first season (Canadian Release) from Amazon. When I received it, I started with a pilot, and I was instantly hooked after that. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon, and I had a top 10 stars here. It's just that good. What I liked about it was the opening and closing theme and logo Of course Stephen J. Cannell at the end of each episode, but most of all, the relationship between the judge and Mark as they worked together to break each case. I was so hooked that I bought the second season as a companion, and I enjoyed them equally. If you do not have this wonderful series on the disc, I think you should buy it and put it in your collection.
