I had the opportunity to watch several movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This film remains at this wonderful action and a great story. Although, if you are looking for a movie with a great image of this one is not. Not having this film on DVD have helped to make the purchase easier. I have always enjoyed the intense action and excellent acting, do not always go hand in hand. In general, this is what makes it a great fun movie to watch. Now on Blu Ray scale. In many movies, Blu Ray, or you will get two things. An image that is almost crystal clear, without distortion or grainy film with HD images. I was disappointed when I did it my first Blu-Ray movies. I almost began to think that it was a standard Blu-Ray. Although after watching the other movies I know better. I do not think they spent as much time as they needed to transfer the film to HD. This is usually a problem with some movies. And at the price of Blu Ray players and Blue Ray discs, you should have only the best image. So I just think this is a good investment for people who have either never seen the movie or not buy the DVD version.
