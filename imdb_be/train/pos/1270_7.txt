This film really is ambiguous. On the one hand, the history and the concept of the film is very good, tense and there are some interesting plot twists in it. But than again, on the other hand, it is said very slowly, without style and uninvolved. Nevertheless, I believe «Just Cause», as the above average thriller simply due to fine cast. <br /> <br /> Maybe Sean Connery was in his miscast role. I mean, he is not so believable as the main "hero" and the father of a young daughter (played by very young Scarlett Johansson, by the way) and the husband of Kate Capshaw. I feel that he was just too old for the role, to be truly credible in it. However, Sean Connerey, of course, a great actor, and this is the only reason why he is still able to carry the film as well as he does. But it certainly helps a very solid supporting cast, consisting of actors like Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynn Thigpen and Ed Harris. All the actors are very good, but some of them are very underutilized at the same time, that's a real shame and a missed opportunity. Especially Ed Harris just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer. He's really terrible and operates perfectly. He usually plays the ruthless, intimidating kind of roles in films, so it really is striking in its role in this. Only in the course of its implementation it is already more than enough to watch this movie. However, due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic, and none of the characters in the film does not work well, because it feels too far away. <br /> <br /> This is really a way of speaking that kills all his films great potential. Arne Glimcher directs the film with a bit of style and keeps the pace is too low at times. Because of this, we, as viewers, never really get involved with the story or any of its characters. <br /> <br /> This is really bad for «Just Cause» was more than enough potential. Fine cast and slick storyline with unexpected twists in it, in which nothing is what it seems. Throwing and history is the only reason why this movie is still higher than the average thriller, which is likely to continue to cater to a supporter of the genre. This, however, is eternal shame that the film lacks in his stories and style, or whether the film could was a true classic in its genre. <br /> <br /> 7/10
