Not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not, so be careful: <br /> <br /> Only a small, but important thing to watch for, the intriguing possibility: the boys steal the green Citroen at one point, to the delight of drive and return to its owner, making purposeful and vindictive hidden damage to the machine, in the hope that the owner will crash. This is the same car they steal much later from family picnics? We know that the original owner sold. They drive off in the end on a dangerous road, one that I know has been closed to all but pedestrians in the last ten years. A whole new slant to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> In another case, the film could be called "Scent of a Woman." I do not remember another movie, of course, not the US, which considers the scent of a woman in such an open and frank manner, as well as the "nose" of a fine Bordeaux.
