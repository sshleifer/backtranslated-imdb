George Lopez funny man even without a sitcom. The first episodes that I've seen this too often joked at the expense of his mother. As I was watching it anymore, there were more and more variety. Nobody in the cast really entirely safe from his wit today. <br /> <br /> I think this season has progressed, that George is getting more comfortable with the family comedy Daddy role. At first he was not, but it is becoming more and more into the groove. This makes it as & show progressively funnier. They added a couple of characters for George to play off this year. his wife's father is becoming more and more active participation in the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but not as central as the previous seasons. I think it's reasonable to say with a sense of comic timing, George, and the lack of good comedies ABC, George Lopez has a good chance to be here at ABC long after George Bush.
