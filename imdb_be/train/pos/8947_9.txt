Kim Novak witch hunt to death a lover, and James Stewart of her choice. Sparkle comedy of manners, with the Broadway scene; shot by James Wong Howe Witch in color, and made sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs beautiful as ever disheveled writer Redlitch. I love this movie, while some others seem to. One Kim makes it a winner in my book. Ha! My # 5 film 1958.
