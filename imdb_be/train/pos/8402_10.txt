Van teensploitation simple picture taken specifically for the drive that goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable, providing plenty of opportunities to laugh and cry with his friends. Danny DeVito has a small but rich role as the manager of a car wash, and almost eclipses! All conclusions acted well, complex characters and direction of fully qualified for this type of image. Crown International release.
