Excellent quality star Gerard Philipe, who died too young, jumps off the screen in this smart, funny, sly swashbuckling comedy with a lot of fencing and wandering antics. Magically shifted in speaking of stories, impossible to resist. Sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as the love interest. The film will be one to remember with great affection.
