This adaptation OK, but not as good as the TV version. Actors tend to be in order, but I found the North is quite humid, as Mr. Knightley, especially compared to Mark Strong in the television version. Gwyneth Paltrow OK and her English accent is pretty good, but again, I chose Emma Kate Beckinsale. There is excellent support performance with Toni Collette, Juliet Stevenson and Sophie Thompson. <br /> <br /> The scenario is often played too much for laughs, a book, a comedy, but there are too many set-piece gags here, and Frank Churchill plot is almost completely absent. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism of the scenery. It's too lush. England has never been. It looks like a box of chocolates. Only the Americans are doing so. <br /> <br /> Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed this film, but would recommend to adapt the TV more.
