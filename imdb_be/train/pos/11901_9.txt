As I recall, Balanchine changes to the account of Tchaikovsky as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The final part Grossvater Tanz (traditional melody played in the end of the game) is repeated several times to give the children the last dance before their scene is finished. <br /> <br /> 2) violin solo written for music eliminated from Tchaikovsky for Sleeping Beauty, interpalyue between the end and the beginning of the party scene transformation stage. Balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relation to music for growing spruce, which takes place shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> 3) for solo Chevalier Dragee fairy eliminated. <br /> <br /> I think the accusation that Balanchine any way contaminated by a large score of Tchaikovsky's inappropriate.
