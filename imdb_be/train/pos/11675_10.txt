I always adhere to the Dakar, so when my husband bought a "Dakar race" Charlie DVD home I could not wait to watch it! Of course, we have seen the broadcast of the race, when the actual race was, but he never gives the background and specific commands. <br /> <br /> If you watched the Long Way Round, then you will not be surprised. language that is open, I find more amusing than offensive <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that annoyed me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but his style before the Dakar was so relaxed in May feminine need for accuracy; Tho 'I could live without, "" immortal flame lol How LWR, the drug was just as interesting as the race itself. I almost cried when Charlie broke his arm and winced at every blow he sustained during training .... and, of course, the death of Andy Caldicott ... it was a terrible tragedy, but then every year there is something. <br /> <br /> Russ drives me crazy, but his attitude has improved a thousand times with the controversial cynic he was in LWR. It's great to see him get so good right now with Charlie <br /> <br /> What I learned from this odyssey was -. 1. Never allow Scorpion to prepare your car for anything! - they had months to prepare the X5, and even the day before the team left Lisbon, Scorpion only done half the things that must be done, and the vehicle was in pain throughout the race; 2. The organizers of the Dakar have to put a lot more work in terms of their rider / driver extraction - leaving Matt (and, presumably, a large number of other riders / drivers to dry as they were doing nothing more than criminal negligence; 3. Charlie is endearing the enthusiasm for the "rough and cruel" adventure, but it is necessary to tighten a lot to really perform the way he wanted, and, finally, 4. Charlie Yueno planning another one of those epic called Long Way Down in 2007, and I do not I can wait to get my hands on it: D If you love motorcycles and / or with really good guy, "having in the course," you have to look at it, I guarantee you will love it very interesting <br /> <br /> imprisoned Simone Pavey -.. You, sir, there is a hero, I was so impressed by your "quiet achiever" manner, and the fact that you actually finished ..... just incredible, given that monumentally difficult race it like Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team -.. full marks for pulling her thinking, what about the green team can reach so many truly admirable. You are all wonderful.
