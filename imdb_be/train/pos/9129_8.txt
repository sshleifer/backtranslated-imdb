When this film first came out in 1984, Prince was one of the hottest acts around. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than the extended clip. The action was very bad, but what can you expect from musicians who are on the big screen for the first time? Despite this, he was still a very interesting movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some time all the classic comedy, especially their rendition of "password", which will force you to think about Abbott and Costello makes them "who's on first" routine baseball. <br /> <br /> Appolina (which went under the same name, that is), provided beautiful breasts, so that you had a short nakedness covered. In addition, it is very attractive. And, of course, the soundtrack album is one of the best princes ever recorded. Prince was later fallout with Warner Bros., and changed its name, but this time in his career, he was on top of his game. <br /> <br /> This film is not ranked in the category of all-time great, but it's quite interesting.
