Richard Brooks wonderful 1967 film of the novel of Truman Capote restraint is the perfect companion piece winning performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman an Oscar in 2005 Capote. They really play well together (try them on separate nights). It is unusual to find movies with 38 years apart that network as well. These two really are mutually reinforcing. Although the different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two parts mix well. Only part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in the film Brooks weak, as they give it a different name, that Capote. I suggest looking hood first and then coolly. This makes it a powerful experience!
