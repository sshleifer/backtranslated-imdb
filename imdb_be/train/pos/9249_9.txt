This film is witty, watchable and quite touching. And now, you can often see Jean Harlow (or any actress of that era, for that matter) give another woman, a quick blow to the jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Ruby Harlow sent to correctional after getting mixed up with Edward Gale Hall (it is this cheesy yet endearing crooked smile), her plight becomes more complicated when she discovers that she was pregnant, and she is convinced that it rakes left her, but in fact, her love turned him, and he comes to it, despite the fact that he will be arrested, and with the help of the minister, in a marriage. <br /> <br /> excellent relationship that shares Harlow with his cellmates is second only to electric chemistry with her Gable, who was her frequent leading man. Her cynical ideal for smooth Gail tells a lie. I do not like <br /> <br /> «You know, you would not be bad looking house - if it was not for the person"? Rubin quips on Roma, its rival. "If you're going to get that close to me, I have to open another window!» <br /> <br /> Priceless !!!
