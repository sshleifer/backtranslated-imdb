I really think that this film is a great person. But, every movie has a loser. Now, some of you may not have watched Hilary Duff «Raise Your Voice», but if you think about it, these two concerts are very very similar, if you know what I mean. In «Brave New Girl», Holly wants so badly to get into Haverty Conservatory. In «Raise Your Voice», Terry wants to go to the conservatory in LA (I do not remember the name of the conservatory there). They are both in the field of music, and they have to sing in the final semester. It's really funny how these two films are similar. I personally like 'Brave New Girl' is better than 'Raise Your Voice', though.
