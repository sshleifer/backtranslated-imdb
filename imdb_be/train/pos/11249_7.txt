I just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD. Acting for at a great - no question. There was not enough action for me, I must say. No real suspense, as such, a large number of first-class character. Nothing like Tinker Tailor terms of «whodunnit». If you want a good story slowly and said gently, then this is for you. Peter Egan as the leading Magnus Pym fine. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the life of a traitor. The man who should have been a loyal member of the British intelligence service, but that was so psychologically damaged by his unhappy childhood, that cheating has become a way of life in all things. As a child he loved his father, but his father had been opened & time again, as a crook and a liar. Pim betrayed not for ideology or money, but because he needed to deceive those who are close to him (wife, son, teacher). Pim fatally damaged by the influence of his father - he ate his moral fiber away. He has no real love or loyalty to him. <br /> <br /> Severe psychological material, and not a lot of points of light in the 6:00 series. Very well done, though.
