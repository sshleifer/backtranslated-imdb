According lyrically shot fictional biopic of John Ford's life of Abraham Lincoln of his biggest mistakes may have been the stupidity of the woman and the ability to dance in "the worst way." Ford's camera only to praise the views show the beginning of the life of Mr. Lincoln. But in order that the film lacks character complexity it makes for beauty and depth of view. Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions earlier films, which would be a great series of still pictures, the Ford has a unique eye for telling a story. Film sings about the life of a promising young man. Henry Fonda plays a contemplative and spontaneously clever tee Lincoln, one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film is about two young men, brothers, is being tried for the murder, allegedly committed. In the classic style of the angry crowd, the city decides to take justice into their own hands and lynched them long as honest Eyby steps into the fray. It fascinates them his sense of humor, telling them not to steal his first big deal, and that they are as good as they lynched him as the boys lawyer. What follows seems to get a path for all courtroom- murder drama after that as Abe cunningly interrogates witnesses of joy and humor judge, jury, and the city, before he stumbles on the missing links. <br /> <br /> film plays out as many John Ford films do: a tablespoon of Americana, a dash average predictability, a hint of sarcasm, that you are not sure if you put in the recipe or if Ford did it himself. Despite clearly feel "Hollywood" movie, and overly patriotic banter hints at the future of Lincoln's presidency, the film is quite pleasant and nice well built, if you can take the drama with a grain of salt.
