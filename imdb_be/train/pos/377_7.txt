Genteel, softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg had his first real businesses in this genre. A departure from its normal adventure / fantasy fare, it paved the way for his success in 1993, "Schindler's List." <br /> <br /> Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Alice WALDER, the story concerns a perfect marriage of a young girl with difficulties in hard, angry farmer and her painful separation from his beloved younger sister, Nettie. Although the plot - about empathy, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - often powerful and agile, he loses his way on the continuity of the fault and the scramble scenario Menno Meyzhesa. «The Color Purple» is sometimes difficult to follow, and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in terms of time. This omission in the script should have the audience and the depth of detail, obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that Spielberg maestro could not find and fix these problems, as most of the show is a perfect example of his skill as a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Representations strong throughout, with Whoopi Goldberg makes debut - she never responds, as against the current achievements - like a heart broken Celie, who just longs to be loved. Danny Glover lends strong support, although his "Moses" was above all for his "place in the heart." Outstanding show comes from unplanned Oprah Winfrey, Miss Sophia, single-minded fighting black woman whose spirit is broken by a terrible incident involving the indulgent upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-produced with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) wrote beautifully melodic cost, and provided some of the original blues for the occasion. Michael Kahn's editing of sound, as always, while the director of photography Allen Davey shows great skill in mastering some nice Southern landscape. <br /> <br /> It's true, it's heart will surely bring tears to my eyes, I only wish we had left so many unanswered questions <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997. - Video
