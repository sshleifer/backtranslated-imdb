I have to be 100% honest with you and other users of IMDb. I would like to see this movie for a very long time, just because of the poster. It does not have Charlotte Gainsbourg looks very sexy and charming smile that way? I'm in love with this woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film should be put standby for those who love all kinds of romantic comedies and stories involving intellectual humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> While I do not agree with another fellow IMDb user, who claims that the film is overvalued; I have to admit that the "Pro-Moi is the chief" has many disadvantages. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters. There is not one scene to the last climax, which shows the main characters sharing the moment of "romance" or even the key to assume that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, only the scene were both share the moment is extremely inconvenient (if both are in the couch), and do not help the audience to understand a possible love interest. I did not buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> However, the film gives a very funny moments and has strong dialogs that support this artless room. I mean a simple-minded, that it would be very difficult to implement such a farse 43-year-old man these days. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a movie, and that's why I'm taking this as a funny situation. Plus, the humor is universal. There are moments, related to S & M, funny lines with your best friend Shabana, some lesbian references, funny situations involving family women, and more. <br /> <br /> performance Gaionsbourg Charlotte is at the highest level, and it is definitely a reason to see the movie. She's funny, sexy, looks very thin and well, and demonstrates that it is versatile and talented actress who can pull the comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance. <br /> <br /> Allen Shaban is a great actor, and gives a very decent performance. I think the supporting cast do what they can. <br /> <br /> The number, direction of art, as well as other technical aspects are really good and give a vibrant look to the film. <br /> <br /> Those who use this kind of movie should be pleased after loans. This is a good example of a feel good movie.
