I must say that I really had no idea what I was going to sit down and watch this movie. I believe it was the fact that I did not have anything better between classes. But this time the TV movie caught my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eye. I really was not a big fan of her for this film. Of course, I liked Twister and As Good As It Gets. But something about this film really did it for me. I would like to see himself as a huge fan right now. This film comes with high marks from me .... Give him a chance, he will not fail.
