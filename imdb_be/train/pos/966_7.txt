2005 Toronto Film Festival Report This is an official; "Takashi Miike" is exhausted. <br /> <br /> The annual midnight screening of the new film "Takashi Miike», «The Big Spook War" or "Great Yokai War" or «Yokai daisensô». Call it what you will is a fanatical drive. <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, fearless programmer said that this film was initially focused on children in Japan. Think of the "Lord of the Rings" or "The Neverending Story" for Japan. After the show, I can understand where they're going with this, but damn it, "Takashi Miike" after all. He directed 01 film «Ichi The Killer", when it screened at the festival puke bags were handed out at the screening. And no, it is not just a marketing ploy, <br /> <br /> Plot Summary :. boy with a troubled family life becomes "chosen", he stumbles into the middle of the Great war Spirit, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who are his companions on his journey. <br /> <br /> This is not for children and not "very" young. of course to see they are frightened to death of some of these spirits (even friendly) on the display. This is in contrast to all that I saw in a theater before. Fantasy, of course, some very funny (but dark) material. You will not be bored can guarantee that. Will it ever hit in North America? It is doubtful. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
