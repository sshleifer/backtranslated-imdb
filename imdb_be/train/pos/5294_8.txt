"Pecker" proves that Waters did not intend to change their sticky the way to old age. Much has changed since then, Waters began making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later, he still does what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget has increased significantly Waters movies. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters is still that "trailer park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, the child who will receive the photograph. He lives a fairly lives in Baltimore, Maryland, with his friends and family. But Packer attracted the attention of the New York art agent (always watchable Lili Taylor), and his life is changing for the worse. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. This is not one of his best films, but there are some big belly laughs here ( «Memama» has the best line in the movie!). He consistently smart and funny, and there are the same "strange" sensibility that I have come to love in the movies Warters'.
