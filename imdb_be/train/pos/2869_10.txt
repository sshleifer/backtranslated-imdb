Firstly, I want to say: "Thank you, Disney, for finally releasing" Cinderella "movie on DVD Now you have all the Disney cartoons on DVD (including in 1999, Limited Editions) What are you going to do next!? you're going to Disney World !!!!! »Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> in any case, Disney is magical in his 1950 classic animated film" Cinderella ", a film that put the film fairy tale on the map, we are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, glass slipper, pumpkin that turns into a penalty the only word «Bippity- boppity-B!" And, of course, trying to home before midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's an old story that the children are now in the form of the film (as well as on DVD, and) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thanks, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
