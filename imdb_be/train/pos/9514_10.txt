This is one of the best films I've ever seen. It has a very good acting by Hanks, Newman, and all the rest. Determined by the best performance Jude Law. The cinematography is excellent, editing is about as well, and includes a large original score, which really fits into the mood of the film. production design is also a factor that makes this film special. For me, it takes a lot to beat the Godfather, but fantastic cinema displayed the victory in this competition. Definitely a nominee for best picture in my book.
