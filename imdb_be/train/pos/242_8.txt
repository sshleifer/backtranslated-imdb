I thought that this movie was very well done, Ledger was very convincing, and his Irish accent was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also very good and believable. How exactly this is to what actually happened, I have no idea, but it reflect why people sometimes become what they are doing. Maybe, those in power have always been corrupt, and I find it interesting that more than 30,000 have signed a petition to Ned Kelly NOT be hanged, so perhaps there was more truth in this film than at first sight? In many ways it reminded me of Cold Mountain, which was another good historical film. In general, I highly recommend this movie, and I was a little puzzled why it is not better in theaters.
