Recently, when I was shopping, I saw a box set Americian Gothic, and I thought: "I remember that!" I used to set my alarm clock to go back and see it when it was on the CH 4 in 1996 year at 1:30 (I was 14). I remember it mostly because it was really scary and strangely, no one could not be as bad as Lucas Buck (with B !!) No one has ever been so anyway. <br /> <br /> What annoys me even though they did the same thing in the box set, as when on TV. Episodes in a funny manner, I was wondering when to leave Dr Matt ??? - they made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the writers, producers or wine director (his TV crew in the background, that money makers they are still doing the same thing - just look at shows like Carnivale and Farscape are not love novelty in the studio !!!!!) <br /> <br /> in order to finish - if you have not seen it, and you call yourself a Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror, supernatural drama..Fan = you have. They even said the same thing to SFX when considering the box set.
