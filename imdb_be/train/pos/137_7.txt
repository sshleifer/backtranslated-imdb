After some of the negative reviews I've heard about this film, I was not sure to give it a go, but I had Â£ 3.99 in my wallet and thought Id bet on a budget buy, like a movie and saw it and gave back and I am glad that I did, I enjoyed it. Directed the star of such films as Chain Reaction, Ring, The Bourne Identity (Brian Cox), I had to play with it, even if it was rubbish, but it was not at all, I found some of the humor is quite funny, especially Alfred Molina star man- Spiderman 2 The character Doc Ock. He was an excellent most enjoyable part of the film. Of course, like many other people who have bought this movie, I saw the name of Matthew, and it made me get it! and none of it is not great at all, it is very little in the end of the film, it's not much of that leads me to believe this is why people hate the film. I suggest you go. Some parts of the pit the poor who needed polishing, acting, and a little more action. But it's watchable.
