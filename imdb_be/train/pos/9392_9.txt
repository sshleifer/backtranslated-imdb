I came home late at night and turned on the television to see the Siskel and Ebert summarizing their picks of the week. I am nothing of Â«Red Rock West" have not heard, but two thumbs up and see him before he left. He will not stay in theaters for a long time due to the problems of money and the lack of a distributor of promotion, but they said that he deserves better. <br /> <br /> The next day, I followed their advice. They were right, it was one of the most fun I've ever had at the movies. As some readers will show, there are some plot holes and the last 10 minutes of it never seems to end. But it's well worth it for the fine craft, went down in the first hour. This is the best role I've ever seen Nicolas Cage, but almost everyone seems completely ignored. Dennis Hopper is almost at the top, which gets silly, but reinforces how well everything else is working. A lot of the music and make a great in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I was later to my family, it does not work as well. Long scenes that build tension in the theater it was difficult to assess from the distractions of home. He deserves your attention; Switch off your phone, make sure that you will not be disturbed, watch and listen to every scene, especially in the beginning.
