This is one of those movies that you happen through if you surf the channel on Saturday afternoon, and you get drawn into it, and ultimately to look at it all. I thought it was well acted, and that made me a feel for the characters. Although it is a little slow moving, focusing more on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their families, it is never boring. We did not really see too much of all the robberies, they were so legendary for, and instead most shootings occur when they are ambushed by the police. I thought that Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, a really good job with her character. The transition from a good country girl in a cold-blooded killer is a difficult thing, to reflect, and I enjoyed the subtlety she brought to the role. <br /> <br /> In general, the above-average effort, especially considering that it was made for TV movie.
