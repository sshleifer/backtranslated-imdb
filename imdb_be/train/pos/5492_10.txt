I was impressed with the position of Chavez against globalization for some time now, but it was not until I saw the film at the festival of documentary film Amsterdam International, which, I understand that he really achieved. This film tells the story of the revolution / conspiracy Venezuelan elite, oil companies and oil loving corrupt Western governments to remove the democratically elected President Chavez, and go back to Venezuela rigid dictatorship. This film is a must for those who believe in freedom and justice, as well as a lesson for the rest of the world! I paid him the people of Venezuela for the case in hand, and preserving his country from such Halliburton, and the Bush regime.
