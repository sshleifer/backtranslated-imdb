Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> In their own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, filmed a year later in the German language with an entirely new cast, only softened and graceful enough to work better than the English version (both American MGM production). Garbo, if anything more imperative (or more interesting, as the presence of the screen), and its effect is more restrained. And frankly it seems more at ease, perhaps for many reasons, but we can not assume that it is already making her first talking picture is not so quickly adjusted. <br /> <br /> No comparison is always the same movie on the other hand, it's Anna Christie is the same O'Neill play too many words. The theme of a woman who wants to love without losing their independence here, but it comes off as strangely old-fashioned anyway. There are some scenes that are not - the Coney Island section of cut and not so good - but overall this is a direct echo of the first film. Director, Jacques Feyder (a Belgian-French), a remake of what has already been done, which I assume to be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see both films in a row, because they are locked in the same way (not only the set, but the shots, all the same). There is a random scene removed from early film - some of the storm, for obvious reasons, but also a short scene where Marie Dressler (from the English version) goes with his friend on the board through the channel, drunk as can be, but they are only silhouettes and if the next scene shows their face, we see the German actor, taking them apart. There is no substitute for Dressler, of course, but for me a German father more believable and honest in his performance <br /> <br /> Obviously, the topic -. Immigration, wayward father, daughters turn to prostitution and trouble to find true love - then there is a strong current, especially with the European threads (Garbo, respectively, playing Swedish young woman).
