I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival in the small theater of 200 seats in the upper part of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was completely in it. I love the combination of menacing fictional scenes. Surprisingly set design. Scenes look exactly like they were taken in the 1920s and 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is so good. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * spoilers ahead * <br /> <br /> The documentary tells the amazing blues-men with black-and-white scenes look old black man playing the guitar and singing. It's really weird. But it also mixes in the new group, and it may, one thing I might dislike in this documentary. It's too excessive use of references to modern rock bands playing blues these songs in a contemporary style. I do not really appreciate spoilage way to play a country blues song. This is the same kind of non-perfect musical taste I have found when watching Wim Wenders' Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The documentary was a standing ovation at the first screening in a small theater, the next day, this documentary was shown for all normal and tourists on the beach of La Croisette in open-air cinema. Although the sand, the projection quality and sound quality is poor, probably made it a difficult experience to use for the thousands of people who were sitting on the sand at night.
