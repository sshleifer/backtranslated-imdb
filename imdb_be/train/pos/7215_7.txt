FULL robbers. <br /> <br /> It's pretty quick and enjoyable crime thriller based on Ira Levin's play about two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) that the plot of murdering his rich wife (Cannon), to obtain property and insurance. The plot is a success, but Christopher Reeve, the younger and less established two writers decided to make a game from the actual murder - with only minor changes in detail. Reeve admits that Easthampton, Long Island can be a Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for example. The rest of the plot of the play is a dead giveaway, and tell the truth Reeve does not mind a bit of gossip or even investigation, apparently accidental death Cannon. This will increase revenue and its own Warhol factor. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine Sidney brulee, then making megabucks playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would not want anything more than peace to return to work on a new game, perhaps involving Riva that would redeem him reputation. He can not afford the scandalous game and key Reeve will be done. So - what else? - he's trying to kill him. Eventually they wind kill one another, the manuscript is assigned to its neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she makes a million dollars selling his Broadway. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting for a number of reasons. One of them is the production of the project. This multi, multi-storey building with a large mill on the top, situated on nine out of what should be the most valuable acres on earth (Easthampton!) I would be a good set of dripping anywhere. You could not afford pup tent in Easthamptom. The house is too big or baroque decor. It's just great modest, although it is a bit neat for my taste, appearance of the house, which is so pure you are afraid to step on a thick carpet for fear of leaving a footprint. <br /> <br /> Next, the current could hardly be improved. Caine, Cannon, and Fred Jones well. Dyan Cannon gives pitch perfect performance as a wake-wife, whose trousers they look so tight, as if they had been sprayed on, which is good in view of its assets. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, it seems, find a comfortable niche in its role as a polite, but psychopathic killer. Irene Worth as a psychic neighbor by Helga, was in a sense it is difficult to determine the error. Of course, she - or someone like her - it was necessary for the story, but, my God, that the offensive pry her character, passing and saying, "I feel pain in the ZIS woom!Â» I believe, in order to make it more interesting, she stood in sweat and dull looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it. However, it is disappointment from start to finish. <br /> <br /> You have to love Bitchy dialogue Ira Levin. Distraught Caine asked Riva to tell him why he wrote Tel entire game. "Because there, Sydney!" Says Reeve, and Kane yells, "This mountain is not playing! The play is not there, while some *** hole does not write them! "The big challenge as Cain to the police after his wife falls dead from fright, as planned. He works his sobs flow could barely speak as he reports about the incident, and pleads that the ambulance will be sent immediately. When he hangs up, his face takes its usual serene expression, he blew his nose into a handkerchief and go, all business again. <br /> <br /> menopause, although appropriately ironic confusing and noisy and full of artifice, not enough evil charm that Levin and Lumet has led to earlier scenes. Expense mainly consist of unsuspecting reef on the harpsichord, neatly fitting into the film. <br /> <br /> You probably will like.
