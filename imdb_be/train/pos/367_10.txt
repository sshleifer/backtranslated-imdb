"The Color Purple", really strange. There's no one like this, and I do not think I ever will. This video Bonfire emotions and pain that the viewer takes over. The actors are impeccable and direction is excellent. I absolutely loved it. The film never made me so happy. It's great that this is the best way to explain it.
