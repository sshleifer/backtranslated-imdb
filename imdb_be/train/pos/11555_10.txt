Simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... it's a great movie that I can watch over and over again. This is definitely one of the ten best comedies made. With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Matthau formulation ideal scenario Neil Simon, based on his play. <br /> <br /> This is real life situation is made perfectly. If you have digital cable, one gets a menu at the bottom of the screen to give it that. This usually gives the film ***% of the stars, but in reality it deserves **** stars. If you really watch the film, you can say that it will be just as funny and fresh hundred years.
