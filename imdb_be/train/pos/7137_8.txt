Goodnight MR TOM plot on paper makes it seem we are in for a big dose of sentimentality, painful sentiment.But, talented director Jack Gold is an expert in touching emotion in the right order, and he goes instead as a strong, deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances.One of the best if not the best television films of the 1990s, which may be already had more success when it was released in theaters. <br /> <br /> evacuation of children in rural towns and villages during the Second World War was, of course, is a common practice, but in the case of a little boy here was twice as important because of the unfortunate family life in the capital.The horrors UK war on the rear is not drifted over even though the construction of the film until it is the throat lumps, misty eyes the ending leaves us with a sense of optimism, despite the fact that there have been before.It almost (but not quite) are worthy of comparison with the finale of it's a wonderful life (1946) .All in all, a modern classic.
