The Young Victoria beautiful film and presented to Queen Victoria in a different view of what one thinks about it. Wiped film "I'm not surprised," Queen Victoria impression and show that she was a cheerful young women. <br /> <br /> I love history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw this film advertised, I was so so excited and counting down the days until he came to the cinema. I was a little concerned that it would not be historically accurate, but it was, and I loved it. I learned new facts about Queen Victoria did not know before, and it interested me greatly. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria in many lights was one of our greatest monarchs constantly, and this film paints a picture of her real personality and that her life was like. She was treated so badly by her mother adviser, Sir John Conroy, because he wanted England to be regent. This was what inspired the Queen Victoria to be fantastic as it was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep, and it was very well done, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, who were both brilliant! The Young Victoria is a heart felt love story, but at the same time a great look for most of British history ... I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
