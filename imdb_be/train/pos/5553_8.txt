Slowly but beautifully fitted the story of the American Revolution. Griffith tells seem much less heavy than in his earlier historical epic and Tableaux work fully integrated into the action. Lionel Barrymore is a complete bastard, Neil Hamilton poor but dashing and Carol Dempster .... well, Carol Dempster most of what happened to Griffith during this period, but it is not often enough to slow down the pace and drama. <br /> <br /> Please note that fines for this film says that he came in initially at the level of just over 2 hours when first released, but there is no cut that lasts longer than 90 minutes. However, DVD edition was presented at a slower frame rate per second, which increases the tension and brings it back to a little more than two hours. <br /> <br /> It is much better in terms of the story than the audio version, such as a patriot. Although not quite in the league of Griffith better, such as the way down the east and broken Blossoms, a great way to spend a few hours.
