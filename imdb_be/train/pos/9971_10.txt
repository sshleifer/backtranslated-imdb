This movie was excellent, I thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. This one, however, has all the ingredients, 1970 Hemi Challenger plant with 4 speed transmission, which really shows that the mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in the Chrysler sky whenever Kowalski killed that big block of the Hemi, and it sure made a lot :)
