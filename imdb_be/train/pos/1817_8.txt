All dogs go to heaven plays the dog underworld. The film is fun for children with the comic and dark-but-happy and satisfy an endless story with lots of singing and dancing. He is an outcast Charlie ~ d, fellow canine culprit who killed, but comes back from the dead. He meets a homeless man a girl who looks at it, and through this relationship, he understands the meaning of life and dedication. This cute animation is very loved in my eyes, like a child. I highly recommend this film for children. I'm not sure how adults react to it. (I tried to watch it a few years ago on VHS, but the records do not last long, is not it?)
