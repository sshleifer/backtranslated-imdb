I remember seeing this movie as a kid. I do not remember where I saw it. I was about 14 years old. I thought that the movie was incredible, and wanted to see it again. He came to the Kung Fu channel once, but I missed it. I was really bummed. This is the best special effects of kung fu movies I've seen so far! I highly recommend it, and now that I've discovered where to get it, I can enjoy it again and for years to come. I also have to check this return of Venom film of which some of them speak so highly.
