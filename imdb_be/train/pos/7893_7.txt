I believe that I'm part of the silent minority, enjoyed this film. This is one of the best in the series "Nightmare"? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun with him. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil joker potential. Since the parts 4 and 5 types of lag series down, I felt the so-called last installment ( "New Nightmare" real final) brought a series of its recession. There are some great nightmare sequences, including one where Breckin Meyer plays Stoner, who receives damage, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game, which controls Freddy. This is a very original and fun sequence, especially when we see it from the fantastic landscape, jumping around like Super Mario. And Freddy belts with funny one-liner "Gorgeous graphics." And since the film was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories of when Freddie started to control the game with PowerGlove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> cast is excellent. Lisa Zane perfectly cast in the lead. I have not seen Japhet Cat as "The Running Man", and I think the last time I saw this film was about 5 years ago. He's another big, underestimates the actor has a powerful screen presence. And who can forget the cameos? Best friend is Johnny Depp (the first "nightmares") plays a spokesperson for the anti-drug commercial. <br /> <br /> 3D-sequences in the end, it's really amazing! So for those who want to check this movie out - please rent or buy on DVD! Hopefully, all editions come with 3D-glasses, but I am sure that the video edition has deleted OF 3D-ELEMENTS. <br /> <br /> I personally have not seen a lot of things wrong with the film. He even stopped on the history of Freddie. The film is an excellent combination of humor and discourages, and outputs the gross effects are startling. Could this be given better justice of the franchise? Of course, it could have. But Talal has done an excellent job. And find the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I loved the assembly over the opening credits. Fans of the series will be delighted and will look at it as a tribute to Freddie's favorite. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
