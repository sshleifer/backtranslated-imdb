Ah, noir. My favorite genre. Preminger next to "Laura" is a noir set in postwar New York, where corruption and violence are rampant. It Dana Andrews stars as Sergeant Mark Dixon, the detective, whose heavy-handed tactics brought him in hot water with the authorities. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a suspect in the murder, Dixon tries to put the blame on the crime boss Tommy Scalese. Dixon is close to achieving his goal, if he becomes involved with the wife of the deceased, the beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course, in typical noir fashion, things quickly go down hill. <br /> <br /> While the film does not do anything interesting camera and story wise, it has a constant tones of fear and despair. Like most large Noir, it is also strangely volatile, sucking the audience from the start. <br /> <br /> However, like most of the films qualified Preminzher, it's not something that I would look again. It lacks the verbal wit of Wilder, Hitchcock's visual splendor and spatial experimentation Wells. As the later work of Lang, "sidewalk" feels very "clone" what needs to be noir, instead of something really artistic present. <br /> <br /> Thematically the film is nothing special. We are talking about the police, which manifests itself gradually becomes a criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his father himself was a little crook, the film flirts with the notion of predestination, but this scene is as far as is Otto, or dare to take his idea. <br /> <br /> camera work is also disappointing. There's no intelligence in Otto chamber. No attempt is made to assign the camera to something. She plays with space and architecture or empahsise step-by-step procedural police. It's just a tripod set ups with a rare cradle and beyond. Meaningless, even though most people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> There is, however, one good shot, where our hero locked in a car full of gangsters (noir cells), which itself comes into cars-lift (the other cells) and resuspended in the main gangster den. As Lynch's "Blue Velvet", Otto retopologizes film continually likens the "top" hell. This works well, but the set design can not strengthen it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto, seems content to stick Hawksian impression that Noir, not a toy with the possibilities of where noir can go. As "Crawling", "Night in the city", "Scarlet Street General", "secluded", "Act of violence», «Bomberang» and "Johnny Eager", "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is one of those, who are well from the second tier of the film noir. This competent and attractive, but lacking that extra special magic.
