In my opinion, this is one of the greatest films ever made in America, and he deserves every award he won, and a place in the list of AFI Top 100 (although it's a shame too low in the IMDB Top 250 list, at only # 183, as the writing of this article). If you enjoy acting very high caliber (Voight and Hoffman is an excellent match), well-drawn characterizations and inventive direction, editing and cinematography, you will love it just as I do. Schlesinger paints a vivid, always an accurate picture of the late '60s New York scene, and that many of the victims are trying to overcome personal demons and survive among immorality, poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street in New York. <br /> <br /> filmmaking techniques used here are brilliantly capture sense subterranean NY film motion (and towns) and are no less dazzling. I've seen a lot of ideas (including the hasty editing, processing announcer retrospectives, medication / off sequences and cartoon face slipped during the murder scene to convey the anguish and horror) stolen by other filmmakers. <, Br /> <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso processed so as to be regarded as an unusually strong friendship or to have it reinforced homosexual. I think that the director dealt with this in a subtle way not to evade censorship of the time, and focus on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether it is sexual or not. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy bold, touching film about the size, influence and significance that has not lost absolutely nothing with his influence over the years, so if you have not seen it, you really are missing out on a real American classic. I would recommend this film to all, <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 10 out of 10.
