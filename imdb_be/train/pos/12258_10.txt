Emma by Jane Austen is a very pleasant story in the worst of times, and this production of the story is the best that I have ever seen. Emma KA Beckinsale is impeccable. Gwyneth Paltrow (with the help of a good script and beautiful cinematography) is able to effectively bring the comedy, she was not able to do pretty Emma. Paltrow does not help the fact that her hairstyle is just "wrong" for the part (and I believe that the era), and she looks positively ill at the Empire dresses line. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, controls easy and comedy is still able to show that Mr. Knightley (the most romantic heroes Jane Austen) actually see it. Mark Strong, Mr. Knightley beautiful with the right combination of beautiful appearance, appropriate age, chivalry, compassion and gentlemanly behavior. Emma and Mr. Knightley supported by a cast of good actors and production as a whole is quite beautiful.
