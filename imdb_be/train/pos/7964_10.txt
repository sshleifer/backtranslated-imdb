It amazes me how much I love this movie, despite the fact that I do not like dogs. Fox Field, Ameche and do an excellent job with the voices of Chance, Sassy and shade, as well as actions by the animals themselves, is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 72 times longer (I know it sounds scary, but it's true!), and every time the end of the scene still get me. I highly recommend it for all ages and especially for animal lovers. It really is my favorite movie!
