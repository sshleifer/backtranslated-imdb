Gung Ho is one of those films that I never get tired of watching. Michael Keaton was always my favorite, and it is absolutely hilarious in this movie. Matching it step by step is Hedda Watanabe. Two of them work perfectly together. Despite the fact that this film is a comedy, I also like how it shows Hunt (Keaton) & Kazihiro (Watanabe) struggling in their role as leaders of their respective groups. They both try so hard to keep the peace, and then they finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to watch). Firstly, they were both on the floor. Hunt then jumps on a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the table. Hunt jumps on the table with him. Fighting then spills out of the office to the factory. I love that after they are separated from each other working, you can tell that they both feel bad for being so things get away with it. In addition, there is a scene where you can see the impact of that hunting was Kazihiro. He is in his house and his boss from Japan comes in and says that he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is closed and we can not find the key <br /> <br /> Tell me you can not imagine Michael Keaton says something like this <br /> <br /> I think I really love this movie.! because it is really funny and also shows how people who are radically different not only learn from each other, but become good friends as well.
