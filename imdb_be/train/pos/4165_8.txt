No, it's fun to hit 70 for the TV horror clinker is not the death demonically possessed dessert cake. However, it is very terrible, but certainly fun and such a pleasant waste cathode ray reaches an exciting Apex absolute, relentless stupidity and rage, it is quite delicious in so disgusting-is-just-a strange sort of way. Tilt, looking tired and possibly drunk and Yvette Mimya that acts as if it has never recovered from the brutal rape she suffered in "Jackson County Jail," slowly draws the ugly beautiful and respectable suburb couple whose quaint, dull, sleepy the existence of a small town gets ripped in half when a cute German Shepherd they take as a family pet is some ancient deadly evil spirit. Quite quickly Mimieux and her two children repellently Cutesy Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (psychic alien moppets from Disney "Race to Witch Mountain" pictures) are worshiped crude chalk drawing opposite, the ugly face of the dog in the den. The boy, now does not that sound really scared and anxious? Well, scary and disturbing is ridiculously ridiculous chatter sure, no, but it sure is funny, thank Curtis ( «Night Tide») is hopelessly weak direction Harrington cartoon (not so) special effects, almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot and the game cast, who fights bravely with a ridiculous story (except for the conclusions as Beswick and RG Armstrong briefly popping up as members of a satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Indian shaman). My favorite scene: malicious Mephestophelion dog puts the whammy on the slope, almost forcing him to stick his hand in the wildly spinning lawnmower blades. While smug snob fright film fans can keep their noses in a completely rotten stench of smelly hack admittedly pious lovers of TV trash should consider these lovingly ABOMINABLE offal equivalent fool tube to Alemu.
