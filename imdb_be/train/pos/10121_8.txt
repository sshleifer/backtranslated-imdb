While not as wild and out, as some of the later films of Takashi Miike in a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> the main story of the police story of the Japanese police to Chinese parents are trying to shoot and the next Chinese gangster. Complicating things is that his younger brother serves as an advocate for the villain and his gang. The film is actually much more complex than a few complications that and keep things interesting and distracting items from the central narrative thrust. It is a complication and loss journey takes about an hour into the film, which makes it less than a great film. (This is a very good one) It is definitely worth a look, especially if you do not mind, entirely at a frantic pace. <, Br /> <br /> word of warning, violence, when it occurs dangerous and disgusting. There is also a half-flowcharts of gay sex. If this is not your cup of tea, with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 of 10.
