The final contribution to the franchise thriller just probably the hardest hit of the three films. He goes on to play the theme of anti-Bond. Bourne did not like what he is doing and wants to know about his past blurred. Everything about this film is striking it on the nail of cinema choreography / stunt work to the script in order to act. <br /> <br /> The film begins in excitement as Bourne runs from the Moscow police. History seems to pick up right where the first movie ended. Or is it? Time a little confused here, but we get the fact that Bourne memorizing things. A sudden recollection, trying to cleanse itself almost gets caught him, but he does it, and does not kill anyone. They are not his goal. From there we get more intrigue of its past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know all about Borne and will defend it at any cost. Pamela Land returned and Nicky Parsons, who seems to have a history with the Bourne, as well. <br /> <br /> Cinematography following in your face seals practically everything. Vehicle pursuit is even more intense if possible, than those of the first two. And veteran cast coinage Bourne lovely with a good side of Albert Finney. It also has a small political overtones in connection with the performance, and other areas of public policy, but this is a minor and were integrated into the story. In general, this is the best trilogy of findings this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.
