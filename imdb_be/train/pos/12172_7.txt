This film begins brisk, has some slow moments in the middle, but in general is moving along well, there are some very good moments, Peters at the end of Act 3. I could see it in the Los Angeles premiere of 2 times (with 2 different endings). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not tomorrow's leading man. He has a sense of humor and keeps his own, but he is better served as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles doing "OK" in the comedy roles, new to her, but she did not "steal" this film is how the star of her caliber should. For the actress, who has great potential (10 items, the last dance, O), it is difficult to see how it continues to do roles that are so "average", and then have her take on the role and run with the film (as Daniel Day-Lewis did in "Gangs"). Selma Blair is a good young actress as well, and makes «OK» work. I did not expect the performance of her Academy Awards, and she did not supply one, but its performance was adequate. Chris Koch delivers another movie that is "above average". Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else. I "made" like this movie! But, this is not a film where you walk away and say ... it was great! "... This is the" story "has been done so many times before and was just not much new. Rehearsal dinner scene, probably the best in the film, and Larry Miller provides incredible performance in a supporting role (he may be the best surprise of the film). If you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times, and have a pleasant evening, I can still recommend this movie, but if they did not change the ending ... again ... leave a church scene, or you, certainly you are disappointed.
