What can I say about such a story like this? This fairy tale followed me since early childhood, causing the warm memories of my heart.The characters take you so many quaint places that make you want more of every scene. For example, on the market there are so many different flavors of knowledge. I loved the exotic dancer, accompanied steel drums. <br /> <br /> The storyline was so wonderful.I want to Landsbury to decide to keep the precocious child and also to stay with mr.Brown for her, and to find the second half of the spell, so that men are less armor can win the war . <br /> <br /> I'm still a child inside, and this film appeals to your inner child, like no other. This film is my definite favorite of all time. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away and transported to another time.
