This is a very rare example of a movie about transvestism (heterosexuals). The film refers to the taboo topic, so that even a wider audience, not knowing about transvestism all strongly sympathizes with his main character. Pasdar very believable, Gerald / Geraldine and it should not be forgotten for this Brillant action. Guide Christopher Monger very sensitively, considering such a complex problem pretty well packed in a good story. Not a great movie, or "art" film, but little lovely motion picture!
