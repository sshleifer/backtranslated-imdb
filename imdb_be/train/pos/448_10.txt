I think this film is absolutely beautiful. And I do not mean just the breathtaking scenery. It is about two hapless British housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home life. In the end, four women just rent a place together, all with different characters and different reasons for being there. In this magical beautiful place they find peace, they want and it is interesting that the world comes from reflections inside and resolutions, the more than one without it. I also think it is great because of the relationships that are developed with kindness and understanding. Act is a joy to watch in itself. I especially love the character Lotte (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
