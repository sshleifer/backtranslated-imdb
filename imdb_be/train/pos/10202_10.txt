Personally, I liked this movie, and I'm anxious to rating some people have given it. This is a film based on a comic book and animated, now, if you do not like comics or animation, then, of course, you do not like this movie, why do you look and work to evaluate it for me. Although, if you are a supporter of interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexual) women's legs and butt to save the world (hell), you'll love this movie. I thought that the story really pulled me out, and it was a very cool movie. Pretty anime-esque or more, as some of the American movies, following the new trends in adult animation. As Titan AE found a version of the Punisher live action. In the end, I highly recommend this film buff and comic super hero fan or any of the quite open mind looking for a fun movie.
