Well, this is not a perfect movie any means, but I do not agree with the general opinion IMDb, it's really too bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong Flix in the 1990s era and loved dearly. I've never seen, "Black Mask" at the time and just saw him last week for the first time. In addition to dramatically poor dubbing, which is a copy of my DVD did not give me the opportunity to turn off, the film contains the raw energy and bravado, penetrated Hong Kong films during this time. I still stick to my guns in the opinion that, when it comes to action, these guys, no matter what their budget, to add an element of the screen magic is not Bourne, Casino Royale, or Mission Impossible (I'm not knocking the movie - I just think that they do not have enough Spanta governing this, and feel too controlled) will ever achieve. What is it? It's a feeling that the filmmakers were experimenting how they shot and edited, is not afraid to leave some flaws so as to draw lessons for the next time., this for me makes watching movies, all the more satisfying and dangerous.
