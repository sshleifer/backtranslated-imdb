Given the budget and production constraints are low, this film is very good. It is likely, realistic, and shows how Csikos (Hungarian riders, who lived on the plains (empty) risked his life to rescue downed American pilot from the ruthless and brutal Nazis. We are involved in strong feelings for a young, impressionable, but very brave boy - deceived the American pilot If you're looking for special effects, superman characters and magical endings -. this film is not for you if you want to feel what it must be like to escape from the stable, immoral Nazis and their lack of compassion.then you will be delighted by this film. I really enjoyed it, and for those who like horses, dogs, and obedient, responsive people who value freedom and those who are committed to this goal, this film will be one you will remember , for a long time.
