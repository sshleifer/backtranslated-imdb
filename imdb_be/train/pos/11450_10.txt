This film is stunningly beautiful. Goldsworthy art really benefit from the film's environment, because you can see the art at its most beautiful, moving and changing and blooming. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I can think of nothing else to say about it. It's just a movie, you have to see, because it is so visually appealing and left me very refreshed when I left the theater.
