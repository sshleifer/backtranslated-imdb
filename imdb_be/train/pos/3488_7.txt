Uwe in need of a Savior as Wrestlemania 14 rolled around. Care Bret Hart and subsequent evaporation Hart Foundation left Vile D-Generation X completely stable in WWE. Their despicable leader Shawn Michaels stole the title from Hart, Vince McMahon due to the intervention and, with the help of his cohorts Triple H and Chyna systematically removed all who challenged his advantage. But in the Royal Rumble new rival appeared. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hated McMahonagement, Austin was worried DX. So excited that they asked for help Â«The Baddest of people on the planet" Mike Tyson as the special enforcer. Austin would have a chance against him firmly in his title match with Shawn Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first, there was the undercard to go through which kicked off with the Legion of Doom victory forgotten 15 teams battle Royale become NO.1 contenders for the title. I'd actually forgotten this game existed until I rewatched on PPV. A lot of very good, and really did not notice the lack of depth in the tags section in this time period. <br /> <br /> The next match saw the title light heavyweight Champion Taka Michonoku protected against Aguila. WWE was created title in the light heavyweight division to compete with strong Cruiserweight division in WCW. He was not successful, and it was the only time when the title was ever defended at Wrestlemania. Short match, it is going for about five minutes, but in fact is too short to achieve a lot. What little they did it was exciting and it was a nice little game that saw Taka to retain his title. <br /> <br /> Well, our next match saw a member of DX Triple H WWE defend the European title, which he won in the fashion farce by Shawn Michaels on RAW in December and defended on PPV, against Owen Hart, the only remaining in living. Triple H received a large entrance with DX group there to perform his song. China accompanied Triple H in the first row, but was then handcuffed to WWE Commissioner Sergeant Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have pretty match China interfered causes low shot by charter, which results in the Triple H retaining the title. Good match, would be nice if just over. <br /> <br /> But, of course, we would not want to take the time of our next match, which saw in real life husband and wife Marc Mero and Sable defeated Goldust and Luna Vachon in the first mixed tag match at Wrestlemania in 8 years. And, frankly, it's not worth the wait. While not terrible, the match was in no way a memorable day. It was close to the end of the work only Mero in WWE and the main aim was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Next, we saw Ken Shamrock flip and cost himself the Intercontinental Championship as it destroyed the champion IC The Rock, and then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold, causing the referee to reverse its decision. It was a short match, but decent for what it was. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the first good night's match as WWE Tag Team Champions The new rogue lost their titles Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in a fun basket match. The decision was reversed the next night, as the Cactus and Chainsaw rejected criminals in the trash behind the scenes, and not one that is used in the game, but it was still a fun game. <br /> <br /> Now it's time for the highly anticipated first meeting in history between Kane and his brother undertaker. Kane stands undertaker WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble, and then "killed" him when he helped Shawn Michaels locked an undertaker in a box and set it on fire as revenge for their father undertaker burned house and left him badly disfigured years ago. It was a decent match and told a good story like Underataker absorbed all Kane could throw at him and then hit him with three tombstones before the end of the match. <br /> <br /> This left only the main event, which saw WWE Champion face Steve Austin and Mike Tyson as a guest enforcer. Michaels suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the undertaker in the Royal Rumble and was remarkable in this match, despite his physical limitations. Triple H and China were sent back to the beginning occurs after interference. The match ended in Austin diving attempt Sweet Chin Music and a Stone Cold Stunner hit with the ref down. Tyson then entered the ring to count three, celebrating victory with Austin, and then knock Michaels after the match. It turned out Tyson and Austin were together and a cat plays with a mouse together. <br /> <br /> It was the last PPV match for Shawn Michaels to four and a half years. She helped establish Austin as the biggest star in the fight business and the advent of mass advertising collected Tyson proved a decisive turning point in the fight in the WWE with the WCW. Austin would go on to become the biggest star in WWE history, and along with the Rock, Mick Foley, Triple H, and the undertaker lead Uwe through a period when they would get their high level of cultural significance. And it all started here Wrestlemania 14.
