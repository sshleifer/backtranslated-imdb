I think that this movie is a lot of fun and horror. I love Elvira, and I like this movie. It is a pity that the second part of this remarkable film had no success, because it is very funny, as the first part. I also regret that, in addition to this film, I did not see Cassandra Peterson other films.I thinks it strange the actress with great potential .... I hope II'll see it in the future in the third part of Elvira adventure. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actress. Cassandra, if you are reading this, know that you are better, and my heart will be with you. You can count on me. What else can I add? It's cool and classic film!
