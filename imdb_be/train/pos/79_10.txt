I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It's too bad that Lydia Reed decided to forget and do not appear. She was beautiful in the show. Of course, Walter Brennan was great and Tony Martinez. I loved it when he called Amos Senior Grampa.I season I bought on DVD, and I can not wait to buy Seasons 2-6.If only be a great show on TV, like this one, it would have been better. This show appeared for a short time in the summer of 1999, but then disappeared. God bless all the dead and cast member, please, Llydia Reed, make yourself known to the public again. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
