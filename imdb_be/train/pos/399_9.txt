This film is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you have to love it. This movie Asian Lord of the Rings: high fantasy story based on a real Chinese mythology. (I understand that many critics have called this film the story, however, I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven and Earth, this one should be right up your alley. This film is still very difficult to find in the US, despite the fact that it was acquired for US distribution with Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey. Well worth finding !!! This DVD also worth owning.
