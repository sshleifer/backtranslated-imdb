I watched it last night on TV (HBO). I must admit that the tension in the film was unmatched in most other FN-era films. I loved how the chip will all calm one moment, and then the next moment violently. It was a classic. Ahh to. The ladies, scoundrels, and cigar gangster cop! He has it all. This film is delivered all the goods for me. I especially liked how they mixed communism in the plot, it is very common for this era of cinema. Very brave and has since blacklisted was popular in those days. I rate this film one of the best I have ever seen in the genre FN!
