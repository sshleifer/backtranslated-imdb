While Lang's version is better known, Borzage work is not without interest, far from it: his "heavenly" sequence even better.The train metaphor (perhaps borrowed from the finale of "La ROUE" Abel Gance c) ultimately more convincing than "above" the heavenly world. <br /> <br /> Borzage tenderness for his characters shows the nature of dreams and love after death is one of his favorite subjects (the end of the "three comrades") .The amusement park, seems to be everywhere: we see, even if we poor house Mary does not think a lot of that much cheese, they are stylized to the fair fault.The afar gives almost sci-fi feel to. Movie <br /> <br /> Borzage never forget about their social problems: the heavenly train up, Rich can not stand to be confused with the dark, but as "chief magistrate" says: "There is a big difference." <br /> <br /> I do not work for a large Borzage (or a version of Lang), but look, if you are interested in the career of the great director.
