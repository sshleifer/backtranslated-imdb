In 2006 he was awarded the AMPAS one of the most innovative documentaries that show wildlife in the coldest place on Earth, the film March of the Penguins was narrated by Oscar winning actor Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios has a monopoly on the animation circuit for decades. They took their blows on a live action film production, and it was a hit and miss all across the board. Disney then created a breakdown called Disneynature release and his first feature film called Earth. This is absolutely one of the most moving and informative documentaries that I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> He told great James Earl Jones, the land is not anything new for those who watched on the Discovery Channel in the last five years, or very close stands for global warming suggest the crisis. The land is very deeply affects the issue and takes a very liberal approach to the issue. <br /> <br /> This allows the emotional contact with nature that I never felt before. It also shows not only the beauty and mystifying part of our beautiful planet, but grumbling and disturbing aspects, which often entail. It is one thing to watch fall "Mufasa" from the rock to crush or mother Bembo shooting hunter in the middle of the forest. It's all good, because in the end we know that it's just a movie. It shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all types of families, from all walks of life, who live and die in their natural habitat. These real things that make a real cinema experience. <br /> <br /> Although a little heavy on the graphic nature of the film (which a lot of people will disagree), earth moving experience. There is a stunning cinematography work here is a great team and strange camera by George Fenton. Compared to March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man, this is not actually hold any measure, but it is a big self. In the end, you're growing appreciation of our planet and a little sad, as many of us probably do not get to visit these places, we will see in the film. We live here all the same, as we never explore the planet for one reason or another. Earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
