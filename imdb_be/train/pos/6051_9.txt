This is an outstanding British film. Reasonably observed scenario with many Quotable lines, which fully reflects the fact that the magic mushroom can do to a person for the weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels perfectly with the most under rated British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out with his mouths is casting workshops and Gary Stretch, with its thoughtfully brings something surprising to atmospheric piece. Despite that, it seems, is declared as a biker movie, I think it will find an audience outside of this, purely on the premise that many people have been there done that and got the T-shirt. Also a great original soundtrack with a dazzling version of Freebird. This may indeed be the 21st-century heir to the famous Ealing comedies. As a weed in fields Welsh: is a plant!
