Bran and Fishburne provide superior performance in this version of the classic Shakespeare. Branagh His plays better than I have seen the character he played in the film or on stage. Someone might say that this film is excessively His-oriented, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in the history of cinema, ironically, provide high performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but the statement as the Moor of Venice may be one of his best. <br /> <br /> One problem I have with this film is a simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. the character of Desdemona is given much shallower than it is in the game. In this film, it may also not be added at all. One of the worst cuts made Branagh in the film, was the subtraction of a conversation between him and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the game shows that Desdemona can not be an innocent child, it shall be indicated in this film. There were several subtraction, damaging the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> However, if you have not read the play, saw the film version of Othello before, I recommend this film. History, cut or NO, is still incredibly fascinating. Proceed as indicated above, it is very good. If some important scenes were added, and the character of Desdemona were priorities a little further, it will be a great movie. As it stands, it's still a great version of the original. I give it a secondary recommendation.
