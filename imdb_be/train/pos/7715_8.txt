Firstly, I believe that this film is almost fifty years old! However, it still stands as one of the greatest films of all time. I wonder how many of today's disposable celluloid production will continue to speak in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but tough enough and the effects are not phenomenal during the day. I still remember the first time I looked at it as a child, when the monster comes into force field that protects the ship, and you should see its outline in the first (and only) time. If I tremble in fear, I can tell you. Probably by now, but still more than enough effective. <br /> <br /> In the scenes with the tiger show their age now. You can see the outline of where the tiger was tangled in arrows with Altaira, but they are just visible. <br /> <br /> In addition, the effect being that melts its way through the door Krell well done. <, Br /> <br /> too strange to see Leslie Nielsen (best remembered for a movie Airplane and Naked Gun), as a young, but still mature person. He was 30 when this movie came out! Nearly 80 is now <br /> <br /> In general, a good film that is sure to continue to be a favorite for years to come. Timeless.
