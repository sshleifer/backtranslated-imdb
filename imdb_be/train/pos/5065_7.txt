In general, a good film, and better for the fact that the plot may remain hidden to the masses was the film has not been made. Brosnan does a good job as an Indian with a hidden past and the photography is stunning. For some it may be too picky, others boring - for me it is a soft, well-told tale, and is ideal for family viewing. Now this is not something you get a lot recently.
