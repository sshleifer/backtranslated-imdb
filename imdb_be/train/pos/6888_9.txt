I watch movies for a living, choosing which ones are good enough to distribute ... Leaving aside those who did not make the cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else on the basis of this, I'm just taking you to how I came to watch "The Gospel of L" ... Anyway ... So many bad movies in my land table, and I actually sit through all of them. I do not really "see" all, as a rule, I just look at the TV sometimes while I am working for the scan output, performance, and how well the story appears. If something catches your eye, I will take the time to watch it. "L" attracted me in the first few minutes, when I closed my laptop and wheeled my chair to the TV, so I can fully adjusted. Needless to say, I was captured throughout the film. It is said also, the characters are either punished or repels (depending, of course, the actor and the character of Directors intention) and everyone played very well. Sometimes I caught the occasional amateur mistakes in camera work and editing, but the emotional nature of the story makes it easy to dismiss the error. I have heard comments from other people say from time to time, the film brought tears to my eyes, at other times of extreme elevated ... I'm laughing one minute and crying the next, and incredibly moved by this film. Unfortunately, I could not buy it because I - as they say - a week late and a dollar short. That's the way it goes sometimes ... but at least I enjoyed watching this and I can not wait to see what kind of response it gets. Good luck and best of luck to you, Bret Carr (if you're reading this), you are no doubt a talent to watch.
