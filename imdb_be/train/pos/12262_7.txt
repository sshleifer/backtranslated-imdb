About thirty years ago, the author of Numa Sadoul has published a book interview with the Belgian comic artist Georges Remi (better known as Herge's, the creator of Tintin). This film catches Sadoul today as he recalls the interview, while we listen to a cassette (Herge died in 1983) and see old photos and footage of the man himself. Some parts of the interview were published in a book by Herge's request, and now we know that it is dealing with his separation from his wife, after he had an affair with one of his co-workers (who years later became his second wife) , interesting thing, the film is also considering a shift in the Tintin books from an early right and imperialist books (Tintin in the Congo, Tintin in the land of the Soviets) holds anti-imperialist book, just a few years later (of The blue Lotus). Overall, I walked out of this film, knowing a few things about Herge and seeing it as little more than a nuisance when I go to the theater.
