"Nothing. There's nothing "in room 237. But you is not got no business going" in any case. So stay. Do you understand? Intervened. Â»<br /> <br /> Never been in such a feat of psychological horror as the film reaches. This is the highest rating a horror movie of all and correctly. Jack Nicholson is a superb actor, and this is one of the greatest performances in the film. <br /> <br /> Its about a family that moves to the isolated and deserted hotel for 5 months in the winter. Then the father (Jack) becomes almost get the horrors of the hotel. <br /> <br /> Kubricks direction is nothing short of the perfect. Tensions tracking shots, painful music, mystical message and confuse the plot makes it the best horror film ever made. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film there are constant references to the danger of death and horror. The red color is used in each stage. Is Red deliberately put in Kubrick? Of course!. <br /> <br /> This is the final Kubrick classic and is the third of his films, which I gave 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction, and you can see it in all of his films. He loves to puzzle his observer in each of his films. <br /> <br /> I'm going to talk about this film for months to come. It has an infinite depth. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it is the cornerstone of the horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10
