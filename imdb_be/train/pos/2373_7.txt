The new film "Pendragon Pictures Wells War of the Worlds", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, is in development for 5 years. Theatrical release was designed for earlier this year (March, 2005), but this did not happen. The DVD was rushed out to coincide with the release version of Spielberg, which hits theaters June 29 <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, with some reservations. <br /> <br /> As a faithful an adaptation? This is not quite 100% accurate book of Wells, but 90 - 95% accurate is good enough for me. At least, a few scenes were completely new, such as the astronomer Ogilvy confrontation with the farmer, and the unnamed author / narrator uncomfortable drinking tea with his cousin. But overall, the film is behind the book very carefully -., Of course, much more than the classic versions of the 1953 George Pal <br /> <br /> His biggest mistake is that he was clearly done on a very cheap budget. Most of it seems to have been shot dead by a blue screen and mixed with the digitized backgrounds. This is particularly annoying for most of the interior shots, and scenes from the crowded city streets. In 1898, London reviews look like something from a video game. Many scenes horse-drawn carriages have been tampered with - I believe that they can not afford to rent a horse. The only scenes shot for the "real" seems to those in open fields or forests. <br /> <br /> But within these budget constraints, they have managed to do quite a lot. Artistically, the film looks right. The Martians and their tripods quite well done, and very accurately to describe Wells. I was particularly impressed with the heat ray. Although the sequence of Thunder Child, which was one of the best moments of the film, is very disappointing. It's a shame you that they could not afford more than the actual set, or a better quality of animation. <br /> <br /> action and direction will not win any Oscars. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. Music is pretty good as well, although not on a par with any of the major Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> In fact, I'm glad that it did not receive a theatrical release because of budget restrictions would make it look much worse on the big screen. As it stands, I would rate it like BBC-TV adaptation of the classic literature <br /> <br /> A few nitpicks :. Most scenes are presented with different color filters (mainly red). It may have been an artistic choice, but used very inconsistently, and more like a sleazy DVD mastering job. And the author / narrator obviously fake mustache mutates from scene to scene <br /> <br /> The bottom line is -. It is worth seeing? If you can look past the technical and budgetary constraints, and get into the story, I think you will enjoy it, especially if you actually read the original G H Wells novel. If, however, you can easily scare the cheap production values, you have to pass it better (if you're not a fan of MST3K). Keep in mind, however, that the film works as much as 3 hours, so I do not recommend watching it all in one go <br /> <br /> By the way :. Quite a different version of War of the Worlds (aka "Invasion") was released on DVD in the same month that Spielberg was in the theater: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. This has also been done on a budget, but it is updated to the present day, as in the Spielberg movie - but it is much better! And to top it off, Jeff Wayne makes an animated film of his best-selling album since 1978, but it did not come until 2007.
