This movie reminded me that some of the old movies Black & White, definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Initially, I had some reservations, however, from the beginning of the film until the end, I was not captured. I was very impressed with the mixture of drama, thriller and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) hilarious and had me in the path all the time. <br /> <br /> Definitely add this movie to the movie night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and "too" strong or too "funny" movies today.
