Twenty-five years ago, I showed this film in some children's classes in entomology and still remember the excitement of the children; they were fascinated! It is not just about the termites, who build and live in a "lock ClayÂ», but also other animals that use the mound. There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fighting lizard while watching a colony of mongooses. This is not only good for entomology classes, but also to the environment of teaching, as there is so much about the interaction between termites and other organisms and the environment in general, of all the organisms living in and around the mounds. <br /> <br /> I want it to be available on DVD, so I could watch it again and show others.
