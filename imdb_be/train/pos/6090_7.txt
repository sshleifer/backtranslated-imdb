envy is not as funny as I thought originally to be, but after some of the reviews I read, I found it to be a lot funnier than people were giving it Belongs now though it is not a gag a minute film as Zoolander or bouncers, but ben Stiller and Jack black work well with each other, and Christopher Walken as great as ever, so the story of the character of Jack black inventing a spray that makes dog knock disappear, obviosly ben did not want no part of it, but if the brand product Jack black ben Stiller started the rich see envy, it is not great by all means, and how Ben Stiller and Jack Black are funnier and the best films under their belt, but if your a fan of either, I recommend it as it is a funny movie and laugh my ass several times already as a big fan of Ben Stiller ID must say that it is less Stiller, but still very fun, give him a watch
