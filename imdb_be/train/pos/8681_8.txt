This cartoon short in the area, but visually stunning piece of work. There will be a very, very minor spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short has a "history" that is incredibly easy-gnome underground responsible for the return of spring each year, but had to deal with in the winter is not yet ready to take off. And the dwarf and showers have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon is not about the plot, the color and animation. Visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, a bright color was still something of novelty and there are some incredibly inspiring work here. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are surrounded by a short movement of liquefied colors through the pipes. When more than one point, there are a series of tubes, aligned in a row, from the shortest to the highest color and moving the pipes and a music track makes it seem as if the string is a pipe organ. <br /> <br /> visual battles between the formed greens and winter storm that refuses to leave quietly executed extremely well. These types of shorts are things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising differ, but they are also likely helped lead to their eventual departure from the MGM, because this cartoon probably went to the MGM budget and, finally, decided that they could It would be better if the animation department to control spending guided by someone a little more conscious of the cost than Harman and Ising were. <br /> <br /> This is a really beautiful cartoon and well worth a look. It is available on DVD Attacks "30 characters. It is recommended, especially if you like good animation.
