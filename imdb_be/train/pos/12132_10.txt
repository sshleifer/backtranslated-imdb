Pleasant, despite the performance of Leslie Howard. Mr. Philip Howard plays as a flat, uninteresting character. One has to feel sorry for this man; However, I consider myself to be carried away by Betty Davis Mildred. Ms. Davis gives one of her best performances (she received an Oscar nomination). Due to its performance it brings it's pretty boring film to life. ** Be sure not to miss when Mildred says Philip, how she thinks about it.
