This contribution is very makes the CIA look very foolish organization. In fact, perhaps they are. In the end, as the story goes that it's very similar, one has the right to authorize the killing of everyone, including his own people, to kill Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon makes a very reliable operation and Bourne tries to stay one step ahead of the entire movie was killed. He was still trying to remember who he is and how he got where he is. He gets help from several people, and it seems that every minute of the film, someone trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is little time to relax in this film and the action sequences seem very very real, there are plenty of car chases sequences filmed with shaky cam, which thus add to the realism and make it seem less than in Hollywood a lot of pictures. These sequences to add realism to the film to life. <br /> <br /> uncertainty in some of the sequences brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can lead them. This kind of action is unknown, you're going to see, if you want to have fun and I'm sure this one will lead to the next film in the series.
