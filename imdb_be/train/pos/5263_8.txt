Netflix is ​​worth noting that a short feature on the information for the silk stockings. Superior in every way that over-produced fluff. It was much better than Cole Porter songs and a lot more energy. Silk stockings was a big disappointment. Fred was too old for this sort of thing, but dancing, and Cyd excellent. I'll be on the watch for Garbo - version Melvyn Douglas Nina. Peter Lawrie was ill during the manufacture of silk stockings - he seems very passive to more active rooms and with fewer lines? I am very glad that I came across Paree - Paree by accident. Made the whole experience much more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a mere "song and dance man" pure joy.
