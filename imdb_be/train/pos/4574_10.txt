Let me from the outset that I have cerebral palsy, and I went into this movie expecting to make a correction for the lead performance. I left the theater half-convinced that they cast an actor who had cerebral palsy in this role, although I knew it was not true. Performances are generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Connor (I believe that's his name), a young Christy Brown. Christy talented, brash, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and irritability, in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story documentary King Gimp, a wonderful lifestyle with CP. In any case complete the portrait, but excellent examples of disabled people, as human beings. Most highly recommended.
