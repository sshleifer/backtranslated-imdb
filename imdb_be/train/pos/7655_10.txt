After not seen it for about 20 years, I am still impressed with this difficult -hitting influence and stellar performances. Of course, one Mr. Mickey Rooney really, of INCREDIBLE in his role as the ring master "killer." (With reference to another review here, no one but Orson Welles did not call the name of Mickey Rooney as the greatest film actor as well.) I also remember the jazz-brass account and bare black and white photographs. I love the last line of Mick before he leaves for his dose of lead poisoning. (I think Stranglers raised it on the line in one of his songs, seize for themselves.) It's a great film and unjustly buried film. Let's get it! Side of the notebook recent Film Review magazine gave a great record on Don Siegel "Little Nelson" took a couple of years before the "last mile", as well as starring Mickey Rooney. Another rave intense and pretty performance.Perhaps to ics of the beginning of the bottom part of the pleasure for some really remarkable cinematic representations.
