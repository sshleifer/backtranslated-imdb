Zombie Bloodbath is a film made by supporters of zombies for zombies fans with a true love of Horror genre. As I understand it from the comments and things that I've read, it was done in a time of great Midwest flood of 1993, when Missouri was half under water. The buildings were under water. cars and houses were under water. One article says that the zombies and crew of the film will sandbag the river after the shooting every day. The fact that this film was made at all is a miracle. It's like a huge mash every zombie movie ever made passed through a filter of three. It's a party movie to enjoy with friends who like to splash around and loads of silly characters. And it is fast-paced and energetic and very funny. <br /> <br /> The toxic spill accident at a nuclear power facility makes people melt and turn into zombies. Local government covers it disrupts plant and building houses on it. Some terrestrial transition (?) Leads to the discovery of the cave and develop some new residents find and discover the cave of the undead to a new community. From there it just gets mad and mountains, and fun. <br /> <br /> I read the reviews on here a few times. And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times another reviewer, using fake names. They use the same words and phrases. Zombie Bloodbath cheap. These raw materials. He has a bad effect. Just half the films made. There are many much worse there than it is fun movie. If you hate this movie so much, do not buy it. There's no need for personal attacks and trigger a command or quit Â«Trailer Trash." And it's obvious that you're not from Australia or England. It's just frustrating, it's a great service, IMDb does not catch people who use it just another trash. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not mind them. I give both good and bad reviews myself. But it hurts it is obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this film. Boring. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "reviewers" even mainly ware their "review" only to promote their own films. One called this film boring - well, love it or hate it, one thing you can never tell about this film is that it's boring. It moves quickly and never has a vague place. <br /> <br /> Yes, and this reviewer from The Netherlands ??? Mind - a liar. You have tried to post this same review on Amazon and received a breakthrough there. The same survey once he said it was from Missouri. <br /> <br /> It's stupid to stop. Love him or hate him - to give him a real examination of whether or not to enter anything. Obviously, you did not see the movie. <br /> <br /> But for the record, I have, and although this one is not the best that I've seen, this is not the worst. And even worse, I would give a real REVOEW and will not attack the director personally. <br /> <br /> I hope this review helps some people to see through the stupidity going on here.
