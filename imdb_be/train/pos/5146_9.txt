As someone who was born in a German mother and father (English, who spent five years in a POW camp) I come from a unique position. One to deal with the Nazis on one side of the family, and the winners of WW2 on the other. This miniseries can not delve into every part of Hitler's psyche and to give the viewer the overall flavor of the situation at that time and as best as it can be argued Hitler mind. This series is doing very well. Carlyle is very good as it O'Toole, I would, but I would like to receive more information about the relationship with other people in the party because Hitler anything about it does not do. He had people around him that followed it to the letter often without question and, of course, no doubt, in the future in his murderous career. What happens after Goebbels, Goering and Hess's mind? It would be useful to see more of these relations. But I hope it will make people to explore the subject more. It can also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein can not be allowed to continue in force.
