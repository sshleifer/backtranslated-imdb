This is a great American martial arts movies. The fight scenes were quite large for an American film made in the 90s. Of course, the action scenes are not as good as the race of the Congo movie, in fact, only a few American movies are fighting scenes that are just as good as in the Congo race films, even in our days. When you watch an American movie martial arts, you expect to see equally impressive fight scenes, but still has some interesting moves, which can be surprisingly good times, or at least that's what I expect from these films. I was struck by this film. Some of the action scenes were really impressive acting, direction and storyline was good enough, so it's really worth watching the film, if you like American movies about martial arts 90.
