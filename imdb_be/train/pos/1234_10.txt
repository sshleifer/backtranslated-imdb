I grew up watching this film, and I still love it as much as it is today, when I was a kid. Do not listen to critics. They are not accurate at this film.Eddie Murphy really shines in its roll.You can sit down with the whole family, and everyone will enjoy it.I would recommend this film to all to see. It's a comedy with a touch of fantasy.With demons, dragons, and the little bald guy with God as powers.This film takes you from Los Angeles to Tibet, with in an amazing view of the beautiful temples in the mountains Tibet.Just beautiful view! So do your mercy itself and snatch this up! You will regret it!
