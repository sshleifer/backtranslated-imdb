First of all, the film, a brilliant work of art (cinema). The plot was full of surprises, a small child pretends to be an adult inherited one million dollars, and he spends. I mean, how is exhausted. Walt Disney really outdid himself this time. Comedy the most anticipated times, but at other times unexpectedly. I mean, this movie was OK, or was this film OK. He also teaches a lot about the wise young people, and I have this child is really a wise and a little time smart trousers. But it sucks. How the hell can a man like this child to get hot cop baby and his father allowed him to go free. Here's how to let the killer get popped free for ten years. If I do, I wander out of the Â«suble nest" (a huge stick that bites when used it is very difficult to bench your butts). This guy is really lucky. Back to the story. The filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing when they made this movie, but still it's not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The child and the woman did not have chemistry or did his father, but had a lovely bro. Special effects on the other hand, was lame. In addition, this film is not based on reality. I hated it and loved at the same time.
