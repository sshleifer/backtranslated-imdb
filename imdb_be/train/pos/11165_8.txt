Four words to explain why this film was made - "She Done Him Wrong". Huge commercial success that Mae West car convinced the studio brass that gay 90s melodramas were viable proposition. Here we are rewarded with a fast-moving, well-written, Romp, which carefully targets their individual stars <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft is excellent as friendly competitors. Jackie Cooper is a little more difficult to accept, but it's Fay Wray, who steals the film with its stocked Woman in trouble. With a strong director - as Walsh proves itself. - Wray can carry a lot of impact, and it is quite plausible as the object of the flesh and love <br /> <br Beery /> Many in the atmosphere, beautifully designed, this forgotten film worthy of revival.
