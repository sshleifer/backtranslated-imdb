The Unborn is very, very different films. James Karen and Brooke Adams in the film, and they were very good. this film builds soundly and keeps you going. Although I think you have to be a fan of horror to look at it from behind the scenes and plot. There is one brief sex scene, without nudity, which can not be marked and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like me, it's in the film, and thinks that things ruining a good movie, but it is when it comes to this. There is a scene where a character Adams goes mad and kills the cat, but you can tell it is not real. The music is very different, but very good. Unborn in my opinion, it really is a terrible film, it is perfectly unpredictable, and it's pretty weird! I recommend to all lovers of horror, this movie!
