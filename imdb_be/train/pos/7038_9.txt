"The first war is 100% outsourced." Aykroyd line says it all. It is difficult to describe the film; comedy, satire, action, eccentric. It reminded once or twice Streynzhlav doctor, especially so in the scenes featuring Ben Kingsley (who did an excellent job, I think). I had no special expectations for this movie, even though I'm a big fan of John Cusack, so I just let the movie wash me. And in the end I was very entertained. Political satire painfully exact and fully exposes the US military-business complex. Sub-plots were more predictable, but the final interweaving storylines, did it all worth it. I can understand why this film was not very popular in the US, but also for the rest of the world, it is a timely story.
