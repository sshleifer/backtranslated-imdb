Winchester 73 great story, and that's what I like it. This is not your everyday west - he uses a rifle, which runs from the hands of different characters - as a mechanism to tell the story about these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian chief, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leading man with the heart and strength, and Shelley Winters plays the goals that must cope with the reality of her husband and the Wild West. Importantly, for those politically correct types - they killed many Indians in this film without remorse. By today's standards, it's still pretty tough. But it's a great story and is worth watching. Enjoy!
