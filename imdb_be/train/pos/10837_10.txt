As aging rocker, the film mentions Heep and Quo - has 2 favorite band ever - but with an incredible cast (all of it) - and fantastic story - I just love this part of the creative genius. I can not recommend it more highly - and Mick Jones added so much (Foreigner lead and main songwriter with the greatest rock singer ever - Lou Gramm) - I watched this great work of more than 10 times- Bill Nighy - what a voice - and Jimmy Nail - talent flows from each pair - then Astrid and Karen .... ..... what else can an aging rocker to ask !! 10/10. - bloody brilliant <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, Rhode from Windsor, England.
