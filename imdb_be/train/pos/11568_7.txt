One of the many cartoons Merrie melodies that entertained American moviegoers during the Second World War, Bob Clampett in the "Itching in time" reflects the tramp fleas on a dog settling into Elmer Fudd. Little guy turns into a real sadist, making the house on the back of the dog, but the dog Elmer warns: "Another scwatch, and I'll give you a bath," Meanwhile, the creation of dynamite flea on the dog! * And it's not the end! I noticed that in one scene, Elmer reads comics featuring Bugs Bunny and Pork Pig. Obviously, Elmer and errors often starred, but Elmer never withdrew from the spanking (with the exception of a very short "Any Bonds Today?"). But for me, the thought of Elmer read about these other well-known characters of the same genre it emphasizes metaphysical character of his world, as if he knew of their existence in its universe, even if they are not in this cartoon. <, Br /> <br /> Of course, I'm probably too far in my analysis. I am sure that cartoon was conceived as a pure entertainment, and it is certainly entertaining. As for the "I could get like this" line, it sounds as if it was something that the censors would not have allowed, but somehow missed; For example, I do not really know what it was supposed to sound like. It was something sexy? As for the end, if I thought I saw it all, I'd be tempted to look for more than doing what the cat did (although it was a neat trick). <br /> <br /> * guys who are behind these cartoons was sure thing for TNT, is not it?
