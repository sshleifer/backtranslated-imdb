The film deals with one of the most dangerous diseases in geriatric age today. As someone who has faced a number of families who are faced with the potential of developing Alzheimer's disease or being in its infancy, I would suggest that every healthcare giver recommend this film to any family facing the trauma of the disease. The film is intended primarily to talk with the patient's family and reaches into the heart of the struggle. Casting is excellent and dramatic image is outstanding with a very domineering storyline.
