I never knew who Robert Uul was before seeing it. But I realized after seeing that he was an eccentric. This HBO features of its teaching "American history" in the New York University film student and the man was simply phenomenal. He ridiculed almost all key historical event that occurred not only in the US, but some of the other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me question if I accept as infallible true story is true. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed, as Mr. Wuhl managed to mix the useful information with great comedy and make learning much more exciting. I would recommend it to anyone interested in history and is ready to challenge the fact that his / her beliefs.
