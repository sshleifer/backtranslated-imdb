I think this film is well done and realistic. I you are used to watching Hollywood "action" movies, and use it as a standard to evaluate the film, you have to be disappointed. This film is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and this is what elevates it above average thriller. I have no experience with the Swedish military whatsoever, and, therefore, can not point to an error in how they operate. But as I saw the "product" Extra, I am convinced that there has been done a lot in order to avoid any mistakes. This is a film I would recommend for others to watch. High quality realistic story and a movie.
