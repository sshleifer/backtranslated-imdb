It has all time favorite movie. My words will be deprived of the true meaning of what I have in this film. I go for this film. It is the perfect combination of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, frightening and martial arts. A story about the power of love is very touching and warm. It is a masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema. <br /> <br /> Sinnui Yauman, without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into a movie. Author and director of Pu Songling Siu-Tung Ching, Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin plays Leslie Cheung, the young man down on his success, which goes in search of the monastery to live deep in the forest, the inhabitants of the place seems to be very afraid to go there. One only dangerous hike with the wolves, and the crazy Taoist monk living in the temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin Tsing meets a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in an abandoned temple. She is forced to seduce the man of her evil mistress, but when she meets an innocent Lin Sin Chew they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Ling Chhv Sina is its native bumbling fool, but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing trying to protect it from other spirits in the forest, he was trying to protect her from the monk who tries kill the spirits of the forest. There's a big martial arts, even a monk who breaks out in a drunken songs, he performs the ritual Taoist forms a ball. The film makes a lot of traditional old martial arts movies of acrobatics, with the help of magic, and fly through the air, jumping from tree to tree, with elegant long dresses and scarves, but the film is really flowing, and everything is effective. <br /> <br /> Tsing have to be married to an evil tree monster that can not be good, and we believe her plight in her house, where we meet her sister and stepmother, which is really not good. <br /> <br /> in the end they have to contend with a deadly tree witch language and go with Yin deep into the heart of hell to fight with thousands of years of evil in order to save their souls, and bring the ashes of Lina back to his home for a proper burial so that she can have a chance of reincarnation. <br /> <br /> a beautiful story that really pays attention to detail. One touch a lot on this film, you will laugh, cry, and just have fun with the big martial arts and cinema. And although in the end, Yin Ling Choi Sin jumped in the morning sun under the magic of the rainbow, we never know when Tsing was given reincarnation, but we know it.
