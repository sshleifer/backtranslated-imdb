Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again see the huge variety, which throws in everything but the kitchen sink. (Bath, but there is.) This film gives the display time for each person who was on the Warners contract at the time. If one of the artists, it seems, are not familiar with some, it's because they were great in the quiet days, and the majority have disappeared from the popular radio stations. There are some really great artists of the vaudeville era, as well. You will be most impressed Winnie Lightner, who has two numbers. In addition, there is the fact that the French star, Irene Bordone, who sings a love song in a sexual manner. Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is dvuhpolosok Technicolor «China Fantasy", which has been restored for this release. It's really beautiful and the stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is a massive finale «Lady Luck», which lasts for almost a quarter of an hour. It's really epic early Talkie era. Any old movie lover will love it.
