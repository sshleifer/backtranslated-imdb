The sight is of the form run mill and clich√© unknown / secret, but lying with some good effect and anguish stimulation. These stories have mostly gone through so many permutations of the same as we have, so we stayed as well this action as smart regulation and the bad guys, how well developed is the main plot, etc. etc. ..... why does the Sentinel solid performance given its content. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland, and to maintain a good attitude and bravado screen. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw it on the screen) brings some satisfactory support. All business side of the story entirely implausible knocks it down a bit, but it deserves the slack. It is worth watching if you like this genre.
