«Yokai Daisenso» children's film by Takashi Miike, but, as might be expected, it's probably a bit too dark and scary for the young. However, older children can eat well from it, that is, if you play duplicate in English. <br /> <br /> Describes the young boy who moved with his mother in the country to live with his grandfather, after the divorce. During the festival the village boy chosen as "Kirin rider" a great honor, but with this honor comes a lot of dangers and adventures, of course. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil things at hand, as a woman in a white mini-skirt and go-go boots & beehive hairstyle, combined with the evil Yokai turn the discontent of people and things thrown against them. And that evil manifests itself as a floating city in the form of a monster, which is headed for the city of Wrath of Tokyo. One rather funny scene has two rogue watch monster fly over the city ... one says, 'Oh, it's only Gamera ». <br /> <br /> The young boy befriended Yokai, who are kind of monsters, mostly benign, who isolated themselves from the people, and all the Yokai Japanese band together to fight the evil. <br /> <br /> In many respects Miike and the crew took in the late 60's / early 70's Yokai films and turned them into a modern adventure for (older) children, which also combines some strange mechanical monster which made me think of "Transformers." Appearance of the film is a big, exciting effects, and some of the humor just go right over the heads of small, but still, elders might enjoy it. As for adults, it is not so much not like it here, if you're a fan of Japanese monster movies, you'll enjoy the heck out of it. <br /> <br /> Cool and funny things, like dark sometimes but maybe it's just Miike..and, that wild ride. 8 of 10.
