Let's start this review on a positive note - I am very pleased that they have decided not weakling with Tony being shot and make a retrospective season, as some people were rumoring. In fact, the creator and author of this episode, David Chase did quite the opposite. We really do not know when Tony would live or die. He is in a coma, and his chances of recovery are very thin there. This episode seemed to move very slowly, and coma-induced dreams Tony involving mistaken identity and robbed Asian monk slapping the crap out of him was absolutely flat out weird. After 45 minutes, I'm a little tired of all the mourners, but it does not "t be a reason to close the episode. It was strange and unpredictable episode, but it is still well written and intense. Edie Falco made a strange career-defining performance in this episode as a conflicted woman faced with perhaps the death of her husband. I also found it interesting to AJ dropped out of school and swore vendetta Junior that AJ, most likely, will not have the balls to pull off. Silvio is now acting boss, which opens many doors to problems in later episodes. There were a lot of large studs in this episode as well, and I think that the Vita pole-smoker Spadafore can meet his end if he continues to be a greedy SOB <br /> <br /> It was not a great episode and disappointed because, that even though Tony is killing people, we the audience love him and feel that he is our hero of the show. It was a necessary episode for the series, despite the fact that it was a little snore inducing a conclusion. Kudos to the performance of Edie Falco, and David Chase and authors to create this very original and unpredictable plot twist. This is the only season of «The Sopranos», where I have no f * CKING clue where he was going to go. I can not wait for the episode next week. Rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> best line Episode: (Paulie to AJ): «Come, Helsing"
