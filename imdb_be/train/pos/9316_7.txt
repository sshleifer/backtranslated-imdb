Dude is Braley Mason, a civil attorney who takes on the criminal case in the "stranger" in the film one thousand nine hundred fifty-one also starring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle, and Richard Anderson. Big fan of justice, Pidgeon takes about Bono case protects young man, Rudy Walchek (Braselle) is accused of murder and gets him acquitted. Soon after, he realizes that the man is guilty, and extorting protection money from his victims, as well as other shopkeepers in the area. He advised the SDA (Sullivan), that Rudi is a small change that destroy organized crime, one must find the top people. Mason is the top man, and faced with a dilemma. <br /> <br /> Â«unknown man" a small, black-and-white film, which has managed to keep the viewer's interest with its various plot twists, although the plot somewhat far-fetched. This is really a story of a good man looking for his god, justice, and that he is willing to do to achieve it. This is the most far-fetched part of the whole. I believe that there was a time before O.J., on the Menendez Brothers, etc., etc., when people believed in the fairness and honesty of lawyers. For this viewer anyway, these days are long gone <br /> <br /> The Dude does an excellent job. - its beautiful, elegant behavior and oratorical voice show us a successful, self-confident man, but also a deeply thoughtful one. Pidgeon had an excellent career spanning 60 years, but never rose to superstar. He was a solid actor who could play just about anything did. This may be because by the time it gets underway, it was well into the thirties, and missed being a matinee idol in; or it could be he did not have, that's probably something; or that it was typed in the early stages as a second lead to a large female star as Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives an honest and touching performance here. <br /> <br /> It is a good film with good performances.
