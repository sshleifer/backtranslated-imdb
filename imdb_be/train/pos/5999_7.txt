This amazing film for me as after I considered a good movie from the new movie maker (FAR OUT on Phil McKee), another writer / director Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to look at and review your movie, THE CURE, I usually Do not review movies like this, but what the hell. - I love the shorts and could not wait to see the other <br /> <br /> I wonder what appeared at the time that I did like THE CURE, I was not enthusiastic about it, and let them know Jafri. To his credit, he asked me to consider it in any way - by giving him my honest assessment of <br /> <br /> The film has a great style, and as far as direction goes Zhafri is exceptional. - especially for a novice film maker (his first film). The combination of exceptional color selection, stimulation, and music, which is well suited film created a great sense of atmosphere. You really get sucked into the film, and it is an achievement in making the film. However, what I love was not part of the letter. While the basic idea was great, the ending was all too easy to foresee. I would really love to ending was born as a surprise or there was an unexpected twist. However, given that this film from someone who should not be in a position to make such a film professional, considering his experience, it bodes well for its future. Good work.
