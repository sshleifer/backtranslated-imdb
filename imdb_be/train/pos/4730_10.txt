In the story, a case of Jet Li, who has to fight against his old <br /> <br /> friends.But there is one problem, friends SuperFighters. The film is filled with blood, super action and the best tricks ever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great Co-actor. Of course, the film has a typical HK-Fun.But I love it! In Germany, "Black Mask," is directing.
