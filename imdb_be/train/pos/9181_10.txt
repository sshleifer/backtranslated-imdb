I had no idea that it was Jane Eyre, before I saw this miniseries. I have read and watched a lot of the classics, and I believe that most of the classics were boring, and formulated over exaggerated stories with a moderately interesting story in the best way. It Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed my views. <br /> <br /> ZIL Clark fabulous actress, and it gives an excellent image of Jane Eyre. Her accent is beautiful and it is quiet but strong character meets a young governess character accurately. Timothy Dalton strange Rochester. His passion and energy in the film leads me to believe that he was born to play the brooding master of Thornfield Hall. I could not sleep all night after I watched this show. Plot as a haunting and inspiring. Symbols skillfully made, and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre to ever appear in the film. <br /> <br /> I read the book later, and was amazed at how close this miniseries followed the letter Charolette Bronte. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see the masterpiece that will change your life, watch 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre.
