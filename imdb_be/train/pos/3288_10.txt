It's a way cool fantasy film. One of my favorite, it really is great. Directed by Bernard Rose, who continued to lead the Candyman, he made a great start from the film. <br /> <br /> The film is about a girl named Anna who falls ill mononucleosis on her 11th birthday. She draws a house on a piece of paper with her notebooks and falls into a dream in which real house. Each subsequent dream that it changes by the presence of that it adds to the picture. In his third dream she meets a boy, she thinks that she has created called Mark. She is friends with him and their relationship becomes stronger as dreams become darker and scarier. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna amazing actress, and it is very strange that, after just one film, it does not disappear and never be in anything ever again. It really gives a great performance in this film. <br /> <br /> score Hans Zimmer also ace. Many, like Tulsa, ghostly and mysterious music. It's a real shame that the soundtrack is not available on the CD anymore. DVD-only available in R2.
