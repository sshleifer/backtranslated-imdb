... it may seem an exaggeration, but it is not <br /> <br /> What's so hard to understand it. - why do not they make more musical shorts like that? Is not it lovely it is clear to all involved? I think not. So many shorts were made only for commercial purposes, and with some luck maybe some artistic value there. It is one exception - the only one? - where, it seems, they were the director had a vision and he could clearly appreciate the music as art. Why no one could think to shoot Lester and Charlie Parker in a live date? Crazy people. <br /> <br /> It is a pity there were no sequels. If you have seen anything like this quality please share!
