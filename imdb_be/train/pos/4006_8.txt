[WARNING: contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes it very difficult. She came to mind when I was thinking about the audience reaction to "Mother." <br /> <br /> People gasped when May (Anne Reid) squirmed hot in bed with his younger lover hunk, Darren (Daniel Craig), and later saw the pictures open in May. I doubt that the public was stunned to nudity, or content of the drawings as much as feeling uncomfortable seeing a woman in her 60's delight enjoying sex. <br /> <br /> Scenario Kureishi ( "My Beautiful Laundrette", "My son fanatic") proves once again why he is among the most hit storytellers on both sides of the Atlantic. His story is not so easy to take. This passionate family drama NOT movie, you can declare that a pleasure to watch, because it is a raw, complex, and often makes us very uncomfortable. However, it is much good stuff. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michell (who directed " Notting Hill "of all things) craft unsentimental, nagging and superbly acted portrait of an elderly woman who understands NES ie all these years, it can and should continue to enjoy all the pleasures of life. As a amazing epiphanous when her son, Bobby asks her not difficult, can shoot, "Why not?Â» <br /> <br /> Why really. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for his turn, in May. This is a subtle, discreet, powerful and sad, often at the same time. See Reid, when May says Darren and Paul (Cathryn Brad) in seemingly hot laying in a pub. Or, if she asks Paul to open the door after a disastrous date. Reed's eyes and face reveal all the suffering and despair Mic. The most destructive of the film, May falls to his knees in front of Darren, wanting to do something for him, but asked him to be good. This is an extremely daring statement wonderful actress. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed using the Michell natural sound, especially when in May and Toots first to arrive at the place of Bobby. It perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Tutsis, in a frivolous manner in which their own family welcomes them. <br /> <br /> The film, occasionally reminded me of honesty and damp working with Mike Leigh, with the exception of "mother" hanging on a small sense of optimism to keep afloat <br /> <br /> My one quibble :. Michell solution to mine and Darren first love scene almost cheese sensitivity. Lovers are in focus, and in the foreground, a white curtain hovers slightly in the wind. It was only the sound of May in the throes of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with the approach of Mitchell is that both Reid and Craig, who completely envelops the role of Darren plow their way so fearlessly in these roles, it is not fair to hide almost primitive energy of the characters from the audience . Especially because Michelle is not ashamed to make later scenes visceral sex. <br /> <br /> This film is not a very likeable character. We sympathize in May, but it also causes the suffering of his daughter. But I doubt that Kureishi is the people your story with likeable people. His point of view, I believe, was to expose a family that is already cracking, if something catastrophic happens emotionally. This unwavering in his sincerity and ultimately unforgettable.
