Internet data base lists it as a television show. And yes, it was a series on MTV showed the program "Oddities", after the "head" and to "Aeon Flux", if I remember correctly. But the version I watched this time was a videotape with all the episodes to work together in a film without annoying loans between or have to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Do you have a story Maxx, Julie Winters, Sara and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie social worker or leopard queen, Sarah girl who should listen less Smith and Mr. Gone guy who can not seem to keep his head. And then there are other strange creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" to the Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real, and what dreams. Maybe they are real or a dream. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. Perhaps the only one there, and the dreams of others. You'll have to wait and see. <br /> <br /> I had a comic book before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The work was exciting and the story was original - unlike anything you'll find in a Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind, and has strong overtones of adults without obscene or offensive. And the show are used in basically the same fine artwork (only now it is moving) and the same story ... ensuring that the beauty is inextricably found in comics will be exactly reproduced. It was the best show to appear on the "strange", hands down. <br /> <br /> If you like comics dark nature or need a good trip in mind, this show is to check out. This "Donnie Darko", before it was ever such a thing. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that it never went on to become another film or TV series, but I do not say this in disappointment. While seemingly simple, they taped this movie in gold and keep it free from damage caused by successive failures.
