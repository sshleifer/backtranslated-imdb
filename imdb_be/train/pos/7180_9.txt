Rejoice, quaint, charming and cheerful! I could not stop laughing while watching this film. Darren Stein presented the films that he made on the family video camera growing up in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at the budding filmmaker and his motivation and the ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, but we all do not watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another? <br /> <br /> From the beginning I was surprised by the fact that the boys in the film seemed to appear without a shirt, if possible. Later, Darren comments about his promise, homosexuality, and you can see it from the tips (great tips!) From the splendor at an early age. Maybe it was just the warm weather in Southern California, who knows? As a gay man, who also grew up in a caring environment, it's great to see that support his parents and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be fascinated by his born talent behind the lens. <br /> <br /> Â»Set On Me" camera offers a look back in the '80s untouched commercialism. You remember, hair, music and fashion. I'm the same age as Mr. Stein, so a trip back to memory lane welcome . His solo lip synchronized dance number priceless amplified Frankie Goes to Hollywood T-shirt. <br /> <br /> Films deal with dark themes for a while. Child abuse, the Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasies, and social dysfunction. not childhood is not a completely carefree, and the way Stein deals with these subjects interesting, to say the least, and yasoly to behold. <br /> <br /> hours at the earliest!
