Todd joins the community of the peaceful swine unfolded self-sufficient and must protect this community, when new soldiers arrive for field exercises. Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, who works with the smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples reflects a frightening vision of a dark, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a vigorous pace and hard, rough tones throughout. In addition, Anderson pens exciting moments of humanity well (Todd's fight to get in touch with its previously repressed feelings really bitter), and the stages of mixing action scenes with violent appetite.
