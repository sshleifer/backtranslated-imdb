One of the best films of Tarzan is also one of its most action packed (and graphics). <br /> <br /> Picking up a year or so after Tarzan of the Apes man Niel Holt Hamilton asked the rich to fund each safari elephants back to the cemetery to collect the ivory. His friend also comes carrying dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to win back from Jane Tarzan. Before they can leave Holt finds his card is stolen, and it gets crazy shooting range to try to capture the rival expedition. When they finally ran out to take a thief, they are all dead party and they are surrounded by. They have no choice but to fight their way and soon they came out of the frying pan and into the fire. Eventually Tarzan and Jane and show it all off, even more adventurous. <br /> <br /> Infamous film was heavily censored, to reduce the graphic violence (Its graphical even by today's standards. It is likely to receive PG 13) and remove all hint of nudity (there are a few minute swim nude scenes involving Jane which is full frontal in his poverty, he has only recently been restored). His clear, watching the restored version of why this film was cut to 20 minutes runtime for television. As it stands in its reduced version it is a very adult movie that is romantic, touching, filled with action and everything else that a movie should be. Its an amazing film of almost any standard. It is best kind of movie that plays well both as a standalone adventure, one need not see the first film to enjoy it, but also a film that delves characters and themes that have been established in the original film, Its an amazing thing . <br /> <br /> I really like this film very much. <br /> <br /> If there are any flaws in the film, it is possible that the film does not get old. The rear screen is often quite obvious, there is a gorilla costumes for many apes and some other effects more bizarre than convincing. However, almost every other level of the film at the highest level. <br /> <br /> You really owe it to yourself to see it. Do yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time. This is one of the greatest adventures.
