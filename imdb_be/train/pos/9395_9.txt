If you want to plot twists, this is your movie. It is not possible at any time to predict what will happen next. Nothing is as it seems, and ends as you think it will. The characters are all sandy and attractive. Cage at his best. Dennis Hopper again shows its magical sinister side. JT Walsh perfect in its latest version. Laura Boyle hisses. Dwight Yoakum makes a great film debut in a cameo role. I classify this film as "I'm really, really, really bad day" movie. Nha slow moment in this film. These sleepers. This film is undervalued and unfortunately overlooked.
