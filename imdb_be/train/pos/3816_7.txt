«Secret Sunshine» reminded me of «The Rapture» (1991), Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but it's better than Korean-made film. It reflects the super-religious Christian in Korean Korean provincial city, and experience of the main character, interacting with them as a result of terrible personal tragedy. Shin-th widowed single mother who moves to the city Milyang ( «Secret Sunshine" in Chinese) from Seoul with his young son. She chose Milyang, because her late husband (killed in a car accident) was born there, and she feels that she needs to make a new start in life in a new place. She did not respond well to wooing local Christian fanatics, one of whose members is trying to persuade her to come to church and prayer meetings. Shin-th, in fact, non-religious and brush these people off as politely as she could. In fact, it purifies almost all of Milyang to begin with, but some of them are stable in an attempt to break into her world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more would be to give the movie away, but it should be noted that the execution of a woman in a leading role (Chon Before He) is enormous. Read that she won the Best Actress Award at Cannes in 2007, I expected her to decent work. But Ms. Chung fascinating and impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on the screen. The film is a kind of harrowing Evelyn Waugh-Esquire piece of work, showing how fate can feel with the mind as well as strangely inevitable.
