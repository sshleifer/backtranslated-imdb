Firstly, it was a brave film. I have seen irreversible and can understand the comparison. Nevertheless, I can not begin to understand the people who have damage to the film. I can see how the end may come off the extreme, but I'd be lying if I did not say that he wanted to every person who has ever forced a woman into sex deserved what he got Jared. On the other hand, he did not decide to do something better, and the fact that the film is not meant to be something that made me appreciate it. <br /> <br /> View of the one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult will not follow. I, of course, and stared. I'm 24 years old. The way the film draws to make it real for me. People are so used to the eye candy and fast paced graphics on the screen, if you ask them to focus too long on a single brick in the foundation of the film, not only do they lose interest, they will take down everything that has been built, and call it garbage. If in fact it is their lack of patience and understanding that needs fine-tuning, and not a product of the creative mind, such as. <br /> <br TALIA Lugacy Rosario Dawson showed insensitivity /> self-destruct irresponsible. I think it shows the Maya in advance and after the attack with great ease and the transition between these two act I rarely ever see done well. Often, as in "aimed at teenagers" films mentioned in the previous comments, the consequences of rape is displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and lifeless. Dawson, in my opinion, it is possible to perform balancing so many surviving victims: drone-like existence in the waking hours working some dead-end job to survive (and distracting), and then pampering vices to lose themselves in the haze of addiction, not a person, that sobriety brings. <br /> <br /> I thought that this film was telling the truth, and I appreciated it finally show people the other side of rape. So many people, even the end of this movie, and eat the middle of the beginning ... I believe that the person in the act of May was the end ... not the act itself ... not revenge or meaning behind it ... just her face ... <br /> <br /> thanks
