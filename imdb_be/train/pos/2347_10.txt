I was a supporter of Pushing Daisies from the outset. He was well thought out, and Fuller is the most wonderful idea for this show. <br /> <br /> It's incredible how much the TV was no need of creative, original shows like Pushing Daisies. It's a huge relief to see the show, that is, unlike the others, where, how, when you compare it with some of the new shows such as Scrubs and House, you would see the similarity, and it does get tedious moments in see the show so in close identity. <br /> <br /> with a wonderful cast, a great script, and fun in every episode, Pushing Daisies is, in away, one of the greatest shows on the TV screen.
