MUST SEE! I saw whipped at a press screening, and it was fun. We're talking non-stop laughs. It does something about Mary, it seems like a meandering drama. Amanda Peet yelling star quality with its winning combination of beauty, intelligence, but serious acting ability. Peter Cohen, director, made the front edge of the film, which shows the inside raw male ego in the urbanized world of dating. For all this comedy, whipped succeeds with his intellect. What is so rare for a first-time director, especially in a romantic comedy. He is a major talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber round throwing a deep and very strong performances like Slick ladies man. You should see these guys go to work and get into the web-Pete. Check out the trailer at whipped.com, it is worth 3 minutes to download.
