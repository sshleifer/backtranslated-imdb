Well here is, well, romantic comedy ... but unlike all the other films of this genre, this is definitely the best I've seen in a long time .. <br /> <br /> I admit, at first I wanted to see this movie because Megan Fox, and a bit of Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First of all, if you watched a decent amount of movies, you'll know that Sidney and Alison would be together and movie, anyway ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you do not know how ... <br /> <br /> well, the film is now simply made for Simon Pegg.I not see any other the actor in the role of Sydney, and I'm sure it will be a very weak film, if not a great performance in Pegg. <br /> <br /> There are some great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laugh really hard, kindly character Simon Pegg in Sydney ... but I think that all this movie good.For example, Kirsten Dunst's really hard in this film (I do not usually think of it as more than the average act ress, but she was very good at this), that is, Jeff Bridges, there are Gillian Anderson, and, of course, Megan Fox, who plays spoiled bitch star Sophie Maes ... a great role for her ... <br /> <br /> in general, while I do not usually agree with the assessments it to IMDb, Mr. but this time I fully agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go and see this movie, it's really relaxing and positive, and I would recommend it deep ... My score 7 out of 10 ... but in actually ... 7.5
