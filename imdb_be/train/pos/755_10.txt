Dirty Sanchez is more extreme, the British version of Jackass, in which four boys (Pritchard, Deynton, Joycey and Pay) goes to great lengths to hurt and humiliate one another. The reason for this show better than Jackass because most tricks is not planned, making the reaction much more funny. There are 3 series of the show, the first follow them around and takes a long look at your life, for example. There is an episode about his love life, work, etc. The second series sends the boy to try different professions. The third stands of their European tour. It seems that boys are becoming more and more bold as the show progresses through the series. In my view, the third series is the best, but believe me when I say, if you have a week stomach does not look as you can easily see enough blood and vomit in every episode.
