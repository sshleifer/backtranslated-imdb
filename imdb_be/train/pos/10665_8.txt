As a disclaimer, I saw a movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I've only seen the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the film without being spoiled by the fact that it was or was not in a musical (though it spoiled me when I was watching a musical :)) <br /> <br /> I actually think Michael Douglas worked very well in this role, along with Casey. I think it is, "Let me dance for you scene" is one of the best parts of the film, it is necessary, in comparison with the musical. The dancers and the singing in the film is far superior to the musical and the cast, which is at least 10 times greater (easier to do in the movies, of course). Decorations, lights, dancing and singing are also significantly higher than in the film, which is to be expected and was indeed delivered. <br /> <br /> songs that were shared with the musical better to do in the movie, and the new is quite good, and the whole film only delivers a musical in my opinion, especially in comparison with the music, which has several decors. One bad point of the movie clear gaps between the actors speak, and duplicate singers while singing parts for some of the characters, but their dances perfect, and the final product was more pleasant than the Musical
