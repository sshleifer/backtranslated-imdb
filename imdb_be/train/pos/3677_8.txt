Fortunately, I saw it on the plane in Singapore recently (thought I missed it at Filmfest Cinemalaya). Paris, Je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes each) of 20 Directors, showing love in different pockets of modern Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite segments «Parc Monceau» by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), which was done in one continuous shot and features Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> Coen Brothers "Tuileries" starring Steve Buscemi as a tourist in the subway was fun! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in "Victory Square" was haunting. <br /> <br /> For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / addict in «Quartier de Enfants Rouges», to reflect the anticipation and the mountain in such a short period of time, it was just great. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, as a vampire victim in the "Quartier-de-la-Madeleine was quite surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell plays a cute couple in Wes Craven's« Pre-Lachaise. "<br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was beautiful, as usual, as the actress girlfriend visually impaired French boy in the "Faubourg Saint-Denis." But despite the many pictures of young love, a more mature performance by Gena Rowlands in "the Quartier latin »was equally aww induces. <br /> <br /> This film is ideal for those with ADHD, because each consistent leadership and I thought carefully <br /> <br /> There are also a number of memorable quotations One in particular, is one of the cheating husband, who eventually leaves her lover to stay with his dying wife in her last days..: "to pretend to be a man in love, he became a man in love."
