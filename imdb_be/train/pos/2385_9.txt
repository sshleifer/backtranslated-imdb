The old advertising blank audio cassettes, the tag line "? It is real or is it Memorex» The same can be said about the events in this episode - a compilation and a remix of «The Cage", the first pilot of Star Trek. Mr. Spock deftly appropriated the ship to take him to the forbidden planet IV of comparison, in order to Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain, who was burned and paralyzed, to get back to. Why finagling? Because to have any contact with the Tolosa IV invites the death penalty. Why is it never explained - that bothers me enormously - but if nothing else, it does not add to the story. Once he got the ship to travel to the IV of comparison, Mr. Spock turns himself into Dr. McCoy (senior-most officers currently ;. Captain Kirk from the ship) for the detention and said "Charge Revolt, Dr. I never received an order to take the ship. " Lower military court, where - thanks to talosiane - we know why it is so important (aside from the obvious paralysis) for Captain Pike to get to compared IV even under threat of death, Mr. Spock .. Illusion in talosiane create, background music, and all fi plot. And Meg Wyllie as The Guardian (Head Talosian) fine. Call me sexist, but it never occurred to me that the woman in this role, but it was full! In talosiane, giving almost all physical activity and becomes almost entirely dependent on the power of illusion, and unisex; you can not tell if they were male or female, and it really does not matter. This episode, more than almost any other in the series, makes me hope and pray that there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far away! Which is a nice thing, if only it were so! This is one of my favorite episodes, and, no matter how many times I saw him (I did it on video), he will never be able to charm me. Meg Wyllie looks like an alien, and I do not mean that too friendly.
