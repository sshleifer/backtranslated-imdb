Full House is a great family show. However, after watching some of the episodes over and over again, I realized that they are incredibly boring, and they seem to hide from the outside world a lot. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy. It's not like I hate him, but just do not watch them again and again, because they are aging rapidly. Probably the best time is the first. <br /> <br /> A full house is about a widower Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.Zh. (Candace Cameron), Stephanie (Suitin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). If the wife dies Denis, he needs some help. Yes, his best friend Joe (Dave Coulier) and girls Uncle Jesse (John Stamos) moves along with them. Once there, they live together, they discover that they can not live without each other. <br /> <br /> A full house reminds you of the importance of family, and that you can always go home.
