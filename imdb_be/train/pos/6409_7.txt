I have not heard about Brashear, before I watched it. This is a story about him and the man who taught him, helping him to become the first African-American US Navy Diver. Tale of willpower. The plot is well written, and is developing well throughout. This is what seems to be a typical lost the case, and it does not hold too many surprises. It is also quite Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the actual people, maybe it's close to how it actually happened. However, he gets the job done, with dramatic scenes and sorrows along the way, and it's inspiring for those who have ever heard the word "no, you can not" talk about their life-long December Acting performances are all excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. and shine when they are on the screen. Rapaport amazing as well. The characters are well-written, trustworthy and consistent. It is well edited and has a good cinema. the production values ​​are high, and it does a pretty convincing job of transporting us back to the 50s. This is the only film I saw of this director and writer, even though I can now consider looking more they are responsible. There is a moderate amount of strong language, not otherwise offensive material. I recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting, and / or supporters of those who did it. 7/10
