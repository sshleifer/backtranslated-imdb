I would give this otherwise excellent Series 10 full voice when Claudia Black Sun went in it! Its inclusion in the silly "Vela" has brought the series in my estimation. In order to bring it as a regular at the same time, including Ben Browder replace RDA was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we just have not recovered from the loss of "Jack" and in fact it is not necessary to become a great series in the new episodes of "Farscape". <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of the movie "Stargate" and when the series was announced, I had reservations that he can live up to the film, but after watching the first episode, I must admit that I was recruited. I always look forward to new episodes with great anticipation
