It is not only one of the greatest films of Jackie Chan, but also one of the greatest kung fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We used to wait for crazy stunts and fast, creative action in Chan movies, and this one is the standard for others to follow. It's two o'clock pure entertainment, striking all the way through. <br /> <br /> In addition to the marvelous action, we have a viable plot and believable characters, with Chan taking what seems to be a more Western approach to writing, mixing eastern resolution methods (ie ass feet). <br /> <br /> In general, it is funny, serious, interesting and innovative. A must for any fan of kung fu, while remaining accessible to the wider boundaries of the film community.
