first, someone remembered that here, because it was released in a "limited" number of this means that it must be bad ... it is exactly what the "big five" Hollywood studios would like everyone to think so, they can "pass" or "ignore" function, which is not desirable, without losing face or think of censoring themselves. to the point, this product has been released "limited" because it is considered "unpatriotic" certain persons <br /> <br /> Now, I absolutely loved this feature. I feel much better then, "Charlie Wilson's War Even if it is "fictional" account of something that "never" happens, but always OBVIOUS.this goes to everyone interested in or affected by the current US foreign policy, "home" or "on board". «Turakistan» country and "Emerald City" is definitely trying to be like Iraq and Baghdad in the same way as a corporation "Tamerlane" goes to "the Haliburton" (with Vice President Dan Aykroyd played Dick Cheney, LOL) .there with ' are quiet in the moments actually where the film is dead serious, even sarcastic longer (a prime example is how John Cusack character deals with his depression, but not only). <br /> <br /> I have found that all of the characters can be related to something / someone or specific stereotypes. Now the word of advise; If you are not politically active, especially with regard to aspects of "globalization", you probably do not use this feature a lot, because most of its content inside "jokes" target specific "personality" that are not "Record visible "to the public on a daily basis ... (the main exception would be Hilary Duff, who plays the well-known materialist pop star, I must say, I have the name of the (S)?). At its core, this feature is the anti-globalization gig period. the message is delivered with unmistakable comic revenge. Joan has a line at one point, which goes like this: "And here we have a book written by you know who, how I have overcome the world and to solve problems with my father» .PRICELESS))) <br /> < br /> brother and sister Cusacks play well together, as always, in the same way as in the «Grosse PointeBlank» I would say a little bit more "mature» .Marisa Tomeihere shows her butt and breasts to "impress" us ( as she did recently, "Game of the devil"), but instead it has a very important role, and was able to pull it quiet well. <br /> <br /> many critics did not get it (I can not do so . Do not want to). This is not a "normal" film, but more of a comic documentary. This function should deliver the message and did not get an Oscar, or "visual" kind of getting the viewer to purchase the latest "experience HDTV" TV ... I noticed, even in my local newspaper that the film gets bad're kind, because it is not "artistic", while the PRO of the Iraq war movies to get a good thumbs up for being "balanced", apparently, and "interesting" .makes wonder how much of the world media is concentrated in the hands of bunch of guys. .. <br /> <br /> I bet this feature will be a hit overseas, much more than it is in North America. As I mentioned earlier, it's all a satire about American foreign policy, and how it was captured by the "special interest" groups ... with "regular" American soldier who wears "Tamerlane" brand logo on his battle dress pretty insulting, but to show the effectiveness of reality as it is, or will soon be, how things are going so far away <br /> <br /> some priceless shots: to "liberate" the country gets a burst of commercial advertising ;. funny scene about how future journalists are likely to gather "news" ( "something turns out better, it's a box-calf"))); soldiers deal with their "disappointment"; <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend this "conservative" or "hard core" patriot of a kind or another.this functions are not made to reach to "the mind of souls" people (as mass propaganda and commercial interests always trying to do so) .instead contains a message defined for the realists, and to some ideological goals seem "always" is not enough implementation.
