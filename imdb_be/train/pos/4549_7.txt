"My Left Foot" pretty big movie that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to draw his left leg, but the limb in his body, he had control. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar for Best Actor for this film, which I'm not entirely sure, deserve, but still noteworthy. Day-Lewis to give Brown a realistic and sometimes almost humorous touch. Brand Fricker as a devoted mother of Brown, also won an Oscar for her role believable and touching. My problem with this film, it's a little too real at times. If Brown desperate and have to help someone, and it's all to do with the left foot, the film can be difficult to see. This gives him the often irksome feeling that may exclude some viewers over time. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have disadvantages and other difficulties that must be overcome. Those of us who are not disabled, and still consider themselves to have a problem inspired this film, because if a few of the much worse than we can overcome the difficulties, we can certainly do the same. Well done, sometimes nice, but it's hard to watch. It may not be for everyone, but not bad. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
