Lonely boy depressed French Mathieu (Elkaym) on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (Stephane Rideau wonderful). Quiet and slow is very concerned about the film. On the one hand, I was obsessed with it, and felt for the two boys. On the other hand I was getting annoyed - the film constantly keeps flashing around from past to present, without rhyme or reason. This is a very confusing and meaningless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> In addition, there are tons of plot holes - Mathieu, at some point, doing something that ends with him in the hospital. What is it - we're never told! Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everyone else that he was living with him. Why? We are not told. He then inexplicably connects with another guy at the end. Why? No explanation. This clearly loves Cedric Mathieu and Mathieu lives in the same city, so ... But it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much. If only things were explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim, like Mathieu is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a beautiful body - but he can not act. His idea of ​​the actor sitting around with a blank look on his face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, it's great. He is very beautiful, has a very nice body, and one hell of an actor. In addition, he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. There is a full-frontal male nudity, lots of kisses and a fairly explicit sex scenes in the film, which is great - most films shy away from showing the male male love scenes. This one does not, and it helps us to see how to take the characters and feel each other <br /> <br /> So, disappointing film but worth seeing a bit -. Especially for the nude scenes in the Rideau - that is, if you like beautiful naked young men! <br /> <br />
