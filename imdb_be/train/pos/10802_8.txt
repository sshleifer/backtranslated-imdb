I'm on the opposite end of the previous comments. <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think that it had to be a direct sequel to "Push." I mean, it's not called "push 2" ... it's "Push, for Too", which leads me to believe that while many of the names of the characters are the same, in fact, revolves around a completely different person. <, Br /> <br /> Think about it: virtually no connection to the previous film, except for the names of the characters; a very different story; the cast is different; and the fact that it is a partial musically. <br /> <br /> I say give this film some credit. He has a lot of laughter in it .. Mark Blankfild in the prime of life.
