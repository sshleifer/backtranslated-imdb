And I say «Brilliant» <br /> <br /> at the end of the spoiler (spoiler above scene is not really ... but it was for me so I did not want to risk it) <br /> <br /> on the question of how this film, my friend said, "Oh, it's just opening P3 people" who made me believe that bad to look silly movie, if nothing else. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself, "" I would rather a pen and paper to write bad things about the film '', but I was proved completely wrong ?? and then some, because I could only collect the goods. This movie was great. Excellent, not because it is unusual and non-commercial film, as the plot, but because of the intelligence in the script and how the film will tell you how to handle the film brilliantly, which would be stupid and pointless film, if given in the wrong hands. <, Br /> <br /> Concon September Sharma affection. She was so damn beautiful, who nailed his role perfectly, as if she was born to play this role. One of the most charming actresses I've ever seen.
