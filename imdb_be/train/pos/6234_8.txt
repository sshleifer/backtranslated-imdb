This is my favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie. The dialogue between them is so cute and funny and very clever. Not to mention that the film contains some of the best songs recorded two; I put all of your eggs in one basket and let's face the music and dance. If I remember correctly, it was the film that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I believe, due to the fact that it will always hold a special place in my heart (sorry for sentimental cr * p, but I'm a woman so get over them) all in all the film gets a 8/10 from me. The choreography was beautiful, and the fact that Lucille Ball in it makes it even more strange.
