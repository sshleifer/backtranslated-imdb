Harman and Isings «Old Mill Pond» is a true masterpiece of the art of animation. Unmatched craftsmanship and artistry that characterize this Duos work as evidence nowhere more so than in this cartoon. It is a shame that so many people can only see the crime that is and has always been intended to be the heart of the entertainment world, which in no way sought to blacken the black man. If something is a tribute to the infectious humor and musicality of the black race. I could not look at this sweet for many years as a "race" commissioners in England found too offensive to be shown in the UK multinational. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would very much like to see this masterpiece again. I think that those who regularly seek communication and intentions that were never intended in these cartoons, which, in the end, sixty years old, should try to alleviate and to remember that the world is a very different place today, but it does not mean that everyone has the right to censor what you can see from the past.
