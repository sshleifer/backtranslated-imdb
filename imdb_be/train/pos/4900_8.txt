This quirky film about the Brits do it well. Low budget, such as the role of episodic, well executed. Story is a little weak, recently widowed Judi Dench decides to round up "the blonde Bombshells' at all (well, almost all) girl group, which is executed during the war in London. Mandatory son / daughter who thinks she left a pot. I did like the way the movie makes it possible for young people to see that they do not have a monopoly on feelings of love or even lust! The fact that "oldÂ» wrinklies can have a good laugh too. Judi Dench was great, as always, it is a pity that we Useless "t get to see all the other" blonde bombeshells, the end was a bit rushed, I thought. I kept thinking as I watched David Jason would have done even better than Patrick Ian Holm, although it was quite adequate, as "transvestite" drummer. All in all a joyous film stands the night with the girls :)
