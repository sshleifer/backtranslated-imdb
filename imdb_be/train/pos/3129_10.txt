This is one of the best ever reunion event, with Adam West and Burt Ward parodying themselves and have fun while doing it. This is an amazing amount of effort that went into the details, in particular, it captures the feeling of the 1960's era, many Batcave, Wayne Manor, the costumes and the actors chosen to play the younger version of the West Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! It is 90 minutes worth your time, and it is fun for all fans of the classic 1960 TV series "Batman." I note that the videos of the "Batman" were from the film rather than the series itself, probably because of legal restrictions. Hopefully, the three season of the show are forthcoming on DVD.
