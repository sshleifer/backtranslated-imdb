I was very surprised by this film. Going to preview, without knowing anything about the film on one trailer I saw, except I thought it would be a Dude Where's My Car Festival kind of shit. I expected bad sexual jokes or humming and pathetic protagonist who will get fucked in the end, because it's just like working films. Instead, I got smart, surprisingly original film about a decent, ordinary guy who just never had sex. <br /> <br /> So, the film is full of "sex jokes and vulgar and sometimes hey-look-alike -nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa, rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you may know, in real life, are repaid friends, who are just trying to hook a brother and live your life. <br /> <br /> I went in thinking that this film was supposed to be full of shit, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's pretty top (c'mon, this is a film about the 40-year-old virgin!), But it's very smartly done. <br /> <br /> In the end, you are really pulling for the guy fucks that says a lot about the film, because, frankly, you really care when Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
