This film is so old, I never realized how young looking Ray Milland looked in 1936, I remember how he played in «Lost Weekend» more films. Ray plays the role of Michael Stewart, who is a very wealthy banker. There are three girls in this picture, which is not very happy about his father and mother, who are separated and they know their father is going to marry a young blonde who is a gold digger looking only for the rich sugar daddy. They hire people to pose as a very rich count, his name Ariszted graph (Mischa Auer), who drinks all the time, and it is without money and gives a lot of comic laughter throughout the entire picture. Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked at the police station and told the police chief that she was an opera star, and then Penny begins to sing with the most fantastic soprano voice I have every heard throughout the Police Department and sentenced began to applaud, which was very interesting and enjoyable scenes from the film. This is the first film debut Durbin and it became an instant success overnight, and went on to become a great film star with MGM Universal Studios after release.
