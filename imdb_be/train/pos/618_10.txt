This film is excellent. <br /> <br /> I was "fascinated" I have to say, and surprised, because, as clearly it was done. Throw, sequencing, effects ... everything! Lovely! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made it outstanding from the others in that it was written in a fun, wholesome way. <br /> <br /> For me, this idea of ​​modern fairy tales, It's like a modern Peter Pan ... simply amazing <br /> <br /> I certainly would like to buy a copy of this moment of getting into the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really two one ... MUST SEE !!!! 10 stars for this one!
