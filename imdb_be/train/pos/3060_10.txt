It's always sad when such films as "fringe," such as it passed the majority of film enthusiasts. "Panic" is a surprisingly compelling and poignant study of a character who feels trapped in the meaninglessness of their lives. <br /> <br /> William H. Mays, Alex, is as convincing as ever. It's a great actor, seems to have a special talent is not drawn on its deep, no matter how the shortcomings of his characters may be; we do not always justify the way of life heroes who he plays, but the emotions of fear and embarrassment that it causes us often too painfully familiar. The name, "Panic" initially seems paradoxical, given the lack of obvious emotions. Once Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. However, as this story unfolds, it becomes increasingly clear that the anger and despair, rather than indifference, are the driving forces of human existence. <br /> <br /> I have repeatedly reminded of his performance in "Fargo" another strong character-driven film. In both "Fargo" and "Panic" we see middle-aged man, who somehow seem out of sync with the rest of life. He lost his way, and the only way back is deceptively appears to be even in the dark. He knows that he is doing a bad choice, but despair overpowers composure and common sense. <br /> <br /> Alex connected with Sara, an old woman in '23 (mesmorizingly played by Neve Campbell), he meets the doctor's office. Thematically this union less randomly, the more the work of fate. Alex finds some comfort being with Sarah, feeling, perhaps, that it is a member of a vagabond, he who has lost his way and floats aimlessly through life, waiting helplessly its inevitable conclusion. <br /> <br /> Opting for such films as insightful and compelling way for Neve Campbell to answer these critics, some have questioned her acting ability. Too often, it is the characters she has played, that there is a weakness, not offering Campbell has no depth in which to flex her acting muscles. This view, however, may be a revelation for many. <br /> <br /> In the ideal world of cinema, not only would there still a lot of movies like "panic", but they would be evaluated and reached a much wider audience. When you watch movies for saturation and depth characteristics, not just the latest introduction of special effects, it is for you, "Panic" is not to be missed. A +.
