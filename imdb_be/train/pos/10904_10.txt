The most tender and really eye opening documentary ever created. I cried all the way through, from beginning to end. Watching the show you are immediately captured by the human struggle to live without pain, to live a life that we take for granted. The first time I heard the name, I was almost scared to see the program, it was hard for me to understand life in agony every day of every year of my life. I really felt for him. The sad part of the film, when Johnny picks his coffin. Could you imagine doing that? Especially since, despite the fact that he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened his own virtue. (Debra) Jonny is one of the few people who deserve true respect and admiration, it is the definition of the role model, as a true and undisputed hero he was!
