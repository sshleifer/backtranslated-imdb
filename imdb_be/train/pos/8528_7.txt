Like Peter Sellers, most of the time. I've never seen that it does not represent the highest class Brit to this film. He pulls it pretty good, although you can see bits of Inspector Clouseau in the mix. It's not the most interesting, while Goldie Hawn Sun arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected that youth Hawn put such a high performance. Her time was great, and her expression was priceless. The way she alternately shoots Seller Slutty character down and seduces its beautiful look. Verbal altercation, as I have rarely seen a film of that era. <br /> <br /> In the last thirty minutes of the film does not fall flat. It costs lowered only see the first sixty. Hawn naked for a few glorious seconds in the early stages. Rejoice ...
