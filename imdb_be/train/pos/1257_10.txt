I have read a few reviews of this film, and I have to say?!?! "What's wrong with you people," It was a great movie I thought that this movie was excellent from beginning to end, and story was well told I am. that people who do not like this film did not pay very good attention to the film. There are a number of very important scenes, if you are not paying attention you will be confused and the next scene does not make sense. I call on all those who do not like this film to watch it again and watch it alone, so that you really can turn into weight. The story made sense to me, and as I said, it was very well written. Each scene in the film is the moment, and everything fits together at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good in his role, as always. Laurence Fishburne was very rich as a Tanny Brown plays a very interesting character. Capshaw was nice touch as well, and it looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I was not expecting anything great from him, but he I took a great performance. Ed Harris was a real gem in the film. He plays a really sick person, and really makes you see how disturbed his character. See his eyes in their scenes, just great !!! In addition, there is a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of his first roles ... a good place to start. Great cast in this film! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to everyone that likes any of the actors or just loves thrillers. This is a great movie, and should be seen. Do not listen to all the opinions of other people to go see a movie and come to their own conclusions. I hope you will watch the movie, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
