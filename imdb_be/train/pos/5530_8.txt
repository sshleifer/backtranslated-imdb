A must see for anyone who likes to take pictures. stunning and exciting, it leaves you in the ore. I saw him twice once in the film and now on DVD. He holds up well on DVD, but on the big screen, it was something else. <br /> <br /> I took my two daughters to see it, and they loved it, my eldest cried end.but she was the one who wanted to see her again tonight, when she saw him in the video store. its simple retelling of the love child of nature and, in particular foxes well said. in some ways it reminded me of a bear in his documentary to tell the story not formate. which works for children very well. Sun is preached is very important, you make your own mind. <br /> <br /> But the star of this movie the filmmakers as they did what they did. It's amazing just amazing.
