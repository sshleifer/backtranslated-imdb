SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry cartoon classic with perfect idea, and almost every short gem. Although I must say that this is definitely inferior to short compared to one such classic Tom and Jerry shorts, there is no way you can hate this cartoon. Of course, it is clear to say that this is one of the worst of the first Tom and Jerry episodes, and I can say that I agree, but the fact is that all episodes of Tom and Jerry are great, but some are just better than others. Well, it would fit into the "other". <br /> <br /> This is the story Fraidy Cat. Those listening to old radio scary, and it becomes easy to scare. Jerry is watching how scary it is, and trying to scare him even more than it already is. It creates a terrible dilemma for Tom, and Tom becomes frightened by his wit, and his life. Jerry then places the sheet on the vacuum cleaner and controls, thereby making it look like a vacuum ghost. Meanwhile he knows that Jerry has done it all, and drives it. Especially then accidentally biting the house maid. However, in the end, Jerry ends the get scared when he sees his reflection in a bowl of flour. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not the best Tom and Jerry short there, but it's still fun and interesting part of the time. It makes me wish that there was more cartoon like this. Slapstick gags and in this, making Tom and Jerry is known as good as ever in this short, but he felt that something was missing in this. He felt more slowly than in most of the Tom and Jerry shorts. Anyway, it's a good short, it does not reach the other Tom and Jerry cartoon, but still nice. <br /> <br /> 7/10
