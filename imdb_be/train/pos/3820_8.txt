This is a story about, Shin-th, which moves in Milyang from Seoul with her young son in June to start more after the accidental death of her husband. Her husband was born here, and it opens a piano school, but has ambitions to have some land with the insurance money she received from death. If this is what the film was about, he probably would have been like a Hollywood movie, with its drop of some local guy, and be happy with her son in her new home. But this is not Hollywood. Her son was kidnapped and killed, allegedly because he knew that she has the money from the settlement. The process of grief, trying to move forward, trying to clear his conscience of guilt, all done in the best and the leading actress is excellent. The only caveat, and this should be stated that this is a depressing film. You need to know what's going on. Do you want to Shin-th to get through her grief and find a measure of happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, this is Korea and Korean cinema, especially drama, they do not pull no punches. Life is what happens to you. Great performances, but sometimes a hard film to watch because of the goings on. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do it.
