I started watching the apprentice about 4 years ago (possibly 5), and I really liked it. The first thing that strikes you about this comforting format, which, though similar to many other reality shows, in essence, is still very interesting. Donald Trump is an excellent as a host and chief judge of the show as well. The casting coup with smart people who have a good appearance to be selected as participants appreciated as well. But the best part of the show in New York. Mark Burnett, could have done a lot of shit in my time, but his appeal of cinema's great, it makes New York look like a character in itself. Jazz melodies, combined with excellent camera-work to make New York look spectacular. <br /> <br /> The Apprentice easy to do all the days of my 3 best reality show of all time (The Amazing Race no. 1, however). but just as amazing race this show is always better seen in moderate amounts. If you continue to watch it for a while the originality of the show will carry a fast (the same case as with TAR) .Star world, broadcasters in the country, has done a bang on job in presenting the show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, and then after 2 years showed the next two seasons, which has retained the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first 2 seasons. However, if you keep watching the show continuously, after which his charm and quick to fade.
