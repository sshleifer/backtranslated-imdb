I had some doubts about this film, I realized that this is a common tariff bill --- a formula movie about Christmas. Being in the middle of the heat wave in late June, we decided to give it a chance anyway, perhaps we would see snow. <br /> <br /> This movie was one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this is James Gandofini. He handed his lines with real wit about him and took a "daddy". <br /> <br /> If you want to have a pleasant, definitely check out this couple of hours.
