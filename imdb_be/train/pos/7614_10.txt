I'm obsessed! The country's history and the show is very exciting, but I love it. I'm on the 2nd season, the disc 5, and I'll tell you that I am now also attached to the characters. For anything bad to happen to them will seriously affect my vote for the show. And Michael on my list right now. Just kidding ... I'm so glad to see that there is a season 3, because I was too afraid to go to the disk 6, thinking it would be the end. I can not wait to see the rest at the moment. Thanks to director / producer / actor and Lost ... I really like to watch TV again. Before Lost I moved through each channel sad sleep because of my disappointment in the television, but I must say that they have lost my kind of entertainment!
