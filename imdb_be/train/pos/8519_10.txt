Strange ..... This may be a poor attempt to rework already restored Omen movie, but I'm sure that much. <br /> <br /> This is the last person who commented on the fool, this film was one of the kind, and the music Dark, Jerry Goldsmith himself would have been applauding the film. <br /> <br /> excellent recommendations from Myself Watch or buy this film. <br /> <br /> I collect horror movies and soundtracks, so listen to what I have to say, nothing more than an idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that does not fascinate me, the ending. <br /> <br /> According to the prophecy, it is all false, including the final conflict, and left behind. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion be .... there are great movies ... and should be considered before the Great Depression falls upon us, and in front of the Democrats to chair too. <br /> <br /> So the signature .... Jacob Eder ... farmer mastermind.
