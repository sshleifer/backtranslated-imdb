Wow, this movie had a great influence on me, it touched me. This is an amazing story about a girl in Cambodia, which is sold into the sex trade. I can not stop thinking about the fate of a little girl named Holly. Setting realistic film, the film was sensational, I can not imagine that someone has left him due to wanting to help make changes to this terrible problem that exsists. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was very very moving. It was one of the best films I've seen this year. <br /> <br /> girl who plays Holly does a fantastic job with his character. Ron Livinston gives excellent performance. The film moved me to tears, he said an important message that needs to be heard around the world. Each person must go see this movie. I think this film will make a difference, I loved it!
