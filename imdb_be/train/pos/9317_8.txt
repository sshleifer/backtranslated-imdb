I saw this film criticized with the statement, "If you can get past moralizing ..." This misses the point. Moralizing in the mind of the beholder, as it were. This is a decent film with a standard murder mystery, but with a clear twist, that halfway through the surface. Resolution leaves the viewer wondering, "What would I do in this situation?" And I have to believe that this is exactly what the director intended. To this end, and by the end of entertaining the audience, the film is a success. I also like the way that violence is never on stage, but in close proximity to the camera. We know what has just happened; it's just not smitten down before us, and then rub in the face, as it would be today with modern bloodthirsty and dressing. Furthermore, violence is not a point. The fact is, the moral dilemma of the protagonist, who skillfully, though exciting, resolved.
