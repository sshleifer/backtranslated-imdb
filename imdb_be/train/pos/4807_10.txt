I really thought that this movie was excellent. Not only that, the story is true, but the style and luxurious but cozy. I was a fan of Emily Blunt image of Victoria and how she kept her spirit, even if it was forced into virtual exile, and in her youth. Dumb reflects the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. Romantic elements of the film is so true and tender, that by the end of the film you really understand why Vicotria decided to live the rest of their days in mourning Albert. <br /> <br /> technical aspects of the film are noteworthy as well. I appreciated the beautiful score that is moving along quite strange with the dramatic movement of history. I also considered to be an outstanding cinematography, some of the scenes, leaving me completely choked due pomp and splendor they draw. <br /> <br /> There have been so few films this year, as beautiful and tender as this film, and it rates as one of the best in 2009!
