I'm tired of people judging films on their "historical authenticity". This movie people !! Authors and directors have put their own spin to the story! There are a number of films out there that is not quite right with the story .... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: American Legend, the last of the Mohicans .... all fantastic films that are moderately historically inaccurate . If you want to see some fine actors doing what they do best, then I suggest you watch this movie and not have to worry about the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the movie, the plot and one of the greatest actors of our time.
