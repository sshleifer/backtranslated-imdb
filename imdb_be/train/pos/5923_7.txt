A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) moved to a small town, and we have to deal with an average teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, a beautiful girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and one hell of a big secret. <br /> <br /> So, technically, it is "a bad movie." But who cares? It's so much fun! <br /> <br /> impossible things (including maize) occurs, people are worried about kitty cats have a bad one-liners, there is too much cheese to cope! <br /> <br /> So, yes. You will enjoy it. Lot. He will not move you, touch you, scare you, excite you in any way, but it will keep you entertained and laughing!
