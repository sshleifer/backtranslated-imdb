I have no idea how Texan (director Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow has never pulled it off, but to see it again will remind you what all the fuss is about Ms. Paltrow was in the first place! I've long since left his wife and still feel that it is rather boring in her Oscar-winning "Shakespeare in Love" performance, but it receives all the blows right here - it is almost perfect as Emma Woodhouse. Perhaps she won her Oscar for Shakespeare, but it should be remembered for it. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is surrounded by a large supporting cast, including Toni Collette, Scacchi, Juliet Stevenson and others ... North very attractive, as the love interest, even if the script lying around a bit in his declaration of love for Paltrow ( in the process, allowing all the stress to merge their relations); a few years later, Ewan hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96, and I personally believe Picaresque Alan Cumming trellis presence than at present. But outstanding, no doubt, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; that this version requires the scene where Emma brings with Miss Bates, she is a symbol whose fate drags us. The film is worth watching (again, even) for one only of its implementation. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a wonderful age with the charm of pity and more than enough subtlety to understand the British class system. Well worth a rental (because it is unlikely Paltrow will ever be this good again - but we will always have Emma).
