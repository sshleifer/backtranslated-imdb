There are numerous films related to WW2, but rather a kind of Night's mother among them: In this film, we are introduced to Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin, and was married to a German woman, Helga note (Lee), who decides to take the role of a spy : more specifically, the CIA agent Major Virtanen (Goodman) enlists Campbell, who becomes Nazi promoter to enter the upper echelons Nazi regime. Nevertheless, the fact that the US government will never recognize the role of Campbell in the war for national security reasons, and therefore Campbell became a hated figure in the United States. After the war, he was trying to hide his identity, but the past return to haunt him. Only his "friend" Virtanen, but even he can not do much for the avalanche of events that fall on the bad Campbell ... <br /> <br /> The story is deeply moving as we see the tragedy of Campbell, who, though a great patriot, treated disregard all those around him. Not only that, but he gradually realizes that even those who are closest to him, there are many secrets of his own. Vonnegut gives us a moving atmosphere, desperately Campbell building and almost breathless spectator <br /> <br /> Nolte plays a role in his life, in my opinion. it is even better than in the «Affliction», although in both roles, he plays the tragic figure who is destined to self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said about the entire cast as a whole. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book, so I can not assess how the film can be compared with it. In any case, this is something that does not matter here My criticism of the film itself, and the movie is well worth 9/10.
