Caprica episode (S01E01) made good as a pilot. In fact, this episode is exactly the same content as the pilot DVD release. That having been said, the episode 01 gives a very significant background is very popular series «Battlestar Galactica» (both the original and the remake, 2007). This applies most significantly to the Series 2007. As trending stories of science fiction in recent years, this series explores the "virtual" life or the environment. In addition, we gave a lot of background on the family line of Adam, as well as their relationship with the unsolved (in the series Battlestar Galactica) the creator of the Cylons. For the most part, this is the first episode revolves around the popular theme of "virtual" life, and (as expected) the early life of the colonies, and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> Overall, I quite enjoyed this episode. Although it is not a new material for yourself or someone that already saw the DVD release of the pilot Caprica, the series seems to be very promising. As is the case with many pilots, Episode 01 leaves us with a cliff hanger so as to provide the following for the audience (sci-fi community). I'm definitely going to continue to monitor the determination and development. <br /> <br /> I give this series of 8 stars.
