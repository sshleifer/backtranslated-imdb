I watched it last night after he had not seen him for several years. It's a really fun movie with a bunch of people you do not know were there. Arkin shines, as always. Check it out; you will not be dissappointed. By the way, it was just released on DVD, and in spite of its packaging, it is wide. Transfer bit, but at least the entire movie visible. ;-)
