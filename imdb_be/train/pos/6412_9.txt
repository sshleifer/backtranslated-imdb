Of course, I am glad that the film was made about the strange stories of life in Brashear. Coming, as it did in the era of civil rights, Brashear became a source of inspiration for people of all minority groups, who are not willing to settle for the status expected. <br /> <br /> Brashear as played Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an example in the conduct of life he chose. Very similar to Jackie Robinson, who integrated baseball and made him stick to his character and behavior. As Brashear, Gooding knows that he does not want the life of sharecroppers that his father Carl Lumbly has Lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than it has received. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman integrated the armed services after World War II, the Navy still have their limitations. A black man can only be a cook or valet officer, real combat troops refused to him. It's not good enough for Gooding, apply to become a Navy deep-sea diver. <br /> <br /> After the school of diving in Bayonne, NJ, Gooding gets all thrown at it is, basically, Master Chief Petty Officer responsible, Robert De Niro. DeNiro may have some remaining prejudices, but he is still a hero and one that can inspire when you can get passed the racial inequality. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men Of Honor is a chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. Of course, they come from different places, but as they get to know one another, as are men of honor. <br /> <br /> Other good performances mentioned are Charlize Theron as the wife of Robert De Niro and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school, the guy just wants the Navy withdrew for reasons you'll see. <br /> <br /> The men of honor inspirational stories about people with courage to spare, and the ability to change.
