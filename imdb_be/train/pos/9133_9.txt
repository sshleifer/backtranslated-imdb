I was young to have ever known about the Prince, but I saw a lot of Purple Rain Tee novelty of the last few years, and I thought they were cool, but I do not want to buy a shirt, I do not know anything about. So one Saturday he came on guard and I decided to see. I did not know what the movie will be about before I watched it, but it was fine as soon as I found out. In the film, the prince was not known as a prince, but how "child". All performances, which are great for me, but my favorite was Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I would die for you. All the songs are related to what is going on through out the movie when his mother and father always fight song when doves cried described what he felt. I also like how smart prince with the way he looked after Apallonia. I liked it when the prince and Appallonia first met at the club, and he was standing over her, and then, as soon as she turned around, he was gone! great movie, and now I can not even find one of these t-shirts :(
