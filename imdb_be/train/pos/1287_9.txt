"Let's Bowl" began on local TV in Minneapolis. He came on late at night, you would come across while surfing the channel after 7 bottles. <br /> <br /> Hamm Even in the ads were locally produced, indicating Wally outside grumpy bar, holding a microphone and stammering nervously - "Ahhh ... to you, Steve Sedahl.» I do not know why, but one always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling contest featured in the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to the comments and clips. Sedahl played straight, balanced Rich Kronfelda's weird and hilarious "Wall Hotvedt." Highlights included segments such as "How to properly dispose of the old bowling ball» (Chuck them in the lake) and "for Dating Tips", where the duo "date" a pair of whores and Wall finish with bitter complaint, "I could have done it myself! »<br /> <br /> Another segment - the duo did on their holidays - Steve showed in beer may strewn hovel, scrapers from the refrigerator, and Wally struggled to climb on the rocks in the waterfall Taylor dressed his tight pale blue blazer and oversized headphones. Hilarious! <br /> <br /> Wally reverence comments about the "League Bowler," and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism for various splits and highlights. <br /> <br /> «Let's Bowl" was picked up by Comedy Central and had a few good moments, but the network never know what to do with it, running it in prime time and stressing the "competition" of bowling, which has never been the meaning of the show. Constant rollers interrupted stream and side code (Ernie, pig, Butch, etc.) were more distraction than anything else. All this seemed rushed and kind of forced. Even Jon Stewart dissed Let's Bowl on the Daily Show - (lacking the lame, the snide jokes?) - disgraceful treatment of a show that deserves much better <br /> <br /> How often does "draw the Cup." They come in the world of modern television, locally flavored blend of comedy genius and full of shit? Networks have "total crap" part down cold, but it's sad to see them kill a dark, strange, funny little gem like "Let's Bowl.» <br /> <br /> Here I hope that will put it on a DVD .
