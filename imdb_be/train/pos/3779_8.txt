I received the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas, and I had to get a second, when I saw it in the store. This one was (I think), just as funny as the first, but much wierder history. It was interesting how they had their own Personnal hell, and how they were supposed to play death. The funny thing was that they were playing with him in a silly little game as a clue. The only thing I would change is the station, and death, are in a group, but other than that it was great.
