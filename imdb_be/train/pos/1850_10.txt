This is my favorite movie ever. I watched it at least 10 times, and I cry every time. My family asks me not to look so I do not have a crying fit. I think I love that this is a true story written by Antwone himself just how much I love this film. It operates at the highest level, and the actors were perfect for their roles. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie that he has done so far. I took care of a little boy who was also born in prison. He was the most precious little boy I've ever met. Now, he was admitted to the lovely family who fought for it for nearly two years. I saw this film while the fight is still going on, and his future was not sure, and I'm so happy that he is safe and loved. And I'm so happy Antwone happy and found his family. <br /> <br /> I would like to know more about it and how it was after a meeting with his family. I just can not say enough good things about it !!
