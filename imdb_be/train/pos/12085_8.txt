Shirley MacLaine to another tailor made role. As the aunt to a single mother in Chicago in 1962 by the working class, the veteran character actress gets another some training as a fearless woman who will not let anyone set-back to win her spirit success. Children, pre-teen boy and girl who are drawn to his energetic Aunt Zoe, although many tricks and jokes learned from it, and is applied in all the wrong features will eventually get them expelled from school. <br /> <br /> the story cleverly shrouded in the Cuban missile crisis, with all the social consequences. Men build bomb shelters, people watch news programs that seemed only to television, in the lunchroom, and the general fog of anxiety and fear in the air. If the "harmless" miracle blown out of proportions, the culmination of a conclusion, nevertheless makes the viewer feel good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will come tomorrow! Obviously, the production of a small budget, this is a sweet little film, full of magic, it was Sunday mornings were made. With multiple-choice "oldies" thrown into an effective Sound Track, the whole family is sure to enjoy it. ****
