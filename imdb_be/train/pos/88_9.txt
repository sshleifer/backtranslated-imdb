It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The film refers to real life and, like drugs, can play an important role. Despite the fact that this film seems to be made with a low budget, I found it to be exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> Some of them may not know how to tell the story and the script is not the direction. However, if a person gets so deep into drugs as these symbols, sun life direction. I feel that this movie is an accurate representation of what can happen to a person when they are faced with extreme temptation. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are new to the industry. Nevertheless, they pulled him very well. Everyone seemed to do a good job and get into the character accordingly. <br /> <br /> I think that this film could be a good tool to use when communicating with a person, or a loved one who is involved in drugs and seems to be spiraling out of control. This film might just scare them enough to change their ways.
