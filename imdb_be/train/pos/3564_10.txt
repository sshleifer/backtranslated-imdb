{Possible spoilers coming up ... you're warned.} <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite musicals and movie musicals! (Another Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, sometimes the glitter (not to mention the song) show is lost in the transition from stage to screen. It is, for the most part, DO not the case. <br /> <br /> A lot of divine, bright and colorful, the characters are larger than life and you can not help but love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (So ​​glad to know that they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All of the actors "bouncing ball" (that is, has an unrivaled chemistry) to perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon absolutely plausible, as the owner of the oldest permanent floating crap game in New York, and the most well-known player who makes a bet on even the most minute of things--, such as fever going up to 104 if it does not take penicillin. Sweet, fresh face Jean Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah (although it is true, her singing pipe is not as prominent as Isabel beagle or Josie de Guzman) - mission doll with a heart of gold and riding heal all. And last but certainly not least (my list anyway) Miss Vivian Blaine reprising her Broadway role of Miss Adelaide-- Hot Box singer and dancer who would like to finally finish her 14 years of involvement with Nathan marriage and rid itself of psychosomatic cold he gave her. <br /> <br /> First, kudos Stubby Kaye and BS bullets as they reprise their role of Broadway, like Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There have never been two players more attractive than these guys. <br /> <br /> Brando is excellent, as usual, and although he did not receive the voice of Robert Aldo or Peter Gallagher, you forget it--, he is determined to bring the sense of everything possible to his role as Sky Masterson. "Success Be A Lady» gives me shivers every time I see that he favored number. Especially nice to hear him say: "Dad ... I got cider in my ear» <br /> <br /> Simmons charming and pleasant as a good fit for her appearance, voice and the way she carries. a. you have been so dear to her not only to win the Sky (or, until the end, to believe him), but to help people overcome their gambling, drunkenness and other sins and live with God. her rendition of "If If I were a Bell, "a magnificent, to put it mildly ,! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is a man. he is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit-- and here he sings part of Sam Levene b adveya never cast could not (a terrific actor, but the guy was tone deaf ... go figure it out). I really liked the addition of the "Adelaide" song ... want some guy to sing like that to me. cool, slippery behavior Frank goes beyond this film. But most importantly, you want to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine just perfection in this role. with emphasis on her belting out "Adelaide's Lament" it's just amazing. And she, too, my favorite part of the film. She really makes you feel at Adelaide ... especially when she cries in front, and then again during «Sue Me». I still have not decided how I «Pet Me Poppa» rather than «a bushel and peck" ... maybe, I love them equally. In any case, it makes a fantastic so as «Take Back Your Mink.» (I am sad that they left the «hollanderize» from the movie ...) It is completely amazing, not to mention fun, and my favorite part of the film . <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this film, their jargon. This mixture was high grade and street slang. Do they use the "It", "I" or "It". It is always "this", "I" and "it means." In general, Guys and Dolls is one of my all time favorite movies and musicals, and this is one that you should take the time to watch every time she comes on. My only complaint? No "Marry The Man Today." Now it's a good song.
