Delicious bit of trash is 65 minutes long do not seem to be a second too short, my name is Julia Ross returns to the English tradition of things is not what they seem - Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes is one example. C-to-work Julia Ross (Foch) finds a dream job in the new employment agency in London, whose sinister representative, seems very eager to find out if she is living with relatives or boyfriend. Saying in debt, she wakes up (having been drug) in a huge pile Manderley on the Cornish Coast, ostensibly as the wife of the yeast-to-donuts George Macready, reflecting a disturbing interest in knives and ice picks, His caring, allowing mom irresistible Dame May Whitty (this . just a noisy model of efficiency on the other side of good against evil, than she is busy in The Lady Vanishes) The nightmare vision of the story unfolds claustrophobically; we know what is happening, but can not say the poor Julia. This film, oddly enough, is regularly given pride of place as one of the earliest (and very few British films) Noir. I think it is closer to the Gothic old dark house tradition than the American wet pavement and urban corruption; This, however, express a more modern, psychoanalytical mind. Whatever you call it, it remains sharply satisfied thriller.
