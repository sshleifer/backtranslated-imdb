Many people like this movie and many more like it, but it seems to me that all of this for the wrong reasons. Scarface has to be loved and love, but not how it was there. <br /> <br /> A lot of people say that the operation was over-the-top, but who better to do on-the-top character than Al Pacino. To say that Pacino went-top here would be an understatement. Nevertheless, he does it so well, he just brings the inner demon of you so well. His character Tony Montana was not such a great guy to begin with, but his lust for power just bring his illness greed to another level; inhuman level. Of course, from time to time Pacino seems to be a little cartoonish and surreal, but it does not to me seem to be responsible at all. The supporting cast has done his job very well. Michelle Pfeiffer was not really in her best, but it certainly fits the role she played. On the other hand, Steven Bauer was at his best, still he is Steven Bauer. Mastrantonio was good, and Michelle Pfeiffer fits her role very well. Robert Loggia I always liked to look at just to see him yelling. In addition to Pacino, they were not actually any outstanding or memorable performances. Everything just seemed to fit their role, being there. They did not fit in very well, but there were quite convincing. <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma has made a very good job of directing this film. Every time an actor can become larger than life to his work which should give credit to the director, and I will certainly give De Palma that. Brian De Palma, though not given respect, is a very versatile director according to my calculations. He knows how to direct films in their genre, but sometimes it is not managed well. That's where he does it on all counts gangster film, but some are much better than this because De Palma. <br /> <br /> The writing was great it was just purely Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of the movie and saw that Oliver Stone wrote it, I was not surprised. It is a testament to it, though. I always though it as a great writer, and for me it shows that it is again with a scar. No one knows how to write surreal reality for the film than Oliver Stone. <br /> <br /> The music was good, but not that great. It is certainly not my favorite by Giorgio Moroder. The music was a bit too 80s-ish for me, but it does not irritate me. The cinematography was good, not amazing, but really, who cares with a film like this. <br /> <br /> This was probably one of the most influential films of the past 25 years, but as previously mentioned it for the wrong reasons, people need to understand that the character of Tony Montana is not a hero, he's a monster. He does not inspire in any case. He is greedy, blood-thirsty, uneducated, and he consumed. Nevertheless, he is a role model for many people, because it is in some sense or another rebel, but perhaps most of all, because it is wrong gangster. Vigilante is as Tereasa mother near the scar. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film, but that it shows that Tony Montana entirely a real problem. If we or the people authorities would like to close the man as he's down, we could do it, but we do not. In a bizarre twisted way, he is a necessity in our society. He's someone you could blame the fallen and feel better doing it. Tony Montana this world are the scapegoats of our society. This in no way excuses people like him. Instead it is a great reminder that we should not justify or afford to do bad things just because we measure up or think that measure more than the best gangster or drug dealer. I love this movie, because it is more than a film about corruption, it's a movie that makes you strangely self-talk.
