As with all the other reviewers, this film has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. I remember going to the library explores all that I could to this story. I even wrote to PBS stations for more information. Despite all this, all I could find out what it was a story published in the newspaper in the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> Fastward in 2002, after several years of searching for Ebay on a weekly basis and there it was, VHS copy of the film. It was another contender, but I was determined to win this film. Loser bidder wrote to me asking for a copy of which I gave her. Despite possessing a copy, I still searched and searched, finally, find a website that sold a DVD copy of the film. You can find it at the following address: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
