We know that he has a reputation for rough suspects. Good cop, but get out of control easily. Why is it that he hates them so much? <br /> <br /> Maybe he hates himself. This part of himself he had inherited from his father? This dark side that can bring it right at the end of the sidewalk, into the gutter? What if the dark side hidden "cabinet"? Note: when Dixon meets Scalise (3 times), the guy was lying on the bed, and he has only the people around him for the company (irony "Girls" poster pinned to the wall next to my bed!) <Br. /> <br /> Scalise acting funny: the influence of manners, bend neck proudly, defiantly, pushing his inhaler (poppers?)
