I've seen this movie years ago, late night TV. Then he went to the title of "Stairway to Heaven." Even as a child, I remember how deeply moved by the story and the visual effects surprised trial (those who saw it knows I'm talking about). Such an idea! The perfect combination of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this film is right up there with the greatest classics ever: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This film is rated extremely high IMDB voters and rightly so - more than 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10; more than 84% rated it 8 or higher to 10. I was surprised that it was not included in the top 250 films, until I realized, so that few people have seen / appreciated this film, as compared with those in the list. What a pity. I hope this film gets released on DVD in Region 1 (North America), so that 1) I can buy it, and 2), while others show a hidden treasure.
