Who would have thought Andy Griffith "Helen Crump" (Aneta Korsaut) was a film by Steve McQueen in his past? But this is only one of a number of weird and wonderful things about the movie Final 1950, the teenage-fighting creatures that can be described as Rebel Without A Cause meets God knows what from outer space. Rebel Steve McQueen (who soon decided that "Steve" sounds less stiff), good boy, only with enough wildlife to be interesting; yet very useful understanding of the aforementioned girlfriend Aneta Korsan. It was bad enough when their date was broken teenage Rodders hot, but they are much more confused when they are faced with a gel-like, man-eater What is it that is going to land on your own HOTROD meteor - and starts entering townfolk right and left. But whether adults believe them? Of course not, they know that they're just kids! <br /> <br /> The film is a little Bopper his bopping a little better. Actors take quite ambitious scenario is very serious, with many penetrating gaze into each one's eyes, and "adult" supporting cast, probably says, "Children" very third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the film of his being, which is well apparent, well made, and are often able to generate a surprising degree of uncertainty. And although it is clear that on the cheap side (check these miniature sets, guys!), Blot is actually quite well made film - is that catchy little song thrown in for good measure. 40-plus crowd (including myself) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia, but this does not prevent them from buzzing right along with the younger set had whole milk and white bread 1950s sensibility, and the film will be a great choice for any family movie nights or more sophisticated "adults only" together. Make lots of Jello cubes for movie snacks! Gary F. Taylor, known GFT, Amazon Reviewer
