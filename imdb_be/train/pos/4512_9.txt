I saw this movie today and I must say that it was much better than I expected it would be about two hours before you see it. Personally, I had some prejudice because of the language, but it was completely changed my idea. The film was in most cases surprisingly good with a lot of actors and actresses performances. It was a story about a boy who had a dream, and who did everything to get to it. It really touched me, and as a film, which is based on a true story, he convinced me. The new school, psycho school director and a young boy who gets famous with a new teacher, a slightly different one than the other, and the struggle for things, even if they seem to not work. He showed how little things can make a huge change in many things, and how the difference can sometimes cause difficult situations. In addition, I think that an actor election has turned out perfectly. He really felt that you were a man, watching the episodes, as an outsider, when they occurred. Before you ruin the film with praise, I must admit that some things and situations that do not look and feel realistic..like one where the headmaster knocked frit aki. Martin before class, at the end of the film. He was really badly beaten, but the only thing that led to it, was a bit of blood from the nose when comparing that to the first beaten in the beginning, when Fritz got some stitches..well I think every film has its own disadvantages ..have to say that if I ever find anywhere this DVD from the store, it is certain that, I'm taking him with me.
