This is what I expected when star trek DS9 premiere. Nha easy DS9. It was a great show in its own right, but he never gave the fans more of what they want. The enterprise is that show. While one that is similar to the original campaign it is different enough to be original in its own way. This makes the idea of ​​stimulating the intelligence to us again. And it was one of the main ingredients that made the original so loved. Another ingredient for success was the relationship that developed between the crew members. The audience really cared deeply for the crew. The company has broad prospects in this area as well. The chemistry between Bakool and Blalock seems to be very promising. Although the sexual tension in the show can often be a crutch, I can feel the tension in the enterprise can lead to much more and say a lot more than usual. I think if we are dealing with such characters span different races or species, even, we get some very interesting ideas and television. In addition, it should be noted performances Blelki very convincing as Vulcan T`Pol and Bacula does whim and strength of character that provides great performance. Other actors delivered good performances too. Has only gripes are as follows. Theme. It's good, it's different, but a little light to the heart, for my taste. We need something more grandiose. Not to be orchestral. Maybe something with a bit more electronic sound will be enough. And my one complaint. They sell too many adds. They could fix this by selling fewer ads, or make all shown two parters. Otherwise, we will eventually see the final act shows getting wrapped up too quickly, as it was one of my complaints about Voyager.
