I was concerned that my daughter can get the wrong idea. I think that the character "Dark-Heart" is a bit on the rough side, and I do not like the way he shifts in forming an "average" frogs, foxes, boy ?? I was wrong, this film was made for my child, but not for me. She "gets it" when he went (under?) My head. Of course, I do not "get". This is not one of the new children's film that adults will also enjoy. It is right for the young, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is not some undesirable political broadcast. There is no magic key that will save the world from ourselves, no one has an abundance of access rights, and not everyone is happy all the time. And as a side effect, no one dies! ?? russwill.
