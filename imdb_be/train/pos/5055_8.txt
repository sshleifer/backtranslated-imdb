I was not expecting much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as the Great Gray Owl ?? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then the story began, turned in a beautifully photographed and paced film. I was surprised and happy in the (mostly) true story. It made me want to learn more about this fascinating character, which means the director has fulfilled its purpose, and the film was a success!
