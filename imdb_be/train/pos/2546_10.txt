This is roughly in the same league as `The Black Cat», though I would give it 9 rather than 9+. This praise for the film, which was so much undervalued, it's amazing! <br /> <br /> `The Invisible Ray» is part horror, part drama and, of course, a part of science fiction. For the film, made in 1936 sci-fi elements were much ahead of their time. A mixture of horror, drama and science fiction are the perfect combination, while exerted by Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hilayer captures many elements that James Whale did so often. What I want to say that this film is terrible and well shot. The scene with the gargoyles outside Lugosi room is a great example of mood. It is an outstanding point in the film, which is so sadly lacking in today's films of this genre. <br /> <br /> Like `The Black Cat» and "Island of Lost Souls, I can not understand why this film has not yet been released on DVD. If you believe some of the rubbish that has already been transferred to DVD it is that much more mysterious. <br /> <br /> In any case, watch this movie if you get the chance. When it comes out on DVD to capture it quickly and put it in a place of honor in your DVD library.
