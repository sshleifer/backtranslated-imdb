In this case, the film is not the only film Dirty Harry, which Clint Eastwood not only stars, but produces and directs as well, you know, it should be good. While some say that the Enforcer is the best of the series, I do not completely agree. In my opinion, except for the original Dirty Harry Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are only two deserve to be in the series. Although the Enforcer is a good movie with a couple of good action sequences, it does not get dirty, rough impact that the other three film making. This film captures all the excitement that makes Clint Eastwood movie is good, and he has a quote that makes the Dirty Harry movie is good. The Harry Hole is «..Well do I, punk?"; in Magnum Force «But the man must know his limitations"; and this is its "Go ahead. Make my day. "Also, in this film it is good to see a change of scenery as you get a little tired of seeing the same old streets of San Francisco and in other films of the series. With more action roles Clint Eastwood and Sandra Locke and good directing Clint, it is in my opinion the best Dirty Harry sequel ever.
