it is far from being one of the most beautiful portraits of the man that I have ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is their native person who is to die. He looks at the earth, and nature with such admiration and respect, that it is primitive in the best sense of the word. its purity, honesty and kindness breathe clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life instant works of art. I was amazed at how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he took them to an end. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish humor embraces his disappointment brilliantly. film shoot elegant and contains the same stream that has Goldsworthy art. it combines nature and art at a minimum, as it itself. Cost of Fred Frith is quite organic, it combines all together without interfering with his naturalistic sound. it's a whole lot of work in every aspect. it has no boundaries as far as age goes.
