I saw the movie with two adult children. Although it was not so prudent as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. In a movie theater, surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was no sound, so I know that the children enjoyed it. There parents looked busy. Death and the apparent death of characters led corresponding intermittent and comments. I hope people understand that this film was made for children. As such, it was a success, although I liked it, too. Personally, I liked Scrat !!
