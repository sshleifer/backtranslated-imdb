I just want to say that I'm so glad that someone finally blurted out in this film. Bravo "The Spaz" Bravo! This film is funny slapstick movie. Especially for the student film! I just want to pay tribute to Spazz ridiculous amount of time to care, to find such a rare picture, and then comments! Most people I know do not have such time, especially since few will read the end. Kudos to you, sir! In any case, the film is behind the thin storyline, which is at least an incredibly simple and stupid. I understand that the idea of ​​creating a satire of Charlie's Angels, but why employ such brutal actress! Besides, what kind of directed the act, write, produce and edit a picture! Select a job and put all my love into it man! It is such a shame, because I had heard that he had made a good movie about killer toothbrush. Again, thanks for Spazz pulling the curtain on this film, people like you, a rare find.
