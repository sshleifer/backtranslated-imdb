Now that's a movie right from my childhood, my family usually are taped; but the view was intercepted and Losted for many years. I was fortunate to now watch the whole movie on youtube.com; I was very fond of this wonderful film that I watched as a kid, and again after viewing (online), I still do today. My favorite song from the movie "Sweet hearts and paper flowers" (I will always remember that sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (about who animated one) that some of the entertainers are dated 1930 (WOW! it's like 47 years old).
