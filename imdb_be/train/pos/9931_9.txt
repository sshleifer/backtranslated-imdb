I rented a domino on a whim, without even knowing that it was inspired by a true story, and even if it is the least likely, and the truth biopic you will probably see. I found it quite strange. <br /> <br /> Richard C. Kelly writing it overflows together mass plots and novels in 2 hours pure entertainment. And once you've seen it a few times you get it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves a perfect Hollywood life conduct is not so subtle and perfect career. He has a sharp style of acid trip, presented by director Tony Scott. And fast-paced music and editing, it provides visual flash to keep your attention, with smooth performance and unexpected comedy, the film is well made and nice and had to reach a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I think it's for those who want to think and have fun at the same time for 2 hours.
