It's a bit embarrassing to have a character named Young gig in the movie ... plays Gig Young. But this film, where Gig got its name, as well as a good momentum of his career after playing small parts with a different name. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go against most of the other comments and say that I really enjoyed this film, mainly because of the energetic performance of Barbara Stanwyck Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring and evil as the eldest of three daughters, whose mother had died on the Lusitania, and whose father was later killed during the war Woar <br /> <br /> As a "person" in the house, Fiona I stood firm for many years against the settling of his father's will, therefore, will allow the type of Donald Trump named Charles Barkley to get the family home. But Fiona to keep the secret, why she hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald average, flirty sister, who is married to an Englishman, but wants a boyfriend of her younger sister (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan Stanwyck, it is not to miss.
