The film of this caliber will affect many of the films, after its release for years to come. `Chinese Ghost Story» falls into this category. This is probably one of the best horror films made during the 1980s; perhaps one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have crafted a film that appeals to every horror fan. The history of all-consuming and original. Villains are respectively alarming and frightening. terrible and atmospheric sets. There is even a little bit of blood and blood to satisfy the fan spray at home. But do not let `Horror» LABEL scare you if you're not a fan of the genre. This movie can be stored in a variety of categories. <br /> <br /> Script cleverly mixed drama, comedy, horror, kung fu, and romance genres into a beautiful cinematic luxury pizza. `Chinese Ghost Story» beautiful epic love story told, fortunately without gratuitous nudity and / or explicit sexual scenes that ruin many Hollywood love stories'. Those scare romantic story elements can sit back and enjoy fast-fencing and 'wire-fu ". If this is not enough, the actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma ensure a sufficient number of humorous situations to satiate your appetite for comedy. This film offers something for every fan of the movie. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a talented actor, but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian.

As we paddle how absurd Taoist, which helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, this film is very impressive even by today's standards. The direction is excellent. I want today's Hollywood executives will be looking for talented artists like Siu-Tung Ching, and leaving on a regular MTV video or Pepsi commercial 'directors. The cinematography is gorgeous. You must pay any filmmaker that can make the film look good, when the majority of its key scenes take place in the dead of night. Special effects make-up is second to none. In fact, most of the effects of being in this film blow out shoddy CGI ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films. <br /> <br /> Since its release, "Chinese Ghost Story» spawned two sequels worthy, full-length animated movie, and countless imitations. None of the films that followed it or copy it managed to capture the magic of this classic, however. This film required viewing for any fan of horror or simply those looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 of 10 <br /> <br />
