Sarah Silverman Program is very similar to Sarah's own Stand; It's so over the top with the prejudices that you can not take it to heart. The fact, however, that while the majority of all people would "get it" that does not mean that they will appreciate it. This is a very polarizing and one-dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can also refuse it. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because every episode so far has been as good as in the past. <br /> <br /> like all shows, though, it It is not perfect. Personally, I love this program, but there are some huge faults with it. funny, but a hundred songs Racist eyuts much faster than Silverman seems to understand - a problem I had with "Jesus is MagicÂ», and seems as if Silverman surrendered quotas for songs in an episode that does not need to exist not to mention the fact that.. while the lyrics of the songs she writes good music, well, it's not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind that while this show is for some reason appeal to fans of Monty Python, Upright Citizens Brigade, etc., it is nothing like the show. I can watch Monty Python all day, but how much I love this show, I can not see more than a half-hour limit at the time. He gets a flat very quickly. a repeat value for this show also low - the second time around the episode quite funny, and the third time, in my opinion, it's a sad <br /> <br /> However, this is the first time really. Very funny. Give him a chance.
