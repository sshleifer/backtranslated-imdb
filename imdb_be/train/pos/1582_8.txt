Another small part of the larger picture puzzles of the Holocaust is turned face up in the docudrama about the Rosenstrasse protest in Berlin, the event, I did not know about, which began in late February 1943 Details are given in the appendix that follows this overview. <br /> <br /> The film is the story establishes the history of this protest in another, modern history, which begins in New York today. Here, prosperity, non-religious Jewish woman whose husband had just died, shocking his child and others insisting on a very Orthodox funeral ritual. It goes further by requiring that non-Jewish groom her daughter to leave the house. <br /> <br /> plight daughter of Hannah (Maria Schrader), then learn for the first time from the older cousin, who during World War II, in Berlin, her mother, and then 8 years old, was taken in and protected by the Aryan woman . Hannah provides everything goes to Berlin, and believes that it is a woman, Lena Fischer, is now 90. Khan easily convince a woman to tell her story. It all seems rather too pat. <br /> <br /> film is then improved focusing over long flashback events mainly in 1943 year, which was surrounded by a protest, wherein the central dummy character is the same as Ms. 33 Fischer (Cate played great on Rome) Baroness and pianist, who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained in the Rosenstrasse site. <br /> <br /> Take short descriptive weave back to the present from time to time, and ends in New York again. While the scenes are now rich colors 1943 scenes washed, strong gray-blue tones. <br /> <br /> The quality of action is usually pretty good, we could have expected, given the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and in the direction of Margarethe von Trotta, the most famous female film director of the New German Cinema in itself a former actress. <br /> <br /> The story about the protest said simply. Only one feature is missing that would help: still text notes at the end indicates the possible outcome for those people who have been detained in Rosenstrasse, the outcome of which was to add as below clearly incredibly positive <br /> <. br /> «Rosenstrasse« unlucky well according to most critics of excessive length, without the need for layered, supplier of gender stereotypes, manipulation with music:... so things ordinary raps It's too long, but I found this film a harsh, powerful, spontaneous and completely persuasive voice of protest on the part of women who kept vigil outside the place on Rosenstrasse, where they were detained by their Jewish relatives and others. I have not found anything ostentatious, modern or manipulative in this figure. <br /> <br /> Himself absence of extreme violence (none photographed or otherwise physically furious) increased my stress, which gradually increases as the film progressed. You keep waiting for some kind of vicious attack to start any minute. bleakness of the film stayed with me after that. I woke up often later in the night I saw the movie, my the mind is filled with dark, melancholy, chaotic images and feelings, wondering film. For me, this is rarely the case. (In German and English). My score: 8/10 (B +). (Visit at 05/31/05). If you want to read more of my reviews, please send me a message for the direction of my sites <br /> <br /> Add :. The Rosenstrasse Protest: endured from their forced labor jobs that should have been the final Roundup in the capital, 1,700 to 2,000 Jews, mostly women, married to non-Jewish women were forced into Rosenstrasse 2-4, welfare office for the Jewish community in the heart of Berlin. <br /> <br /> Because these Jews were German families, many of them very smoothly, Adolf Eichmann hoped that their segregation from other prisoners will convince families that their loved ones were sent to labor camps, but not more sinister places in occupied Poland. <br /> <br /> As a rule, those arrested remained in prison only two days before being loaded on trains coming to the east. But before deported prisoners may occur in this case, his wife and other relatives sniffed that occurs, and appeared at Rosenstrasse, in their first and twos, and then in continuously growing number. <br /> <br /> maybe more than six thousand took part in the protest, though not all at the same time. Women demanded back their husbands, every day, throughout the week. Unarmed, unorganized, and the leader, they faced down the most severe forces at the disposal of the Third Reich. <br /> <br /> Goebbels, Gauleiter (governor or district head) of Berlin, wanting to have the city racially cleansed, was also in charge of public morals of the nation. In both cases, he was worried about the possible consequences of women's actions. Instead of inviting more open dissent shooting women down in the streets, afraid to jeopardize the secrecy of the "final solution" to Hitler, Goebbels agreed to release prisoners Rosenstrasse, and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them have already been sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> In order to Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was only delaying the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost all released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. Women have won a surprising victory over the forces of destruction.
