This is a really funny movie, especially the second, third and fourth time, when you look at it. This is quite a short film and I would definitely recommend to watch it more than once, you will "get it a second time. <br /> <br /> This is a spinal tap, but the version of rap. She has a lot of relationships in it which may be negative, that rap under the influence of movies, but this is only a general p ** s to take and is not a problem because it creates a twist. <br /> <br /> a lot of standing bits, one of those types of movies that you find me quote a line with your friends, and this will raise a laugh. <br /> <br /> my favorite part is the "guerrillas at the height" section. in skiff video, wonderful!
