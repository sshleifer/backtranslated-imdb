Michael Stearns plays Mike, sexually frustrated man with an interesting moral attitude toward sexuality. He has no problem staring nude dancers, but when women begin to have sex with men, that when he loses it. He believes that if women actually have sex, that when they lose any sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty". Thus, it goes through Hollywood Hills stalking Lovemaking pairs at a distance, eventually shooting dead men with high-powered rifle with the area. <br /> <br /> The imaginary main reason for the existence of this film is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again. "History" comes off as a minor. This should make many happy heterosexual men very pleased with how we were treated quite healed obnazhenok scene (houses here look very good clothes SANS) and sex, to serve as the main dose of tickling. Of course, seeing a fair deal through his scope ups horror factor is significant and illustrates the coercion with respect to voyeurism. (On the one hand, Mike's eyes through a pair of frames for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger.) All of this emphasizes the very intrusive when some atmospheric music on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Those with a penchant for lurid trash obliged to use it in varying degrees. It even includes a lesbian tryst that confuses Mike and it renders uncertain * how * to respond. It takes place at a very slow pace, but it wraps up with the amusing irony. This is an amazing and extremely twisted that, if nothing is determined to keep some viewers glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
