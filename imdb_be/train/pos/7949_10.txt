SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film of my life, because it's the first movie that I remember, in the movie theater in my hometown, as a 4-year-old adventurer. The story is based on a novel by Sheila Bernford, and is the reason why it is not possible to write this one off as the mindless clone Lassie <br /> <br /> main story :. Two dogs and cats living happily in the Seaver family, if the new husband of the mother of three children, gets a job in the city and they are forced to temporarily move to the inner San Francisco, and the animals are sent to the ranch to live for a few months. The connection between animals and children that they are looking for especially strong and golden retriever Shadow and Sassy the Himalayan Cat are broken-hearted as children, though young and carefree American bulldog known as the chance of a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (in part due to his voiceover explaining that he was abandoned as a puppy, taken to the animal shelter, and family to be purchased), even though its growth as a character telling provides most of the important story. <br /> <br /> three pets to avoid the ranch and head into the wide and dangerous wilderness (desert fantastic setting along the way), driven by instincts directions Shadows. They meet several hazards along the way, hoping to make his home at the time as a family and the ranch owners are concerned about the sudden disappearance of animals. There are funny moments all the way through, great dialogue between the three animals and funny lines (see - slogans), and moving society, growing between the protagonists in the narrative, interspersed with moments of sadness (for example, when the arrogance arrogant about trying to cross the river without getting wet makes it fall in the river and washed away down the waterfall, leaving the time of loss that is felt deeply the audience). <br /> <br /> Either way, though, I do not see that the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the desert adds to the story and the way they take. Anyway, it seems a little unnecessary as a part of history. <br /> <br /> End scrolls rates higher if a shadow falls into the pit in Trainyard and injured his leg, finds it hard to get and give up, exhausted, and then the chance to go up with him to convince him to get out, telling him how important it is to him, and he pushed them so far away, so that he should not throw it all away so easily. <br /> <br /> By the way, that this scene (brilliantly done) leaves no ambiguity will be concluded, which carries the final scene, when the chance of Sassy and return home, but the shadow was nowhere in sight. Then, just as all seems lost, he comes slowly, and be reunited with his family. Conclusion Chance says at the end of a partnership that has developed between him and his companions on the way, and the realization that the house is actually on a long journey to get there, leave a subtle epilogue to demonstrate how his character has grown, but also , the other two have, as well. Hang on a second, I think I'll cry ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have not read a book by Sheila Bernford, so I do not pretend to know the difference between the book and the film lies. But this is a film that the whole family can watch and while the toddler will love talking animals, older viewers understand the story line better (as I found out when I was not seeing him again watched the movie a few years later). This film is a masterpiece of the cinema, and I believe that if you have not seen it, you go out and get it! <br /> <br /> And please, not the sequel (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)
