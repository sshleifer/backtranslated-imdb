I just found IMDb and was looking for this film, and I was moved to tears by the comments of people who have seen the film, as I did when 6 or so years in 1967?. I saw him in front of The Jungle Book, so I was Eagle Boy for several hours, and then Mowgli over the next year. I cried at the movie theater, when the boy turned into an eagle and always wanted to see the film again. When we got home, we had dinner roast chicken and I got a bone desire and guess who I wanted to be? My father then said, "I bet you want to be the EagleÂ» and, of course, we all know that the desires are broken when someone guesses as more tears and a bit of resentment toward this day for not being able to fly .. .
