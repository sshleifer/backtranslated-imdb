How could I pass up the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not, and so I was shooting the film this mess. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of Ned Kelly and was amazed at what I learned about the legend of the young man. I was also surprised at how mediocre this film was. Perhaps the fact that it was very, very late, and at the end of the 4-hour movie marathon or maybe it's because it's actually a little bit slow, I found the story hard to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is a very slow process. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Blum failed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I hang recommend this as a must see, this is a great story of Australian history (given how young country, it is very rare and should be evaluated), and the film does have some good action sequences. <br /> <br /> 6/10 to see this historical significance .... (yeah right ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;))
