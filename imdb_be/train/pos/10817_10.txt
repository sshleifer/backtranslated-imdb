Well, this film was probobly one of the most ridiculously terrible movie I've ever seen. The effects are so bad, you just have to laugh, and act, and does not allow to say, it's not Mel Gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays a police officer so damn bad it becomes good. I do not know how, but he makes his own the film 10. You have to see if your to horror / Slash movie cause its bloody and funny at the same time. movie killer.
