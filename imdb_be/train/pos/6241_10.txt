in the first reaction I had a lot of people left with after viewing this: that obese people shots for sunbathing, etc. were cheap shots on the road. OK, so it does Diane Arbus meets. ,, whatever. ,, But it was not long before I realized that this was not done in inhuman way as images unfold, I felt that the problem was entirely the audience: we makes Hollywood and movies almost anywhere really feel that the look, people over a certain age behave sexually something indecent, something that should not be shown. if that were all that the film suggested that it would be very much. However, the history of women with abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks: a very eloquent storyteller, incredible performance, and think that scene was improvised. that blonde guy a genius actor. Finally, I would like to contradict those who say that this film is all about how worthless all these people. old man who is on the mark with a woman who finally dance for him completely such as OK symbol that breaks that mold, so that the film does not simplify overlooking it. but his dog is killed. it's not a happy picture of the world, but it is not. ,, It is hopeless. in any case, I felt very grateful to the director for creating such a beautiful film all in all. I would not say, each of the streams was as strong as the strongest, but I say that this film is basically rips and highly recommend it. ,,
