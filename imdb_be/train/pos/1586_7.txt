Rosenstrasse more intimate film than one of epic proportions that could alienated many moviegoers looking Pianist similar plot. Fortunately, von Trotta, a good writer, selects the Feminist squeak in an era of too much, shown on a beautiful appearance, but too little analyzed proximity point of view and in terms of the usual Aryan German, and from the Jewish point of view. Rosentrasse finds its strength in this unnoticed gravity people trapped in the historical circumstances of which they appear as victims. The pace of the film introspective, bitingly slow, meditative. Furthermore, the characters are so bright, and transitions between generations and were eventually elaborately manufactured. Rosenstrasse not a masterpiece, and some story flaws are well distinguished. Another fault lies with the trivial cinema is unable to capture the intensity of the inner drama characters lived. However, this film is worth a look. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German films, associated with a haunted nightmare of the past, a trend that includes such great films as elsewhere in Africa, and more recently controversial Downfall. I would recommend this film to anyone who knows how to read more of the image.
