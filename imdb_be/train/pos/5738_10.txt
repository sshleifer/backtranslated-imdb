I just bought a DVD and reviews of the film. DVD Transfer from last year, 2001. This 1988 film is really a great little film. The attention of most people. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and loved it so far. I love the opening shot of Pittsburgh (not Baltimore and another user noticed). Pittsburgh does look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say, in Pitts tour on a garbage truck with Nicky is very colorful and interesting! Meanwhile Khalsa, like everyone else said, gives a wonderful, wonderful show. DVD good transmission, without additions, but the widescreen format. I recommend it for anyone who loves cinema.
