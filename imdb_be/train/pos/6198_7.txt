I am one of those people who would crawl a mile through broken glass to see the movie Hal Hartley. Of TRUST and IRIS to Henry Fool and (my favorite Hartley) no such thing unique brand Haley movies is an acquired taste. Bringing equal parts mystery / comedy with subtle espionage seems to be his forte. Comedy is not necessarily in your face, and often passes over the scene before coming to life. And it is in the case of Fay Grim sequel to Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Posey stars as Fay Grim, the abandoned wife of Henry Fool and the mother of his only son, Henry Ned. Fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. It is called the Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, PEOPLE OF THE YEAR), and he wants notebooks Henry. There are many Henry Fool laptops and they were once thought that does not contain anything other than the crazy travel. Apparently, there is much more to them. Study secrets of weapons to terrorists, or the way? Who knows, but Henry. Agent Fulbright Fay says that her husband is dead, but it is quickly realized, as a ploy to get Fay from his home in search of Henry (and it works ... but not the way they think). <br /> <br /> Fay battle several spy rings to collect laptops Henry and search for it. In addition, she makes a deal with the CIA to get her brother Simon (James Urbaniak) from prison (he helped Henry to leave the country at this Henry Fool movie.) Several overlapping events occur in quick succession: the spy ring shot each other to death, Henry discovered, is held in the "security" with the jihadists, Fay frees her brother, but unknowingly at risk the life of his son, and the CIA gets the answer for putting Fay in danger. <br /> <br /> Hal Hartley, obviously, loves to play with the themes. And he makes it to the extreme here. Even the characters' names (Grim, fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have the implicit value of its own, that's pretty funny. In over-the-top spy movies Alla "gives a lot of screen time, as well as guns blazing in the sequence of stop-motion, never striking our heroine, although it is directly in the line of fire. <br /> <br /> Now that I have praised this creation, I would say that over the image of Parker Posey's Fay Grim is not the best part of the film, which is a shame, considering how much time it is on the screen. I understand that this is probably what he wanted Mr Hartley: uncurbed woman with hand gestures in the Italian extreme. But it was still painful to watch at times. <br /> <br /> However, fans are likely to absorb Fay Grim, and ask for more. Although it was not my favorite Hal Hartley movie, I know I'm ready.
