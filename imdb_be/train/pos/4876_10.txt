I do not know why some guys from the USA, Georgia, or even Bulgaria has the courage to express their feelings about something they do not understand at all. For those who have not watched this movie - watch. Do not expect too much or not put some frames because it Kosturica. Watch a movie without compromising, try to understand the humor inside - the people of Serbia really marries while Bill Clinton to bomb their villages, the Roma in the Balkans always try to F * SKU you in any way they can, love is always unexpected, clean and bright , and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who argue that this is a bad movie that I can only see that American crap (as Meet Dave, Get Smart, and so on) is much worse than a clean, open the Balkan humorous love story movies like Promise me. Comments should be useful and in second place should represent the personal views of the author. I think the film is great, and the people watching this should give my respects to the director and the story inside. It's simple, but it is true. It's tough, but gentle and makes you laugh dead.
