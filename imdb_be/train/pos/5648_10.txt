I recently bought the complete series American Gothic on DVD and lived up to my memories of him. I was very grateful to be able to view the first time episodes that have never been on television. I loved the "Ring of Fire", in particular, of the stories that I did not see the first time around. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is fantastic, as "evil sexuality" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a great player. I thought, Brenda Bakke, Selena Coombs was also lovely in her image. In fact, all the cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other. <br /> <br /> It's a shame the series has been screwed into the network (in collusion with the growing group of censors), because it was really designed for adult viewing. A mixture of comedy, tragedy, comedy, satire, romance and gothic horror genres, he offered brilliant characterization, supported acting genius level. <br /> <br /> I had a very great desire to the devil at a time in my life. Let him live by Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the succulent "Fallen Angel" ever.
