Dark Angel is a futuristic sci-fi series, set in post-apocalyptic Seattle, centering on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically enhanced young woman on the run from its creators. <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel universe absorbs (not as much as say, Buffy ', but absorbing nonetheless) with an interesting and believable character set. Of course, this is not for everyone, but those who give him time to find yourself watching one of the most enjoyable series there. Dark Angel criminal to lose sight of, and undervalued, and was canceled after only a miserable 2 series. Which was a great shame as it has the potential to be a great series, although its 42 episodes, only 10 shy of the long running BBC sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf. How is Dark Angel remains incomplete, so look for it, and if you want more, Fox | lobby, to do another series.
