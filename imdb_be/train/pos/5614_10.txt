It took a long time until I could not find a name in a special videothek in Berlin, and I was lucky to find an English version with hollandish undertitles. I think that winked at one of the best ever horrormovies. It seems strange to me that some people call this film is a black comedy. I must admit, I was not able to laugh when I saw it the first time (and it was the same with the other time!) On the one hand Trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his timid behavior, but on the other hand he hit the boy in the playground, and there is no explanation for this. But most weired thing, of course, its transformation into Simone Choule and the fact that he does not know ,, who he really is. His halluzinations are the most frightening in this film. Of course, it's all in his mind, but this apartment, which brings the feminine side of him, or it, too, before he moved to - I think, that's an interesting question. His shizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and winked terrible to see two of its sides or the identity of fighting against each other. The result of this is that it is the first cut off his hand, then jumps out of his / her window. But this terrible cry - it means that everything will be repeated again and again, and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphics and other Egyptian stuff? The fact that he / she looks like a mummy in the hospital - that's entirely the incident, but a hint in my point of view.
