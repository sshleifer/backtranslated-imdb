Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan again outraged superiors with his maverick approach to police work. Refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case, which takes it outside of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a connection between a recent murder in the city and murder outside of town that leads him to the trail of the murderer revenge. <br /> <br /> As the entrance to the Dirty Harry franchise film begins with a very promising moments, including the legendary "go ahead, make my day" line, which delivers amazingly Eastwood through clenched teeth before single-handedly foiling the robbery. Very bully and that's just what fans can expect from him. Nevertheless, the film quickly shifts gears and focuses on a mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer is not all that mysterious as it is characterized in the same way Harry. It really detracts from the presence of the main character, who led all of his previous appearance of the film with, excuse the pun, Magnum Force. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, it's a new story line does make a few parallels with their own methods and unorthodoxy Harry gives his character a dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans who are looking for another scoring Harry picnic will more than likely to be somewhat disappointed. However, intense climax ends the film on an exciting note, so if you do not mind something a little different, this is a good movie for the fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for violence and rape scenes
