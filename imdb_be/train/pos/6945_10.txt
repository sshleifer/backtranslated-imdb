My favorite movie genre of the Western, it's really the only film genre that is of American origin. And in spite of Sergio Leone, no one making them just like the Americans. <br /> <br /> At the very top of my list of ten favorite westerns Winchester is 73. This was the first pairing, and only black and white film of the Partnership director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. He was also a landmark film in which Stewart chose a percentage of the profits instead of a direct salary from Universal. Many such deals have gone for the players, making them as rich as moguls who have used them. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann up to this point has been done mostly B pictures noir type of material without real budgets. Shortly before 73 Winchester manna did excellent western with Robert Taylor, Devil doorways that never gets enough praise. I am convinced that James Stewart had to see it and decided Mans was a man, he decided to work with. <br /> <br /> In this film, Mann also developed a mini-stock company, as John Ford was legendary for. In addition, Stewart others in the cast, as the Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan the Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson will appear in future films manna. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story, James Stewart will get to the search of a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killed him. Why I will not say, but until now we have never seen such cold fury of James Stewart on the screen. Anthony Mann climbed into the soul of Jimmy Stewart and pulled out a few demons all of us are afraid of us. <br /> <br /> Hatred aptly demonstrated in the big time before the start of the film. After Stewart's sidekick and Millard Mitchell disarmed Wyatt Earp played Will Geer, because weapons are not produced in Earp in Dodge City. There's also a contest pictures for Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the bookmaker's favorite Dutch Henry Brown, played with the threat of Steven McNally. Stuart Mitchell and Gil go to the salon, and Stewart and McNally spot each other at the same time and reach to bring the weapon does not exist. Look at the close-ups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another character in the film Stuart works Waco Johnny Dean played Dan Duryea, who almost steals the film. It was probably the best moment of Duryea on the screen. He is a psychopath killer law that death as a left-handed draw, although it sports two six guns. <br /> <br /> Another man is Stewart meets Shelley Winters who the groom is instigated in the disassembly of Duryea and killed. Her best scenes from Duryea, who took a fancy to her. She plays for a while, until she can not bear to leave him. Guess who she eventually fail with? <br /> <br /> There are some fine performances in some small roles, so not sour note in the cast. John McIntyre runs like an Indian trader, Jay S. Flippna as a grizzled Army sergeant and Rock Hudson got its first real notice how the young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, known as "Theodore Roosevelt" in Arsenic and Old Lace is a short but impressive role as owner of the trading post, where both McNally and Stuart stopped at different times. <br /> <br /> Mann and Stewart made eight movies together, five of them Westerns, and were ready to make six western, Night Passage, when they had a falling out and went Mans set. The end of a wonderful partnership that produced some quality films.
