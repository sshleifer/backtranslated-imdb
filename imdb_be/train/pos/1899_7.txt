Arthur Bach is expected to grow, but it is, unfortunately, not the only thing he needs to do. In his very rich father, Arthur must marry a rich certain Susan Johnson and he is cut off from the family money ($ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur does not love Susan (although I have heard that she is doing a good chicken) and had just fallen through the heels to the head waitress and part-time shop-lifter Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting guy. He's really just a big kid who was born into wealth, at least one person who looks after him every second of every day. Work just rubs Arthur the wrong way - he likes to have fun, to be confused with the women, and, of course, drink. Drinking gives Arthur kind of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; and at the time, which gets him into all sorts of trouble, it is absolutely fun to watch on screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore big here, in this movie, Arthur, earning an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win for his statement. Moore is fantastic with the comedy aspects of the film, making the already funny lines in an unforgettable comedy gold, but it's also great in bringing Arthur until Relatable level and make the character likeable. Moore has some help in one of the main roles of the department - Liza Minnelli big as Lina, energetic one, Arthur can not get enough, and John Gielgud is terrific as butler Arthur Hobson. Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in this film, and there's no doubt why. Hobson has a solid dry stone mind and stayed attitude, but he always looks at Arthur - Gielgud and perfect in the role. Nineteen Eighty-one movie Steve Gordon Arthur short and simple, but provides laughs and lots.
