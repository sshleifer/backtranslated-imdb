Excellent during the murder melodrama, with Fontaine effectively play against her earlier naive wallflower type, starring, reportedly Olivia DeHavilland rejected. That's good, because Fontaine fine. Scripted by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the thirties, and later wrote a great script for the classic British horror film Demon Night. The first scene, where Ivy visits sinister fortune-teller plays excellent Una O'Connor (screamers in James Whale fame), is a tour de force, and the film retains an interest for many sinister machinations. I hope that I will see this movie on DVD ever, but despair that ever happened, because it seems to be unduly vague film. Fortunately, I was able to see him on the AMC some seven or eight years ago, but did not see. Catch it if you can!
