This film (an alternate name Â«Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott first. And it was a great introduction. Although I've never heard of it, he seemed to be a great fighter. The scenes in this film are great! There are a lot of them, too, by the way. Conscript battle at the headquarters of the peacekeepers is especially good. There's just something about a lonely guy beat the crap out of a bunch of people who really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for a villain. Role, as it corresponds to it (but others do not). Matthias Hues also did a good job, as always. He's a great fighter and macho, as a character, and was a good contender Wincott in this film.
