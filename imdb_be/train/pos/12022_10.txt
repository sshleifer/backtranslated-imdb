As a huge fan of the original, I avoided this film like the plague, when the bad reviews started coming in eight years ago, but I just finished watching this film and found it to be a really nice surprise. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're looking to recover the original tread, you're a big disappointment, but if you are looking for something completely different, a little edgy and political, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four and a teacher at his old secondary school work, where it is pursued teacher colleague and sexual dreams about one of her students. If the student insists on meeting with Gregory, a series of misadventures that follow include torture, hacking and all sorts of twists and turns that left me feeling elated and moved. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something original, then I highly recommend this film. I just want more people went to see it when it was released, and saw him for what he really is.
