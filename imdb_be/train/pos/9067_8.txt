After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (racing stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really liked to watch Â«Fried Worms". At this time, I do not think the end! It was interesting and fun, and do not resort to gross-out humor tone, despite the name. My boys (6 and 10) and loved it too - Oh, and my 45-year-old "boy" had a smile on his face all the time. This is a family film that is not only tolerable for parents. Relations with the little brother so close to real life. "He's not stopping singing just to annoy me !!" In addition, as a new baby is trying to make friends and how those friendships actually form is excellent with the way children behave. Of course, parents need to act a little stupid - but my favorite scenes involved dad gets used to his new job. Have fun!
