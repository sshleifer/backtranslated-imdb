I think it has the potential to be the best Star Trek series yet, I say potential .. We all know that there is a chance that they will drop the ball and run out of ideas ... but I hope NOT! For those who have not seen it..SEE IT! Without this annoying Â«PRIME directive" floating over their heads every time they face the races it can be cool .. and Scott side was without a doubt, it is an excellent choice for captain, and Vulcan Babe hot well (Check disinfected scene) I gave it a full 10 ... she blows all the other series openers .. I hope it goes longer than 7 years ...
