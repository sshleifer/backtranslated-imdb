This is one of the few films released on the "what if" type of situation that made me think. It was strange to hear how they talk to each other, and remember all the great (and not so great) what happened between them. I actually think there's a very good chance it happened, as the film has in mind, and they actually made it up with each other. These are good memories for each fan, to hang on to, and ask what really happened between them would be selfish. Strange movie it was. Comedic aspects of the film were fine. To think that they were together, to settle between them so it is a comforting thought for people who wish they had a chance to clear the air with someone they have not received. To see John as a caring, laid back character was refreshing to hear all the garbage that is said about him ...
