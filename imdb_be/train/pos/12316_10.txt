Ching Siu Tung-x and Tsui Hark is the Chinese Ghost Story, except that one of the biggest Wuxia PIAN films ever made, beautiful and romantic love story, and clearly choreographed martial arts film, which must belong to the collection of each film lover. Sorely missed Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays mobile customs officer, who spends the night ghost temple. During his stay in the temple, he meets colorful characters that include swordsman Yin (Wu Ma) and third Howe tree devil and a beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen, played by the beautiful Joey Wong. <br /> <br /> in order to free her from the clutches of the evil devil's tree, he must transform his body and travel to the underworld to defeat more powerful demon. <br /> <br /> a lot of good things can be said about this film. Go perfect with a perfect combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and frantically paced ending to leave you little chance to breathe. The chemistry between the tragic surprise Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended too soon) allows the viewer to really feel for both of them. Indeed, acting in general is so vibrant and full of life, I would say that this is one of the most fun events of view I've ever had. Much of the credit Wu Ma in his portrayal of a mysterious swordsman Yin. His over-the-top persona disappointed fencer obsessed with defeating the evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama. Excellent rating, gorgeous cinematography with stunning colors, and possessed of the action gently Ching Siu Tung complete this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere you can. 10/10
