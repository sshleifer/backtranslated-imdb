Secondly, the feature concerns a young woman in London, desperate for work, happy to accept living in a secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son. Thriller about the people who are in the house against their will always makes me a little uncomfortable - I end up feeling like a prisoner, too - but it's pretty stylish B-movie is neither tacky nor claustrophobic. It is far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Foch) soon on his feet. Swing it in 1986 (as Â«Dead Of Winter"), it turned out to be not wise, as the story elements are not contemporary. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!), But it remains a good rate, it's not very moved climax that feels a little sloppy. *** from ****
