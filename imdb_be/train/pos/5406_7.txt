Fourth Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Do not you dare say that Pokemon sucks! I do not like it when people say that .... I loved Pokemon for 5 or 6 years old, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including the film and other films of Pokemon. So, without further ado, please tell me what a great Pokemon and should benefit people of all ages. And why Pokemon haters give low ratings for all or most of the Pokemon movies? I do not understand .... They do not do it .... There's absolutely no reason why people should only vote no evidence that Pokemon sludge, except that: 1) Pokemon Baby ONLY. 2) Pokemon stupid. and 3) People do not like Pokemon. I think that's why people do not like Pokemon.
