What it seemed at first just another introverted French Flick offering nothing more sinister feeling began for me on the first viewing, really insightful and perfectly presented. <br /> <br /> Spoiler kind follows. <br /> <br /> Poor Cedric; he apparently did not know what hit him. Poor audience; we were the first to engage in what seemed to be really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth in the dark reality of the mismatch. These two guys just do not belong together with their first encounter ambiguous. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the lack of a deeper emotional connection made it impossible to Mathieu, intelligent creature to realize themselves in exchange for a life with someone whose feelings were more attuned to the carnival celebrations and romps on the beach. <br /> <br /> on a purely technical note, I loved the camera action in this movie. Subtitles are not necessary, although my French "Almost nothing." I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. It was polished, very professionally made movie. Although many of the scenes seem superfluous, I appreciate it nine out of ten.
