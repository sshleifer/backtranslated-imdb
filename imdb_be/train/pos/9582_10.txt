After growing up in the gritty streets of Detroit, Michigan, and friends who traveled to New York balls, I have fallen in life, to be a member of the house. I joined Theieves House. We have adapted the same rules as most of the houses, but we were professional crooks who have pushed and committing credit card fraud to get fantastic value and clothes what you ask. I even learned how to practice the production of checks and driver's license and implement them for seventeen states, until a jealous queen is not called the Secret Service on me, and I went to federal prison. But I learned a lot from these queens in this film, and I highly recommend you watch it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in homes here in Detroit and we indulged in criminal activities. My book, Identity Schemes available for sale on Amazon dot com or dot com Identity schemes. But believe me, it is much better than Paris is burning, because it makes 2005.
