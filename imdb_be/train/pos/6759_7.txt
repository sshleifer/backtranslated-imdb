Where the sidewalk ends deserves to be better known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA. And this time, he received the same co-stars: DANA Andrews and Gene Tierney. I must say that Tierney is underutilized in the fact that more than a supporting role, and the focus goes to Andrews. <br /> <br /> He plays hard, seasoned police officer, used to work with a bunch of thugs too vigorously, until one night he accidentally kills a man during his arrest. If the suspicion falls on the taxi driver (Tom Tull), he goes along with the murder investigation, but begins to feel guilty, because he is in love with the daughter of a taxi driver in the (Gene Tierney). Tierney, by the way, looks a little too elegant girl, she plays here and does not seem to fit in squalid background story elements. <br /> <br /> The story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper, and it is found that the victim had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero. In the end, it turns into a morality tale with the Andrews develops conscience of crime. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film noir with a capable performance with a strong supporting cast. A good entrance to the field of film noir, with a force designed to Preminger, and plays well Andrews and Tierney, despite a slight miscasting her character.
