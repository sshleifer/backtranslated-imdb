The house that dripped blood is the third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthology. If the Beast CLUB is part of the series, it will make eight films. Although the film is very different from others. <br /> <br /> I look at Amicus anthologies with great memories as I loved them when I was a teenager. My feelings for him today as strong. <br /> <br /> I have spent many years trying to find this movie. The summaries of stories was so attractive that I went so far as having paid a significant amount for it, when I finally found a copy. As big as a movie, I feel a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it. It was not as good as I had believed. Although it is better than its predecessors, it is not nearly as good as his four successors, as I will demonstrate. <br /> <br /> The history of cross-linking to see John Bennett as a police inspector to track down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house. His journey begins in the local police station, where he learns the history of previous tenants. Coupling story later sees him visiting a realtor to sell the house. Although this relationship is the story seems attractive on paper, it is flat and lifeless in practice and is easily the weakest of any Amicus anthology. I could not help but have a feeling that a poor man's version of John Bennet from Pleasence and Ian Hendry. I would prefer to see one of the two aforementioned actors in his role. We could even both here - one as a police inspector, and the other as a real estate agent. They could have, and I think that brought the weakest element of the film to life much better. <br /> <br /> The film consists of four stories, each of which focuses on the residents of the house. <br /> <br /> The first story to see Denholm Elliott as the author of crime stories. He is absorbed in the fascinating history of the strangler, even going as thumbnail image to help him write. Soon after, he begins to see the vision of their own creation. Some excellent directing Peter Duffell, in particular, with a choice of angles helps diminish the cautious scenario. Elliott statement well as the exhausted writer, and it also helps to raise the story. The story ends with a half-twist, but I could not get a sense of the script, which does not allow her to live up to its potential. <br /> <br /> The second story see Cushing's move into the house. He is a lonely man, who still misses a beautiful young woman who once abandoned him and who he keeps the picture. Cushing's performance really brings this emotional and touching story to life. It helps the director who decides to incorporate sustained attention to loneliness Cushing. It is made in the future with great hallucinations scenes, which helps us to see in the form of Cushing. Anyway, Cushing see figure in the wax museum nearby, which looks just like his girlfriend. Naturally, his obsession is growing, but it seems to be a romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end. Ekland plays Cushing's rival, but its performance is massively overshadowed by the late great Peter Cushing <br /> <br /> The third story, and easily the best to see Christopher Lee. - my favorite horror movie actor of all time - to move into the house with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives one the ideal ice performance here. He shows no love and attention to her daughter at all. He even brings in school governess to teach her. Governess, played by Don Porter naira in its other remarkable performances, trying to figure out what happened. Without giving too much, I can tell you that magic comes into play. The presence of Christopher Lee really electrifies every scene he is. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for its massively underrated performance as a little girl who is easy Creepiest character in the whole film. The film is worth seeing even for only see this story. <br /> <br /> The final story is played almost entirely for laughs, but it certainly is entertain and that's what matters. Jon Pertwee plays a horror film actor who moves into the house. He was very unhappy at the approach of its producers to take films, seeing everything as cheap and fake, especially the costumes. So, he decides to buy a real cloak for his latest role as a vampire. Jeffrey Beyldon has a great cameo as a dealer, who sells Pertwee ancient raincoat. If Pertwee puts a cloak on, he begins to develop his fangs and basically turns into a vampire. Pertwee performance has to be seen to be believed. It's really funny. Ingrid Pitt in the story, but her talent is wasted in a role that was supposed to be so much more. <br /> <br /> The story ends with the binding of loose connection to the final stories. This is particularly relevant as the Inspector sought Pertwee and, of course, decides to visit the house. The rest you'll have the opportunity to work for themselves. As poorly as the history of cross-linking, it has a decent, when some unintentionally comic ending. <br /> <br /> I believe that for the shortcomings of the wine that was supposed to be a really great movie does not lie with Peter Duffell, director, who really does everything possible so that he has. I think the script was too reticent and lacking in ambition, which can be found in the following four films. <br /> <br /> In general, the house that dripped blood, despite its shortcomings is a must see for fans of Amicus ontology, supporters of other films Amicus suitcase or lovers of horror films. If my summary provides the film with a sufficiently attractive to check it out. You will enjoy it!
