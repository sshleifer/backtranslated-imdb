Seven young people go into the woods looking for bear.Soon they are prosecuted and angry mad veterans killed in Vietnam. "Trump Infernal» is quite interesting slasher Mexico, which reminds me of "Zero Boys» .The film's fast-paced and there are some nice scenes of death, his throat cut or ax neck.Unfortunately there is not much gore, so fans Grand guignol will disappointed.However, if you are a fan of slasher movies give rare sight .Mexican horrors quite vague (I only saw "Alucarda" and "do not panic"), so this should be another reason to see this nice rating slasher.My: 7 of 10.Highly recommended.
