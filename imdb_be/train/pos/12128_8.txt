I just saw "The burden of human passions" for the first time a few days ago, and WOW! What a mysterious and almost scary movie. I loved how the music went to the tempo of each step Philip feet. He gave me the creeps, for some reason ... <br /> <br /> One of the biggest aspects of this film is that you can see Bette Davis comes to life right before your eyes. It is big, but not necessarily, because this is her best work, but because it was so unusual to be so evil, gritty and unflinching as an actress in 1934 ... Betty was risky, always wanting to be different and that right on when she began to realize that it could be as opposing and bold as she wanted, and people will love her for it. If you are a movie buff, it's amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> It is just a way to deliver the line, which has made part, and the film on this issue belongs to it. As "mass music and fire. This is me ... and some old Kazuo Bengal "or" But you Blanche, you are in that chair! "Or," with all my heart, I still love the MAN I Killed !! Â»... this from a few of her films, but you get my drift. She was so bold, brazen, and exotic looking with these beautiful big eyes. Seeing this, I can not believe that it was remade twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was a wonderful ... so calm and persistent, the need to be loved. I thought he was the favorite, and could not understand how it all did not fall on him, but then again, it was ... except for Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like it was anything to do with writing in the early films. They make a character so odious that it is almost unbelievable that someone really fall to them in the first place. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would never have been interested in Mildred. This is just the simple truth ... See this !!
