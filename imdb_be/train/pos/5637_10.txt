I just wanted to say that I've seen this film twice now and I love it! The acting is great, and despite the fact that such a conspiracy «Raise Your Voice» I think that the story never gets boring for those who like that sort of thing. It has some great lessons in it, and shows us that we can do anything if we try. Incredible movie. I'm sure this is one I will be watching for a long time. Even if Britney Spears to write a book, it is a realistic story, maybe not about falling in love part, but the part that is different and hard, but it turns out better in the end, this is very true in real life. Only minor criticism, why the main girl in these movies always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or mean? I doubt it ..
