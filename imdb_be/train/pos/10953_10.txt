I think this show is surprisingly funny! It's not for everyone, and I do not intend to raise or denigrate people who do not get it. I'm sure they are excellent bright people working at different wavelengths. But if you like it, you really like. Sarah plays independently captured a loser named "Sarah Silverman", which often finds itself in its Homerian heavy (this "Homerian" in "Homerian Simpsons"). <br /> <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman in her short speech on Saturday Night Live in the early 90s. I loved it immediately, and I go out of my way to check out all that she did. <br /> <br /> This show choke-on-your-food and wet your pants funny. So I always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers. Check it out!
