I must admit that from the collection EROS movies, it should be one that I love the most, as well as one another, that I also considered. The story is what really keeps you watching. EROS many films have a story that looks like a hammer and broke it into pieces to produce, if you look at it. All centered around sex, and who can get with how many different people are coming to the end of the film. And oh God, will never see one of these films, if someone pulls out a gun. It does not work, it's almost funny, but you do not want to spend energy to do it. <br /> <br /> Â«Loss of control" just as its name comes from. The protagonist, a leading character (a wonderfully talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control a person has over their feelings, their bodies and feelings. And one person changes everything for her, makes her another woman almost. But the mirror is shattered at the same time. It makes for a great movie that I wish I came up with the first !! <br /> <br /> 10/10
