I'm going to give it an 8, but since you people have done a lot better with 6.5 votes, I had in my contribution. River Styx brilliant. Of course, Woody was his long-term stuff, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was very cheerful, and then the rest of the film was easy to observe. Dialogue was smart enough and card tricks Woody in hand, along with the reaction of the upper crust, it was fun to watch. It was much better than the newspaper critics make it sound to be. And plus, a little Sorcerer's Apprentice, to go along with it. And, of course, you have noticed that Johansson gets a bit unattractive? Charles Dance is always interesting, like Hugh Jackman.
