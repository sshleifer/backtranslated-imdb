My favorite character in the movie, but almost all of them the character of Zorro has a small piece of cloth as a mask, and if villain`s can`t say who is at this cloth they abnormal. <br /> <br /> But Reed Hadley`s Â«Zorro`s Fighting Legion" (serial number 1939) mask fills his face makes him the true secret who Zorro is actually. <br /> <br /> But in any case, Zorro is one of the best character`s in films and bring it up to date I think Anthony Hopkins in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) is a delight. <br /> <br /> My interest in movies is huge, but I have a real affection for serial`s 30s / 40s .... <br /> <br /> Bond2a
