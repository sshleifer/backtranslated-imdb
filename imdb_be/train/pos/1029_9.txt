I would rate a perfect 10 ranks for excellence and consistently high quality and the history of the character, if it were not for the last episode of season 10! <br /> <br /> In the final episode of the 10th "infinity" of the season, where (it is, of course, it seems that) Asgard was killed-off in a very right and very unconvincing fashion unceremoniously, left me at a loss! <br /> <br /> With an extremely toward the end of the series, it is obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to take place for at least another season. My guess would be that they are rapidly accelerated by these stories that set a franchise Stargate SG-1 for two upcoming straight to DVD moves! <br /> <br /> If only Asgard return next SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "explicit" extinction), I think that the fans were cheated with poor cleaning of loose ends! <br /> <br /> The poor end to otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.
