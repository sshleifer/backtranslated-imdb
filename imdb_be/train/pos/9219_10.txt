the film itself made me want to go and call someone, so they can enjoy it too. It was very funny. Angelena Jolie was beautiful as Juliet. Parents hilarious.They is catering and enemies.The kids play part of Romeo and Juliet in the church play.They falls and their parents trying to keep them apart. (Spoiler ahead. I think), they run after the party and make it. Strangely, they still want to get married at the end of the film. If you do not like stereotypes and desecration of classical literature is not playing. If you do not mind that you will have a blast playing it.
