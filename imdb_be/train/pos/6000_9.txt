Kristine Watts (Molie weeks) is broken into pieces, not enough of her lover; she can not overcome her love for him, which is lost in the past. She hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives a list of the errors to him with things to fix. But time is irreversible, and sometimes pain medicine tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first item that strikes in «The Cure» is a stylish film that alternates between black and white to color. Short and sharp script is capable of a tragic and dark story about love from an unexpected plot point at the end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume a bit loud and due to the fact that English is not my native language, at some point I have to repeat a few words whispered narrator. Unknown lead actress has excellent capacity and extremely great. I hope to be able to see her again on the screen. And last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. My vote is nine <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. not available
