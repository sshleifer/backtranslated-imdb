This is one of the most underrated gems Hollywood has ever produced. - A young British fighter ace of World War II, whose plane should crash, a radio with a young American woman who comforted brave pilot, knowing that in a few minutes he would be dead. For some reason, the man who, of course, supposed to be dead out from under the rubble and eventually learns that he had to report to the sky. If the messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to the sky, the man refuses and demands that his "day in court" to argue his case. The man claims that his position has changed in the last moments of his life, that he fell in love, and for that, he became a different person, one who deserved a chance to live. <br /> <br /> «Heavenly Court" is a cinematic delight! "The statement of the jury of peers" is a specific event. History, as fantastic as it sounds, is an attractive one and will keep you mesmerized for almost 2 hours playing time. The final scene is just beautiful, and require «Kleenex cure" for most viewers. This film is my personal all time favorite top 10, he has my highest recommendation!
