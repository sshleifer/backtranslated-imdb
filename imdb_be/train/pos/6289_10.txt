The film took a lot of stick. He was slated by critics when it was released, and was accused of wrecking the career of Nicolas Cage. What I do not think people get that it's not meant to be epic, Oscar contender film, it's just some kind of brilliant "Marriage booster" action at its best Fast cars, fast installation and a great soundtrack -. That is exactly what it says on the tin addition, for those who love his pure fun cars everything is there:..! Ferrari, Mercenaries, photos, and let's not forget Eleanor I think you would be hard to find the best action movie, and personally, the best film at all !! Then again maybe it's just me!
