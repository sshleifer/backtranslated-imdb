I loved this movie. Large plot and actors, and sets a good movie. He told the story in a way, I can easily understand and pay attention, do not fall asleep. I would like to know where I could get the sound track. I can not find it anywhere. Please email me if you know where I could get the sound track. Other than not being able to find the soundtrack, I thought that the film was exciting. Swayze did a great job. I think it is some of his best works. His last movie was okay, but it really tells the story of change. It will go down in history as one of the best television films ever aired. Congratulations to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work.
