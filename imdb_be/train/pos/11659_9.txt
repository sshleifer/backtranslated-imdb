This animated film (co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) has to deal with what is surely one of the most bizarre thing ever for a film: the creation in the 9th century, the famous illuminated manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic retelling of the story, prepubescent boy named Brendan who lives in a monastery led by his uncle, stern abbot who cared ready to defend abbey impending attack Dangerous Vikings must get into banning the surrounding forest to find the materials that the master illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book. To do this task, in the forest, he suddenly finds help a friendly fairy named Aisling.Gorgeously and finely painted by hand (there is some computer animation in several key passages) in such a way that he wants to be like as medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with a very creative use of color and a variety of geometric shapes, the film inexorably enough, but it's good enough, do not put off a variety, but from the kind of eye opening. If one were to cling to - for some anachronisms as African monk in the ninth century Ireland ?? it could be said that the combination of Catholic mysticism Celtic paganism in this film will never be closed. And the comic is sometimes a little too wide. That's why I can not give it the highest rating. But these minor problems with the other perfectly and beautifully shaped film.
