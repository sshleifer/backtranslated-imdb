Even this early in his career, Capra was fully achieved with his camcorder labor and time. It's a fine story - and entirely predictable at times - but it gets very good performances from his actors, and has some pretty complex camera movements that involve the viewer deeply. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, but anyone with a brain can see that the bottom will fall out of it. - rich "prince" will lose its status <br /> <br /> However, because of his good shot and a fast pace, it's easy to get caught up in clich√©s. Then, the film does become more original, as a married couple must find a way to make a living. The ending is very predictable, but satisfying. I also want to compliment the title write: very clever and fun.
