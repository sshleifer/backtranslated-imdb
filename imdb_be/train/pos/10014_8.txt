Night Listener held my attention, with Robin Williams as a shining New York radio host who becomes fascinated by his friendship with 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin), who is very ill. Williams never met the boy in the face, as they only have been in contact, talking on the phone. However, Williams ex-boyfriend (a good job from Bobby Kannavala) raises doubts about a boy who leads Williams to arrange a meeting with him personally. It is worth making a permanent impact on Williams in the way he expected. I'll leave it at that. Toni Collette also star. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie with Toni Collette giving memorable image Culkin foster mother. Sandra Oh has also starred in the role of Williams. Night Listener is inspired by real events, and it has a dark, almost eerie silence everywhere. Sometimes it is not predictable, not because of some of the reviews I read before watching the movie and just because of the logic, but I still enjoyed it. Like Williams in the role, as it is, to a greater extent than his comic characters, so the bonus was added to me. Recommended. 8/10
