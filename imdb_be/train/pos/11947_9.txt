Just well it is written, directed and acted in the best ... Woody from the 2000s, when it is not the best of the 80's !! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for him roll. banter Scarlett Johansson Woody proves how well-rounded she became an actress. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to be in a romance on the screen with the leading lady. He plays the perfect clumsy magician. <br /> <br /> There have been several reviews of blackening of the film. Do not let them stop you seeing beautifully made film. People in the crowd I saw it with laughing so loud some of the lines I missed the next line. If you are like Woody Allen movies 70s, you'll regret is not enough. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go watch this movie with an open mind, if you do, you can come out smiling.
