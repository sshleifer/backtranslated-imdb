This story has never been among my favorite works in Christie, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation. Mouse motif was efficient, if a bit overdone, the bones of history there, but more emphasis on the "crimes of the past" story. The students were pretty much as I imagined them, although it is a pity they are not a cosmopolitan bunch - possibly revised thirties installation does not allow this! I thought that some very bold risks were taken with the filming; maybe its because I re-read a book not long, but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer of their appearance in some detect boom early. <br /> <br /> Humor was much more common in those early Poirots. Sometimes it works, but I found a lot of it quite a heavy hand in this episode (although I smile at Â«Lemon sole" dumping the line). In general, though, a solid entry in the series, although not one of the best.
