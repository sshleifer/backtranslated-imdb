Sarah Silverman is completely manic Zooey Deschanel, and I think I'm in love already. So, if you loved Jesus Magic, you will love it. If you did not, what the hell is wrong with you? Kudos Comedy Channel for shoving it in my face. My life finally makes sense, and "Your car smells like farts" my kind of humor. I'm a happy guy. The first episode made me laugh hysterically, and I am eagerly looking forward to the next week. It's like Grease meets South Park. Absolutely outrageous. Sarah Silverman someone I could watch the phone book reading. Her delivery accurately and so funny. She never stops. Let's think about it, it's not so much of its material selection. Some really good stuff, by the way, how is it that she wants to take him. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thanks, Comedy Channel!
