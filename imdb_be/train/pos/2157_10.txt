All right. As you can see, it's one of my favorite, if not favorite movies. This is a character drama that is absolutely hilarious. The protagonist is a business man who is stuck in "the same as the second day" mentality. He sees a woman looking out the window at the melancholy dance studio out of his train every day and asks about her and decides to learn more about it. He decides to join a dance class only to find that she was not the instructor. From there, he engages with four other dancers and learn to enjoy dancing, as well as learn about the mysterious female. <br /> <br /> There's no gratuitous (or) sex is involved, just as a small group of people to learn how to form and develop friendships. <br /> <br /> This film was remade with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the new yet attractive nowhere as enjoyable as the original. The film never made it big in America, because he is not eligible for an Oscar, as it was shown on television in Japan (movies can not be put on TV or they are disqualified Oscar nomination). It was a win many awards in Japan for the best film, actor, director, etc. "Oscar" for their awards.
