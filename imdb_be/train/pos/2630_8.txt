"The Lion King", without a doubt, my favorite Disney film of all time, so I thought maybe I should give the extensions a chance, and I did. Lion King 1 1/2 was very good and had a good laugh and fun with Timon and Pumba. The only problem is, I feel, sometimes not need no explanation, because they can create plot holes and just feeling the desire own explanation. Well, I highly recommend this movie for fans of the lion King or just evening with your family. This is a fun movie with the same laughs and cute characters as the first. So, hopefully, I'll get the same thing with a third party in the Lion King series. Relax and just think Hakuna Matata! This does not mean that we should not worry! <br /> <br /> 8/10
