The first film was good, but it's not as good as the wonderful animated classics, which I found more bitter and conquers. This sequel is inferior, but not bad. Of course a farce too much, the script has its weak points and plot a bit of inspiration. But dogs are very nice here, and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw. The film is pleasant to look stylish, cinematic and stunning costumes (especially Cruella-x), and the music is pleasant. It operates mainly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is attractive and Gerard Depardieu as he gave the best performances of fun, as a partner in Cruella. But the best asset, as it did with the first film is an amazing Glenn Close in a delightful on-top performance as the Cruella, even more evil than it was before. On the whole, good. 7/10 Bethany Cox
