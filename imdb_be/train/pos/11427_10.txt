I loved this film because, in my opinion, seemed so well reflect what I imagined life in French colonial Africa should be like in the '50s ( "my" generation anyway). But I was really passionate about his quiet stimulation and glorious end. During the last 5 minutes of this movie, you should focus attention is focused on what is happening. I have never been more impressed by the "summing up" of the film. I remember shouting "Wow!" When I realized it was all over. On the other hand, has two daughters slept on the sofa !!
