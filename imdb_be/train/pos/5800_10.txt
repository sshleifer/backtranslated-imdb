At the moment, my favorite film IN THE WORLD !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 and I still enjoy it in 16 years !! His absolute masterpiece! No video collection is complete without it !!! I enjoy every moment and not only the film has some great special influence, but it sends a message to a large audience of young people, who may sound sheesy, but in fact the film is made very Cooly really! Although Michael Jackson was in movie AFEW now, people still do not see it as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor, I know! He is so talented! He's incredibly !!! Lunokhod must see !!!!!!
