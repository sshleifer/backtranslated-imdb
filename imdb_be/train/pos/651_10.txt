** possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like the movie and does not have any problems, do not sleep for him. It reminds me of myself at 20, except that it's even better. As Veronica says two chicks at the same time. It detects horniness in me, a casual conversation, these two real-life chickens, not prostitutes, teasing us every step of the way. I get to talk too. Even if they are completely BS From time to time, so what? Each chicken, only that I ever spoke highly on, usually full of the same ill-conceived chaotic gratuitous self-centered BS philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and how reasonable, how that other BS chicks philosophy often: astrological charts. The only deal with this film guy almost as much as the feminine woman, he at the same BS and moodiness. Brunette chick is actually the most courageous people there. <br /> <br /> I think it's ridiculous that brunette chick gets so obviously excites Veronica. She would like to get the little blonde from Alexander, but Veronica plays her all the way. It's brilliant. She gets brunette thinking there was something between them, and then she steals a boy-child / man who only incidentally, because they seem to be the same age group. Brunette knows that she has been in the end, when she released her face in his hands, and Marlene Deitrich singing on the background of the fact that, to paraphrase, there are a million pair in Paris tonight, but I have only this refrain. <, Br /> <br /> But they get married in the end, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine the super-violent relationships that end in pre-marital breakdown. They are too selfish to be something to each other than the stage. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, though. He kept me entertained, it has a good look, and it's sexy.
