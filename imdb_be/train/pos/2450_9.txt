I watched this show since I was 14, and I have loved it ever since. I love this show, because it's just ridiculous! You will enjoy this show a lot, because it shows that something new and fun every day, and my favorite part, when Benny always have your latest comments on George pointes after each of his fat giant head. * Laughs * I like to laugh, and I would watch it with my friends at home, it would be like we were watching a funny movie, but short. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, exciting. This comedy series funny cool family fun for everyone, and you will definitely like it - I did! And if you have not watched it yet, I suggest that you start looking, because you would not want to stop playing it. Although there is no longer stigmatize new episodes I still use a rerun. Still funny. It never wears off. <br /> <br /> 9/10
