«Margaritas and cock ...» <br /> <br /> This is an extremely interesting film grabs you from the first scene and never fails to deliver laughs, surprises and unexpected touching moments. I had more to pin «The Matador», than almost any other film from 2005 is a stupid movie with an unforgettable character, played to perfection by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a mediator (hit man), which specializes in high-end corporate gigs (murder rich dude). He also feels something like a mid-life crisis. After coming to the realization that he had no real friends, no permanent home and planned the future, he stumbles into a Mexican bar one night and works in Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Denis is lowering its successful family man who is on the verge of losing a great business deal that just might turn things around for him. He loves his wife dearly, especially since, as they have lost a young son a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Two men chalk and cheese, is hardly common ground other than that they are in the same deserted bar one night. And somehow the conversation surprised that establishes that the motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever. <br /> <br /> Friendship they form reminded me a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is the straight man, and other stubborn fool who gets them into trouble. Interaction perfectly timed, and finely tuned, in no small part to the excellent performance with Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake ... This is a movie Brosnan. He puts one of the most memorable and despicable cute characters of the decade. He could shoot a mother and apologize immediately afterwards, and you'll probably forgive him. Brosnan may be the ultimate cinema charmer, but this is his most attractive and full implementation to date. I would not mind to see the nod of an Oscar for this role. <br /> <br /> Consider a scene where he is clearly ogles high school girl with impurest thoughts and utters the line, «All blushy blushy. .. No Sucky Fucky ». He does this with his usual grin Bond and managed to get away with it. He was able to say a little boy, "Tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years. Then come back to me "without coming across as unpleasant. In fact, it makes us like him even more. <br /> <br /> And yet the film has managed to surprise us with some truly moving scenes, most of which come to an end, when the film has some unexpected twists and turns. However, when Julian fingers through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console each other in his bedroom one night, the film achieves unexpected depth of emotion. <br /> <br /> «Matador" is a stylish and energetic. It is constantly absorbing. And it contains a career-defining role for Brosnan as a lone hit man seeking normality, friendship and means to make at least one good thing in his life. It's missing a gem in 2005, and you must make the effort to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler with IndependentCritics.com
