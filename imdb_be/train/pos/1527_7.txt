Tormented, when he came out, the film looks beautiful and sounds great. Holiday intelligent thoughtful action by Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Walbrook, and moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminzher Sun jumps around and show off- he slowly takes a long time to encourage you to listen and talk, and Graham Greene's script condenses Show without prejudice complexity.The part has the look of a TV movie, and, of course, the studio related, but none the worse for this. Too many modern films on "historical" fact can not resist the dumbing down. What would Mel Gibson did with Virgin? Many salivary shots on its stand is likely then to improve the clarity of the barbecue as flame hold. Preminzher not doing anything out of it. Combustion shown mainly due to fault victim reaction. There are a few weak statements, but not enough to cause any serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and did not expect to see it until the end, but I clung. Currently, religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has an unexpected resonance.
