I read a lot of negative reviews about this film, and finally got a chance to see it on DVD. Honestly, I really do not know what the problem with him. <br /> <br /> This is a decent mystery thriller murder, shown from different perspectives, with an eccentric cast of often under the influence of drugs of potential killers / suspects, including the late King, John Holmes porn. Please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the plot of the film. - I would like to contribute to longer view than the abstract <br /> <br /> Many observers have gone so far as to give this film have the lowest rating because of the violence, but I do not really see it. Many of today's films have been worse - Saving Private Ryan was ultimately stronger than the film, which often relies on the mean blood stains than actual massacres (assassination depicted in this film were made with lead pipes, Afterall) <br /> <br. /> I was captured by the two halves of the film - the first show of John Holmes as hopelessly cash-hungry drug addict and the other half showing its side as a minor accomplice in senseless bloodshed. The film has an excellent effect, even though Dylan McDemorant looks more than a little out of place in his biker-esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy face <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also amazing. - a fantastic combination of 70 B-side rock and pop vague, spread out in a couple of hours in all the right places ala Boogie Nights.
