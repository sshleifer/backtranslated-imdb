Internal imports was a great movie. I laughed all the time. It was interesting on so many levels, from the crazy fashion to hilarious situations. Action was fine. Alla Korotkov, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman, and all the others have done an amazing job. Because it is an independent film written by the first writer, he has not a clich√© that can be expected from other comedies that was such a relief. It was a unique and interesting, and you will fall in love with the characters and stories of heart warming. I heard it was based on a true story? If so, what is the fun (and surprising!). I highly recommend this film.
