I watch this movie all the time. I watched it with his family at the age of 3 to 87 years, and everything in between; They all loved him. It really shows the true scene of the dog is, and the love and loyalty you get away from pets. Just beautiful. <br /> <br /> It is great for thoes, who love comedy films, tear Jerker movies, or even pets. <br /> <br /> Music is excellent, the animals spectacular scene, really thought out, and the characters perfect. I liked the characters are true and beautiful mixed entities: Shadow (The oldest, a golden retriever) It is wise, full of wisdom and thinking any dog, Chance (American Bulldog puppy) basically puppy with a prankster side, comic character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She's a real cat, which shows that this cat would do to their owner, the real one girl.
