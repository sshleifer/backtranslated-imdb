I know that the film snobs are sniffing. But if you are looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B-movie jungle, try «Jake Speed». <br /> <br /> little thin at times, but its severity and location of up to more than that. John Hurt (God love him) seems to be happy to perform its role as the evil ultra white slaver. Nemesis Crawfords, Jake Speed. It adds a dimension to the film, which can provide only a professional like Hurt. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) a good team, but you wonder why they both resigned to every other.However together as Crawford and Christopher reflect a team that is so much fun, if you can get over itself at the moment, you can find yourself behaving like a child again in situations, and the inherent uncertainty they provide.The delicious Kopins does a great job as a girl in trouble, which is more concerned about the motives of his rescuer then her cat. <br /> <br /> I have yet to find a movie that, like a lot of fun without getting instructive or shearing the film, trying too hard. Not every film has to be the last "Citizen Kane." And believe me, Wells was original. So let's keep in mind that sometimes, movies fun.Not social commentary or try to persuade the audience politically. But just for fun, to be alive and to live in a time when live our hero in celluloid dimension.
