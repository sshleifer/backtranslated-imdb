Being from Philadelphia suburbs, and is very interested in local history, this film provides an excellent vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes in the city center, railway station, which no longer exists, Street Station thirties - are still there, as well as scenes from the north-eastern part of the city. Good shots of old row houses as they were then. The film becomes a little "chatty" sometimes - forcing the viewer briefly loses interest ... but the overall storyline is solid and very touching. Anyone who enjoyed this film should also try to see the movie "Shining Victory", as well as with local hospital staff Valley Forge Army in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania - and from Phoenixville scene. Army hospital has since become a college campus. None of these films in any format, and I can not understand why. I have them both on VHS from home recording, as shown in TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to other lovers of history there with my field!
