This is hands down the greatest show stand ever. I saw a lot of defending the show, has been advocating for many shows, and watch Comic View bet, but I've never seen anyone who could match the skills of Murphy on the show.

Also shows that at the time, especially in the early to mid-eighties that Murphy was funny. My favorite part of the show, when he retelling family barbecue and "Ice Cream !!! Mooommmm !! ice cream man comes !!!! "Another interesting part, where his mother, like Clint Eastwood.
