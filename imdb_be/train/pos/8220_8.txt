The fourth in the series of "Dirty Harry", this film shows one of the most disgusting, ugly, unpleasant, profane, disgusting women I have ever seen in the film "Ray Perkins," plays Audrie Neenan. It is a modern version of the inverse low-life character in 1945 "bypass", "Ann Savage." <br /> <br /> It is a foul mouth and a drain attitude turned me so I never watched it again until I purchased the profanity filter, which closed it .... and at least some of it! Then I could enjoy the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Everywhere "Harry CallahanÂ» (Clint Eastwood) is, violence should be immediately ..... within a few minutes! It happens so often that it is almost funny, but it makes for a fast moving, entertaining movie with a happy ending, as all scum villains eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a babble film appeals to our basic instincts ..... and connects, sad to say. Most of us would like to see it dirtballs get it in the end, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
