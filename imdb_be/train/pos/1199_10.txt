This is the most convincing and excellent performance that Robert Taylor never gave. It even surpasses his excellent performance as "Johnny Eager" is as much as 14 years after this film. His appearance is still surprising to see, but it has a consistency now, gives it an advantage in the rough, violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who kills not for money but for pleasure. His wild eyes of the murder not only the buffalo, but man, is stunning to watch. It is mostly a lonely man, in need of the people around him, but they do not like him because of his behavior sociopath. His partner Sandy Mackenzie (Stewart Granger), who is sick of hunting, and only goes forward because he is a failure at something else. Along the way, Charlie kills seven Indians and captures beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her in vain, but he sees that Sandy interested in it too. Granger's kind of sad to watch so tired of hunting, who yearns to go to a woman and her child. Lloyd Nolan as drunk Skinner perfectly with his wise cracks and Accordian game. Tamblyn plays a half breed, trying to fit into white light. The group is an odd mixture of good and evil, and so young. In the end, Taylor gets scared buffalo, as many hunters to him and runs away leaving Sandy with the girl. Upon returning that night Sandy leaves the woman, putting Charlie off on a rampage of murder in the quest to get Sandy and a girl for himself. The final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget. This film Taylor all the way, and he was really a very underrated actor era.
