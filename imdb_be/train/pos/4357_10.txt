I saw the film at the festival Nashville Film. It was beautifully done, with the cinema in action. This is the story of father and son, and they come to understand each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written, with dialogue that never rings false, the film shows the acting talent Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among other things, in this outstanding cast. The film begins with an aging father (Peter Falk) is trying to find out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) left him. Father presents himself, without warning, on the threshold of his son and daughter-in-law. Father and son take off the next day to look at some property and ended up taking a classic ride. They fish, play billiards, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get into a fight and dance bars with amazing women. But more importantly, every one of them to confront the unspoken tension that can affect any family. This kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them.
