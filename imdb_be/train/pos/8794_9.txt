Chang Cheh in "Shaolin" may well be a sign of HighWater Shaw Brothers martial arts films of the cycle. This amazing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a real who's who of the stables Shaw. Although the plot is pretty standard and the fight choreography is gorgeous, as usual, this Cech treatment of the subject matter that makes this film an excellent and enjoyable. The feeling of reverence is reflected in the history and traditions of Shaolin felt in every frame. Not unlike William Keighley ode to the legendary Fighting 69th in the same titled movie itself or salute John Ford in West Point «The Long Gray Line», «Shaolin" Cech is lovingly crafted ode in the same style. <br /> <br /> cultural correlation I am tempted to do is compare the Shaolin Temple in Alamo. Watching this film will give the same enthusiastic and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in elementary school history when you learned of the courage and dedication of those convicted Alam heroes. At the end of the movie, you might also be tempted to cry, remember the Shaolin Temple!
