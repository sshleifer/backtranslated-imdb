I am surprised by the low rating IMDB about the movie. With all due respect, his lowest rating is representative of the level of IQ of those who rated it as poor. They would prefer to see a movie with a cheap thrill, a bigger budget and more Gore. <br /> <br /> The first misconception of people is that it is a horror film. It is not, and is not a movie fool you, believing that it is one. This psychological thriller. It is for people who really want to intellectual experience when watching a movie. Overview Reel.com is an excellent example of how I feel about this movie. All the other negative reviews does not make much sense. It's almost as if trying to make an original film for change- very rare these days- the bad and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I will reveal some spoilers for morons who say that it is boring and useless "t make sense. March was brainwashing themselves and perform experiments on himself to be a caring mother, and she was really angry Nazis who would kill without warning. Evidence is in the pudding and the fact that at the first viewing, we sympathize with this monster conscious throughout the film is a testament to the direction of the film and writing. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this film should at least be estimated in the range of 6 to originality alone. I recommend this film to people on the other end of the IQ masshta- aka smart man-since this film, obviously, being butchered those who prefer to watch scream or Freddy Nightmare. <br /> <br /> Kudos action as well. For such a low-budget film, you will be surprised that this film does not hit the local movie theater with great direction, writing and acting. Please do not be fooled by the rating on IMDb. This movie is worth it. I really recommend buying this film as the first view on the rent will not do it justice.
