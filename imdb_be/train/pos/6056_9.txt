Super Speedway is doing a great demonstration of their new sound DVD / Bigscreen / 5,1 channel system. IMAX camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around different tracks at high speed, resembling the driving sequence in the Grand Prix (unless it appears on DVD!). I really like to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only negative, and why I did not give him 10, some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was accelerated. The soundtrack also requires a bit of suspension of disbelief - all that can be heard in a real car is the engine. You will not hear rotates as you go under the bridge.
