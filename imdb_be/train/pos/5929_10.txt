Stephen King was brought up on films like this. -Flicks not a movie. <br /> <br /> Movies like this and "Jeepers Creepers" are "conversion" to the good 'ol days drive clicks in horror. They are designed to be fun, cheap to make and I hope: some good Repeller <br /> <br /> Everyone is looking at the theory of the human species must pass this particularly important because it all ... it all. never will. <br /> <br /> Stop the trash that has considered itself as trash. ! Okay, fun, trash <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed this, I recommend: "Jeepers Creepers" "Jeepers Creepers 2" '30 Days of Night, "" Scarecrow "(" 88) "They live" "Planet Terror" "death Proof" and "Halloween III: Season of witches"
