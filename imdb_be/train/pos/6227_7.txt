Specifically, one of the smaller of the musical Aster / Rogers. It's just a very poorly constructed and pace. It only works for a few minutes longer than the swing of time, for example, but it feels a hell of a lot more. In part, this is due to a secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott rarely interesting. I like Hilliard. She's cute, and I like to at least one of her songs, "Where are you?" ( "Get thee behind me, Satan," its other number is a weak relic of Top Hat, fortunately cut from this masterpiece). Follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if you do not at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. Dance competition vying for the first place of any one of them. Dance is fantastic. "I put all the eggs in one basket" is to rehearse two dance that they're not quite perfected yet. Its shortcomings make it all the more perfect. And "Let's face the music and dance" is easily one of the best songs of Irving Berlin. So that the film is worth watching because of its great moments.
