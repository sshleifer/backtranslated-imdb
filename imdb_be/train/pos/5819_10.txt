I loved this movie ever since it first came out. I was nine years old, and now I'm 27. I remember playing video games on the Sega Genisis. I had so much fun, I would like to show my son this film. He loves Michael Jackson, as well, and I know he will love this movie as much as I did when I was a kid. Despite the fact that he is so much younger than I was when I first saw it. I can not wait to get out on DVD! I hope that it will be released on DVD! Please let it be released on DVD !! I'm dying to see it again !!! Well that is my comment, I hope that one day soon I will get to see this movie again. I love all the videos in this film. My favorite mini video Badder!
