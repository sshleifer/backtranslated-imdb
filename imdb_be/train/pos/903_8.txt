I can honestly say that I never expected this film to be good. I do not like family movie. I am far from a fan Shahid Kapoor. The last film directed by (MPKDH was nonsense. And the music was very boring and bland. But there was Amrita Rao who became my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There was also a Sim Biswas, Alok Nath, and Anupam Kher, who is very talented. So a few advantages . <br /> <br /> I finally saw the film and I was very impressed. He brings us a young lover with a pinch of MPK HAHK wedding, and we have a winner. the history of the plan is similar to HAHK, heart light in the early to serious mode at the end. Director, is also a symbol that you could touch. that I do not like about HAHK was that the characters were Zana DTA eccentric. Casting adds it to perfection. Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance. This is a significant improvement, and most importantly, it is suitable for this role. Better easily Amrita Rao. In fact, it was her best performance. Her screen presence so electrifying , you must love her job. Samir Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are badly cast. not one actor feels in his place. <br /> <br /> The songs were quite disappointing, but they will sound better after looking at them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi glorious ballads. Milan Obi Aada Adhura Hai also nice to view. The songs are not colorful and dancey, and they are more like a ballad. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein who shall remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what does drawback in the film? The movie gets a bit slow, and the ending is quite stretched. But the film is still going at a good pace, making it the perfect family film.
