Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Frels, Alice Garner, Chris and Michael Amphlett Caton- what else could you ask for? Monkey grip on the basis of the award of the novel with the same title explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mother, shooting heroin addict Jobe (Friels). A simple story really made extraordinary through great round of action (in particular nonite Hazlehurst) and good use of a small budget . the only drawback is that (if you can pick it up) is that the story is based in Melbourne, although for budgetary reasons, the film was mostly filmed in Sydney, as a result, in several scenes you can see trams (Melbourne scene), and then post e Department of Carlton (Sydney scene). In addition, the "Monkey Grip" must see (sorry for the tip, but it's there), at least for the award of performance from the former Â«Play School" and "Better Homes & Gardens" leading Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> <br /> 10/10
