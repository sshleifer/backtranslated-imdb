Well, if, before I saw this movie, I really was not sure would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought it was one of the best films I've seen in a very long time, a real family classic. The history of young evacuated and its new "reception" Dad, this movie ticks all the boxes. I have not read the book (maybe this is a good thing, and it meant that I liked the film more), but in relation to the history, I really can not think of any bad points, thus killing it 10 out of 10 ( and I hardly ever think anything guarantees the highest score!). By the time William declared: "I can ride a bike, PA I was sobbing my heart (any one who has seen it will understand, I'm sure) Really touching, and definitely recommended!..
