This is a really great short by Hal Roach. This is due to two main reasons :. The youngest children in the short are one of the prettiest that ever on film and story are so many funny and well-written elements <br /> <br /> As for the smallest little rascals, I honestly can not think a cute baby than Spanky about four years. Despite the rather plump and unattractive child in later years, he was simply a valuable here. And put a little tiny boy, who is responsible for supervision of children in smaller children, is not only ridiculous, but once again a pretty high factor. <br /> <br /> After the older children to blackmail Spanky to do this terrible work of the nurse, all kinds of ridiculous mess off. The gags are quite effective and well done for the time - with the occasional crank call involving murder and the final scene, where Spanky, finally gets control of the small being the most memorable. I have not seen these shorts for decades, and I'm glad that I gave this one a chance.
