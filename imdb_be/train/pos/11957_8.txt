Big Woody Allen? No. Good Woody Allen? Determined. I found myself, along with the audience in attendance, laughing hard and often some of the best lines of Woody Allen, we've heard in a while. Aging Allen created an appropriate role for itself as the "father" of Scarlett Johansson ... well, sort of. Some of them said Johansson plays the "young Dianne Keaton." I beg to differ. She plays Woody dialogue which, in his comedy, always has a very similar feeling ... like, well, a Woody Allen comedy. It's good for us, Woody connoisseurs. She, of course, Woody's dialogue is much better than the young part of his latest comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some of them may find the humor of Woody tedious, but for those of us who love it, if it is done correctly, we look forward to the next.
