I found one and only comment about this movie quite little information and in general too hard, so I decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and caught him several times larger since then. First of all let me say that, in general, the fact that this film gets right that makes it useful. It does not matter that he has some quirks low cost and other disadvantages. It's worth a look. The idea of ​​basing a film on the visit Walt Whitman restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is brilliant MIS-en-scene. The film is about how the humanization catalysis Whitman inspired in people. And in this sense it is true is true. Actions - particularly Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - it's very good. Scenarios and strong dialogue, and give due consideration to the customs and bends time. In general, do not like? In addition, the name of another movie, in which Whitman brought so vividly to life?
