I found this film is really funny, because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock), who dies and is sent back to earth in the body of a white mane mid 50s. He does not understand that his behavior needs to change, and continues to operate as before. He listens to rap music, sings, and plays the part of the stereotypical urban Negro. The real humor in this film looked concerns that such behavior gets him into the black community.
