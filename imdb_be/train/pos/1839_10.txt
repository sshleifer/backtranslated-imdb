Great movie about the two policemen, who love the same woman. One of the officers (PÃ©rier) killed her, but all the evidence seems to incriminate the other (Montand). Hapless Montand did not know who the other lover who could have killed her, and Perrier did not know that either Montand had an affair with a girl. Montand must find the killer ... and what a great end! Highly recommended.
