There are too many new styles of sitcoms, but one that works best is the old-fashioned way to the audience, and an indoor set. 70 Show a perfect example. If the show was aired, in fact, no one had heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp is much less teens playing well Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both of them left the show this year to pursue other interests) I want Topher to stay around because the show started about his character, Eric and his inner circle of friends. Ashton has John Travolta our time. Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland eight is enough, I think Ashton Demi Moore. Acting actors have never been known to us, which is a good thing, because a member of the cast of celebrity can ruin it. I miss Mo Gaffney, who played the girlfriend Joanna Don. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original of Laurie, a replacement can not be compared with it, and I regret it. I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as a waste, but beloved father for Steven Hyde. I loved the look, Tanya Roberts, except for Charlie's Angels. I love Brooke Shields plays the mother Jackie. She really showed his acting talent, before heading to Broadway. This show was fun with lots of surprises. I hope that this show lasts longer, even if the 2 his actors go, but I hope they are not too far for too long. I want the creators of the show, Bonn and Terry Turner, who also set up another of my favorite show, Third Rock from the Sun, is more successful at Fox than they were on NBC, who sabotaged their shows. Turners Sun mannequins, and I hope that they will create more shows like this in the future.
