All the people who see this film, and probably many professional reviewers of the film, just do not get it. This film was made with a matte sequences and methods of art completely as the works of the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get any of the films Zeman, such as the fairy-tale world of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, a trip to the beginning of time, or a comet. If you can not find a movie, read reviews in the AMG. They will explain the processes that are used. If you could look at the work Zeman and try to compare it with any other scientific / fi fantasy films of the time, the audience probably did not get it, either. It's unfair to compare any of the styles of the filmmakers to the standard technology in the day, because both of Zemen and Hines Â»not figure out." They have a style that is unique to them and should be assessed only for their creativity. If you look at the film from the point of view, where you know that he deliberately tried to create a collage of Stein styling, mixed with live action, you can easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. It's not easy to make a bunch of stream computing expressions. I thought that these creatures were also very good, and given the way they were made. Hines took a big gamble, and I think his film will not be enough to judge for many years. Someone promotion of the film must predict the audience on what they see, and not allow them to blindly go to the theater, waiting for the usual CG work. As for the actors, I think Hines also took a page from the book Zemen, in that many of the actors Zemen was somewhat obscure at first, but became much more attractive, as the film and the action continued. It is quite refreshing for me to this film in my library. I'll watch it for years to come, all three of the big clock.
