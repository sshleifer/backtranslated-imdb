As a supporter of author John Le Carré, I'm slowly working my way through both his books and adapting them. I found a 1987 adaptation of the masterpiece from the bark of my local library and sat down to watch him think that I would know what to expect. I was surprised to find that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries, a fine cross between a spy thriller and human drama. <br /> <br /> Peter Egan gives a great performance as Magnus Pym, a perfect name spy Continuing a long tradition of strong protagonists Le Carre, Pim also quite possibly the best. Egan plays PIM (which actually contains many shades author Cora), as a man forced to spend his whole life a lie and a betrayal of the circumstances sometimes, and sometimes just to survive with the investigation it becomes a "perfect spy." Egan plays PIM to perfection as a man always on the run, if not the other, then away. Egan makes a six or so hours of this miniseries is worth a look just because of his speech. <br /> <br /> Beaulieu a fantastic supporting cast Egan. Ray McAnally gives one of his best performances conman parents Pima Rick, who (like Le Carré told) is strongly based on the author's own father. McAnally plays a man who comes in and out of life, and Pima is one of those responsible for PfP become a "perfect spy." In fact, if it was not for performing McAnally a year after this in a very British coup it would be suitable for his performance, unfortunately, too short career. <br /> <br /> The rest of the support is excellent as well. By John Carolina mother Pima Alan Howard as his spy teacher Rüdiger Weigang as a friend of the young Pima controller turned to Jane Booker's wife Pima supporting cast is fantastic. Special mention should be of three young actors who played the younger PIM (Jonathan Haley, Nicolas Hale and Benedict Taylor), who set the young man who would become the man played so well, Peter Egan. <br /> <br /> production values ​​miniseries strong as well. As the miniseries adaptation of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People to prove these stories can be said only in miniseries format. Place non-English sites to scattered across Eastern Europe and the USA, are sets of Chris Edwards. Cinematography Elmer Cossey adds an extra level of realism in the show world. But really nail miniseries script. <br /> <br /> Screenwrtier Arthur Hopkraft set to work on the adaptation of six hundred or so pages of the novel perfectly. The novel was significantly (at least in his early parts) autobiographical in the early life of the Pima repeated much of the life of John Le Carre. for the script of the series is no exception, as it traces the development of Magnus Pym from a little boy to a "perfect spy." At no time does the miniseries deviate from his goal to talk fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage. If one wants to ever prove that the spy thriller can be a tense and exciting, never having had a gun fight, fist fight, or James Bond style car chase that would be proof. While the miniseries, plus six hours long not waste the time and all the better for it. <br /> <br /> While it may be a long time for some of those who do not have a very short attention span here it is a must see. From the speech of Peter Egan and Ray McAnally to small production values ​​and fine literary scenario A Perfect Spy is one of the best mini-series, which can expect to see. This is a fascinating trip down the history of the Cold War, even more than that. In addition, a trip down the John Le Carre called "secret path": the path spy a man who must lie and betray to survive. How much human drama as a spy thriller A Perfect Spy will be missed.
