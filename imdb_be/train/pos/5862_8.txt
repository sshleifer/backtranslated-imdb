There is not much going on in this story - only two men who used a variety of methods for processing the memories of Vietnam. But what it lacks in the room, it more than makes up in acting and realism. It is a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and exchange of experience. We even get a novel (not free - just another very real part of the story). It's worth a look.
