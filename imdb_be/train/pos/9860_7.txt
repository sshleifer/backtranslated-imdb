This film does not have parts that were funny, mostly just average funny one, but he did not have any parts that were really bad. The worst part was the voice of Sid. His slothy slur was too much for me. About 5 minutes later I was sick of listening to him talk. In addition to the annoying voice of laziness film it was good. There were many side jokes that if you catch them to make the film much better. This is a good film for children. He has enough in it to keep adult content and enough there to entertain the kids. This one is definitely worth a rental if you have kids and you want to watch a movie with them.
