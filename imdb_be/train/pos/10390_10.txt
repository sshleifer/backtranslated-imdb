Next to the "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz", it remains one of the greatest science fiction movie ever made. It's a real shame, is not as well known as the former film (perhaps because it sticks to stories based on legends and not modern or sci-fi environment, and that is the UK, which means a smaller market for movies), but he know very well that it deserved this reputation. <br /> <br /> As with all the great family movie, one may be a child, an adult or a teenager enjoy this film (I'm now 18), but it is necessary to evaluate the classic movies in the first place. I absolutely love this movie. She has an unusual score of Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic film score), that rivals any John Williams 'Star Wars' numbers, fast, but not flashy pace, beautiful sets, dialogue and the use of color (as a set and cinematography won Oscars) and introduced the Oscar-winning special effects (for a time, and some of them are still stunning). And, of course, hot June Duprez looks like a princess competes Catherine Zeta-Jones (she even looks like John's in the way!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movie All- time (next to "The Adventures of Robin Hood"), and it really deserves more attention. It is a real adventure charm throughout, and, together with the "Robin Hood", this is my desert island movie that I can watch over and over again, Sun annoyed <br /> <br /> Stars: ****. (Excellent)
