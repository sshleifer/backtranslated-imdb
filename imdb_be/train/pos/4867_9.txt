Ignore the plot and enjoy the Fred Astaire does Foggy Day and several other dances, one from the hapless duo Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire do what, in fact, the "step" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he knew how to fully exploit the potential of the movie. Best of all: what we see, Burns and Allen before their radio / TV husband-wife comedy career, pretending to dance they have to do in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in his films Paramount College of 30s years (George was once a dance instructor crane). Their two rooms with Fred the high point of the film, and to be expected. The first soft shoes trio workout for the "chin" of the wave number of the carnival, in which three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. Fan and Fred Astaire, Burns and Allen will be have a "story". I've seen it a 4 or 5 times, and find the button fast-forward is useful.
