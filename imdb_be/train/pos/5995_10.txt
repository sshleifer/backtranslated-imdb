Not sure if it was right or wrong, but I have read through the other comments before watching short.I have to say I disagree with the majority of negative comments or concerns people who were with him. <br /> <br /> As for the first time the "Lone Wolf" director / producer, I would like to see what I strive for, not necessarily with the pros, and people are just getting their feet wet as I am. <br /> <br /> If it is in fact also a first timer, I read, I applaud effort.Marvelous job, for that matter! There have been some comments about music.I thought it was very nice for piece.Some say that this is a kind of humming along for a while, but I found that the generated voltage without (we) must be aware of this, and when he pulled out pistol, and began crunching guitar chords, it was like we knew that train on the tracks, but realize that it is only now moving. Yes, there is a 180 degree slip / video out there, but shi * happens.Did anyone else see the dirty shirt Hugh whiten (closer to the end, in the rain) in "Australia"? Look how much money, and the people behind this film! Give your child a break for the gods! In general, I think it was done very well. Only 2 things that I would mention is hardly worth mentioning, do not come to the shiny brass picture frame with the camera, and I would just showed splashing in the early rounds even shot, so that people do not necessarily know what it is. <br /> <br /> My experience so far has taught me that this is not something that is difficult to make a film, it just takes time to learn how to do this, at the time, actually do it, and then you better for some time still to think of all the details you need to be executed before the call "post-production!" IMHO, it looks like the director / writer Ryan Jafri did their homework, and if it really is his first report card, I would have given his "A". The rest of the report in the principal office for whuppin '.
