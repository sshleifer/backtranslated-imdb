I can not understand why they decided to release the film to introduce American audiences to a dynamo, which Jet Li. Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask is not terrible, but it's certainly not great either. The final battle sequence is well put Yuen Woo Ping, who went on to co-ordinate the Matrix. But the English release suffers from rough editing and rewriting. (I pray Hollywood studios to release the films of director with subtitles.) Jet Li shows its characteristic charisma starring and Fran√ßoise Yip is cool, but the short role of the women 701. <br /> <br /> Black Mask has an amazing goth style which adds some interest, but it is overwhelmed by shootings and bombings. More attention to the fantastic physical Li skills were fine. Black Mask decent movie, but do yourself a favor and pick up the Fist of Legend, if you want to see a great movie that really shows Li skills.
