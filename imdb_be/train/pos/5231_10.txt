communicate to the cinema essential things of life - as something that is life, it makes sense? - essentially impossible. Of course, the possible answers to these questions are shown in every movie (story), but communication must be a direct appeal to the consciousness. This occurs when the input from the senses override "input" from our mind, that is our thoughts. Few directors know how to communicate the important things. Tarkovsky is one. His "Stalker" shows the mode of existence, life passes, how it manifests itself, and yet is slipping my mind. I think De Zee and De Graaf to do the same.
