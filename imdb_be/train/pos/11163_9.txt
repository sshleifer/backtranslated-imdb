I love this movie freekin! Walsh is a true master of cinematic form, his film was sometimes in my opinion, be overlooked. But this film is my favorite because it really gives you a sense of time when the film was set. \ <br /> <br /> All the great characters that existed, lifestyle, mode of dress, so they said, they may well be exaggerated, but it is good to know that there is a case where the two men were trying to outdo each one crazy stunts. <br /> <br /> I just felt like it was a piece of history to be Thats wathced many people and are valued because of this fact. <br /> <br /> Can I get it somewhere on the DVD? I just saw it on TV. But for those who want a slice of life film about that period of time is the ideal one.
