Everyone should see this film, because each of us is broken in some way, and it can help us to understand 1) May life is not as bad as I thought it was and 2) How important is it to take a child in need. There are so many out there. To think that the film was actually based on a real person made us think deeply about life and how the world and always will be. Corrupt, but corruption should not be to reach your home. We all have a choice! Definitely recommend this ... and while you're at it, I'd like to throw in «The Color Purple» and «Woman, thou art loosed" ETC. Jakes. <br /> <br /> It's all the movies that are based on life and give us an idea of ​​life.
