It is likely, Karisma at its best, except Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives it better, not even trying. The story is very good for a while, but in the end, it seems to drag, especially if Shah Rukh comes into the picture. What really made me as it were the performances of conclusions, dialogue delivery, as well as the story for what it was. It might have been better directed, and edited. Support the cause was even greater, including Karim's mother-in-law, despite the fact that it is just one shining moment, it was great to watch her. <br /> <br /> Many were also pretty good. I do not really like the picture on the Canadian family, but as soon as they are living in India, this is as real as it gets. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would give it a thumbs up!
