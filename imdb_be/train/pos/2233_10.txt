I first saw this movie back in the 1980s, and now in 2006, this film is still one of the best movies I have ever seen! I would recommend anyone to take a look at this movie. You will not regret. He worked well, so real, and never boring. Action is excellent and the location makes the film seem like you are there. From the beginning to the end, this film is the type that makes you lose your focus. The actress does an excellent job drawing the girl who survived that terrible plane crash in the Amazon, and it shows how she managed to survive in the Amazon are all alone. It's unbelievable that someone could survive in such conditions. That's why this film is so attractive. The fact that this is a true story makes the film even more interesting and to think that a young girl can survive this test is preferred. I think this film is one that I can watch over and over again, and one that I will never get tired. It really is quite a compliment as I have hundreds of movies! I would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best I have ever seen!
