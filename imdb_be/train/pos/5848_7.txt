And I gave him a high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it's a bloody good rock. At a time when there were so many other shows which were attached to toys / games of this show was unique in the fact that he had crossed history. As has already been said here, ahead of his time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's why the show was doomed. They have released 4 DVD 16 episodes of the series so far. I hope that more will come. <br /> <br /> How does this compare to watch today 20 years after it first came out .. I do not know, I still like it, despite the sometimes clumsy animation, and IMHO it's the only drawback. The letter was almost at the highest level, and far ahead of the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope for a DVD-ROM or even a set of all the episodes in the correct order ... DVD-drives are good, but I do not think that these stories are in the correct order, but in spite of this show rocked.
