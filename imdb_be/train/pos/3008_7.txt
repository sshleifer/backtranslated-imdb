Calm William Powell. He is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through the situation without a care in the world. He always seems to be on top of their game, and shows little consideration for those who doubt it. Murder projects are barely human beings. I have noticed that it is a staple of whodunnit. Other than an occasional weeping widows, victims have the function to be a reason there is a movie. Nothing more. There are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way, and Powell is a master at this. There is a lot of political incorrectness, especially with regard to Asian artists. It's a bit hard to take. The cast is large and the direction Curtiz is also consistent asset.
