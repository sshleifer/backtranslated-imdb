<br /> <br /> I have to admit, to enjoy a bad movie. I love them, I watch them all. Horror especially. My friends and I are going after the hard week at school and at work, pull off some crazy bands, pizza and explosion. One of those, we got Hollywood movies, was one zombie Bloodbath. This one had a big box, so I was expecting less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story of the housing project, which is built over the nuclear facility, which had elevated layers bulldozer and other underground layers just closed. Residents of the area to find a covered object when some children fall into the hole inside the cave. It wakes up a few zombies. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it's a piece-city. Gore effects and action will never stop until the end credits roll. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not great art, but it is one with his joke dialogue and over-the-top disgusting stuff was our favorite evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party bands" I have ever had the pleasure of watching. And you could say that it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks Brendan Fraser (he has a cameo), and it's just a wild ride.
