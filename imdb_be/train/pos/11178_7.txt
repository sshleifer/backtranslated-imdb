SMALL SPOILER <br /> <br /> Underrated little Stephen King shocker. It is not perfect, any stretch - even if sluggish performances Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, there still be wrong mystical elements of the story, to contend with. Old Micmac burial ground, mortally sick sister Rachel and Jakob Gauze en Victor Pascow never merged into something coherent, and in places the film feels confused and stretched. But a few horror movies really are perfect, and that is one may not be available in other areas it is in their willingness to strike. 'Pet Sematary' can actually be one of the most violent horror movies in recent years, with its murderous zombie child and his insanely insensitive way Zelda. It is politically incorrect, it is tasteless, it's free - and all this makes us squirm with disgust therefore `safer 'horror movies never can. Add to this one of the best performances of Fred Gwynne and witty direction of Mary Lambert, and you have a highly satisfactory scary movie - even with the end of hockey. Highly recommended for fans of the genre. 7.5 out of 10.
