Bromwell High cartoon comedy. He ran at the same time as some other programs of school life, such as "Master." My 35 years in the teaching profession leads me to believe that satire Bromwell High is much closer to reality than the "Master." Scrambling to survive financially, that astute students who can see through the pump them helpless teachers, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me I knew the school and their students. When I saw this episode, in which the student has repeatedly tried to burn the school, I immediately thought ......... .......... on High. Classic line: Inspector: I'm here to dismiss one of his teachers. STUDENTS: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults my age think that Bromwell High contrived. What a pity that it is not so!
