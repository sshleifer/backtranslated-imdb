There have been many recent surf films that I seem to have accidentally stumble without prior notice. I caught this treasure in digital cable this week, and what a pleasant surprise it was! It focuses on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60s, Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea gods Mavericks in the jaw. Hell, I could watch a movie only about Laird Hamilton - one of the greatest athletes of this generation - so everything else is just gravy. There's also loads of good surf interspersed with interviews of past and present stars of surfing, in a pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious way. With all surfing movies that I've seen it tells the story of the great wave of the best, and I think this is my favorite. Enjoy!
