Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 Family Credo just moved to a small town of Ludlow. The family consists of father, Louis, his mother, Rachel, brother Gage, and a daughter, Helen. They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall. Jude is 89, and basically can tell the entire history of Ludlow. <br /> <br /> For the new house Creed, there is a path that leads to the pet cemetery (written Pet Sematary). If Ellen wants to go up to see him, Jude voluntarily take the family on a trip. That is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> If Rachel and the baby were gone, the cat Church Helen dies. Jude says that Helen is not ready for the death of her cat, so he offers Louis to follow him down the path, past the pet cemetery. <br /> <br /> Jude says Luis this cemetery if used Micmac Indians. Louis Church hides without the aid of Judah. A few days later, the church returned, alive but out of hell. <br /> <br /> This film was one of the two horror movies that could really scare me, except «The Exorcist». The greatest performance ever be Zelda, Rachel's sister, meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help Faith from making mistakes, get things back from the dead. <br /> <br /> The musicians in this film plays the part of the extravagant. It is at the same time sad and mysterious. He goes along with the movie perfectly. <br /> <br /> 9/10
