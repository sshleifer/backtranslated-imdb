If you watch a short film you are always afraid that a person creates a film trying to throw too much into it. This is not so with this. Great story about a young girl who was quite worldly and other forces are trying to help make things right. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari do an excellent job representing the twisted spirit of justice and helps to convey complexities blurred line between good and evil. <br /> <br /> and the young girl's father and give great performances in this beautiful short film, but the performance of Eric, of course, show the kidnapper in this story. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film for him complexity, performance and large throughout history.
