Since I watched it for the first time, "Piedras" personal favorite and one of the few paintings that I really could watch over and over again. Big scenario reflects a bunch of women's lives (they are all somehow related to each other) with a deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramon Salazar reached a convincing film in his directorial debut, and prove himself as a director Effective actors. <br /> <br /> Not all speech is fine, though. With all will lead, they range from average (Najwa Nimri) very good (Vicky Peña), but the applause should be directed to a brand new server Monica, who convincingly plays a retarded daughter Antonia San Juan. Enrique Alcides irresistibly magical as orderly girl, and there is a good little twists of Andres Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramon Salazar. <br /> <br /> «Piedras" beautifully written and shot, when I watched it, I was so moved that I could not stop thinking about it for a few days. I highly recommend it.
