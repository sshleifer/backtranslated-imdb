Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, it's fun, camp horror comedy, in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and jokes often remains below the navel. And breast Cassandra Peterson became a character of their own. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) laid horror show hostess, who learns that she has inherited her aunt Morgana. So it goes in the small town Fallwell, which controls the most horrible monster ever to cover the land: The moral civility. Elviras boobacious appearance, of course, too much to prune, but the city kids get a kick out of it a different kind of approach to life. And, of course, there are still more sinister evil, her uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who, after his mother Elvira book of spells. See Elvira really is a witch, she just does not know it. And yet. <br /> <br /> For what it is, Elvira pretty funny movie, but the script does leave a lot of room for improvement. Most of the laughs come from the difference between Elvira and people of good morals, but there are some good visual gags as well. For all directions in order, but he never raised anything more than that. In general, good, deliberately mannered comedy. If you like this sort of thing, that is.
