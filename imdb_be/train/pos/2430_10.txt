This Casper the Friendly Ghost short of my childhood, and I'll see it to YouTube (Thank God for You Tube!); after that, I love this short, and this is one of my favorite panty Casper <br /> <br /> I love how creepy short begins with a haunting story of Frank in the galloping. until we get to see Casper sits his tombstone in the cemetery, reading. While each ghost has risen from the grave "replacement" of people, Casper decides to leave in search of another. But in an attempt to make one who sees Casper escapes. Poor Kasper sat on a log and weep; until slightly Pup comes nuzzles him. Casper and the little fox quickly bond, and he quickly calls cub Ferdy and considers him his best friend. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie relationship is put in grave danger, however, when Casper does not keep a close eye on Ferdy while they play the game of hide and seek. While Ferdi hiding hunter and his two hunting dogs come and try to kill a little Ferdy Ferdy and running as quickly as possible, until he choked and starts panting. While the hunter fires shots toward Ferdie Casper says that they are trying to kill him and flies in the direction of the hunter, and pleads that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone. And the hunter and the dogs are afraid of Casper. Casper shouts Ferdy that the hunter and the dog disappeared, and that's all right. But Casper see Ferdy body is not moving, and asks what he's all right. If Casper see Ferdie died he begins the mourning of pain because he lost his "only friend he ever had in his whole life." Casper is returned to the cemetery where he is buried Ferdy and made a tombstone for him near the tomb of Casper. Casper continues to mourn the pain as long as he does not see that Ferdi raised himself a ghost. Ferdy starts licking Casper on his cheek. Casper shouts with joy because he was reunited with Ferdy <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very good short. although oddly disturbing, indicating a death in the family-oriented cartoon.
