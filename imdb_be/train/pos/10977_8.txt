I took it out at random from another night of the library, not having the slightest idea of ​​the cult film, influence, or that it is being staged as a musical. (!) Most of the comments here is on target, it is moving, funny, sad, yes, a bit exploitative, despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. Chriterion expanded edition is a must for those who love him when he left. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see Eddie in a small class drop, like disappeared, you can hear in old movies Jackie O well; People just do not talk like this anymore. I think, as a documentary, it would be interesting to know more details about how the House into disrepute, Old Eddie, at least so far, seems to know what is happening to a certain extent; she could not see as a spectacular house disintegrate? <br /> <br /> However, the subject of the film is the life of two women built for themselves now that the real life one act of Tennesse Williams. Well worth your time.
