I've never seen a lot of movies online for the most part of my life, but if I had to choose any of them, I would choose Spatula Madness, a clever reference to the majority of films like Star trooper (etc.), with the camera and steel jokers, Jason Steele mastered the art of transformation of a normal picture in picture, and then put it all together with a frame-by-frame animation to get a world populated spatulas. the story begins in the middle of that to how directors pleasure? then the middle of the very beginning, and so on, when I first saw it, I was expecting that the crude pixely look, but Jason, like me, loves to look, so take every detail on max. although I do not recommend it for children, or anyone, but me like that, but please, find it on the network (his short film, watch film cow), his style reminds me of South Park, but less hard. 10 species, 6 for a laugh, and 6 for the story, it all comes to 10/10, good job <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I wanted to see the film.
