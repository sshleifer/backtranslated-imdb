... but I liked the show anyway. I read some comments from previous reviewers had to say about this show, and I can hardly completely negates all the criticism in my head (except for one: that the show was not fresh, the program was nothing but stale). Many people take issue with things about this show on the money: a pretentious; compulsory; excited; desperate attention; smug; The omnipresent annoying story. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, he was the original, he really, actually try; and did all the minuses. The show was a bright, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, interesting to look at ... you know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week, and look forward to it and enjoy it. I mourned her. But I think no one will bring it back to life.
