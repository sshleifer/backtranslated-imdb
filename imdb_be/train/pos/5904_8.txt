I've been waiting to see this movie from a long time. Promos This gave a clear idea of ​​the content, and when I finally saw it, I really find it was pretty well done. Most conventional romantic movie ends lovers finally get married or start a happy life after marriage, but there is a really big adjustment is required for this transition from the old life to a new relationship and life. That's what this film is all about the period when the young pair Fardeen and Ash get married through arranged marriage and begin their lives with their honeymoon. Actions truly spell binding, although I think that Ash had a little quiet, and it could use a few lines to you. The story was a well-knit, and dialog boxes are more or less suitable. Editing and direction were also good, Mena Galzar a really good job here. To summarize, I would say that it is a good drama cum romance, true combination of what Bollywood has to offer pure entertainer.
