After watching this movie months ago, he continues to jump back into my mind, and I feel that I have to buy, or at least to see him again, even though I watched it at least 3 times, when I was shooting it at this point . <br /> <br /> I fell in love with the direction of Hartley Hall many years ago - I have found that these films could make me laugh in a place that is rarely entertained. It is a strange feeling for granted, and I believe most of the people there are really just does not understand, and it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - I think I'll just get it - it, as if these films were made for me. <br /> <br /> Although I do not remember when I actually laughed at the film, it is still one of the funniest movies I've seen for years. If you do not see the humor Fay grocery bag bears the street to the church, in the office of his brother, the publisher, in the school principal's office her son can not have the sense to be very impressed with this film. Bag a silent character in itself, pulling around the image of motherhood usually brash, cynical Posey should be held before the international intrigues of the remaining part of the film stood in front of her. <br /> <br /> I think "Henry Fool" my I honestly do not remember Hartley least favorite films of his very well -. I think that the character itself was so mean I found it tedious Fort Hartley appears to be developing. female character. <br /> <br /> in addition to the light Posey, it was great to see Elina Lovenson, one of my favorite actresses again. Her extravagant naivete is ideal for directing Hartley. His ability to make a blatant seem banal helps define your style as a delicious irony chronic everywhere. <br /> <br /> This film breaks in very urgent international story of intrigue, explaining the political situation in Afghanistan. It has never suspected in the beginning. The complexity of this film is unparalleled. <br /> <br /> This is embodied in the «Stand Alone» cont. The less you know about Henry Fool more mystery revolves around it, the less you are waiting for his appearance before the end of the film - a complaint alcohol chain machine smoke, throwing insults at his Islamic terrorist overseer who for some reason seem to respect him, he is to find out Santa Claus in fact, 12-year-old school bully. <br /> <br /> Although I was amazed and pleased with other recent films Hartley "Girl from Monday" and «No Such Thing», «Fay Grim» goes far beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality Sun Oscar winner never dare.
