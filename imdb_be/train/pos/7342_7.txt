I will not claim to be a supporter of Bakshi, because I'm not. I watched only 5 of his animated films so far: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz the cat and the Lord of the Rings and, finally, the "Fire and Ice". What can I say that I found the "Fire and Ice" to be the most enjoyable of the lot. It's fantastic tale of swords and sorcery through the Conan the Barbarian, but beautiful works of art, realistic animation and live music for the film effectively gives a very classic charm of the film. <br /> <br /> worthy of first mention is the animation itself. I do not care what people say about rotoscoping, but in my opinion Bakshi used this technique very effectively here. I was amazed at how realistic character movements were. Leadership style and character designs did photorealistic "Fire and Ice" feel like a big budget blockbuster fantasy than a caricature. Unfortunately, the level of artistic details, tend to get a little bit inconsistent, especially towards the end of the film. Some scenes just look very flat with almost no body parts or tissue contour folds and shadows on the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic characters moving, realistic actions will naturally. Not only that the action is well put, but it was really tough. I would dare to compare the actions of cruelty live action films as Zack Snyder's 300, I noticed, however, that although the blood was shed, the blood spatter is minimized. Again, a large variety of creative team, which only enhances the viewing experience, not taking things too "over." <br /> <br /> While I do not recognize any "big names" in the cast, the voice actors to deliver satisfactory performance; maintaining delivery of each line and actually won just hamming it up in case the bad guys. <br /> <br /> I have said, that the bad guys ?? Yes, I did. Because this is exactly what the story of the standard good vs. evil tale. Nothing really original about the history, which seems to be simply a combination of existing clich√© fantasy films that include poorly dressed and warrior maidens. Everyone is looking for "depth" will be very disappointed. The characters do not give a lot of development, and some of them are Nekron and DarkWolf is one-dimensional, at best (though I've heard rumors about some distant scenes, which explains the obsession with DarkWolf Nekron murder and his mother. Such scenes worthy of full recovery and they should have been included in the final cut, to add a level of depth to the show). In fact, I would not be surprised to learn that the entire movie was just a "technical demonstration" of its kind to demonstrate the amazing animation and art, with a history cobbled together and thrown in as an afterthought, to pass it as correct "film" . <br /> <br /> true classic of a bygone era, "Fire and Ice" really captures the fiery spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful visualization of fantastic creatures and magical characters. This is a unique vision of the world created by the artist Frazetta baksheesh and with a good measure of action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Will it hold up to the standards of animated movies today? Definitely not. But I call on all fans of animation "to get off the high horse" and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow on you. This is really the pearl 80 worth checking out.
