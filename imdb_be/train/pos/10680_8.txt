As almost always happens, when Britain comes to the entertainment and / or successful, or someone sitting quizzes, the Yankees will come and cook format and produce its own grossly inferior, version. The man of the house is, of course, is no exception to this rule. Yankee version (three in the company) was unwatchable, Braindead smear, which seems to run forever. Bright example of the number of (non-existent) quality. The original, on the other hand, is a delicate remembered gem that had the common sense (like Fawlty Towers), to pull the plug exactly at the right time (as opposed to 637 "fun" episodes, the company came up with Three). Joe was cute, had a brilliant chemistry between Ropers, Richard O'Sullivan made it all look so easy, the scripts, while not exactly Oscar Wilde standard was consistently funny, and Chris was the most drop dead gorgeous woman who walked the face of this planet as well as the Dead sea was just not feeling well. Nuff said.
