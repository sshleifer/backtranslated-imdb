This road movie with a killer on board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), sophisticated, suave writer wants to conduct field research on American serial killers. But neither he nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), has the money for a cross-country tour of the killing sites, so they advertise for someone to split the cost. Who are they ultimately young couple, Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend Adele (Juliette Lewis), two of the best examples of "poor white trash", you will never find in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, the early and Adele, what makes this film so interesting, how they talk, laughter, trust, muse, speculate, saliva, and otherwise behave in a way I have not seen as replays " Beverly Hills. " At the beginning of the idea of ​​California: "People think that the more there is, on account of all that warm weather, cold weather makes people stupid." This is enough to convince Adele: "I think that explains why so many stupid people here." Early on that responds proudly, "It sure does." Sooner Adele continues to instruct about California, "You never do not have to buy any fruit, it's all on account of the trees ... and they is not got no speed limits, and I hear the rent for the first month for free, the state law." <br /> <br /> But there are some poor Early, well, mental health problems, which are becoming more apparent to Brian and Kerry, the four travelers to pass through the western United States, as they enter the desert in the south-west, with its beautiful stunning scenery "Kalifornia" is beginning to look more and more like "Sputnik" (1986), and at the beginning of starting to act more and more like John Ryder, manic hitchhiking everyone whose fear seemed so unstoppable. <br /> <br /> in «Kalifornia», which acts unevenly. Dukhovny performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, despite its overplaying at times. Michelle Forbes as big as the avant-garde, a photographic artist. But my choice for best performance goes to Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and ultra-strong Southern accent, it is stunning how naive, highly animated, children's Adele. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film takes on Twilight Zone feel to it, our travelers to enter the site the Nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated house full test dummies. The plot dissolves pretty sloppy in unnecessary and inappropriate violence, ending, which was somewhat disappointing. <br /> <br /> In general, however, «Kalifornia» is an entertaining film, due to the clever concept, great scenery, especially in the second half, a good film, great dialogue, and this is an excellent performance Juliette Lewis.
