Zero Day movie few people got to see, and what a shame that is. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, where the two main characters go down the room and ruthlessly killing people and then commit suicide, and that made me grab my stomach. I was shaking, that's how strong this film. <br /> <br /> The film is strange. It's too incredible, not to get a perfect ten. It's sad that so few people realize the true beauty of this film. This is not a budget that makes the movie good, is the number of the sense of the creators put into it that makes it good. <br /> <br /> He leaves a lasting impression in your mind that you just can not get out. It makes you realize the true horror shootings- especially if you had to know that person and this film makes you feel like you know these people. <br /> <br /> I would recommend Zero Hour for those who feel that they are mature enough to see it. I'm fourteen, and I feel that this film is too strange to express words. A feeling that you are watching something that really happened.
