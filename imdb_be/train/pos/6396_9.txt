You think you had it hard? You should check out this film. Brashear embodies courage and definitions. What this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration to us all. And significantly, after watching this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half of them! Cuba Gooding Jr. doing some of his best work to date as Brashear. De Niro is usually good as the southern redneck, who trains with him. George Tillman only its second basic function (after «Soul Food»), made as a quantum leap filmmaker. If you want to move and inspiration, you definitely need to check it out.
