Very good film martial, which shows the impact of war on hometown boy who loses his sight on Guadalcanal and have to go home and re-configure itself with the help of family and friends. A great actor cast helps make this film very interesting. the role of Eleanor Parker as a friend was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has the innocence to her in this film. Ann Doran role was as much fun as all of its small supporting roles. I especially like the hometown aura prewar Philadelphia. hunting scene very well. Of course, the war scene on Guadalcanal really showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle. Well deserving film, and one that should not be overlooked,
