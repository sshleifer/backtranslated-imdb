The Woman in Black (1989) TV adaptation of the modern history of the classic ghost Susan Hill, published a few years before the film was shot. Unfortunately, this movie has not been released on DVD, and as far as I know, he was removed on VHS. This presence in direct contradiction with its popularity among those who know about horror movies. The story revolves around the events in the seaside community in the early 20th century, where a young lawyer sent by his firm to conclude the case recently deceased widow, who died at her isolated marshy property. What he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare when he discovers that an old woman had in her death, and the ghosts of her past to rest entirely. The story is told in the small, but concise, never being self-indulgent, or screaming in the exposition. Obviously a tight budget, may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach, but that is exactly what you want the story, and why it works so well. This is something you do not see that's scary. Having said that, there is one particularly terrible scene, which is based on a visual, and it works to perfection. I watched this movie during the day, and it still gave me nightmares for almost a week later. If you like to be terrified, do what you need to get and see a copy of Women in Black.
