Currently I'm doing film studies at A.ş and "this is not a love song" movie we saw on my view, this is a film with a very simple story, but a complex prehistory. If you scratch the surface you will find thriller-chase film of two men who pass through the countryside by farmers after the murder: - "sounds pretty out» <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, you have to dig deeper. reveal the true sense of the true genre. Presumably, this is a love story between two gay lovers, full of trust, fraud and treachery. We were not told about this "love" directly through the film, but events occurring through the exit, such as Heaton acts in the direction Spike almost shouts the pristine love affair in our faces. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a good example of why British films should not be dismissed as "junk" because they are made on a low budget. <br /> <br /> a good movie with a confusing storyline, but it is definitely an acquired taste, and may not be suitable for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
