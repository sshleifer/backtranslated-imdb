Once, late at night on a deserted road in the empty salon Martin Sheen spinning yarn for Robert Carradine with Hopalong Cassidy and friends of tracking a group of monstrous cattle thieves who have already killed several people and kidnapped the girl Cassidy. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Christopher Coppola May incurred the wrath of purists William Boyd, daring to make a modern low-budget film with his favorite Hoppy, but I'm glad that he did! Neither character should not be so attached to the actor that no one will ever be allowed to play his or her again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was very fun and exciting update of the classic programmers thirties and forties. Although guilty of some bad acting, it is quite serious and unpretentious, which makes it hard for me to not like. <br /> <br /> In general, the production is a bit strange, though, but I really enjoyed the scene between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we are witnessing history in the course of history does odd inflections and more enjoyable.
