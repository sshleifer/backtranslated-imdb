Sudden Impact is the fourth of the Dirty Harry films, and one of the best features of these films is that they really do not degrade the quality of a film to another. Thus, Sudden Impact provides another thrill ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time, Harry tries to solve a series of murders during the holidays. Harry always seems to work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men of action, slowly, deliberately, and without fear. As the first of the Dirty Harry films to be made in the 80s, Sudden Impact lacks a bit of the 70s feel that characterizes the first three films. This does not mean that it is less quality. Bottom Line: Filled with the intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the series of Dirty Harry.
