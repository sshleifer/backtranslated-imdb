In the colonies we are not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost missed this film (which had its own TCM preview lately) because of the negative comments here about his appearance in «Ghost Train» - which I expected thoroughly annoying . Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find yourself laughing out loud. The physical aspects of comedy Askey and his time at the line delivering believe that you will get when Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen was a child. There's no comparing it with Bud Abbott or any of the other usual comic distributors who apply to films of this genre. You can feel also the thread that connects Asuka British comedy 30 years later; at least, it is clear from the American point of view, he has more in common with the troupe Monty Python, than with any of his colleagues here. As for the rest of the film - the more movies you've seen, the more likely that you can guess in the final, but it's still pretty interesting and atmospheric and expect its further appearance.
