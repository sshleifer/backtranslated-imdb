Miriam Hopkins "Lady with red hair" in the 1940 biopic Mrs. Leslie Carter, who also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and a great cast of supporting players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give excellent performances. Hopkins was a fine actress who really makes us feel Mrs. Carter. Showers are large, like a bright, self-centered producer / screenwriter / actor / impresario David Belasco, one of the biggest names in the theater. <br /> <br /> Although the second husband of Mrs. Carter, L Payne, served as an advisor on the film, it's a bad idea of ​​real life events, Mrs. Carter. However, there was a lot of publicity and a bitter divorce, and it is certainly regarded as a scandal for this purpose and become an actress. Nevertheless, she was the guardian of his son, Dudley, so that there was no custody battle. After she broke up with Belasco, she did not return to him, and, in fact, started to work in vaudeville and in fact made several films before the end of his life. She did marry h, and he became her leading man in many performances. <br /> <br /> The driving force for Mrs. Carter at the beginning of the film restores custody of her son, but she finally realizes that her time away, he carefully bound with his father. The film also (and I'm not sure if this was true in real life), she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house, which gives the film a more interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Or is not a bad movie, is probably not the image of grandeur or Carter or Belasco. One of the most famous moments Mrs. Carter was in the heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with a six-foot hair. Off-stage, fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage, compressing the center of the bell to keep it from ringing. Pretty visual.
