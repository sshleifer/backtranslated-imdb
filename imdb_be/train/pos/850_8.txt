The Matador (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best nya-Bondian role as a killer of middle age face a mid-life crisis while on a business trip in Mexico, where he befriends a square has a nice American businessman (Kinnear at its most welcoming) and finds there is more to life than death. Novice director Richard Shepard makes a solid debut on the big screen with significantly wicked black comedy with a keen eye for visual detail and nuances of dialogue and character development, which makes it a talent to watch in this breath of fresh air in the "buddy comedy" Formula strung on spit, that is expected to lead and letting it get Brosnan YA-Yas with devilish glee. sleepers stone indie hit.
