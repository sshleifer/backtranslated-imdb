Henry Thomas was "great." His character had my attention. I was so "in" stories that I forgot it was not real. I wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was. Other people in this story have been necessary as a part of his character. The way they came together to help each other is really awe. I love movies that show the real side of human emotions without getting hit on the head, that you're not smart enough to figure things out for themselves.
