This show is freaking hilarious! original jokes, God and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say, after the 8th of the season it is not funny because Eric and Kelso is not in the show, and Randi real jerk. Randy, compared with Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can not take a funny character and switch ute "I'm a tough guy" kind of guy (Randy). it's not his fault, anyway, but the authors are trying to keep the 8th season of funny, it's still there, but not as much as the previous seasons, but it's good. <br /> <br /> 360 are awesome, the circle, the red real kind of mental abuse and dad :) kitten always half high half pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, it also has its moments. Least characters favrioutes Jackie and Donna. they are steep, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> big show. Dumbass!
