However, this does not mean the book very carefully, but it is still a very interesting look at the history. Swayze was much better in the role than I had expected. And Doody avoid "a fool with the depth in the desert" picture most of us probably expected (see Capshaw in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"). <br /> <br /> In any case, it is surprisingly better than that awful time to Richard Chamberlain Quatermain cinema. <br /> <br /> This is very similar to Western in many ways. About the only thing I did not like all the mysticism, but I believe that it is an integral part of the genre. As "how can you have an African adventure story without witches doctresses and unnaturally wise wandering tribesmen?" Heh.
