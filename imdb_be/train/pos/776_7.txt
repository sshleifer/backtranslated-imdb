I think those relations are far more tension ... ... a lot more tension and potential tensions Sun reach ... <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack, may have been more than the number of songs in the background and the theme (which was good, but not quite, and not always at the right moments) ... yes ... I could feel no better soundtrack .. <br /> <br /> actors ... I umayu that they were anywhere from 7 to 8-10 ... lacking in key moments of sensuality ... <br /> <br /> A total of 7/10 .... mainly for stories
