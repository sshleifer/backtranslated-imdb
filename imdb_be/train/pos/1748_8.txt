From the beginning, I was so excited to see this movie. Poster perhaps ridiculous I have ever seen the movie. I immediately bought to my dorm this September. <br /> <br /> Each element in this film came together so beautifully. It's not often you see a film with so many penis, gays, and racial jokes so praised criticism. Karel and other actors to deliver every bawdy anecdote sensational. Karel is a sweet throughout the film, where the end of the film you are the introduction for him to succeed in their relationship more than you for him to get fucked. The supporting cast hard, each of which have some problems with the houses themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this film is a wealth of memorable scenes we have data. This is what makes the film easy to remember fondly. This film is often brought up when the word "chest hair removal" and "condoms" are mentioned in the conversation. <br /> <br /> Watching the theater, I was surprised at how many older people were there to watch it. I saw a group of four mid-60s women come. Despite the adult audience, this film is still filled the entire theater laughing. <br /> <br /> I think the type of people who like it and proponents Management Steve Carell. Many jokes remind me of the type of jokes you see on Family Guy, too. The film is shallow enough for young boys and still sweet and smart enough for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend going to this movie if you do not like profanity, or if you are easily offended. However, if you are in the movie, just remember that this film is all in a good mood. Jokes are not "gay jokes," they're just jokes. And they're funny.
