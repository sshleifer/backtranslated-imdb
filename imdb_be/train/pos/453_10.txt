I always tell people that "Enchanted April" adult film, do not swear, no sex, and no violence. One could think of it as "the ultimate chick flick," but I'm sure there are one or two enlightened people who are there love too. Nya invite children, though. This film is very discreet. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Enchanted April" very healing experience. Sound track and excellent scenery, along with the gentle manners of women, bring to mind the peace and beauty of the pre-Raphaelite paintings. <br /> <br /> To anyone thinking yours is looking only one kind of movie, I will paraphrase a line I heard once on «Saturday Night Live» and said that two of my favorite movies, "The Deer Hunter" and " fascinated by April. "
