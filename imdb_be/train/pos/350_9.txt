I would like to see Valentine's since I saw Denise Richards and Marley Shelton was in it, because they play some of my favorite movies ever. When I looked, Valentine, I was amazed at how big the story was actually. It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all. Actors and actresses have played part perfectly, and so it ended up so bright and cunning. Some scenes are a bit unbelievable, and poor, and I admit, a few minor details, he received only a small bit sad, but overall it was Nona-stop entertainment and suspense. He had a mind twisting plot that made you guessing all the way through, and he does not deserve all the crap he gets. I recommend this movie to watch at any time, but especially Valentine's Day, because it is sure to give you a ton of chills. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the trailer or rating, please do not ...
