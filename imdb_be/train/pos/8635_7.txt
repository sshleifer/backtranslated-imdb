«Kalifornia» is a good Hollywoodish odyssey of uncertainty and fear, which tells the story of two couples who travel cross-country to California to share the cost of gas: A pair of losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two artists wannabee, photographer and writer (and Spiritual forbes). Pete "nail" his character, which is the focus of several predictable thriller. Good watch for those who are in a psycho-killer Flix.
