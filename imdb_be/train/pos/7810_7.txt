What is Â«Cry Freedom", how? It's just a great and unique experience of South Africa and as black people were persecuted by white people in this country. The protagonist of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), chief editor of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods wrote several articles, where he talks about a critical Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon Woods meets Biko and he changes his views to him, and he begins to understand that the authorities are doing to black people in South Africa (on the right from the top, even by the chief of police). If Biko died in police custody, Woods decides he should write a book about it, and that no matter what he has to publish. But Woods has to flee their country, that this book was published, and he also has to put his family on the second place, so that the world can learn the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough managed to make a good movie about people with the basic premise that black and white are the same because we are all humans. History leads us to South Africa, and it (the film) is a great way for the whole world to know what happened on this earth, and I am disappointed that only 3,200 people rated this movie. This film, from which we can all learn something. Although it is a bit long, this story can not be represented in either the short way, because the director wanted to show us how difficult it was for Woods to get this book published after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> In addition, between Woods and Biko relationship was shown large as the families of these two men, and all the problems that they are experiencing. But sometimes sacrifices have to be made (the death of Biko), so that the truth can be happy (Woods book).
