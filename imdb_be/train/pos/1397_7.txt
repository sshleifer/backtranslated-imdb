"Shore Leave", mainly in the average Star Trek adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode, however. I just think it's not the best idea of ​​the show was to offer the fans. It's light entertainment, nothing more. Nevertheless, I am pleased to see that the TV shows of this type was enough common sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflict. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his team some time and landing radiates down onto a planet that looks like the perfect place to relax. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems. There are some action and tense moments, but much of this story is played for laughs. Okay, but mediocre.
