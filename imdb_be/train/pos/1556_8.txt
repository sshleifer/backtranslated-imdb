Like other people who commented "Fraulein Doktor» I stumbled by chance on this little gem on the late night TV, not having heard it before. A strange mixture of pulp fiction story about sexual but unscrupulous anti-heroine, on the one hand, and the realistic and well-researched way the war in the trenches, on the other hand, he had me hooked from the start. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the top five films about the First World War (the other "All Quiet on the Western Front», «Paths Of Glory», «Gallipoli" and the post-war «La vie et al Pep d'Autre "). And the scene of the attack of poisonous gas is really scary; horses and people are like riders of the apocalypse of these masks. <br /> <br /> I just wish I had taped the film.
