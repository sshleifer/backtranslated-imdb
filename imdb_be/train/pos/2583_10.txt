The biggest games of Kasparov and Fischer can be a mess for the complete beginner. This is a great movie. There is no special agency is involved in the conspiracy. This is the key! This is a private site, built as a private company. This self-destruction and self-organized plot. In conclusion, we note that the above scenario is the perfect professional story: private, independent ?? Organized, self-destructive, without a trace at the end. Anyone can be the plot: Smart "director" with some money. Everything can be done only by delegation. "Director" should only be the trigger. If an ordinary viewer can not see the essence of the story in a clear sequence of the film, the real story is less likely to be discovered. All performances of actors is well done, with some special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
