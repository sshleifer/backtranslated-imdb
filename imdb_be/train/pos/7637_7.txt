I really like this movie, although I can not imagine James Belushi very much. In this film you can see a few big names on the rise, Linda Hamilton and Cox, namely; Kane has been a great course. The plot in this movie just; its the same as the movie Sliding Door. This, however, has been said, in a light-hearted manner, and I love comedy moments in it. It made me trying to relive their own important moments alive, for example, that when I took this girl for the film, and not others, etc. This tells us that the people around us could take different roles in our lives, when some of the smallest details have been changed. He also reminds us to be careful what we wish. Life is not always so good, on the other hand, we think; it may be that we have at the moment is the best for us, all things considered.
