I would like to comment on the number of how much effort. The storyline, although it requires some improvements have been quite good, especially in Season 1. Season 2, but became a freak show, and had lost the original charm of the district attorney. Season one storyline was more interesting, easy side of life at Jam Pony while purposeful serious plot with Manticore chasing J-series. I look forward to the new season, in fact, I still am. I hope that the guys and manufacture DA FOX crew understands that many public procurement have to wait DA, to make a comeback. Even after 2 years of it is canceled, DA can make it big, when working properly, and I think that's the name of James Cameron to take on this task.
