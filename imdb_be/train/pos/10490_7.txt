Another example of what British cinema can be achieved: a simple story, told and acted well. Blethyn gives layered and warm performance as the recently widowed and financial constraint Grace, ably assisted by a rigid support cast. Map "nimble little city" is played on a handle, like many TV series and movies that have come from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). As aforementioned, this film makes use of some perfectly beautiful rural landscapes, in this case, in the wet and wild coast of Cornwall. <br /> <br /> Some viewers might find the wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit complicated, others can find the ends just a little too cute and safely. But it's a nice joint, to be sure.
