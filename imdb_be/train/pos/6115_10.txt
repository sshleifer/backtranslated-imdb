Have you ever wondered how far one can go to a movie? <br /> <br /> Schizophreniac tirelessly explores the extreme world of Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is a keen writer, and killer junkie bastard who will stop at nothing to destroy anyone who stands between him and madness. Slave demonic voices his ventriloquist dummy, I asked Harry begins a killing spree. <br /> <br /> From director Ron Atkins is a first for participation in the revolting story will ever be removed <br /> <br /> The only other film I've seen like this happens to be the second installment of the right Schizophreniac Necromaniac <br /> <br /> this is really a low budget film and is not for everyone, but if you are looking for something disturbing, and more monstrous, it would make an excellent choice. <br /> <br /> Do not expect anything like a modern day of horror (like Scream) <br /> <br /> Look at the reviews recommended
