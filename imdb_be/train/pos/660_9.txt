9 / 10- 30 minutes pure holiday terror. Okay, so it's not so bad. But it sure is fun. <br /> <br /> Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) fairy tale story about the holiday FEAR, which gives us all the Christmas goose ... GosseBUMPS other words. Bwahahahahha. You really have to be careful what you AX Santa. There Scary Christmas and a happy new fear. Okay I will. <br /> <br /> So, in history, a greedy wife (Screamer best in the world, Mary Ellen Trainor), kills her husband (Marshall Bell, a coach who gets a towel whipped to death in ANOES 2) for money. BUT, her plan falls apart when a crazed killer, dressed in a Santa suit (Larry «Dr. Giggles» Drake) comes her way. <br /> <br /> If you look it up on YouTube, you can watch for free, but most of you have seen it (my third review). But if you have not seen, I suggest you do.
