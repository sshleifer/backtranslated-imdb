While Rome is going crazy celebrating the visit of Hitler - form band councils - two outsiders to stay at home, in a large building, and meeting the wind. It Sofia Loren, who is the wife of brutish civil servant and mother of six children. He Mastroianni, radio announcer, who was fired because of his homosexuality. Both of them are in need of the company and an understanding of how it is, to find each other. <br /> <br /> The film covers a span of a few hours. Color dull, and it all comes with the soundtrack military marches and hysterical radio announcer. Ironically, the Nazi anthem - Horst Wessel - ends up becoming a romantic theme music <br /> <br /> Great movie, great vacation special epoch in the history of Italy and touching, sad story .. Mastroianni as good as we used to wait and Sofia Lauren does an excellent job, very far from the pins to her normal truck driver vendor Neapolitan people. Do not miss it.
