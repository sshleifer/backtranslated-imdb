This film was like a classic cheese in the 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of them all, so that when I saw Free on-demand, I had to look at! It plays Caroline Munro, with both films Dr. Phibes (she was his wife who had died!), Dracula AD 1972 The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Captain Kronos -. Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, maniac, and Faceless <br /> <br /> Brought to you people for not open Til Christmas and play, Heres my thoughts about this ... <br /> <br /> It opens on April Fools' day, where a bunch of kids playing a prank on the school complex nerd- promising him sex in the shower, and gives him public humiliation and the person in the bathroom (all in while hes naked!). The coach puts an end, but both sides swear revenge. But the cool kids eventually burned alive botanist. <br /> <br /> Cut into the future, and it is, high school reunion, or so they think (bwahahha?). Only those with invitations were gangs who burned the child and his April Fool's (or in fact, the day before April Fools, but the fun starts at midnight), but they do not see a match and hang out in front of the school before nightfall. Then they finally break into the school, and it starts to storm. <br /> <br /> Inside, they find food / drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of them the cabinets and property, along with Marty (botany) lockers and yearbook. They also found an old black janitor / caretaker, who spends his time saying "Ooooh yesser! Yesser! I do not want any trouble, sir! "And then die instantly. Rather pointless character, but he's still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The film takes a page from the book Stranger in a bloody magical way that you simply must see! It is when everyone knows that they are there to die, and they begin to uncontrolled Shirley, who decides it would be better to take a bath in the old school of souls while it apart. Of course, this results in blood and acid and its face melts (very cool, mind you) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and Marty is, killing all wearing clown mask .. Whats your plan? "All we have to do is stay up and wait till noon. Marty custom to kill us in the middle of the day! ". Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently, you can only kill at night. But will they survive the night? Who will live and who will die? And why all the bodies disappear? Rent, buy, or steal it's a great movie to find out! The film is actually very good, full of clich√©s (custom car start, dammit!) And just a slasher fun. Not to mention all of them have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to everyone! And not to mention, he has a twist! In 1989 Cutting Class is a spin-off from this grinder stone, and the movie begins a career Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell <br /> <br /> My favorite scene :. 2 people have sex, the guy wants to finish, but she does not. "Talk dirty to me, Frank !!" she yells "Uh ... tits!" "Dirty!" "Uh ... Tit. F * ck. Tits. Boobs. F * ck.". It seems to work for her and her climax, the killer electrocutes them both!
