Most people know Paul Verhoeven as a director of many good (and bad) science fiction films in Hollywood. But long before he churns out common thriller in his homeland. History is one of the major fatal premise is nothing new or passionate about. Verhoeven thinks he can do it better by adding a series of dream sequences that instead of defining our protagonist, and its provisions, are simply used as a way to carry forward the predictable plot. The film's script was solid, the dialogue helps to inflate the effects of soft stories. What really made the film at least, was good for a stunning effect. Jereone Crabbe was strange as "tortured artist", and supporters were very good as well. In addition, cinematography Jan de Bont adds at least some life to the film, helping to make Verhoeven look at least as a director capable. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
