As noted by other reviewers, this is one of the best movies of Tarzan. Unlike other but I like the beginning of the film, it feels pretty accurate description of what the trading post should be like. Plus the exposure needed, so we know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most exciting and frightening sequences pursuit ever made.This occurs when the safari group Harry should overtake the tribe of cannibals. The values ​​of prior censorship of production add a lot of realism, drawing really terrible danger awaited the Europeans are going to the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps a priori, accurate records of how badly treated the native Africans were their white employers. In dropping sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some large sets and two chetas! Not to be missed adventure classics.
