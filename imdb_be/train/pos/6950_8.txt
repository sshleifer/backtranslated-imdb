On the day of the California Presidential the Primary, between midnight and one o'clock in the morning, Victor Rovner spy sends a message to Kuala Lumpur in the United States. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, a federal agent Jack Bauer returned to his family, and problems at home with her teenage daughter Kimberly, who blames her mother for letting Terry Jack out of the house. Terry and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim, and they discover that the girl ran away from home. When you try to solve its internal problems, Jack called him a counter-terrorist Unit colleague Nina Myers for a meeting with your boss, Richard Walsh, who reveals the threats against the life of Senator David Palmer, who is running for president, and they need to find out who fired. Later, Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and says that there is a conspiracy in the agency against David Palmer, and assigns Jack to find a co-defendant. When the plane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has one additional issue to worry about. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a promising start of a successful series, introducing Jack Bauer. This is the first time I watched this show, and I confess that I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story, with lots and lifelike characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect as a family man and a reliable agent in charge of the three challenges at the same time: to find the murderer, to protect important policy; find the traitor in his organization; and find his teenage daughter who gets in trouble, trying to save his marriage. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "12:00"
