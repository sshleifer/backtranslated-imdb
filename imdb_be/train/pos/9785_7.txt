Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I got a movie for Hugo Weaving, and I watched it till the end. This is one of the "drama of life" films, as well as my mother called the film, which reflects the real life story without any extraordinary events, and that this is mainly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I love light and girls, the rest did not have too much wine, but not too many virtues anything. I longed for something like an interview, or at least some matrix element villain here and there, but nothing unusual. History teaches each facing their own destiny and to break out the other to build for you, but it happens when healing peach plant in the area is going to close, so not a lot of effort to change the situation required. <br /> <br /> «smart» American Beauty lyrics sound counterpart in the background can be a part of a larger soundtrack, but the only one to play again and again became annoying after 100 minutes of the film. <, Br /> <br /> In the end, I think that on the proposal of the Australian life, but I do not think a particular Australian (it could be located anywhere) did his job, and it does not seem as appealing as history. <br /> <br /> I think one has to be in a certain mood, like a movie.
