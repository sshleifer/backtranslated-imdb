GoJoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, taking a very creative director, editor and photographer and work on historical themes, which the Japanese call "period pieces.Â» GoJoe extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant even. New wave of Japanese samurai films allows you to look at the traditional belief in shamanism, the demons and the occult forces, which, of course, were part of their ancient culture, but it is not really explored in samurai epics Kurosawa or Zaitochi series. Another great prospect .. Yklad this genre Onmyoji (2001) I would place the director Sogo Ichii as one of the most exciting and creative new wave of Japanese filmmakers Other recent part of the Japanese period, I highly recommend include Yomada in Twilight Samurai (2002) and Dato Shintaro Katz: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
