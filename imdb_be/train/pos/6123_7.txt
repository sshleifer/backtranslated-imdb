Before you comment about this movie, you need to understand that when I saw this film, I was expecting the typical crap, horror, B-movies and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only delivers, but in fact one of the best that I've seen in a long time. Scott McDonald as big as Jack Frost, in fact I think he has a future in the psychopath in the big time movies, if ever given the chance. McDonald is a serial killer, which becomes a snowman through any combination of random stupid funny elements. As soon as it starts to move around the snowman and kill people, though, you'll find it hard not to laugh. The lines, which are called quite backward, but really funny. The fact that the rest of the cast is completely over-acts only adds to the film's nonsense, but it's nonsense, it's genius. The scene where the snowman with a teenage girl is really a classic in the B-movie horror film fashion. I really hope there is a sequel, and I'll be there to watch it on any cable channel does it. Of course, this is just fun to watch the first few times, and it's not quite a good job of films technology, but I just would like to see a snowman kill people. I gave it a 7 out of 10, it's a great film for the late hours of the date and time.
