I give ten out of ten, it is one of the best movies ever. Completely smashed, dazed and stunned the whole picture, amazing game by Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, and the whole crew, an amazing story ... Just look at yourself and pluck up the courage to admit that was involved in your soul, because it is strange, but has all the answers you are looking for has never ... all the best, mr. Ritchie! THE VERY BEST EVER. Those looking for a simple and figtings quarrel they keep crying disappointed. But there are a lot of small films in Hollywood at the moment, you can not remember what it was about the next day you saw him. On the contrary, Revolver unique, I could not expect that you can draw such a clear and brilliant picture of yourself, all those who had to watch. Absolutely unbeatable, strange, dazzling ... You can get an understanding of watching it, I do not doubt it. In fact, no words can not express my admiration ... I still wonder how it was possible to shoot such a film after years of breakneck Hollywood garbage we saw. Thank you with all my heart, it's simply the best.
