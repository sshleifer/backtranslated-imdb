Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in its quest for freedom struggle of India ignored his family and son, this film about his son Hiralal, who feels abandoned because of Mahatma Gandhi's life in society. The film begins in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi worked as a lawyer and fight the cause of freedom against the British in India. Hirarala arrives in South Africa, to help his father, who is a lawyer, since Gandhi took part in the struggle for freedom, he wanted his wife and children to join too as a public service and as a result gets a chance hirarlal to complete their education and have not passed the exam, he married his love Gulab (bhoomika Chawla) against the will of his father. Hiralal has ambitions to go to England and become a Barrister in the same way as his father, but his own father refused to give him a scholarship offered his family a businessman and instead give it away to another person say that science should not be limited to his family 'and both should be open to the most worthy pupil who lives in the colony. It angers Hiralal and the gap between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggling to make ends meet, and lands on the streets through business failures and huge debts, he loses his wife and children. Akshay Khanna is to give a stellar performance as the Hiralal Gandhi .. all kudos to him, the direction and the script is fantastic, picturization fine. Overall a great film and a must see. I give it 10/10
