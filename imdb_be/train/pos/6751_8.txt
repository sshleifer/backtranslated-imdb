Pretty good movie from Preminger; labyrinthine at times, as it explores the sets and locales from different angles and points of view, as if it was the nature of the film in the inhabitants of the modern city and how they live. In this sense, it is visually and spatially pleasure, like his hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets very hot water when he accidentally kills a Man with a plate in his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays a leading role, as if he was Hamlet, and has never been better. History can be a pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight, and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. As his girlfriend, Gene Tierney is an attractive but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes for a very interesting villain, with its natural warmth provides a good contrast to the cool Andrews; his smile, dear imaginary bad guy seems to be constantly challenging his nemesis the mere fact of his being emotionally open, in contrast to the tightly wound and moralistic policeman who pursues him. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this film, which seems to be a transition for all stakeholders. For the director Preminger is a kind of reunion with their stars, Laura Andrews and Tierney, Pass their career peaks at about the time the film was made. The supporting cast - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - it is, for obvious reasons, is more optimistic, as they were on their way. Preminzher, serene observer, as always, lets events unfold entirely expressing a strong point of view as morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, for a cat-and-mouse between the two antagonists seem more and more archetypal than any simple film could contain much less resolve. <br /> <br />
