. All the films made before 1912 really should be viewed with a sense of time and place <br /> <br /> In 1894, the Lumiere-family people [father Antoine (1840-1911), son of Auguste and Louis] owns and operates the plant, which produced a photographic plate and paper. Not a small business; Plant has more than 200 employees who received a pension and social security advantage - innovative for the time. It was located in Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon, France. What made Louis Lumiere become interested in creating Cinematagraph, in 1894, it remains open to speculation. My suggestion is that the appearance of the Edison Kinetoscope Organization (peep show machines), in Paris, during the fall of 1894, provided that catalyst. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Dickson, employees Edison invented a camera filming the size of the piano, which was patented in February 1893. He had an electric drive (when powered by heavy batteries. This massive machine pumped celluloid film strip (recently developed company Eastman) by the lens at a temperature of about 40 frames per second (fPS). It was located as nearly immovable object in the "black Maria" (in fact, the first studio film.) Kinetescope machine showed satisfied presentation (less than one minute long), which were filmed in g tai studio. <br /> <br /> during the 1894 Louis Lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing the motion picture camera. He found that even at 16 frames per second on celluloid film, vision persistence, because the human eye / brain would allow normal movement will be perceived. His camera, called Cinema, was the size of a shoe box and is equipped with a removable film magazine that provided for storing enough films to make the shoot last about one minute when it was cranked by the lens 16 frames per second. <br /> <br /> size and light weight of the camera (it can be converted to a printer or projector by adding a. light source) made enough that it can be delivered to any place to record the event in a portable (if available there is sufficient sunlight) in the spring of 1895, Louis removed: trick riding on some cavalry; house on fire with firefighters arrive and dousing with water engulfed the building; and a number of other scenes in Lyon and the surrounding area. Using the lamp Molteni, he turned the camera to the projector, and presented their films scientists gathered in the waiting room Revue Generales des Sciences. Images are projected onto the screen at a distance of five meters from the lens. The screen has been stretched in the doorway between the two rooms. At a meeting of professional photographers, in the same year, Louis photographed arriving delegates and in the evening they showed video footage of their arrival. <br /> <br /> With the honors of both scientific and photographic societies, Louis decided to show the public its invention until the end of the year. After all, every one of his films will be about one minute long, it will take at least a dozen films to make a good presentation. For one of these films, he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory, photographing weekend staff at the time of quitting <br /> <br /> public places selected Antoine -., Who offered himself as a "fairground barker" for cinema - salon Indien was Grand café on the Boulevard des Capucines in Paris It was a winter Saturday night, December 28, 1895. As the first audience sat, they were presented with a projected view of the appearance of the Lumière factory (closed gate). Some of them were upset that. they're just going to see the routine slideshow Lumiere photos. But then crank the camera / projector has been turned on and started moving. Louis had an innate sense for the movie taking. This film has a beginning, middle and end. In the beginning, the doors are open, and people are starting to leave the workplace, in the middle, people flow with - many try to ignore the camera, and the operator, as they seem to be happy to leave the day job behind them. In the end, the door closes factories. <br /> <br /> And it was the first film designed for the entertainment of the public.
