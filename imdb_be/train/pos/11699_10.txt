I saw this film as much as ten times and it is awesome. But the only thing with him was that in the beginning, there was too much talk about who is with whom. I think it would be interesting to do a remake. But on the official website, they said that they will not do a remake, because a lot of people got saved when watching. What's happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a very good actress. She made several other films in the '70s and' 80s, but since then we have not heard from her. I know for sure about Tom Rekforda, who plays Jerry, works on accounting in RD Films. But in general, I must say that the series itself as a lagging went old school.
