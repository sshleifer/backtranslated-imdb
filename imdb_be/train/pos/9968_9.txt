My mom took me to see this movie as a kid, and I long to see it every year, as I do all of my Christmas songs. What I remember most was silly devil and Santa looking through the telescope. I waited and looked through the manual every year TV after to see if it will be displayed. I usually find it to play in the second half of the day on Saturday. I just found the film in English, who took something special from the movie, and longed to find a copy in Spanish. I think this film is dear to my heart, and never suffered from nightmares, others can offer. Yes, this is another film about Santa Claus, and that's what makes it special and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with their children, as I explain to them my favorite part of the memories !!
