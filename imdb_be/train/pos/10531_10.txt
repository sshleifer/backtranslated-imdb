I love this movie. My friend Mark and I browse the local Hastings, because we had the desire to rent something we've never seen before, and stumbled upon this thin film. We had no idea it was going to be about, but it was exciting. 2 thumb up. I liked how the film was made, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a funny film that also makes you think, I strongly recommend that you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie. I would tell you some of my favorite pieces, but it can spoil the movie for you, so I will not. This movie is definitely on my list of top 10 good films. Do you really think there is nothing cheerful?
