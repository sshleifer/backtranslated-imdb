Good story. A good script. Good casting. Good acting. Good direction. Good art direction. Good photo. Good sound. Good editing. Good all. Put it all together, and you end up with a good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The shame of it is that lacks nearly of the caliber of films to be made these days. We can count ourselves lucky that the writers / directors like John Hughes are sometimes able to make their creative voices heard. <br /> <br /> Every time I noticed that I was watching a movie in the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly I conclude suit, something that the movie is correct.
