There seems to be only two types of reviews of the film in the network. Those who hate him and to curse the name of Bakshi and those who love it and call it a work of genius. I tend to be in the middle. I'am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film (e.g.the rigid cutting stories, bad rotoscoped charecters, act on, and etc ...) But dispite this I still love this movie. Rotoscoping (if done right) adds a dimension to the terrible realistic charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic. The surreal scene where Frodo nineriders chase stylish and well-made music and ... magic. Unfortunately, the bad points outweigh the film, but if you can force yourself to ignore them is a great movie. <br /> <br /> (without a doubt, I will be angry mob lynching of people who hate the film after writing this review, ah well, that's life)
