This film is worth seeing for the visual beauty and movement, acting alone, but there is also an interesting cultural connotations of alienation. Women and performers (and participated in a support role transvestite opera star), both destined to be attributed to subserviant role in China. This makes it unlikely connection between outdated street performers and a young girl, even more strongly as a triumph over the native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this film was the soundtrack of the tendency to swell with emotion is unnecessary performance of actors. <br /> <br /> a welcome alternative to the unsatisfactory action film of the summer.
