This well-made documentary about the exciting world of Indy Car racing. Photos are just wonderful. The scene was Mario Andretti manages old race roadster down the New England streets lined with ancient maples, letters of wind away from the vehicle speed is incredible. The film does lose some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you enjoy watching cars driven to the limit, you should see this film.
