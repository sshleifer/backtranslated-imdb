There are some very clever humor in this film, which is both a parody and a tribute to the actors. However, after a while it just seems like an exercise in style (although the big gags, such as part of the ongoing Balasko Dussolier, and very good, which is valid for all participants), and I was wondering why Blier made this film. All is revealed in the finale, when Blier directing Claude Brasseur, receives a phone call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from the sky, and is able to tell how much he misses it. Effective emotional closure and obviously heartfelt. But there really is not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the interesting film around it is constantly working. Some really good scenes and consistency, however, and every one who loves the «mosntres Sacres» French cinema must get enough of the fun of the film.
