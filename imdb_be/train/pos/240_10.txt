Fantastic film. One to initiate all 5 senses. Is this not a real historical record and not all information should be treated as factual information. True convention Hollywood used as a play list and very attractive actor as "heroes" such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - lover Ned Kelly), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned right hand man) and the ugly (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play drunk and corrupt Victorian police. It also instills a very fragile love story in the link between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts), to encourage all romantic women to be especially susceptible. Even with the first episode, when Ned rescues from drowning fat youth and his father calls him "the sun" and had "a twinkle in his eyes as he looked down at me, his hand on my shoulder," this is a very romanticized and urges viewers to side of Ned Kelly, who lost. In addition, not all Australians like to lose?
