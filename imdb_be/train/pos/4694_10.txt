If your a fan of the aircraft type film is a must see! Set in the 1920s and 30s Johnny Dangerously has not only a great actor but great lines. "To bring down the walls of dates, to bring down the wall to knock Dates Dates and # @ $% # @ $ walls." "You should not hang me on the hook for Johnny" or "It seems, Johnnys be put." Definitely a parody of the old James Cagney movies and links in them a lot. There's a great scene when Jhonnys down death row and has set a priest to save him. Listen to the priests of false readings, it's pretty funny. Another great scene when Delauise house playing dad. Look at his reaction to Johnny after he tips dad said a lot without making sound.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh or old movie buffs.
