Why a stupid, boring, overpriced crappy movie series like "Star Wars" gets all the hype, and a truly amazing film like this is completely unnoticed .. is me ... This movie will really open your eyes to a dark, anxious, sad and a terrible world we live in ... <br /> <br /> Unlike boring "Elephant", this film is not one of those "just an ordinary day until someome glances trigger" movies .. this film focuses more on what happens after the event ... <br /> <br /> Diana played very hot and very talented Erika Christensen, is happy and healthy straight-a student with great friends and a great life ... yet ... she is not injured in the shooting day, being hit in the head .. fortunately, she was not killed, but seriously injured and needs to be in the hospital for some time, causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain, in the annex to the physical ... <br /> <br /> at the same time, Alicia, played by the also very beautiful and talented Busy Phillips, is an unpleasant , heartless, rebellious, anti-social goth girl who does not have any positive signs on it ... and it is a whole If shooting takes place .. because it turns out she was friends with the shooter knew what he was going to do what he did ... that makes her lead to the police station and be asked some questions .. If she refuses to tell the cops when she knew that the filming will take place, they always come to her home to try to persuade her to say something ... and it is still there, so the headmaster makes her presence at the funeral of one of the dead students, and after she goes to that ... the chief decides enough to nutsedge, and forces her to visit Diana at the hospital .. Of course, it refuses it, too, but mostly said that if Alicia does not undertake this, the police are going to continue to try to get her to say something .. and so it actually goes to see it ... <br /> <br /> lonely, traumatized, both physically and emotionally injured Deana more than happy to h ave someone to visit her, but, of course, Alicia anything but pleased to see her .. Deana tries to give her a warm reception, but, of course, Alicia meets nothing but harsh and hurtful remarks and strong statement that I but here only because it has been replaced, and has no intention of being friendly with her at all. But sooner or later that the intention to change ... (and that's all I'll say :) This is truly one of the most moving films ever, and one of the most dark and disturbing .. In fact, I think they bind it is with the "American history X," as equally disturbing and moving at the same time ... <br /> <br /> NOTE: See the movie at your own risk !! It contains very graphic scenes and images! Excellent and criminally underrated movie! I feel so ashamed that I'm pretty much the only one who knows about it!
