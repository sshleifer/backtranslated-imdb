This is a great modern film noir .... "excellent" is that it is interesting from start to finish. There are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ..... but I have not found anyone who did not get caught up in the story. The film has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, sports some nice colors and a cinema plus a good guitar soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I'm labeled a crime movie, "film noir", because it is rough and all the characters are not good. Even only supposed good guy, played by Nicolas Cage gets in trouble himself, lying down and has a quick thing he should't there. In addition, he is doing something at the end that is not right, but I'm not going to spoil his words. Suffice it to say, however, that the other characters are so bad that they make cell look good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of the "bad guys" Does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not so much. At least in "abnormal" category, he was badly beaten. Lara Flynn Boyle is interesting to watch a bunch of reasons. J.T. Walsh gives even greater productivity supportive too. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that never got the publicity, but it should be. You'll have fun watching it. By the way, try to say the name of this movie loudly three times faster, without spoiling it!
