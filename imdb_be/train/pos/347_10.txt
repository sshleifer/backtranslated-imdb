Valentina is now one of my favorite horror movies. Death scenes are complex and most of the action is good. Marley Shelton made a big as the female lead (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in "I know ..." movies). David Boreanaz, which is the main reason I've seen this film was a very small role, but he played well. Removal from the list of good actors Denise Richards. She was terrible at it. The only scene that I was glad to see it was * Spoiler * her death scene. Overall, this is a good movie to watch. You should definitely look at it, before watching "Scream" or "I know ..." again.
