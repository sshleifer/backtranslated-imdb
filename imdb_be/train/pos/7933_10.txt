Good times working with Quiroz Brothers, and the entire cast of this project, as "Guy on the bench." I was amazed at how well they have achieved capturing all identified features of the «B» horror film. I hope I will have the opportunity to work with Pumpkin Pictures team again in the future. I moved to Detroit, shortly after completion and were recognized in the community several times since the release. One time was actually in the video store, and she almost lost her mind. It was pretty funny, and it was my first real moment of signing, I signed her receipt. One day I asked the girl at Blockbuster, when the film is often rented, and she confirmed, looking at it in the computer. While he was shooting a Ring2, which was also a new release at the time ... The title really captures immediate interest in more urban markets. She also noted, in many cases, the film was not returned to me, leading customers to believe that the film is just very good people do not want to bring it back .... Watch the Zombies, when in the hood, because they will get me! Jaysun Barr (Guy on Bench-2005)
