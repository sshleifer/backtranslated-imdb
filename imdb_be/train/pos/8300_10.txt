It is not surprising that Busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity, the film is also not a bad decision, but one I thoroughly enjoyed. The first 5 minutes of the most boring 5 minutes in any film; sad, bad dialouge, and then, with the position of Spiderman's, Busey shouts the worst line in any movie ever created ... "your worst nightmare butthorn!» I coughed up some of my eggnog laughing so hard. That line resonates so well that even the top of the infamous Clooney's "Frieze Hi, I'm Batman" line. Other classic moments in Busey constantly worry for people who remind him that he was his partner, ex-CIA killed ... what he did, accidentally shooting him in the chest (all made possible thanks to a retrospective super slow-motion sequences, making the paint preview dry, sounds exciting). There's an ashtray to the NADS, a blow to the face, and that "it is not my fault, and you know it!" Well, the footage shows he lacks the bad guy and beat his friend, so ... Other whiskeys of high-profile moments should be his ex-girlfriend dropping a grenade on the ground to make his escape - a plan that defies all logic, physics, and absurdity. And finally, if the pops from McBain Thunderblast during intense guerrilla war and starts to run and the obstacles small object, I almost moisten himself. Some of the best works Busey longwave, rent or buy it today «butthorn!» My voice is a perfect 10 (urinate on the meter, that is).
