I loved this movie. It is rare to get an idea of ​​postpartum Vietnam, and the film-Saens combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire- did it. I had no idea I would be so affected by it. What a strange look at how alien Veterinarians feel. It was hard to watch, quite openly. We all understand the type of military action and drama Apocalypse Now, but it's so different. What happens when they come back and try to live? They can not. It made me very aware of the large group of people rattling around lost in America. Not able to connect, can not sleep, can not have a love relationship, can not deal with "normal society". They feel completely apart. This is a great tragedy, and one that is not considered sufficient. Yes, we have changed our attitude to the Vietnam vet, we love it now, but what? It does not seem to have made no difference to them. It's too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticisms.
