Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in the 19th century in India, which, with the help of a boy water (Jaffe) deprive the region from the deadly strangulation cult. The chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most interesting films of all time. Jaffe is exceptional as an outcast water boy who mistreats all, and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. On the motives of the poem by Rudyard Kipling. A must see, who love this type of film.
