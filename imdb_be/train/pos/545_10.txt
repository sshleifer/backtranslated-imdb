For hardly ever live to the original. It certainly proves true in this case. However, if you are a big fan of the original than it is defined to watch. While the camera work is not enough, the character of Brian Krause annoying clicks and the plot, it's much funnier than the first, and that's what I find interesting about this. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this film expecting the same performance as in the first film. Frankly, it's a little bit different. Instead of sitting in his cabin writing screenplays, Stanley excluded in Hollywood are trying to direct the project of his dreams, hut on the lake. This film has a lot of different feelings, but it's still nice to see Stanley back in action. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 6 out of 10.
