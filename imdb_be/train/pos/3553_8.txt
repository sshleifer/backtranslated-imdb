Guys and Dolls is a film itching for a remake. This was done in forty-eight years ago. Its two main stars are either dead, or 409 pounds. Although the remake, with big stars now will be a box office success, it will not be able to capture the magic that went into this version. His boundless energy can not be caught and can not be pure joy you get when looking something like this: a huge, widescreen, large entertaining movie <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (who in the past with a clock speed of 409 pounds. . the last time I heard) plays Sky Masterson, one of the largest players in New York. Frank Sinatra Nathan Detroit, whose as-often as-it-can-find-a-liquor-by-play that shit is famous citywide. However, if in one place he had left to keep charging $ 1,000, Detroit needs the money quickly. He puts $ 1,000 Masterson that he can not take a missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. <br /> <br /> Guys and Dolls is basically nothing more than questionable types of singing and dancing, which usually, as it does here, add to the fun. It is obvious to see how it was a musical Broadway: there were not a lot of sets, and the scenes were long. If I had to complain about one thing, it's like the songs were uneven. From time to time, there were two songs in the scene; at another time, after thirty minutes have passed without the other. Guys and Dolls is never sad, just a great time <br /> <br /> My rating :. 8-10 <br /> <br /> Not Rated.
