This film was scaring me since the first day I saw him. <br /> <br /> My mother watched as he was on the telly back in '92. I remember that I woke up in the middle of the night to her tearful incoherent, my dad helped her up the stairs. <br /> <br /> She said something like, "Do not let it get me," or something like that, I asked what made her so upset, and she told me that she was watching women in black. <br /> <br /> So, obviously, I had to watch, and even though I was only eleven she let me. It scared S *** with me. I was immune to horror movies, so watch this!
