I do not understand. Not being a critic, I can not assess the quality of acting, which I think is true, a good thing. May confusion is content. Did no one else is sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women, justifying their unfaithful men who fought and bleeding, to ensure the continuation of freedom of their families and their country. If the prologue was not informing us when people made it home, and if so, what effect their deception unfaithful "wives" were they? Despite the fact that these women were lovers litter from their loneliness, they thought that their husbands enjoyed shooting while before his death, or separation on a daily basis? They do not think about their husbands at all! Only themselves. Excuse me, except when they wanted their husbands are dead.
