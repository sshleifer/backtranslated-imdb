This begins a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and journalists ... bet that a person can not spend the night in a terrible castle. Well, of course he can, but he will come out unscathed? It is difficult to say with all these strange people who should not be there to wander, including ice Barbara Steele. It is quite strange film that presentation in French and English, and switch back and forth several times. Perhaps this is because the dialogue bits have been lost? It's also quite dark and claustrophobic, that one does not see much beyond the narrow circle of light, candles and such generation, plus there is a sense of fear and hopelessness pretty much at all times. This version (at Synapse) also uncensored, and I thought it might be censorship in the film since 1964, until I saw a topless scene, I think it can be. In general, this is very good, and in a dark black and white. Barbara Steele, of course, makes the film too. 8 of 10.
