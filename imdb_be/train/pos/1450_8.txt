Excellent political thriller, playing a much quieter and slower than other, higher rated films in this genre. When people talk about Pacino Cusack and how they manage to miss the strange career-topping performance? The story of the friendship, the father-son relationship, corruption and fraud. Two actors gel surprisingly well together and support with Aiello and the Fund are equally impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially if the paper run to the press. Instead of focusing on overly complex corruption scandal, it creates interesting characters that show the human side of failure in the political bribery, final scenes with each of the main characters beautifully written and acted.
