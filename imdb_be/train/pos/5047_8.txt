Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this frightening, dark, and well-made thriller about a widowed mechanic (he Paxton), who rigging his two sons participated in the brutal killing of an ax, claiming that the victims are not human beings at all, but "demons" and that they were chosen by God to destroy these "demons". All this is said in the memoirs of one of his sons, now grown (Matthew McConaughey) to the skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe) <br /> <br /> Hard automatically forget this film. better than most serial killer features, this winding and alarming story told in a simple manner with a minimum of cinematic tricks. The Paxton, commendable, just shows no blood at all until near the end. Well acted all, especially the two child actors (Sumpter recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary from "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Hurdle"). The only reason why I have deducted all points at all is, because I understand that some people may find it all hard to digest. In any case, this is not a typical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
