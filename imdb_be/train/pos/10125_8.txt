This film is the first of a triad society Miikes trilogy and trilogy of waste to a great start. Films in the trilogy are connected only thematically, and these threads really obvious in all his films, if you are close enough. Shinjuku Triad Society of cop, trying to prevent his younger brother from getting too involved in a rather extreme gang of outsiders, from the best of his way to the top Tokyos yakuza. baby brother is a lawyer, and triad gangs has become increasingly in need of a friend, as the film progresses. The film takes place in a very harsh environment, and therefore fairly rigid and cruel. Miike made worse, but since it is a serious film, he hits you very hard. As usual, there are also a lot of perverted sex, mainly in the homosexual. The film is in many ways a typical gangster film, but with more drive and true grit. If you only saw Miikes away from the film (Ichi the killer, Fudoh, etc.), you should check out as a kind of compromise between his aggressive on-top display style in these films and more serious side as presented in other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this, that you will never forget (see this and find out which ones for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
