Soylent Green ... really good movie, actually. <br /> <br /> I would never have thought it. I do not like Heston in his efforts to science fiction. He's one of those actors who, like Superman, manages to meet all sneery invincible and most of the time. I prefer a more vulnerable character. And indeed, he mocks his way through a lot of Soylent Green, too, but it has to be self-confident, playing the bully, I do not mind. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people turn their noses up in the film. Soylent Green makes no effort to create futuristic visual effects (what do you know - it looks the same as 1973), and it is not lacking in action. But I admired the vision of the film about the complex, corrupt and highly stratified society, and I was so glad to see that Edward G. Robinson was such a touching, funny final role. Nice little character moments - for example, if he shares some valuable food with Heston. - actually make a movie <br /> <br /> In Soylent Green message is quite relevant today, when no one knows what the hell the government or corporations to. Funny, is not it, to see Heston in Michael Moore's film prototype ...
