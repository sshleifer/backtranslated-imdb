I saw this movie at midnight, at the request of the other night, not knowing what to expect. I heard about this movie, but never any thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> I have to say I was amazed at what I saw. I was really freaked out in some parts, and I definitely remember the bounce in his chair several times. <br /> <br /> The drop was scary to watch. Now I'm looking at a jar of jelly and wondering if it will catch myself on my arm. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews, the film's protagonist. I also liked the old one in the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the 50's horror film, it was very well done, even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
