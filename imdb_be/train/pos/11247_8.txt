The first time I saw the movie when it landed on the US cable a year after he left. It blew my little head to the side, I was only 16, and it was the first new wave of music I heard as a strictly folk, classic baby grows. Music hypnotize me, as did an amazing view of Hazel O'Connor and charismatic vocal performances, and hard, but soft cockney manager Phil Daniels just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce of drugged saxophonist. It was so ridiculous in the group and so harmless and pathetic, he just asked for sympathy. Favorite scene, performance, when the lights went out and a love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Thus, the film is not Rose! But it was really great for its limited budget and its image in Britain in the early 80's years with the explosion of rebellious youth, looking for a way out of the queue for unemployment benefits. I went to the UK just a couple of years and found that the film was very much reflects the atmosphere I found when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see it. This is a great film, with some great performances, and music blow you away. <br /> <br />
