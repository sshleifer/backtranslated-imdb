I first heard about this movie about 20 years ago when I was a kid in elementary school (!) It just so happens that I was flipping through encyclopedias in class one day, and at the entrance to a movie (or movies, I do not remember) were several frames for different films from mainstream to experimental, and one of them was still on the page for OffOn. It really intrigued me, because it differed most on the page (it was still from the film scene with an eye to the other elements, superimposed on it). <br /> <br /> About 18 or so years later, the public library here, where I live was available for inspection only 4-DVD set of "treasures of American Film Archives", published by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I read the notes on the DVD case for the set, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was one of the disks. After all these years, I could finally see the movie! After watching it a little was not I expected it to be (this usually be a more organic kind of film, not that it's bad, but I expected it to have more electronic aesthetics), but still a great film, IMHO taking into account the method of Scott Bartlett, which is used for the manufacture of films, including hand-tinting of the film, and with the help of video equipment for some scenes of the film (shot off monitor), giving it a more destroyed, that res look. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the methods used in this film were quite innovative for 1972. Here's why it's still one of my favorite short / experimental films and creative inspiration for me as well .. .
