There has never been anything like it, that's for sure. This episodic seemingly unnecessary trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole, and as such it is not a film about Groovin 'Gary, Utah cross-dressing sense. This film is very shy about how to respond to the director Groovin 'Harry. Harris for the entire project is undoubtedly the extended and effectively reversing of guilt and remorse. He's trying to atone for his sins - yes, Gary has made a suicide attempt after the original document has been submitted - through the correction, comments and convention reclamation such Hollywood plot standbys as the best friend and the calling of a happy ending (two different, with the index adjustment version Glover) and turning them into their own very personal use. Thus, although thematically is a film about gender differences, the structure ensures that it is also a film about the cinema - but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity. There's just so much going on; to tell and re-tell the story Harris is in the right place at the right time, three times in a row, and he did not miss the opportunity to make something out of it. Immensely moving, and as deep as the camp never received.
