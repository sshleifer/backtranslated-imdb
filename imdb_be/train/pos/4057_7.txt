Like many Americans, I first became acquainted with the works of Hayao Miyazaki, when I saw "Spirited Away." I fell in love with the movies and seen it many times. Now I am on a quest to see all the films of Miyazaki. One of his early works "Castle in the Sky." Although it is still nice, it's not as good as "Spirited Away" (although compared to this or any film with his 2002 masterpiece, perhaps unfairly). <br /> <br /> The little boy by the name of the slot (James Van Der Beek) is working in the mine late at night, when he sees the girl slowly falling from the sky. When she wakes up in the morning, it represents itself as sieves (Anna Paquin). But Sita is a mystery, and before he knows it, the groove is drawn into an adventure that will lead him to the danger of pirates, the army lost and floating city. <br /> <br /> Going into the film Hayao Miyazaki means that you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe as Miyazaki. Watching the film, Miyazaki is going through a fantastic dream since childhood. <br /> <br /> As the animated film, dubbing the films do not pose much of a problem, because it is almost impossible to determine whether or not the movement of the lips match the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well written and voiced by talented actors. Postproduction diverse. James Van Der Beek best rates. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of the slots, which is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is almost as good as Sita. It scared the events taking place around her, but she knows what she must do. Mark Hamill unrecognizable as the evil Muska. It is dangerous and wants something from Sita, and will do anything to get it. The remaining votes bad. Lichmno bad as Dol. Leachman, may have won the Oscar for «The Last Picture Show», but it is annoying as the pirate leader. Leachman gives character to reverse piercing scream that it is almost always monotonous. It's so bad that almost kills the movie! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he is miscast in general. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend seeing "Castle in the Sky." I'll probably end up buying himself. But even if it's not as good as "Gone", it's still pretty good.
