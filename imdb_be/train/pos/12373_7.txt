Time has not been kind to this film. After the controversial adaptation of the bestseller by Jeffrey Konvtsa "Now the film looks like a simple version of your typical basic spookfest. Terrible strokes in the side (in particular, that crazy, over the top of the final), it is essentially a glossy horror film for those people who do not care much for this genre. She has an unusual cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted a road throws to convince the audience that this is not your average cattle cinema (the manufacturer '70s disaster movies had a similar idea). I kind of wanted to see a familiar face, but the story is very silly, and no matter how high-end the film pretends it does not work at the level of your average 70s exploitation film (not entirely bad, though). Nevertheless, it's a nice film, especially for those viewers who enjoy the meteor shower. As usual, the matte work Alberta Whitlock is outstanding. In general, quite interesting.
