Some of those guys are watching movies and complain to them during their lifetime to forget something: DVD menu system. I'm telling you man, I watched the repetition of the main screen in this about 35 times. It was awesome. Cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me where it was, it was in the beginning. Many times the amount and BAM! I was hooked. Again and again and again. And more. <br /> <br /> "Doot Doot de, de do de-dodedo." And this is only the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I set out to side on the bed, curled up with my Vaio. Rain in the flat roof and the soft evening again soft. The cat is comfortable and my ankle, which crosses I already rested. I jumped per DVD. I was fascinated. All night. "Doot Doot de, de do de-dodedo". <br /> <br /> Blob. Look. Steve Queen, two police officers and a girl in a dress. Two thumbs way up!
