My favorite series of police is constantly transformed into a TV movie. Does it work? Yes. Gee works for the mayor and gets shot. Slaughter "Hall of Fame" turns up. Pembleton and almost all of the police officers who have ever played in this series. Many memories, helps you who has not seen the series, but he entertains the fans too. The last five minutes decides to another murder, and in the end even the two dead policemen turn up. And a short view of my favorite coroner Julian Cox. It's a good movie.
