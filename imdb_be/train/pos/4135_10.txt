It is absolutely charming film, one of my favorite romantic comedies. This is a very humorous and perfectly cast. Although Laurence Olivier is mainly due to his Shakespearean work he shows in this film is that it is in no way limited to playing only classical theater. It manages the transition from a cynical divorce lawyer who is trying to prevent women and their treacherous way to puppy love, which falls on Lady X Merle Oberon plays effortlessly. Dialogue countries witty and refreshing and magical atmosphere. Ralph Richardson was a delight to watch as well. I highly recommend it.
