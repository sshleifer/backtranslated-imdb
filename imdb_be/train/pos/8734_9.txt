The film was totally awesome and cool. The graphics were excellent, and it was strange, especially, Flick was a wonderful and strange in the film, and he was funny and he was, and sometimes he was clever. Circus bugs colorful and they are great in the film. Horses were wonderful, and cool in the movie. Hopper was clean and perfect villain. Even, Dot was cute. If a bird comes there is a mistake that the scene was excellent and well. Even the last scene was amazing and cool. Even invention FLIK was good. Construction of an artificial bird was a good idea to scare the horses. If ants are building an artificial bird that scene was good and well I really appreciate the creator of "A Bug's Life."
