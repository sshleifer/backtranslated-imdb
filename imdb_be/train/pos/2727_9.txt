One of the best true crime films ever, and very faithful to the book Truman Capote, who invented a new genre of true crime. Ghosts Quincy Jones music and excellent acting, Scott Wilson and Robert Blake, Dick and Perry, the killer. Why Wilson did not go to a big star after this film is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> In the black-and-white film and edit the film at the highest level. Restoration of murders and frightening, because it leaves a real murder in your mind, even worse than if they showed a shotgun going off. The film was shot at the actual Clutter house that was sold to another person after the killing. The film has a very documentary feeling --- but the scene in the actual Clutter house and other scenes were shot at gas stations and convenience stores killer actually went. favorite horse Nancy Clutter in Babe, even in the movies. Will Geer has a large turnover as a prosecutor in a short trial stage, not only filmed in the courtroom, but has several jurors killing a real mess painting itself as the jury for the film. <br /> <br /> This is a solid film, scared every time you see it.
