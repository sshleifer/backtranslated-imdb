"Happenstance» is the New York-Paris feeling of a movie that I have seen, because "If Cat's Away (Chacun Cherche Son Chat)." <br /> <br /> The film is released in the past year, now benefit from the attention becomes Tautou to "Amelie", his French title more apt: «Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon (the beating wings of a butterfly)" as in the synthesis of chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives. <br /> naughty-ness <br /> Tatou is less annoying here, because it is only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile among his unlucky adventures, and because it is part of a large, multi-national ensemble, is so great it took me a long time to understand the characters, especially in some nice guys and older women were like me, and some of the characters dream, that they should make sure that I was not sure if they do it, or no. <br /> <br /> But I loved how the city matches were immigrants like nests in crowded subway cars to hang around the cafe. <br /> <br /> subtitles rather annoying given the two parts of the dialogue am once. <br /> <br /> (originally written 2001/08/12)
