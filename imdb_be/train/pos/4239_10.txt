My observations: Postwar fun. Meanwhile Drake and grandfather with Â«Meet Me in St. Louis" after two years (the year of my birth). Donna Reed charming and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton well, as always; smaller part than the "Wizard of Oz". Bayinton the way prettier, and the premise of perky little nose missing Hamilton. The tent scene at the end with the former boy next door was fun. As a veteran of the army tent in two years, he looked quite young and inexperienced, when I looked into his eyes. <br /> <br /> I worked in a department store, and it was as elegant as this. Unfortunately, he disappeared, and disappeared into obscurity. We are famous for those large windows, which were used to lure passers-by in the store to get them to buy anything other than a commodity. <br /> <br /> 10/10
