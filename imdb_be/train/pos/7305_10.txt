In 1978, the phenomenon began. Release of John Carpenter's "Halloween" there are people organizing around the block, to witness the evil that Michael Meyers. Critics loved it, the world loved him, he imitated, and went down as one of the greatest films in cinema history <br /> <br /> plot :. 15 years after the murder, four friends (all women) are babysitting services (and with it with their friends) on Halloween night. After escaping from the hospital at night, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to pursue these people. He kills 3 of them in silence and subtlety. He does not say. He walks slowly. He hides .... <br /> <br /> Only one friend escapes after saving Dr. Loomis (pursuer Michael and doctors) <br /> <br /> There is a reason why Halloween works so well, simplicity. We do not know where Michael, we do not know why he was killed, and it scares us. They are the only reason why we are afraid. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter wrote the film, and director. It builds unbearable tension throughout history, and scares to the point that sometimes we can not see. And the climax is really strange. <br /> <br /> As a horror, this is very important. It's scary and well acted. In addition, the puzzling. Michael is a strength, not a man. A force that can not be denied. <br /> <br /> sequels focused too much around Michael and his "history". This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Perhaps that is why this thing is a masterpiece.
