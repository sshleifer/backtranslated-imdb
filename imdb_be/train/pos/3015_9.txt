Why is not this type of compact, entertaining mystery shot in the new century? He keeps the viewer guessing and thinking all the way. Throw a great ensemble. William Powell demonstrates the true star quality. Who knows - maybe he rehearsed his future as Nick Charles. He is a joy to watch. You can also understand why Eugene Pallette made more than 200 films. He's a wonderful actor and his character a great chemistry with Powell's fun to watch. Mary Astor doing above average work is not very meaty role. All hands to chip in to make it a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect that Michael Curtis had a ball, directing his friend. Bravo!
