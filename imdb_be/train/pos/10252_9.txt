After watching «Guinea Pig», two questions come to mind (except "I really see what a psychopath?"): "Is this a snuff? The answer is no; although it is closest to the snuff film I've ever seen. And then: "Where the hell are they found that girl?". Because she gets tortured for 45 minutes, without any reason (in fact, there is nothing in this film!): Nails ladder away, beat the hands, feet, tools, infected larvae ... and much more to the final scene (I still do not know how they did it). Because he belongs to the «japonese underground", it is obvious that it has not received a lot of money. So it was (their) motivation? <br /> <br /> I've seen him in japonese without subtitles, but it's not a problem (not a real dialogue, the boys not only insulted her in several scenes). I have not yet seen the entire series, but the first «Guinea Pig» is not known as the best. However, I rated 8 because, if the goal was to make people believe it is snuff, this question is quite good (ask Charlie Sheen, actor). But I think they could go on what they were doing in the next. <br /> <br /> Another film I'm hiding from their parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
