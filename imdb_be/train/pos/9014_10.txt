Shamefully, before I saw the film, I was familiar with Helen Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research to assure yourself that it was not really suffering, as well as its character, with a (good?) that she was suffering. I was absolutely delighted by this lovely lady. She pulled it out smoothly. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that sexually obvious circumstances, including the course you want, and need, unique girls, could be interpreted as a tender and romantic? Well, they may be, if the right artist to present them in a proper way, as they did in this wonderful film. I forgot to mention how fast the beautiful Miss Carter watched this movie. I have often said that she was the most beautiful creature that ever graced the face of our earth, but it seemed to be made of themselves in this particular film. <br /> <br /> I hope that any of you who watch this movie to enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion.
