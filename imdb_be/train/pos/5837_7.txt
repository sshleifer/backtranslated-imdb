With Oliver Hardy intricate sound the horn, bells, telephones and trombone, his doctor advises Finlayson peace and rest and a diet of goat's milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes with a big decision, who lives on a boat dock so that the salt sea air can help Olli everything else he needed. This is an excellent prerequisite for all the crazy pranks ensue when the boat is on the continuation of hungry goats, and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) invests along for the ride. <br /> <br /> I got a kick out of all the gags in the film, starting with this sign in the corner of the test plant - 'Silence While the men work. The early history of the boys in the apartment has a number of mixed plumbing and household equipment failures, with Stan does a banana in a banana a bit. Laurus has some great lines in the film, as "We had to dis-unbound", but one that had me rolling his reaction to the offender on board - "self last law of averages" - exactly! <br /> <br /> I'm not as great a student Laurel and Hardy films, like many in this forum, all that I know, I enjoyed them as a child, and find them to be as entertaining today, as they were back in my youth. On this account, Â«Saps at Sea" provides a decent hour hornophobic fun, well on his way to hornomania.
