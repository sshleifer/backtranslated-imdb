Brilliant! My wife and I joined a sprawling line to see the hall at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the film, I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a touching story about the impossibility of communication between two people. She is a young girl, it is worn Westerner. The film captures all the bones in our body. There are no graphic scenes or something, it's hard to watch - his surreal normality that really pushes you in the gut. The film is beautifully shot. Among other things, we loved the scene where Patrick Holly teaches to ride a small motorcycle. dampness Thuy Ngoyen (in school believe that this is her first acting job) and the performance of Ron Livingston's stayed with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
