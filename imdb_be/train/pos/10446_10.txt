I watched this movie 10 years ago. and I watched the video on average once a year since then. This type of film, it is out of time, because the topics are universal, but the stories and conversations so personal. it is also one of the few films that grab you from one frame Sesame credits roll, despite the fact that there are, in fact, only two (very participation) characters. This owes much to the contact action by Hawke and Delpy, which lead us to believe that they actually Jesse and Celine. it is also the first film I saw that the said reality show, and now the phenomenon is booming! I love how this movie simply envelops the audience in its space, and makes you think, however exhausted it may be that you are one of these characters. it also made me want to travel by train in Europe! I have not met anyone who was not able to relate to this film. it is possible that talks about himself, his friends, or just pure genius of this film.
