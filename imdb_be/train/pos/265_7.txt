A series of random, seemingly minor theft in the boarding house of her sister Miss Lemon has pretty excited. Ring, light bulbs, a backpack, a lighter, stethoscope, shoes ?? there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it. Miss Lemon asked his employer, a large Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, to look into the matter. But Poirot to see something far more sinister than Miss Lemon could have imagined. And Poirot fears are confirmed when one of the students living in a boarding house, if found murdered. It's up to Poirot to bring the killer to justice. <br /> <br /> Hickory Dickory Dock is a solid, but not spectacular, the entrance to the Poirot series of long running. I appreciate how faithful the script for the original story by Agatha Christie. I understand that some liberties have been taken, but I appreciate the effort, however. The main points of the secrets of all there ?? petty theft, a boarding house, students copied the backpack, and, of course, the ability to Poirot to see something sinister is happening before it actually happens. With some exceptions, students cast almost as I imagined them. Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd prominent among the group. The mush as I always enjoy Poirot David Suchet, I get a real kick out of episodes to Phillip Jackson Inspector Zheppa and Pauline Moran Miss Lemon. This episode is a real treat as Miss Lemon gets more screen time than usual. Finally, I enjoyed using the ubiquitous mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel. This is a fun game on the name of Hickory Dickory Dock. <br /> <br /> I realized while watching re Hickory Dickory Dock only that work great influence Agatha Christie was a stylized Italian mystic films or gialli, with 60s and 70s. Take Mrs. Nicoletis murder as an example. If you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene, you have something right out in the early '70s Giallo. In fact, the entire site Hickory Dickory Dock can be used in Giallo. It just rolled and worked quite interesting.
