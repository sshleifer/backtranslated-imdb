Most Hillarious Brooks and funny movie that I've ever seen. I can watch and re-watching a tape 100 times. I'm laughing my a ** off, and I was crying at some points. This is a really good and funny movie, and if you like Brooks - is a must! In short - Brooks (billionare) hit the streets as homeless within 30 days in order to win the whole poor area of ​​his rival. Reality Bites, but in the end - it's about the warm relationship between the people ... I recommend them highly!
