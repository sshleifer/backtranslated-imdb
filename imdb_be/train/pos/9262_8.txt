Offside is the story of teenage girls who are trying to get to the stadium to watch the final World Cup qualifying soccer match in Tehran, Iran, which can lead to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Females are forbidden to go to the stadium for the law in Iran, although many of them dress like boys and enter the stadium guards search every entrance to make sure that no one is fireworks and, of course. no girl gets. <br /> <br /> As with most of the work Panahi, his performance was excellent anchor CAST. You actually think you're watching a documentary. Dialogues between the girls and the rank and file were made subtly and surprisingly believable. The film reflects the interaction between prisoners and trained guards, who themselves serve mandartory from his family and friends in a funny sort of way. In the end, the audience understands that there is no such difference between the girls and the guards, who were just following orders.
