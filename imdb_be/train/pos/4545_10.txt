I saw this movie recently. After 2 hours, my head still hurts from laughing. The plot was soo horrible jokes were soo bad, but what I did not expect to have: <br /> <br /> 1. 2 scenes before and after the film, which was Pat and Jay creates (that caused more than enough laughs) <br /> <br /> 2. Blow through the windshield that beheaded villain. <br /> <br /> This film is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy, even came to the site of the Law is, if you do not like the film, send a certificate for HBO. While I thought the date you were supposed to send it in January 1991 was (which also caused wackiness come).
