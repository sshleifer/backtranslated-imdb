When I first saw the show, I thought it looked interesting. I watched it, saw how it revolves around Sara, as a character sees the world revolves around her .... I got it, but not laugh very much. <br /> <br /> Onstage and in her show, she is a racist, crude, insensitive and very self-centered. I did not get it at first, and took it all at face value. Then I see her film, Jesus is Magic. I think it served as Sarah Silverman primer for me, explain to me just what "language", she says. It's like Marilyn Manson, as well, to give us a faceful horrible ideas and images, but eventually realized that it was not an attack, it is a statement. And once you understand that you are glad to find someone finally give it to you straight. <br /> <br /> I do not mean just the smart people understand it or hate it show to prove your idiocy. While I like a lot of "smart" show, I still do and do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm today. I have the impression that it was good, but I just do not understand. Many people will never get Sarah Silverman Program, but I'm glad that I finally came to his senses. <br /> <br /> The creator of this work show, each episode is loaded not only with dialogue and plot, but from a song, or a dream sequence, the production figures. These people are not putting together something to fill the time slot and please advertisers, they seem to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. If I had to predict the future of the show, I would say that it will follow the path of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled before the time and to live in the hearts of fans and on DVD. But be of good cheer, the SSP creators, your audience is there, and we will look for as long as they allow you to do the show.
