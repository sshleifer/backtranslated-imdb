I looked at the film today, and it just blew my mind away. This is a true masterpiece, and I do not understand why most people think that it's garbage. The main idea of ​​the film - to take away your ego, then you will have the true power! It was a major battle in the end of the film and Guy Ritchie has shown that in a wonderful way. "The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will always look '- you remember that it's from the movie? Because our true enemy is within us - that is our ego ... This is the voice that always tells us that we are important, which gives us our honor, which tells us not to give, but only to accept that creates our aggression that wants to control that makes all the negative thoughts and feelings. GR expressed this idea in a strange way, and showed that the only way to get a true control when you lose control and you just let go of your personal worth. Great movie!
