Matthau and Lemmon are at their best in this one - everyone else in the movie is also great. The dialogue is excellent and very, very clever - and the scene where Lemmon character in an attempt to clear his sinuses in a restaurant I rolled on the floor laughing every time I see it. Anyone who saw the accident is not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie for all - I just love it. And the fact, Jack Lemmon plays his character as straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion. These two big guys did a string of films together, but it is one of the best - no doubt.
