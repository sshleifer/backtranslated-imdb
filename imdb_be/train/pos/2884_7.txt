Of all the Disney Princess stories set there, Cinderella, probably has the most stable attraction. I can not say why, but for some reason, generation after generation puts it at the top of their lists. As a little girl, I wanted nothing more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper- it was my favorite costume. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I do not think there is any story that sells more than the lust of the human heart than Cinderella. Who never wanted to get away from the everyday life of suffering and find someone who sees no one else has ever been? History older than the English, and somehow it still rings true. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, if nothing else, Disney can make a great villain. Lady Tremaine the evil at the T in the amazing computing, open not physically able. Her cutting tongue and eyes do the work for her- she does not need the headquarters of lighting to strike fear in your heart. Animal Friends, as a rule, rubbing, particularly idiotic Gus. I would welcome if he met his fate in the jaws of Lucifer. she was not Cinderella pushover- make some fairly CATTY remarks at times. Nevertheless, she simply did not have the drive to make it completely sympathetic. Of course, it was nice and fed animals, but what keeps it at this point? We will never know. Even if it only became a servant in the house of a friend, at least she will get the money and have a shot against. It seems the only reason, it works in the end for Cindy, that all seemed to fall into place in her lap. It never works for her dreams, she sings so softly. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the music as good as ever. Forest Eileen has a beautiful, rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Some great standards of any here- Sleep is the desire of your heart makes, so is love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella story with a different heart tonne musical moments. While it lacks some character development, it provides some classic villains and excellent voice work. If you feel sick heart, pop it In- it will warm you and make you hum Mmm Mmm Good <br /> <br /> A quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> -Surprise! Surprise! -Duh Spirit duh- Happy Birthday!
