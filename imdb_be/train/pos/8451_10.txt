As I got into it: When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I have to say that I have never seen anything like it, and it was the best. But when I began to collect a series on VHS, and a few years later on a DVD collection of the Bandai Anime Legends. It was weird, and really worth watching. It was a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of their place. And, of course, the theme song Â«Just Communication", and Rhythm Emotion "were the best <br /> <br /> The characters and Gundams .: What are your favorite characters in the show were: Hiro, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin and Zechs. My favorite Gundams in the show that I liked the most, Wing Zero and Epyon, and, of course, Altron and Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> The value to show: that this series also tells us that in real life, the war is very difficult, and sometimes we can win or lose, but the world can also be difficult to get, and I believe Gundam pilots that are doing the right thing, and. I am trying to get the peace of the world. <br /> <br /> But, nevertheless, this show is really the best of the best. Thus, at the conclusion of that review, after you watch this show, watch a movie Endless Waltz.
