The final yield of William Powell, Phil Vance takes place in a nursery murder case, where the murder of the championship show dogs leads to a more than two murders and one attempt of the human race. It's all in figuring out how this leads to who and why. <br /> <br /> Kill Philo Vance by SS Van Dine was the most popular at the time, and a clever Mr. Van Dyne found a way to sell his books one at the highest price the studio. That's why you see so many Philo and thus achieve many studios are putting them. If Bill Powell went on to greater fame of MGM, Nick Charles Series Thin Man, he would be known as the greatest achievements are Philo. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Powell came into his captain's little terrier in the same competition, which killed the dog came in, followed by another competitor of the owner became the first murder victim. As usual Powell shows up Eugene Palette Sergeant Heath, whose greatest contribution to make use of its carcass to break down the locked door from the inside, where the first murder victim was found. <br /> <br /> I said, shut up inside and it was the top floor, so it was to find out how. Powell has an excellent group of suspects, as well as wide, that is usually found in thin-Men secret. People like Paul Coffee, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mary Astor, the cast fill their roles well. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers liked this version so much that they actually altered it again to the thirtieth to James Stevenson in his one and only output as Philo Vance. He does not hold a candle to this. <br /> <br /> As the only Philo Vance Powell, who on VHS or DVD by all means see it or buy it if you can.
