Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (one thousand nine hundred ninety-one) was the last film to show Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as a subject or roles). murder years hit Springwood city. It got to the point that the small town became a virtual ghost town. Parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago, all paid a high price. Only a madman inhabit the city and the survivors scattered everywhere. But that does not stop Freddy of searching his final revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. But this time, he learns a little more about his former life. Children can finally stop Freddy forever? What is this secret that is buried in the twisted mind of Freddy? to see what you have to watch Dead Freddie. end was originally filmed in 3-D. <br /> <br /> fitting way to end a franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his distorted life, and he gets to go out in a bang! Lisa Zane, Japhet Cotto and Freddy Krueger star in this last batch. Ryazanov, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. Much better than the previous one, but it is filled with a few dated jokes. If you like the series, you will not want to miss it. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this film for fans of Freddy.
