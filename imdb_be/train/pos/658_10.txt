This is not an easy film to watch - it is more than three and a half hours long and consists solely of conversations. Nevertheless, it is so incredibly convincing and ruthless observation of human nature, which, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, see Rivett fantastic Celine and Julie Go Boating, which was made around the same time). This shows that idealism in the late 1960s, there was nothing from society that he is trying to change. <br /> <br /> It includes supposedly released Menage-a-trois between Alexander (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) Dreams (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronica (Francoise Lebrun). Nevertheless, Alexander was shown that as chauvinistic and jealous, like any other person. Women are as a service willingly and determining their femininity through the male gaze. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely icy end to a very revolutionary French New Wave. This movement has been one of the most significant movements in the history of cinema and had a profound influence on the cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leo was one of the key players of the new wave, starring (including other movies) in the influential Cent Coups Les Quatres (1959) Francois Truffaut, like a naughty teenager. Director Eustache not as well known as the other directors of the New Wave, but it should be. <br /> <br /> There's no improvisation (in John Cassavetes made in the US Unlike similar films) and the dialog comes from the real conversations. The film resonates with personal experience in Eustace. For example, Françoise Lebrun was a former lover Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981, but in real life people that the character of Mary was founded on, too. Anger and bitterness all crowned Veronika harrowing monologue delivered directly to the audience, breaking the cold objective character of the rest of the film. It is fascinating, personal film and honest statement remains one of the most representative films about human nature.
