My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (Ret. Major US Marine Corps), was at Guadalcanal and the Japanese lost a leg, and also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical consultant of the film, and I hope that he influenced the film to make it look like it really was when I read the various comments written by the film audience, it seemed like in real life. My father is a fanatic of facts and figures, and always wanted to see how they were, so I would like to believe that it has something to do with it. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, married my mother for over 40 years (ironically, it is in Japanese), and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest accolades from the Emperor of Japan for its contribution to return operations, and kendo and Iaido in Japan with MacArthur banned them after the second World war. <br /> <br /> My father once was the sea, but I know that once you have the sea, you always sea. And that's exactly what it is, and I love and respect him very much. <br /> <br /> I would like to be able to watch this movie, if someone would have a copy. And I would like to give my father for his 94th birthday this year!
