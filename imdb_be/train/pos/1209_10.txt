In an era of such horrible caricatures, I am rather shocked to see the film with such high morals make it to the bottom IMDB list for animated films. <br /> <br /> This film really contradicts the first. I will not deny. However, when I was in the target age group for this film, I did not even notice, and it will not matter if I did. The people who did it could have used "New Generation", to be noted that this is another way, leaving the Bear family could start. Perhaps, we are called upon to decide for themselves how to truly began Bear family care. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite film at the age of 3-6, and it did not scare me or confuse me. <, Br /> <br />
