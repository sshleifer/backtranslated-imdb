A good film with strong performances (especially the two leads). The film is about two American girls who are caught with heroin 6 pounds at the airport in Thailand. They were both thrown into prison, and one of them signed a confession. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer who is trying to get them. All you need to do is find Nick Parks, who put drugs in the bag of one of the two girls. So far in history, which is not what the original (it has many similarities with the best Return to Paradise). <br /> <br /> The current and beautiful picture of Newton Thomas Sigel makes this film worth watching. 7 10.
