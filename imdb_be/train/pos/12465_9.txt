I would definitely recommend to read the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very exciting reading (pun not intended). It's not too difficult to read for those out there that do not read often, so do not be afraid! The book seems to capture the passion of the relationship more than a movie, and the film will make more sense after reading the book. Growing up in Melbourne, I could really relate to this book and the film. Very few Australian women writers were around in the 70s, so very little documented about the way of life of women in urban city in Australia during this period or class. It is a valuable piece of the history of Melbourne. It's a shame that the documents as a kind of 80-soft porn. This is far from that, and in another reviewer mentioned, please do not read the DVD jacket, it is not that movie about at all. Those who rent a movie based on this disclosure will only disappointment. Just remember that this film was made in 1982, so do not expect Hollywood dramatization of what they seem to include these days. That's what I like it. He also sees very Noni Hazlehurst in this role, it is just fantastic, like Nora, and it's great to see how it actually works, because if you're close to my age, you better remember her falling on the garden and Better Homes and Gardens . Who knew that it concealed this talent? This film will give you an entirely new impression of her. Classic Australian history!
