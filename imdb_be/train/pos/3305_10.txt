Without a doubt, this movie has to be one of the biggest ........ in cinematic history. I watched it too many times to remember, and every time I see the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where to start one? <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari Central Bank performance is undoubtedly one of the best in his career, he followed closely by Sahib Bibi Ghulam AUR and Phool Aur Patthar. Every movement and nuances of her performance, make any other Bollywood heroine pale in significance. Her masterly interpretation of Kathak combined with her grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery Urdhu, like nothing ever seen on screen Bollywood <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition. photography, gorgeous cinematography and staging, so full of symbolism and meaning that the audience is holding their breath. <br /> <br /> Naushads music is unmatched, his knowledge of music courtesan Gharanas incredible, and the way in which he emphasizes the story with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic tunes really great. <br /> <br /> My only advice for those who seriously loves the spectacle of general movie must watch this epic mediation on life and art.
