Hidden Frontier is notable for being the longest running internet-based fan series Star Trek. While product quality is not on par with fan productions, such as Starship Exeter, or New Voyage, Hidden Frontier is focused mainly on history, and in this respect he is doing very well. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier has no physical sets; instead of the actors filmed against chromakeying and backgrounds inserted digitally. One of the greatest achievements of Hidden Frontier is a great amount of work they receive. One of the ways this is achieved by inserting a virtual set during filming and not in post-production. Although it really saves a lot of time, it is also worth noting that the quality of the video is not as high as if it was made in the post-production, although it continues to serve its purpose. <br /> <br /> While it may not be everybody's cup of tea, Hidden Frontier's worth a shot, though you might be better to start watching the third season, as this is where the manufacturers are really starting to hit their stride.
