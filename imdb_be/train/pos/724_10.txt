The film is just plain fun .... maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of «The Ramones» at the time the film was made. I watched the movie over and over again, he and friends, and it is still fresh and funny. Risking too seriously, the concept of being a big fan of a certain group is infinite, and high school students with the monotonous melancholy some classes as out of time. <br /> <br /> And, in the film there are some valuable line / scene ..... links as our "permanent record" in high school will follow us through life. (Let me assure you, I was out of high school, uhhh, a few years, and it's not for me) ..... famous "static" line ( "I'm getting some static" ..... "Not so much, how you are going to get, "as approaches principal Togar) ..... a member of the school board, which is so old that he attended nurses .... Nazi hall Monitors love for" inspection "...... main Togar about ' It is: "I give you the final decision", and burning Ramones records (Note: the recording was that it was up to the CD-ROM) .... and, of course, Joey Ramone noting that "Speech sure zmyanil camping since we have thrown out of high school, "and then Togar asking" do you know the parents of the Ramones? "<br /> <br /> Only one piece of advice ..... do not look for, where the stars are now ..... Joey Ramone, unfortunately, died young. Express Yourself Young, who is one of the major beauty in film, today reminds us that we are all ages .... PJ Soles career never progressed as we would have expected ......... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the other students, apparently with 'appeared only in this film (one of my male friends die on it every time we watch a movie), but I imagine her performance was more than enough, and had to bring it more teenage roles in movies. and anyone ve It gives what happened with DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So, watch and enjoy ..... I do not think .... just have fun!
