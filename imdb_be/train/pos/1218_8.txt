This cartoon was strange, but the story was actually a little more depth and emotion to it than other animated film. We have a girl in the camp with low self-esteem and hardly any other members besides his brother and sisters, who are just miserable as she is. She reached the final low point, and when the opportunity arises, it literally makes a pact with the devil, as a demon. I found this film very realistic and just when things could not get any worse, she saw what she had done, she feels remorse and then change, and then it makes it a dark, mystical creature to know the human qualities of love. Improve the Twins also helping the little bear, and then they get a sense of self-esteem too. Very positive message for children, although some elements of the film was weird, it was and still is a pretty good movie. Music by Stephen Bishop (Tootsie lyrics) made the film even better
