I am stunned by the negative comments that I read, and I can only assume that the people who make such comments were less than honest. The most tender and real image of Joseph Smith, that I have ever seen. It is well acted to the point that sometimes I forget that I was watching a movie. He brought Joseph's life of hardship, good-natured optimism, bringing faith in people and God, and the ultimate sacrifice of life in a way that is open left me speechless and silent in fear. If anyone, in any of the Christian religion can watch this movie, do not touch any positive way - I would say that this is a reflection of the person and not a movie. I give the movie "10" and to encourage the honest souls to view it. At least, this is an extremely heart was a picture of a man who gave everything he had for what he believed ... In a world where the values ​​and beliefs ridiculed, this film stands as a reminder of the eternal kind of people we need to be-no matter of any religious belief we hold.- Anne Pruitt-
