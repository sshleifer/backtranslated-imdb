Now, this show looks like most of the other shows of its type since the mid 90s, but the only thing about it is that they are different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this, and perhaps a bit of drama, too. I personally thought it was a good show, I can not understand why they cancel it. The good thing is that the supporters of the show is still alive ever since 1997 until now. <br /> <br /> My hopes that the Security Council return the show, or even make a movie that I know is going to make it is impossible, but hey, it does not hurt to dream, is not it? <br /> <br /> In any case, I would recommend, if you do not see him, to find a DVD of all 13 episodes, because the characters are great, the storylines are good, good comedy and good all shows just fine.
