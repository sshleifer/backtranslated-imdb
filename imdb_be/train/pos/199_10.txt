I have seen hundreds of silent films. Some will always be classics (such as Nosferatu, Metropolis General and wings), but among them, my favorite this film (it may not be the best - but the favorite, right). In fact, when I saw it on the IMDb, I noticed that I immediately laughed to himself, because the movie was so gosh-darn cute and well-made. Marion Davies proved in this film it really was a great talent and was not just a Hearst's mistress. <br /> <br /> The story involves the Loch from Georgia coming to Hollywood with every expectation that it would be an instant star! Her experience and interesting cameos stars eras make it a real treat for film lovers must see!
