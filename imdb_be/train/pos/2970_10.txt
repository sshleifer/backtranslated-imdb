I thought that BASEketball was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! This witty humor made me giggle all the way through, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so over the top, increases the comedy film. <br /> <br /> I just bought BASEketball on DVD and only one of those movies where you never get tired of watching. I have a very short attention span, and I think that this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout. Humorous quotes are stored, and can make me laugh for a few hours, if I can remember them later .. <br /> <br /> So all in all, I believe that BASEketball brilliant film that everyone should go see, especially if you young like me, as it will keep you laughing for a long time after that. <br /> <br /> P.s anyone think it is amazing for me to love them both? hehe
