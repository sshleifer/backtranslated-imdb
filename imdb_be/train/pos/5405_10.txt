My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We watched it a couple of times and it was the best. Too bad New Pokemon did not speak this time. I get used to it. <br /> <br /> Iron Mask Marauder was quite Mean When He captured his dark Cheleti ball. Good thing Sam Ash turned Snap it with management. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the final Loan Called Cele-BRATE performed Russell Velasquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever became successful with the three previous films, and people will always love this movie.
