Gene Kelly came up with some really great ideas for musicals while with MGM. Here he is at the top of his creative powers, working with the musical Arthur Freed unit. Hard to believe when you look at American in Paris that the players never left the back of the MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of An American in Paris due to creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and kits that MGM is designed mixed with some background snapshot. The idea of ​​the film came from Kelly, who just wanted to make a film with a long sequence of ballet with George Gershwin's symphonic poem Americans in Paris. It sounded good Arthur Fried, who came Il Gershwin, who said, okay with it as long as they used other materials Gershwin. <br /> <br /> Gershwin was the kind of deal for the music of Gershwin, Irving Berlin usually has. Not one note nya-Gershwin's music sounds in An American in Paris. Listen to some background music, and you'll hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me, which are not true musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Another guy who was just in the writing of the texts, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story, which admittedly is a thin one. An ex-GI played Gene Kelly, who, after the Second World War never left France, simply settled in the apartment on the left bank, and began to be a starving artist. He lives with an eccentric composer Oscar Levant and makes something sound like redundancy. <br /> <br /> The two women are interested in it. Another American immigrant plays Nina Foch, who wants to sponsor him as an artist, if he would reciprocate in other matters. But Kelly falls in love with a shop girl plays Leslie Caron in her debut film. Caron is also a musical comedy star Georges Getari interested in here. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin. An American in Paris happens the first film I ever saw during the flight of the film on the first plane trip I've ever taken. I still remember the arrival of the Phoenix, Arizona at Kennedy Airport to see Gene Kelly doing I Got Rhythm. My favorite number in the film, however, Tra-La-La, which Kelly sings and dances throughout the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano. Once Kelly dancing on top of a grand piano. <br /> <br /> In the book of Arthur Freed, I read a quote where he said the American in Paris ballet sequence had to be done with the background of the French Impressionists, which he felt would be public, instead of real conditions on the streets or in the back lot. So it happened that way. Kelly made a long ballet sequence in words and music, pirate, and in the city. But this one topped them all. Nevertheless, it does in my opinion, and that includes some of the more recent films Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> In a surprise upset at the Oscars, the best shot of an American in Paris was selected for the 1951 beating heavily favored A Streetcar Named Desire. I believe that fantasy has trumped realism in this year. Big budgets also has the upper hand in these things. <br /> <br /> Another American in Paris is one of the best musical films ever made, and because the studio is not all that creative talent under one roof, that is less likely to be repeated.
