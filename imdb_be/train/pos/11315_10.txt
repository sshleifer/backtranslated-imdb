Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries. Italian great directors 40s and 50s there were people who understood the environment, but it was Luchino Visconti, a man of vision, who dared to bring the film would show that he was capable. He clearly shows his genius at the beginning of his distinguished career with "Ossessione" in the film, based on James Cain "The Postman Always Ring Twice", which was later made by Hollywood, but this version pales in comparison to that made Visconti a film by Luchino Visconti and his staff on the screen credits include Alberto Moravia, a man who knew about the impact on human passions. <br /> <br /> The film has been well preserved in the DVD format we have seen in recent times. The film is a must for all serious film fans, because we can see how the Visconti vision translated text in a movie that is ringing true in an acceptable form, something that was not in the US version. <br /> <br /> What comes watching a movie, the intensity of which was directed by his key players. Gorgeous Clara Calamai does a terrific job as Giovanna, a woman, who is married to an older man, but when Gina appears in her life, all she wants to do is to rid yourself of a good man who gave her a chance in life. Giovanna is one of the best creations in the achievements of Ms. Calamai in Italian cinema. The last sequence of the film shows Ms. Calamai at its best in irony, which serves as the moral redemption of the terrible crimes that were committed. <br /> <br /> No less majestic Zhirotti, one of the best actors of his generation, which looks like a genie in hunky man who awakens obsessive passion in Giovanna. Gina is the perfect man for Giovanna, something that the projects Mr. Girotti with such ease and grace are not equal in front of the screen. Mr. Girotti make people come to life in a performance that seems so simple, but with another actor, he might not have been so obvious. Juan DeLanda regarded as Giuseppe, an elderly man who fell in love with Giovanna. In fact, his character rings truer than its counterpart in the American film, where it is viewed more as a clown. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonto. They gave the film a naturalistic view, that was the way Italian directors favored era. The original musical score by Giuseppe Rosati is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, but also includes arias by Bizet and Verdi, which fit well into the context of the film. <br /> <br /> «Ossessione» film treasure, because we see great Luchino Visconti at the top of their form.
