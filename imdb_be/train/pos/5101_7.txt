John Travolta, honkeytonk largest in the world, and a mechanical bull ... what else could you ask for! Yes, you probably will not get a lot of surprises and a deep meaning in this. Nevertheless, I have always found it quite nice to look at the redneck novel. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) found in Jill's and fall in love. They have all the difficulties, one would expect a hardcore pair of cattle to be. In honkeytonk scenes fun with dancing, mechanical bull riding and -of course- the necessary fights. He has a good, 1980 Country soundtrack, featuring "Looking for love in all the wrong places," "The Devil went down to Georgia" and "Hello Texas" is my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break up your cowboy boots and have a boogie boot scootin! <br /> <br /> *** (4)
