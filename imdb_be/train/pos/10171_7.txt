Once, when I was in college, and we had an international trade fair, Russian part was the Soviet-era poster with the inscription «Ne boltay!», Which means, "Do not talk!". I "translated" it is for the "generation" of TV viewers as "Not Gladys Kravitz "(in relation to the curious neighbor on" Bewitched "). <br /> <br /> However, if you see the result of gossip in Pvt. Snafu short "Rumors", you can see that this is not a joke. In this case, constantly brainless soldier overhears something about the explosion and immediately thinks that's the state attacked the United States. So, he says, is someone who tells someone else who tells someone else, and it continues. As in "Russian go, Russian go", the story is inflated more and more out of proportion every time, so that when he returns to the Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, this is basically the Second World War propaganda - complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese - but I must say that Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually pretty funny. Of course, since they had a Dr. Seuss to write and voice of Mel Blanc, it is not surprising that they came out pretty cool. Worth a look.
