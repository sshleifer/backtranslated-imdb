I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic, and the older the film was much better. I liked the lighting, make-up and costumes have changed, Gillian changed history. mannerism Jimmy Stewart did not do much for me in this film, but I believe they serve to highlight the nature reserve Gillian. I was also surprised Nicky and mannerisms Jillian - it was as if the director wanted to appear effeminate and Gillian appears male. Nicky makes gestures as he shows his strength Redlich, particularly struck me. I never thought witches as the effeminate, so it was an interesting way of opposing these characters.
