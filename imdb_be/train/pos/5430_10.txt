Of all the British imperialist films like Four Feathers, The charge of the Light Brigade, for example, this film stands out as the cream of the crop. It reflects a time when "the sun never set on the British Empire." Get over it. I will not go into why, because many others were a lot of reasons that makes this movie great. I visited the Alabama Hills and photographed the passage through which the British marched and remains as it was, without any changes in time and human attempt and vandals. And although I know that it is seeing Dean lying dead on a stretcher, and if these lines are read <br /> <br /> "Yes, Ding! Ding! Ding! <br /> <br /> You Lazarushian-skin Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> While I belted you and flayed you, <br /> <br /> On Livin 'Gawd, who made you, <br /> <br /> you're a better man than I am , Gunga Din Â»<br /> <br /> I still, at age 54, get misty-eyed and one who says they do not is a liar. the spectrum of emotions within him is a sign of a great movie. As the end of another great film, mice and men.
