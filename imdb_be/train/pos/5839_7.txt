Last (I believe) of the films Boys made from Hal Roach, this is also the last really funny movie they made before the fox to the 20th century, who so valiantly not properly their talents. Although there are weak points - a business with a "tester easy", for example, a little exaggerated ah ... (but worth it to see, "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but overall this film is a good overview of what boys bring to the screen. Richard Kramer (titers) appeared in other L & H click, and it threatens enthusiastically here as convict Nick Granger. The scene where the boys have to eat their own food synthetic ( "Looks good, smells good, and it's probably a good taste. Eat.") He is one of my favorite moments in the works. Stan and Ollie will always be pleasant companions in the life of millions of loyal fans.
