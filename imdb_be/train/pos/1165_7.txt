As one other reviewer IMDB noted that the movie starts a little slow, but it gets better as it goes along. Yes, he will be released, Roger Corman, and yes, it passes some of the same thematic ground, as the significantly higher cost precursors such as Fatal Attraction and poison ivy. Nevertheless, juxtapositioning career of his wife as a rising singer's blues collection against her husband alone and almost Freudian need to fill emotional and physical "emptiness" or "holes" while she is away with the judicious use of a minimum of effects and settings are nicely done . Using a very small amount of locations and characters, as well as with the use of water in almost every scene, and as a cleansing and sink the metaphorical sign to have this film, although clearly suffering from a tiny budget, reminds me in many ways, better implementation and more recent scenario, namely the French film "Swimming Pool", which seems to me, at least, may have borrowed liberally with some useful ideas "against AMANDA." with a smaller set of tools saves against AMANDA affair with rudimentary fatalist ychnyya vision surrendering those occasional lewd temptations, but it performs as well as or better than other movies in this genre. Twist stepfather abuse of Amanda in the past (again, very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and it is interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and nice response to the plight of Amanda's this aspect of the story is. The cast is great, I think. <br /> <br />
