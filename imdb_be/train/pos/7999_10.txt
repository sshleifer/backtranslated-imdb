This must be one of the best, if not the best movie I have seen a very long time. If enough action to satisfy fans, and yet the story was very good. I really liked the movie, and he had me hooked from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Added blood and blood there, but brought the realistic nature of what is happening in front of the film, and even had a tear Jerker the end I think for many people. <br /> <br /> This should ensure someone. I saw a lot of reviews, film slate, but to be fair, most of the films that get bad reviews are one of the best. it proves it again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy film, just go and see this movie. You will not be disappointed.
