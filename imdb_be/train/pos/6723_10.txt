Riding Giants amazing film. It really shows how these people lived then just surf. Their lives were basically surfing, live, breathe, and enjoy. They do not care about money, work, or any girl stuff. These waves were their baby girl. I've never been on a surfboard, and it looks so hard, I do not understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense at all. This is an amazing movie, and if you love surfing, then you really need to see this movie. If you are a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing as he came into life, who really know him or something, then you really have to see it. This can be documented, but it is really good. -Tara F.-
