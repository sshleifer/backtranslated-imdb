Stylish, whimsical, innovative revenge managed bloodshed. Also, a cheese course, from time to time is very cheesy. It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat, because it has a revenge plot emphasizes exactly the same event, and she comes to the side of the good guy because of the bad behavior of the bad guys. It is sad that there is no Gloria Graham, but so fantastic that it is Alain Delon and Glenn Ford. Maybe someone as handsome as Alain bypass in a cashmere sweater and a raincoat? Nevertheless, it is absolutely hard and icy cool. Not one at the moment can not touch it - even someone like Jude Law could try, I guess. Hard for any girl to look good with it. The music was funky and perfect, and there were several excellent car racing (and those are usually not my cup of tea) - especially one willy nilly alone in the forest. People also met their doom in a creative and bloody fashion, such as in a landfill Cruncher. But for the cheese, influenced by the general atmosphere and skilfully pulled. More creativity, risk and freshness in this "forgotten" movie than most of what I've seen lately.
