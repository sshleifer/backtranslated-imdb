This film shows life in the north of Cameroon from the perspective of a young French girl, France Dalens, whose father is an official of the colonial (French) governments, and whose family is one of the few white families around. It gives a sense of what life was like for the colonists and the natives with which they are associated. This feeling is consistent with the other film I've seen about Africa in the same period of time (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I have no way of knowing whether it is really as typical. This is not just an impression - things happen in the film - but the plot is too low. The viewer is left to make their own conclusions, rather than imposed on him filmmakers, though framing story as a memory of visiting a woman in the southwest of Cameroon, as an adult provides some perspective.
