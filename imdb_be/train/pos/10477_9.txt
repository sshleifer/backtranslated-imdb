Walking a tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the most difficult acts in movies. How do you get a laugh out of flour and other people do not start to feel bad, when he is too long? <br /> <br /> Well, it's amazing little gem of a film will bring great big laughs, beautiful scenery, and a pretty good noise as well. I especially like the idea that the story did the trick alcohol legally, as white Europeans liked, and marijuana is illegal, because "those other race" ... undoubtedly used it and puts aside racial marijuana laws so openly flaunts the world's population. <br /> <br /> extraordinary «DVD Extra» comment ... two of them really ... run through the entire film with the two actors, and then again with the writers. I kept seeing things I was sure that it was not in the first movie, but then I realized how easy it is to miss most of the subtle comedy on the first take. That horn! Do not miss it! 9/10 stars
