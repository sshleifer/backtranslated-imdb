This film was one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen. great for the whole family to watch. ideas may be a little far-fetched, but it's a good feeling great comedy and action. loving little boy, J.P. and part of the Academy Award winner Adrien Brody can be very short, but very memorable. Highly recommended.
