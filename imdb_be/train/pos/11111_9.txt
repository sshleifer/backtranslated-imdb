Soprano, perhaps the most mind-opening series you could ever want to watch. It is reasonable, it is bizarre, it's funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can not resist watching. The best aspect of this show overwhelming realism of the characters, located in an underground world of crime families in New York. Most of the time, you do not really know whether the wise guys injure someone in the back, or buy their lunch. <br /> <br /> In addition, adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show the depth of their bodies - These are dangerous people, most of them murderers, but God, if you do not like them. I laughed at their jokes were broken when they made the ERR in court, and was terrible at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> In a suburban New Jersey setting is absolutely perfect for the subtext of the show - people are not always as they seem, and the stark contrast between the mundane and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals to weigh even the odds. <br /> <br /> If you have not already, you definitely should.
