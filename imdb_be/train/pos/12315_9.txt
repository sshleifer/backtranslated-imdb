There are 21 comments, I add my to this list and there is hardly a criticism. That's because this film is terrific fun, and has a bit of everything in it. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps a little frightening for younger children, but my 15 year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action, humor and even a beautiful score. <br /> <br /> I buy a DVD-disks only when I know that they will be regularly observed, and now that it is finally available in the UK, I will definitely be adding it to your collection.
