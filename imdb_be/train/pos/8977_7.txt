The film is a bit rate of 4, but for fans of cinema during the 1940s, it is almost a must-see and rate 9 in a variety show! I was drawn to watch this presence Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day. Outside of the "Calamity Jane," I've never seen her put on a song better than it does here. Randolph Scott unforgettable as well, even if he does not see a lot of screen time. It's been awhile since I've seen the movie, but I was pretty sure that Humphrey Bogart put in mind. With so many familiar faces, it is difficult to follow. If he ever appears on the TV station near you, be sure to catch the sequence of Doris Day, if nothing else! <br /> <br />
