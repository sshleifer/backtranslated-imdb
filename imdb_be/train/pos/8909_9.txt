It's pretty well known one, so I will not get too deep into it. The main story of two teenagers who find out about other people's mucous clot mucus coming to Earth via a meteor. Person contact with this slime ball burns flesh like acid. It is also absorbed by the human body, making it grow bigger. Nobody believes teenagers (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend), and when they finally do it, it seems that the drop can not be stopped. It's really well done for his age, and in contrast to many other 50-clicking the pace fairly quickly. The story is very unique, and that makes it a must see for any fan of the old science fiction and monster movies. If you can dig up the sticky blood from 80th terror be sure to check out the remake of 88 as well.
