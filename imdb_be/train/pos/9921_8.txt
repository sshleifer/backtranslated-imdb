I was a supporter of the work Burtinskaya for many years, and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work, thanks to the documentary Jennifer Beychval in. The stark beauty of shipbreaking yard in Bangladesh, a stone quarry in Vermont, a huge assembly plant in China deposited the old quarters in Shanghai, which is just waiting to be demolished: the landscapes captured so well, and photographer. cinematographer <br /> <br /> I thought of the old television documentaries about the abandoned coal mines and plastic mold factory; kind of stuff I grew up watching. Burtynsky's work is of great importance, showing how industrial activity is only shifting to Asia, it has not stopped. Strange scene for me was the computer, scrap yard somewhere in China - waste had a menacing air about it, while the workers were very cheerful.
