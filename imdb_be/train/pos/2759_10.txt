The number of times I had tears in my eyes watching the film a little. And there's only one time I really cried, and that was when I saw this movie. This movie has some kliches, but I really do not care. I'm crying, even as I write this, and it's been quite some time since I've seen him. He was well acted, and all the production values ​​are good, but what really counts is a simple and beautiful message. We all know that in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in the life of love in all its forms. It is only when we love, we are truly alive. I know how I sound sentimental, and I promise that I'm not usually the case. I'm quite cynical. This film brought more strong feelings like sorrow and happiness in me than any other movie, and it probably always will be the first film that I recommend others to see.
