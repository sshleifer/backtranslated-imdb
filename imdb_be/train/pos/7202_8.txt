Long before the "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years ago), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two men kissing passionately on the screen, and to be honest, I was shocked. I understood it in terms of plot, and it is not very upset my feelings (not much), but it was the first time I saw him, at least in the "core" of cinema. I thought it was a bold move for the time, and cheered for them to try, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as a PG-rated Superman. Male bisexuality on the screen might hit his stride with "tea", but it is interesting to note such an early incarnation.
