I saw this movie for the first time, while drunk in a motel in Canada. While flipping channels across parts Easy Lube. My friend went on to study, but I told him to go back. Something about the name of light machine oil just does not sound right. I watched the rest of the movie it was pretty darn funny. I jotted down a few names from the credits and returned home to watch it. It turned out, the first film Chevy Chase. I do not remember him in it. I do not remember it, so I hired him and gave him a second Wei. It's pretty funny and pretty graphics. This is the same as Kentucky Fried Movie, except not as funny. Love fingers, light machine oil, and I'm so f ** President of the cinema. hermitage Dealers pretty cool too. I give it a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
