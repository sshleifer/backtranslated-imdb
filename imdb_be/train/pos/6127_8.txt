Jack Frost about a serial killer who was sentenced to death. On the way to his death sentence in a prison truck that he rides in a collision with a chemical tanker, filled with a chemical that turns it into a molecule with snow on the ground, turning it into a snowman. As the killer himself, which turns him into a killer snowman. Jack now wants to avenge the sheriff, who caught it. Jack is now starting his rampage again, it kills people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I do not think that Jack Frost has a chance to become a classic of horror, but its entertaining film. Just put your brain to the content and have fun with it, but do not take it too seriously.
