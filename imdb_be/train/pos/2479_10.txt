(Sorry for my faulty language, I am not a native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a film that almost demands suppress reactions. Personally, I agree to all these superlatives that are around. But I will not use this rather sematically Void other himself to describe this film here. Because the "perfect one-and-only the best in the world !!". - surveys done by some people turn away (including me) <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for another "Hamlet" on which the potential to compete with many of cinema and theater all of them - then do not miss this when you are lucky enough to find it anywhere. (Unfortunately, not too many people will have a chance to see it seems a DVD is not there, and the version of the German language -. Which is quite well done -. Not available in any format) <br /> <br /> Just in case you We decided to get a copy of: Spare, that cut down two o'clock (or so) version of the movie. It has no meaning and no pleasure, and gives the wrong impression of the film, which is engaged in an interesting way with the flow and architecture. And it, too mutilated to 4: 3 Aspect Ratio <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
