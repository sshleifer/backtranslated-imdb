In the first, I do not think Ben Affleck can really shoot funny Christmas movie ,, boy was I wrong, my daughter invited me to look at it with her, and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny ,, I really liked Christine Appelagate and Catherine O Â»Hara was also good, the plot that really sold me ,, I mean ,, well ,, put up with the family at the table for people you only just to see but once or twice a year ,, and probably does not get along with anyway ,, you really need as much alcohol as you can stand the system to deal with Christmas ,, so I thought that the room was good there, buy a family of $ 250,000, it was a little far-fetched side ,, but it turned out to work very well for me ,, because g it was a riot all the way to the end, it shows the class struggle of the different families. he has a lot of funny moments in, including faulty items on the computer for a teenager. all in all I loved this film and watch it again next Christmas or earlier, when my daughter wants too.
