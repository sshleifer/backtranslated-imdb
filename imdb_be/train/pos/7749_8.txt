This film blows over. The debut film of Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band Deus) introduces you to the intriguing 8 people, building blocks addictive puzzle film. Each one of them survives for one day and one night in the metropolis of Antwerp. The bartender draws his characters with a great deal of inspiration and skillfully weaves their individual stories, tour the force that recalls the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. Trays anecdotes surprises, moves, entertains; the dialogues are so natural, they seem to have to improvise. Some great performances Shonarts, Natali litter and very funny duo from Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam is a memorable Luvik «Windman», a strange guy dancing throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the stunning choreography, and he, of course, Tom Barman took care of the ultra cool Sound Track. We were seriously impressed: Any way the wind blows is a movie that blows down.
