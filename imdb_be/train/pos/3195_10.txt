Beaver TRILOGY, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant films ever made. I was lucky enough to catch it, along with the Q & A session with the director Trent Harris, NY Video Festival a few years ago, and then bought a copy of Trento site. This film has to be seen to be believed! I wholeheartedly recommend a search on behalf of Trento online and then buy the film from his website. He's incredibly nice guy to boot. Do not get confused: cameramen fictional trilogy sections beaver NOT Trent <br /> <br /> After the trilogy saw a few times, I must admit that I could do without Sean Penn version. It's like a test version of the Crispin Glover «Orkly Kid» and interesting as an element of curiosity, if you're a fan of the Penn, than to be a good video. Penn's pretty funny, though, and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty B & W video. <br /> <br /> This is probably also one of the best roles, Crispin Glover, and I just love to see the new documentary on the original Groovin 'Harry. Once you see this film, you will never get nervous laughter Harry's head ever again.
