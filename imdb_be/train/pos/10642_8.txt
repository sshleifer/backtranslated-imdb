I just consider the detention last night, and I liked what I saw. It was great fun movie.Dolph looked great on the cool Bike.He also looked good in this film compared to his other recent movies.He now in a pretty good story shape.The was normal, and the other actors would also be tolerable .I do not I called this film his best, but it is still a good movie. <br /> <br /> but it also had its share of problems. The first of these was the way the bullets were flying everywhere, and even if they are fired at close range, they missed target.They would have shown PPL escape from the bullets for the better. Another problem I had was the students swore way. I do not know which school students can swear in front of his teacher, and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in number. There had to be more bad guys. The latter problem has been identified by the fact that many types of cheese, but it was associated with a small budget. In general, the film was a good Movie.I enjoyed it.I would recommend others to watch it. PS Now p and DEAD beat cop. (Some One-liners also cool) <br /> <br />
