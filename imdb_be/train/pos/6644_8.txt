After too many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons said in 1979 the book "The House Next Door" was finally removed. As a result, it turns a little bit from the novel, which, especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable, if disappointing, as a television film, all of which absorbs and is actually very good, just not as great as the book, one of Stephen's favorites of the king and a friend of mine as well. <br /> <br /> with a lot of work time and fewer restrictions as to cinemas, the richness inherent in the original three-part stories sinister ultramodern house could be explored and nurtured, especially the climax of the opening near the very end. <br /> <br /> However, the whole cast does well on this thoughtful story about the senseless malevolence. There are several unnecessary shocks cheap, but what an atmosphere of fear is well-developed. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes include abstract painting the house of their neighbor neighboring amateur artist who is trying to present their corruption to the canvas. <br /> <br /> Be sure to read a great novel.
