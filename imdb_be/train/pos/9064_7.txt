I sat with the children as we were watching the movie. We all found it very interesting film. <br /> <br /> If Billy goes to a new school, in the fifth class bully starts to stuff with him, and this is what leads to eating worms. <br /> <br /> Billy the bet is placed and only so much time to eat 10 worms anyway. From this point the bully and his friends try to come up with ugly ways to cook, fry or bake the worm to try to get Billy ill, so that he loses his bet. <br /> <br /> Billy remains strong and eats its way into becoming more and loved more than anyone else, even the bullies friends. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you when he wins the bet or not ... you just have to watch to find out, but I would think that if you love a good family movie, you will like it. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this movie is not just for boys, I've got all his daughters and they really enjoyed it very much.
