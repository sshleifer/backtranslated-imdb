Perhaps the two main significance of "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" that stupid leporid signs in «A Wild Hare» now has a name, and that he utters his famous "Of course you realize this means war!" The first time. Mainly, the crowd Terme Terrace is still trying to figure out what to do with this big-eared rascal. This is definitely a must-see for the hard-core fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to take an interest. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake, it's pretty fun, making bunny mistakes to ever gullible Elmer Fudd. Crisp shades of things to come abound for the cartoon. I recommend it.
