is a film about the life, the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. I defy anyone not to shed a tear at the end of the film. This is more than just tear Jerker, his charming, thought-provoking drama with excellent performances from all the actors, but especially Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. 7 years on, I'm surprised that Luke is still a virtual unknown and Washington only one other film is directed. However, except for the slow build-up, the story of the trials and tribulations of the foster child, and how it still affects his adult life is a kind of film that stays with you long after you've seen. Like many fox searchlight pictures, it was more the sleeper hit and not get massive critical acclaim he deserves. The scene in which Antwone finally meets his mother summed up the film for me, there were so many ways that could be done, and it might be all mushy or it might be unrealistic, but Washington struck exactly the right tone, his mother never I did not say the word, and can only shed tears and antowne just asked why. Her overwhelming sense of guilt prevents her from saying something she could say to defend yourself? One of the most exciting cinematic scenes that I saw.
