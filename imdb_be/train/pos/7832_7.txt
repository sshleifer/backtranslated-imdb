I finally got his wish to see this in the theater. I saw a film by Fritz Lang on video a few years ago. I was hoping that the ideal screening conditions will work their magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions were perfect at Cinematheque Ontario. Untouched full-length printing. Intertitles in the original German Gothic script, with simultaneous translation into English, detailed without being too literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the film sputtered for a while, but ultimately failed to catch, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This film has no real relationship to Wagner's Ring Cycle, as I already knew, but some of them can not. Wagner adapted the 13 gr. Niebelungenlied for their own purposes. Part I Fritz Lang's epic - "Siegfried." - there is a lot that will be familiar to students of Wagner but <br /> <br /> «Revenge Kriemhild» is the story of Siegfried's wife Kriemhild, her marriage with King Etzel (Attila) Huns, and her desire for revenge Hagen and Gunther, was renamed in Nibelungen, for the murder of Siegfried. Spectacular fire in this movie is supposed to develop and expand in the Wagnerian myth in his Götterdämmerung, his Götterdämmerung, and the end of Valhalla. This film is the life. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is spectacular. Massive sets to compete with "Kabir" (1914), which inspired the "Intolerance" Griffith (1916). Their decoration and sets new standards in barbaric splendor. There's a huge cast of scarred, mangy Huns and art deco Burgundians. And battles. Fights that never seem to end actually. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild very successful in its plan of revenge. She manages to destroy everything around it. Her loyalty to it martyr Siegfried does not seem to stop many from love or devotion, but something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth cried, "to castrate me here." She knew she was not emotionally prepared for the fact that she needed to do. But Kriemhild sun reflects normal human emotions, and, of course, no one does not identify with the feminine. She had already "top complete heavy cruelty", to borrow the phrase of Shakespeare, from the very beginning. Margarethe Schön and its Director to convey this to the filament. I do not want to exaggerate, but Glower virtually the only expression ever "live" person to Kriemhild. This is the ultimate in one-note speeches. This is clearly intentional but not just a case of bad acting. <br /> <br /> What we have on offer then a one-dimensional sketch of a vengeful Fury. Someone might see Kriemhild as the strengthening of the heroine. I just see the film as a misogynist.
