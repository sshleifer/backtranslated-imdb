It was a little strange, and evil, and I enjoyed it a lot, the characters in the show were great as well, and praised each other well. I was sorry to see that it is cut off .. I'd like to see where he could find a went.You leaning towards Lucas Buck sheriff, who was more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was terrifying and alluring. And I would like to see more of him and his character has become. However, I will buy just enjoy the show, it was great something different on TV. And Paige Turrco, who was a cousin Caleb, she was a big mystery, where and what it meant Lucas. Its a shame, it's not over until now .. or was never finished, I'd like to see what would happen.
