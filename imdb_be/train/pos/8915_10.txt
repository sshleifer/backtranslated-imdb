Drop is a great horror film, not only because of the horrific images of brightly it almost irresistible, flesh dissolving the title character, but because he has a real social message. It is, in many ways, "the feeling of a good horror movie." A reasonable story helps immeasurably solid action from all the cast. Two romantic leads, Steve McQueen and Aneta Korsan brings surprising depth and sentimental to the point. They do not understand, but very well-meaning young people, and it is very easy to eradicate them. <br /> <br /> This is a film about the society and its juvenile characters cause problems mostly out of boredom, and not some evil character flaw. drag racing competitor Steve McQueen almost seems the enemy at an early stage in the process, but quickly joins the company of McQueen, to save the city from the invader occurs as soon as he sees the seriousness of McQueen. Thus, the situation, the nature of what at first glance it seems that suddenly develops cartoonish depth and realism of the human <br /> <br /> children's initial skepticism authorities refuted the wild claims. - and as soon as the threat is recognized by all, all the conflicts in the society disappears. This association aims and validation of "intrusive" teenagers, becomes official when the father Aneta Korsaut breaks in school to get fire extinguishers required for freezing Blob. On any other day, breaking the school will be considered as an act of vandalism, typical juvenile delinquent - on this day, it is a necessary action performed on the body of an adult figure. At this critical moment, it is clear that there is no separation line between young and old. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual film that he recognizes the perception of "the generation gap", but believes that it is more imaginary than real, and that, given the real crisis, people will naturally come together to restore order. "Drop" is an excellent tonic for the kind of depression that usually comes with a view "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). <br /> <br /> A lot has been made of the film cheap, but an innovative (and effective!) visual effects. They certainly smart. Many gravity defying tricks we see Blob performs achieved with miniature sets for rotation. The camera was usually supplied with the kit in a very tightly "locked" position (the lights were to be attached as well, so the light remains unchanged, as the room was turned so and so). These scenes often photographed one frame at a time as the room slowly turned - silicone blob oozing slowly, and action needed to be accelerated. In a sense, it was like, to stop the movement of the photos, but with blobs of silicone, not Rod puppets. Even today, the effect is amazing and surprising. <br /> <br /> It is a good film with the exploiter-sounding name, BLOB is a must see.
