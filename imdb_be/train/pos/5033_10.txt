This is one of those films that, after watching, you will continue to think about and get back to even months after watching. Action is spectacular for the starring two children (usually I hate movies with a whiny baby steps). Bill Paxton is awesome, his directorial debut, even better than I had expected the actor, whose most memorable line "Game over, man! Game over! "(From" Aliens "movie). <br /> <br /> Most of the film dichotomy between these scenes, where the actors playing a family, and if they do their job, "" It really makes the film believable and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I'll wait for more movies I 'sure that he loves!
