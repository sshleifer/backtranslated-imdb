Star Trek Hidden Frontier surprise you in many ways. Firstly, this is a fan of the series, only available on the Internet, and it is mainly friends & neighbors, who have a computer program and a home video camera and sewing machines that, like Mickey & Judy once put it, put on a show. This, of course, friends and neighbors, you might say. Many of these people do not look the most beautiful people you have ever seen, or the youngest, or thin ?? some of them stumble through their line as they walk on the marble ?? some of them have thick accents, or just do not seem to speak well, first of all, whick makes it almost impossible to understand a single word of what they say. However, you have to admit that after all these friends and neighbors together, it's really fun to watch. So, some of false dialogue. Yes, it is a little strange (though admittedly a little too cool) watching two Star man kisses so you wince a little, if they explicitly cite ST (although some of the kissing scenes seem to go farther and farther.): TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you hear the theme from Galaxy Quest played at the beginning and end of each show. All right. We can get out of it. Why? Schedule the first course. Better than most of what you've seen. And sometimes, a show or two really stand out story-wise ?? some of them are actually real tears-jerkers. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier in general malevolence in every sense of the word ?? but you have to give people involved in credit where credit is due. It requires a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude. People, sets, costumes, graphics ?? it is a huge effort for many of the people. We observe, we will be back, and we thank them.
