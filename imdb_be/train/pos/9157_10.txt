Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I came to this film version in the late '90s, I was thrilled! This is the best and most complete version of the book on the film! This version is a little bit long time to sit in one sitting, but well worth it. Timothy Dalton's amazing how Rochester. I was glad that they threw looks fine actress (ZIL Clark), Jane and glamorous people. I love the sets and location. For those who are true fans of Jane Eyre, this is the version to watch !!! For those of you who are interested, I just found this version to DVD. I watched as my VHS copy almost to breaking, so I was thrilled to find it on DVD.
