Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago, I immediately wanted to turn it off. As I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actor who plays Joshua stole the show. His facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head why he was not more comedies. He has «Marty Feldman» thing going for it, but much, much more talent ... not to take anything from Marty. The film really shocked me how close he was to the initial spurt, but then again, it was so much more. I really think that if this movie was first released, and I saw the movie 2nd Steve Martin, I think the second one was a cheap rip-off. I know that it sounds like a bold statement, but it's true. I actually like Steve Martin very much, but his execution of the second actor in a push Too. I would like to get a copy for my collection. I encourage you to see if you can find it.
