What a great gem it is. This is an unusual story, it is interesting to look at. Yes, it's singing, but it is very nicely set up in the story and very melodic to hear. It was so nice to look at; I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during the Second World War. We are talking about a trainee witch who is looking for a missing part of the spell that she needs. She uses her rough "magic" to transport it and 3 children under her care in a variety of destinations to find it. They joined her teacher correspondence that surprised to hear that from his school lessons actually works! <br /> <br /> While the special effects may seem a bit dated to the first, once you get used to them, they become part of the charm of the film. In fact, the film won an Oscar for the effects! <br /> <br /> The film is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like the melodious song. Characters surprisingly interesting to watch. I think that anyone at any age can find something to like in this film.
