Fidois very odd film. And in many respects, very good. <br /> <br /> My first thought after watching was how the hell are they going to sell this thing? If Shaun of the Dead romantic comedy with zombies, Beetle is a boy and his dog story mixed with the fiftieth nostalgic comedy with zombies. Who is not exactly trip off the tongue. <br /> <br /> Fido has little slaughter Shaun, in dried blood and belly laughs. This is a different beast (pardon the pun) <br /> <br /> Fido starts with black and white film information, which explains the background. - people won the war against the zombies, developing control collar, which subordinates the flesh eaters in dumb slaves. <br /> <br /> At first I thought we we had during the fifties the Cold War paranoia parody la matinée, but we shall soon cast into the world of bright primary colors and fifties middle-class nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The young Those Robinon lonely child who does not fit into the school. His mother future social climber, and his father nervous and off. <br /> <br /> In an effort to keep up with the Jones, mother (Kari-Anne Moss) acquired zombies. Jimmy uninterested at first, but "Fido» (Billy Conelley) soon turns out to be a great friend of Jimmy. While his collar does not go out for a moment ... <br /> <br /> Fido is not a horror film, but my problem with the movie is to find out what exactly it is. <br /> <br /> Much of the humor is light grade family and sometimes the storyline depends too much on the boy and his dog / family moments. <br /> <br /> However, the film is permeated with a surprisingly dark, really funny moments, while welcome, to ensure an R rating for the fact that, for a long time, the family comedy. <br /> <br /> film looks great and perfectly performed by all participants. <br /> <br /> Despite its complex tonal problems, I hope that this film will find its niche, as it is quite a little gem in the flood this year cinematic crap.
