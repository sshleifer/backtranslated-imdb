I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many sci-fi show, so if it bares no resemblance to them, I did not notice. I like the quality of the collection of stories about the cinema. I even love story, even though I enjoy this wonder in the back of my mind, how the heck that is really part of the story can evolve, seeing as Ned can not touch or even Chuck ... well, you know. I even like Chuck, I do not find it annoying everyone, and I do hate is too sweet, beautiful, wonderful characters. I even like the voice of the narrator, even if it bothers one of my family members and bares some similarities with some advertisements Walgreens. I could quibble about all the other things, about the plight of Neda and the authors are going to address in the future, but I just prefer to wait and see what the story writers to weave.
