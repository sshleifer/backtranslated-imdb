Alternative historical drama with some excellent battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good backup. Scenario competent and quite original, and the film is mercifully free of heroes. However, it does drag a bit, and the last coil too much like a mini-series. However, Cinematography Frederick Elmes keeps one interested in dull bit (and every now and again you see a picture that reminds you that he worked for David Lynch). Worth a look.
