I think this film will be more enjoyable if everyone thought of him as a picture of colonial Africa in the 50s and 60s, and not as a story. Because there is no real history here. Only one vignette on top of another, like little dots of light that do not matter until you have enough to paint a picture. The first time I saw Chocolat I do not really "get it" until then, having thought about it for a few days. Then I realized that there are a lot of things in order to "get", including the end of colonialism, which was, but because of the angle, simply there is no plot. Anyway, this is one of my favorite movies. The scene at the airport with a short shower and beautiful music was simply poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, not to look at it - you'll be bored to tears. But for some of you ... you can thank me later recommend it to you.
