Given the lack of art from the African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The idea of ​​offering a multi-dimensional look at the community assigned hoods and dealers. But the funny thing is that this is not the center of attention or even for short. But this unidentified assertion of independence from these that is the most sticking. Genre unique and not typical expectation. It's almost the waste, who first catches the eye, so watch it twice critical. The film has an aesthetic quality that gives it to itself to the true art of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is real art, that the African voice, which is very rare. The film is not copied to reach their posts, he modernizes and provokes pulling thin stereotypes (not racial, but on the basis of the nature of stereotypes), from the point of view of the writers of the film is brilliant. It carries multiply messages consisting of very rapid development of the character. You must remember this movie in less than 10 minutes, and it is possible to establish the nature very quickly. The use of color and texture of the music is also worthy of praise. But considering the director, a former venture Owen Alik Shahadah 500 years later, the music is to be expected. But from the point of view of the theme seems to be that the idea is a waste, but a satire escapes indirectly social problem ?? shiny things!
