Reading some of the comments on the boards here I am waiting for this film to be a complete disappointment - but when I watched it, I could not stop laughing! He officially became my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what all the hate is in question here, maybe it's because the film of this kind have never really been around before. I can hardly be called another all-female comedy cited. Many comedies will have one or two actresses in the long run, but there will be plenty of support for male characters. This one was almost all women - except for Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked. . All actresses delivered very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) with a fancy and attractive scenario <br /> <br /> The charm of this movie, I think he has a subtle feminist message: welcome you, female success in the public sphere, the power of the female friendship and break gender roles. Carefree, although it is one of the main characters are faced with a problem, as they are trying to be more "fun" conflicts with their feminist values ​​and that they knew themselves. <br /> <br /> Miss Pyle suggested that the movie missed the theatrical release because of his all-female cast and the lack of well-known actor to get the studio behind it, and I have to agree. All I recommend this movie loved it, and I think it's a shame that the female comedy dorkiness celebration has not been widely adopted and successfully. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and love to the women's center comedy.
