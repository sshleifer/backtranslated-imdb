I went to Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge !! .. Tom Cruise fan, my very cynical brother and my girlfriend ... What can I say .. I was completely blown away by the film, and especially productive to the TC, I thought it was a very moving film, and it was not quite what I expected. <br /> <br /> I read the reviews and decided not to go and see it, I'm so glad that I was "forced" to view it. What is surprising is that I can not say why, all I can say I found it to be completely engaging and I could not stop thinking about it the next day. As for what I felt about the movie, all I can say about that, it's not the storyline (fiction, psychodrama, whatever ) it on the people and events that shape their lives and as a small event like getting in the car, you can change all ...... <br /> <br /> as for the fact that Cree yki wrote, yes, perhaps, the original was a terrific second film for Amenabar, but that's another subject of interpretation, and in any case the narcissistic remake to benefit Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can not even think write a couple of trite, brisk sentences to describe the movie to just go and see it !!!! <br /> <br /> yes, I know that this is not a balanced thoughtful review, but that .This is not a film.
