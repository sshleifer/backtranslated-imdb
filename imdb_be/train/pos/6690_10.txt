Mystery Men is one of those films that get ridiculous for a long time. There is a naive simplicity and "courtesy" to the characters. She became part of the "culture" of our family, and we often quote characters. This is my favorite movie from the past two years. My children are 13 and 11, and we all three love this movie. More action and comedy. We like Galaxy Quest and Monty Python and click. Well, we're not talking smart here, only family bonding!
