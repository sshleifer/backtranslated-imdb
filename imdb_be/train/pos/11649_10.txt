What an absolutely stunning film, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, watch it, you will not regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth carries the film on his shoulders, and although there is nothing more, except for him, I still liked it. Music A.R.Rehman takes a long time to grow on you, but after you've heard it a few times, you really start to like it.
