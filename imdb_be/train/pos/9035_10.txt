Acting was superb in this film. In amateur rocket men, I found very few mistakes. As a man, he touched my heart and soul. In order to observe the actor, you would think that they are the actual characters. Laura Dern, my favorite actress, there was nothing left of her performances. Young actors playing Rocket Boys showed talent his age, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired that eternal love / hate relationship between father and son, so it felt real. If you do not get a lump in my throat and tears if it's the first successful rocket goes up, or if the father and son agreed, and then get your pulse checked (may be dead).
