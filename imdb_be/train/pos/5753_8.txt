*** 1/2 ***** Though I am not related to the fact that this is an English version of the name, some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted, it appears to be found in many native Quebecers hearts. Nevertheless, it was a movie in my childhood I was a fervent supporter; bearing in mind now that it was done for the children, I appreciate it on a relative basis. The history of children in the winter break is building an amazing snow fort, and pushing back-'n-forward to control weapons, such as snowball fights and other inventions, and idle hands and free time lessons is the winter break. If I had a child, it is certainly a film that I would try and get them interested in the snow fort struck me when I was young, and I think even the kids today would agree, albeit with Pixar and all computer animation, maybe I'm old and I just do not understand this. In addition, the message of the film is amazing allegorical and positive that children (and adults).
