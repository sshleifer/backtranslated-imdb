"De Groot" stunning Dutch thriller based on the book written by Tim Krabbe. Another of his books, «Het Gouden Ei» was placed in a large Dutch mystery thriller called «Spoorloos» ( «disappearance») one is not as good in 1988 as the thriller (although much better than the American remake is also called "The Disappearance "), but there are times that close. <br /> <br /> Especially entrance points are startling. We see a man, later we learn his name Egon Wagter (Fedja van HUET), leaving the aircraft in Thailand. If he picks up his bags it is quite obvious that he throws something across borders. These scenes are completely directed, photographed and acted. A kind of uncertainty is created, you are usually not in the first stage as it is. Later we see how Egon makes his case in Thailand with a woman, and that they have never done anything like it. <br /> <br /> Since then, the film constantly FlashBack and flash-forward. We see how Egon, a child (here played by Eric van der Horst), friends with a guy named Axel (played as a child Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, a kind of and how Axel (played as an adult Marseille Hensley) was the culprit. Egon since going to college and lives with a woman. Around the same time, he sometimes meets Axel, but really did not want anything to do with him. <br /> <br /> The film chronologically road. It shows, by Egon and Axel as children than as students, young people, and in their mid-thirties. But from time to time, as I said, the film goes back to when they were children, and leaps forward. Every time we see them as children that explains what happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers in this document. <br /> <br /> title means «The Cave", and a cave that gives the film its happy ending, but it's actually not so happy. As in the beginning, the ending is terrific. The middle part of the film entertaining and thus diverts our attention to the first scene, only to return at a time, after all. This editing that gives the film its happy ending, although we can say, the dramatic ending is happy as well.
