The horror film is being shot, and things are not going well. We are talking about the masked killer. The director says of the killer before the cast and crew. He goes mad and kills two people. He killed himself and the movie never ends. Twelve years later, a bunch of film students have decided to try and finish it - but there is a curse. People who try and finish it kill themselves. Students ignore it. Guess what happens next? <br /> <br /> The plot is old hat, but it's not bad ... for what it is (a low budget slasher). It is well done with a young and pretty talented young with gypsum. No one is great, but no one is afraid of no. It also avoids obligatory (and useless) female nude scenes. It moves fast, blood is good and bloody, and the script does not insult your intelligence. Ringwald also this having the time of her life playing bitchy actress lost. <br /> <br /> unprofitable but not bad at all. I give it a 7.
