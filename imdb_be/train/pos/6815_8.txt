Elisha Cuthbert plays Camping on a girl fourteen years old, who lost his mother and finds it difficult to talk with his father, until one day in the basement of his apartment, she finds a secret magic elevator that takes her back to the late 18th century, it was it meets two other children who had lost his father and face poverty ... <br /> <br /> I flipped through the channels and found this..I read the synopsis, and suddenly saw Elisha Cuthbert ... I thought it was okay. ... and watched the movie .. I did not realize Elisha made movies before .... Â«The Girl Next Door and 24" Elisha provides a avalnyayuchuyu performance, the plot a bit cheesy but the film works .. .Its amazing how this young girl went on to become the Hottest baby in Hollywood!
