Very interesting. Big turn was not as big a shock as perhaps they hoped for, and it was very dated, but it really got my mind works. It really made me think about a world without vegetation or pet, and made me appreciate the world in which I live much more. Charlton Heston is doing a good job, as well as all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic film, which was awesome. This was not the direction at the time and a lot of settings and background for further clarification is needed, but it was still surprisingly good and intelligent film. The main drawback I could find that I did not want the film to the end, when it happened, I wanted to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
