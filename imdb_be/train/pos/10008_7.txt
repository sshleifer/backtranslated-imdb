You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these silly comedies he made this decade (with the possible exception of "Death to Smoochy," which bombed, when he came out, but now a cult). Drama, he has made in recent years have been fantastic, especially the "Insomnia" and «One Hour Photo». "Night Listener," in spite of the mediocre reviews and fastest DVD release, is one of his best works, period. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary story, even if it does not include a serial killer, or someone that is physically dangerous in this respect. The concept of the film is based on real cases of fraud, which is still to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read the autobiography of a child by the name of Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was touched by the story, until I read the reports on the Internet that Johnson can not exist in reality. When I saw this film in the tangled feelings that Robin Williams is so brilliantly reflected surfaced in my mind. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette, probably gives her best dramatic presentation as well as eventually sociopathic "caretaker." Her role was far from the one she had in films such as «Little Miss Sunshine». There were even times, she looked into the camera, where I thought that she looked right at me. It takes a good actress to play this kind of role, and it is this understated (but well unverified) role, which makes Toni Collette, is probably one of the best actresses of this generation was not even nominated for an Oscar (as of 2008 .), it is incredible that there is at least one woman in this world, which, like this, and it is also scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unresolved, though, because this film leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.
