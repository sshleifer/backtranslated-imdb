Well, in the beginning it looked like "Shrek" - a loner, who persistently followed the comic. Then he turns into something really compelling, like a glove set. And the result is a nice film that has moments that I agree that it's a bit too dramatic for the children to watch (past Manny, for example). The room had obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in creating a movie set is practically no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they will be able to make something out of it emotionally. As I said, this could be a break twitch a few times, so that the children, be careful. The real disappointment is the animation. It was not like a souped up toy story movies or Shrek, and it shows. People are not real, and we have seen the best examples of early CGI. But do not let this recording spots: how to solo, «Ice Age» commendable. And will gather a lot of fans, I have no doubt. Ah, yes, moments of this little mouse is priceless, and the show-stealing.
