Excitement is fun enough movies. He has a lot of funny moments (including a funny disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle of where all the heavy, "she was parting with me," things are happening, but other than that it will still be funny to the end. <br /> <br /> Even if the plot revolves around the fanaticism in relation to the Red Sox, he is not overloaded with sports. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this film <br /> <br /> Of course, it's easy for me to say .. I was a fan of the Red Sox, since I was a boy, too, <br /> < br /> 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Barki
