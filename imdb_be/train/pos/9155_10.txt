Who ever came up with the story is one sick man. I rented it for our hen nights, and all six of us were in shock, because we are all acting together in the classroom, and we know a few actors from the class. Besides all shouting all night oddly, I had a weird nightmares. I kept thinking about my God, when I get up to go to the bathroom to pee, I'm going to be a knife in the middle of wiping or something. I could not even go to the bathroom, because we saw that terrible horror film. I also thought, why all the girls topless in the film, but we do not do any of the boys blocks? You have to make a horror movie where the killer girl and chopping off units. I would like to see that again and again. Call it hard or soft, or something stupid like that. I'm only giving this film 9, because you freaked me out freaks.
