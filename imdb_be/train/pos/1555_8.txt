After watching quite sloppy WW1 spy thriller, Madame Lily (1969) starring Julie Andrews on television this afternoon, I suddenly thought, I've seen much better WW1 spy thriller. All I could remember what he was made Dean De Laurentiis. It only took a short search on IMDB found Fraulein Doktor. Once I learned the name of the memories came flooding back. He was, at one time, are well developed plot revolves around real events such as the death of Kitchener and German offensives 1918.It also has a female spy who is much more plausible than Julie Andrews! Like other reviewers of the first and most powerful memory was well received by the battle scenes and horses and men in gas masks. If you have an interest in war films, and especially WW1 film is worth a look if you have the opportunity.
