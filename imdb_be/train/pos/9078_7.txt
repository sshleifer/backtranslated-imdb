Generally speaking, the story was much better than I expected. Laugh track was a bit annoying, and sometimes does not seek to get in the way; however, it was quite real giggles in this episode, to do for him. My biggest surprise to find some of the best lines and situations that have not been shown in the trailer. Spade, in particular, has not been presented in the best light in previous campaigns, but his character comes across pretty well in the pilot. There is enough eye candy to satisfy just about any and all of the usual characters seem to the challenges they face. Now that the authors may just live up to what they started.
