Amazing and gritty war film that focuses on the internal agony blinded marine Al Schmid. Although it is difficult and frustrating it is at the end of the heroic - Schmid triumph over disabilities and depression. Battle scene was beautiful. But one bone to pick. No matter how many bullets they fired the .50, I have never seen any water or dirt being kicked up the punch! Painfully realistic, but I can live with that. Fine performance Eleanor Parker again as his girlfriend.
