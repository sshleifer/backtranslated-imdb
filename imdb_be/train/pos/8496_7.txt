Wow, it was years since I had last seen this film. Watching this in 2008, of course, is different than watching it in 1986. Initially, I did not 'think I would make it through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so unpleasant, arrogant and disrespectful that it was hard to watch him. He embodies every negative stereotype of Americans. If it was not so bad as only the best employees of a small American town were shown images only worse. On the opposite spectrum of the Japanese were presented as unfeeling, robotic workaholics. The film was not all that funny, I just hung in there because of the nostalgic value of this. And I'm glad I kept looking. <br /> <br /> Just as boxing judge swayed like to finish the round. This film went from about three to seven I appreciated it because of the ending. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious ending, and it was easy. It was great that the city should keep there jobs and maintain the facility, but what was most special was the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American traditions and values. It was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note.
