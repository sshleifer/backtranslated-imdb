Great fun from start to finish. Excellent performances Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some twists and turns and a lot of scenes. The film was made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as a tough sheriff and Railsback as a "cattle-villain." I have to recommend this film for every fan of adventure! 10/10
