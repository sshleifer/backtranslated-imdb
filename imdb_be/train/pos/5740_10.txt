Emotional strength and nature of the Dominique and Eugene thing that Hollywood does not do more. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and sincere films I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hals and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, put Oscar caliber performances! There's not enough words to express how great this movie. Of course, people who are not in sentimental films can not take care of as well as the rest of us about Dominick and Eugene, but for the rest of us, this movie goes straight to the heart and sole of compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie, ever! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS below ***** <br /> <br /> A simple but eloquent story is told masterfully. Eugene is a med school intern who is facing long hours and requires a load at the hospital. His fraternal twin brother Dominic (born 12 minutes earlier) a little slow and awkward because of brain damage due to a victim of violence at the hands of his father. (A heart-breaking when it is shown in the film, which will leave you in tears!) Eugene (a.k.a «Gena") is faced with a painful dilemma. He must decide whether to finish medical school, which means taking his place of residence in another city and left Dominique (a.k.a «Nicky") behind, or forfeit the rest of his education to take care of it. Nicky helps pay school tuition median of his brother, working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> issues of ethics, morality and responsibility skillfully blended in this landmark film. Just when Gina thinks Nicky is making progress towards independence, Dominique turns and winds make things such as helping drug dealer or tying to use the faulty cable, he finds at the dump on the appliance. <br /> <br /> Larry is "Character" and partner Nicky on his garbage route that fills the head gullible Dominic with all kinds of stories like Gena and Jennifer (his girlfriend, whom he tutoring in clinical pharmacology) going in Atlantic City and gambling away all their money. But deep down, you can see that Larry is caring for him. In their rounds, by Nicky also befriends a little boy, we learn, was also beaten by his father. The final result is also tragic, and the pain that you see on Nicky's face when this happens, says a lot. <br /> <br /> sensitivity that two brothers share to each other can not be inflated sufficiently. All Nicky wants to do is to be loved and to seek recognition in anyway he can. (That is, he goes to church, likes to Hulk Hogan) Gena loves Nicky most in the world. But if his brother could become independent so that Gena can realize his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film, which was supposed to get a ton more attention than it deserves, but, unfortunately, came out around the same time as Rain Man, which dealt with a similar problem. Nevertheless, I like Eugene and Dominic better because it has a much stronger emotional component. I warn you that this film is aimed directly at the tear ducts, so there is a Kleenex handy! What movie !!!!
