Well this movie is great, as I said, but of course you need to look like it is worth a look. It's about two boys Mac and Sam, who are great friends and work as a fashion photographer, and the fun begins, when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts dating a 3 flight attendants at the same time leaving his wife with suspicion. Sam reaches the state, and almost forgets his friend, but not completely. But Mac thinks so, and so he begins to meet with the flight attendants. eat garam masala every movie step, rock songs, but something is missing. Comedy is not up to the mark and deserves the award. Its good, but not all that great. Some people laughed until their stomachs ached, but he does not deserve this much laughter. But the opinion, of course, are different. So if you want to watch a movie, you can do it.
