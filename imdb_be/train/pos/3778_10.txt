The first film of little ambition, so that nothing sticks to the screen. It was a bad version of "Back to the Future" with zero charm. Once accepted that Bill and Ted are assholes, joke only can get a hammer on the audience for so long before it breaks down. <br /> <br /> It's a surprise. This is your only warning spoiler ... <br /> <br /> By today's standards, it's more interesting. It avoided after release, unfortunate, given that more talent involved than the first time. We get a photographer «Face / Off», editor of "The Fugitive", the art director of the early works of Burton and sound designer of "The Matrix." <br /> <br /> Writers compensated for their shallows first outing with something profound. Since this is avoided by the fans and the general public, the director probably decided that the style was too extreme. It is not, it is suitable material. As well as "Death Becomes Her" and "Catch-22" dares to be smart, but we like our films "simple", so we do not buy it. Probably, because it dared to be different so it took 12 manufacturers to get him. What's so good <br /> <br /> --Nice self-reference to Keanu; by Airhead Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> --Joss hates his creations just as he hates his colleagues, he makes his hatred. Evil B & T and "good usses robot" are the same as their original vocabulary :. Smaller copies and amortization language <br /> <br /> --The «duality" motif. Nowhere is this more evident than in the photo styles, a lot of high and low angles. They even used Roy Broksmit from «Total Recall», to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> --The «Choice" theme. I do not know where it started in the genre (perhaps «Ghostbusters»), but it is used here is pretty good. He even reduced to 7 games against death -. Armadillos and the club <br /> <br /> --Film of self, even the presence in the game against death (Clue). It's smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Note the Premier magazine cover at the end: "Bill and Ted:. The Movie» ironic as well as death Nomolos were the villains in the sequels in «Die Hard» and "Lethal Weapon." <br /> <br /> I still have some minor nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and film different mediums, so it makes no sense why many scenarios revolve around the former - especially adolescents market. Carlin is a great comedian, but in these films, it is wasted. In addition, for all the brave effort to show it, even crack gay jokes, they can not kill the cat? <br /> <br /> Thus, despite the similarity of the Nickelodeon production, it is incredibly interesting. With this film we have Beavis and Butthead. "We are in heaven, and we just robbed three people.» <br /> <br /> The final analysis of the average range = Material
