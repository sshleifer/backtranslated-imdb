One of the most underrated films I've seen in a long time, Bill & Ted Bogus Journey is the second hilarious adventure Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, he's Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to look at this film: First, you see the dumb dialogue, contrived plot, juvenile idea. OR .. you can see brilliantly exaggerated idiots who once again find themselves in a situation too much for their brains. Throw Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar in this story, and it becomes a big blockbuster. Bill and Ted go down in history with the same level of sincerity, but Bill and Ted. This is a difficult fence to balance, but if you are watching a movie, not as disposable eccentric comedy, but as an adventure involving the two, who have no business being on an adventure, it becomes a lot more.
