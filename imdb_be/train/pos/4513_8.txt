Child with ideals, who is trying to change things around. The boy, who is forced to become a man, because of the system. System who hides the truth, and who violate the rights of existence. The boy, who, inspired by Martin Luther King, stands up and tells the truth. A family that is falling apart, and the fight against it. The film can not hide from. You see things and you hear things and you feel things you until death will hopefully never been real. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, the parents, who can do nothing, and the boy with, I'm sorry, the balls, the boy who would not accept the things that will not let anything happen to him, the child with the force, and the child, which behaves as a professional, he never did anything else, he caries the movie to the end, and everyone who wants to see how the abuse has found a place back in the 60'ies.
