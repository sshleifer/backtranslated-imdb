As you probably already know, Jess Franco a prolific guy. Hes made hundreds and hundreds of films, many of which are crap. Nevertheless, he was able to penetrate the operating time of the quality of all assembly line operation. "Succubus" is not his best work (it will be either "Devil doctor the Z" or "lesbian vampire"), but has many of its brands, which make it a must for those interested in diving in his large catalog. It combines the erotic (alternating between showing full frontal nudity and leaving something left to the imagination) and seamless surreal. This is a very fabulous film full of great atmosphere. I especially liked the constant name-dropping. Despite the meeting as an incredibly pretentious, it's funny to hear all the influence of Franco. <br /> <br /> However, there are many users who do not like "succubi" and I can see where they are coming from. His leisurely pace, but I can handle it. More problematic is the incompatibility. The scenario here is obviously rushed, and within five minutes I had the movie not the slightest idea about what is happening (and it was never agreed with this point). Those who want some substance of which style, look elsewhere. In addition, when a horror film, it never gets really scary or suspenseful. Nevertheless, I entertained all psychedelic nonsense, I do not mind these major disadvantages too. (7/10)
