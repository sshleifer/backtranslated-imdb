This is a great movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, where chaos theory summarized, referring to the wings of a butterfly, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug all about it (or at least something, do not worry, this is not a spoiler) I'm not the religious type and do not believe in the doomed things, fate, etc., but this film certainly makes you wonder if a match does exist ... <br /> <br /> moreover, the current and the camera is excellent, too, has to prove that it is still possible to do good movie without a zillion bucks
