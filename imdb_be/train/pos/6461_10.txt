Firstly, I was caught completely off guard early lyricism of the film, and then I became quite fascinated with the story unfolds and engrossed with brilliant directing. The characters were well developed, larger than life, but just as the people we live among any place we are in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all quite believable people with disabilities and nobility. Hollywood could learn so much from this wonderful film. This shows that there is no need to go into every detail of every action to bring the whole topic clear and bright, and it shows the director shine! Hearfelt thanks Kay Pollak and an excellent cast for this wonderful fun !!
