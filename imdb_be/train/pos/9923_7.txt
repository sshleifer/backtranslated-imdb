I read some mixed reviews and some of them are downright trashed the film. Initially, I was interested in this project because it was directed by Tony Scott and I became very interested in his work after the man on fire such a profound impact on me. Before I begin my review, let me say that it's ... it's nice to see that this film could be said in a dull and ordinary way, but the authors and Scott chose a different approach. <br /> <br /> story: <br /> <br /> Simply put, it is not boring. Most Hollywood movies give a "true and" sites that they know will communicate with people, often providing the recognition of film audiences and creating a higher probability of profit. This story has been one of the more interesting ones I've seen in a while. Just for reference, I recently watched "The Weather Man" and "Lord of War," and while I would say that these movies are wonderful, and I enjoyed both of them immensely, and plots of these films are boring, and they say exactly how you would expect them to say. They do not take any chances at all, and they are very predictable once you've seen a sufficient number of American films. Dominoes is an interesting plot and told in a manner that keeps you thinking, "Oh man, they're in trouble now." And I feel that it is not enough in many recent films. He has a lot of depth to it, in my opinion, and gives you a lot of things, to question while watching. In general, this is what kept me so interested in the film <br /> <br /> The characters :. <br /> <br /> I felt that the characters were accurate. Knightley has done an excellent job displaying a beautiful woman, who was anything but on the inside and would be viewed as what it was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove to myself, and she took it, which means that it had to achieve this. <br /> <br /> Choco was also very believable, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reaction to the lack of Domino attachment and his jealousy issues within the team ... they call me faithful, that made me feel, that his character that much more realistic. <br /> <br /> character Rourke was the least interesting to me, but it still rang true to me. He seemed like a regular guy trying to make ends meet. I hope that this is what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with it, because that's what I got out of it. He has done a very good job, showing Ed in Average Joe kind of way that made his mistakes, but still tries to live <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies :. I believe that they have provided a much-needed 'heart' to the story. They were not the only people who are out to get money to buy the Bentley, they were real people who have real problems, and they were looking for other means to achieve this goal. You can empathize with them, because, to them, the disease that the child had a problem there is no other solution. These characters were to show real people who were taken away, however, got into this mess because they need help <br /> <br /> mafia :. They have made the story seem so ominous that can only crowd. And I really liked this part. They also laid the story of the little subtleties that make the story that much more interesting <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210, the children :. <br /> <br /> They provided comic otherwise very serious film, from awkward statements Walken in a continuous reference to the 90210 children have to be former people. Their participation in the film only made it even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> cinematic .... to .... cinema. This is where the film seems to have lost many potential supporters. But, in my opinion, I thought it was a genius, the use of cameras to catch the mood of the current situation has been extremely effective in my opinion. I thought that the method was correctly understood, but can always use improvement, as well as everything else. I like to congratulate and applaud Scott, editor, cinematographer and director of photography on taking some real chances with this film. Not only do they go far and above his presentation, they went much further than that. The use of colors, it is very light and very dark on the condition that "look" film with a sinister and rough look that accurately reflects the life of the crowd, the killer and the less fortunate in such a way as to show that their lives the ISN "t like peach or" pure ", like all the others. If you notice, many times less stress or conflict, there was very little camera tricks, if any. This shows that Scott and his team were trying to achieve something with this view, rather than just doing it for the hell of it. I understand that most people who watched this film did not expect it, and it can cause many of them to fold in this film, but I think it was great that Scott has taken this approach. Hollywood movies have grown predictable and bland. Most of them are shot in the same way, with the same turns. And I am happy that Scott was trying to do something different. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is not for everyone, but to say that is rubbish and has nothing to offer completely missing the point. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I'm glad I spent the money. I would recommend it to all, but I'm sure it will only hit a few chord. I have to agree with the previous poster, when he said that many of those who refuse to see beyond the "scope of MTVÂ» has rated this film, but I think a lot of people will. We should all try to enjoy it for what Scott and co. I took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. And with that in mind, I think that he had in spades.
