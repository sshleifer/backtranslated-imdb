Holes great movie to see. It has good messages, such as: not being a good friend, never give up, etc. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I still say that the book is better than the movie, but the film gives the book a run for their money. In addition, Cleo Thomas plays scratch. It really adds to it !!!! Lol !!!
