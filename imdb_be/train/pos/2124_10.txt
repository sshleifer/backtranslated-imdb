It really is a classic film in his story, action and presentation of the film. Excellent actors flit throughout the film, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart be advanced characters. In real life, she is very fond of and loved Jimmy, and really gave him his mostly first acting roles, and helped him become more relaxed with his appearance on the set. "Chemistry" between them has always been obvious, and so warm and nice to look at. She was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality patterns. The story of these two young people, and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch, and a purely magical entertainment. Heart-warming presentation is also provided other support actors in this beautiful story / movie. I always give a cardio Miss Sullivan perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, which has a special attraction for all generations. A must see for everyone!
