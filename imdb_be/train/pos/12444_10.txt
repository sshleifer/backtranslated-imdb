Best Modesty Blaise movie I've seen so far. It's as good a pilot for a TV series. I even think it's a bit of a "cult", both with a lightweight touch of magic Quentin Tarantino, or something. They caught a lot of character of modesty, but I can be absent Willie Garvin bit. Even when I read a lot of comic books by Peter O'Donnell, I'm not disappointed with this film, quite the contrary. Positively surprised by this story about modesty and her childhood. I did not set my expectations so high because of a bad movie from 1966 So, you may have to re-evaluate this film just a few. But if you love comics and other Storys about Modesty Blaise, you must see this! can not wait for the next ...
