Fay Grim is a continuation of the history, started ten years ago with Henry Fool Hartley. I did not see before the film, and I do not know if that's a good thing or not. I can only consider the current film on its own merits. <br /> <br /> For most people, the style of Hal Hartley movie making is something you either like it or not. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry humor ironic really resonates with me and Fay Grim is no exception. It has produced air sharply intelligent parody that he had, and many in the audience laugh Melbourne International Film Festival. In the first half of the film, he was relentless and come with unbroken straight line. It is a style of humor is unfortunately lacking in movie theaters and a welcome relief mindless teen comedies that Hollywood pumps out like pancakes. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the film, the humor begins to thin as morpho film in international espionage / thriller plot. Was it the intention of Hartley or running out of ideas it is not clear, but I think a little editing or rewriting cut fifteen minutes of the film would keep the initial momentum of the film. <br /> <br /> performances were generally good, especially Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had most of his time on the screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina Lovenson all played a good supporting role. Visuals of the film were good (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and music (as Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well written, and I enjoyed it immensely him. If you want to Hartley's earlier work, you'll probably like this.
