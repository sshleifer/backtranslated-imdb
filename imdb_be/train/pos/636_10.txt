Why previews so baa for the film, which is so cool !! Everyone should know that this wonderful film. This is an attractive and fun from the moment one of the original and well-acted. I want to do the film like a good press, as it deserves! <br /> <br /> For all who love The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, both really funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the biggest. Robert De Niro's hysterical. A relative newcomer Charlie Cox is extremely leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic, as always. Michelle Pfiefer makes quite a splash with its latest return to the screen. There are also many beautiful moments of the secondary characters ... until facial expressions.
