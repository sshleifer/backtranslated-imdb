I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic "Casper the Friendly Ghost" cartoon. I picture it was early, since Casper was not looking * right *, as well as Pork Pig does not look * * right in the old 1930s cartoons. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode in the life after the death of the friendly Ghost comes to his friends the young fox Tod, whom he calls Ferdy. I remember that he was glad to see Casper has a friend, as well as those who watched cartoons tend to know that most people run away from it, shouting, "The GhostÂ» <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie's have some fun together while someone it still does not show ... I hate to leave you with a floor-spoiler, but the cartoon lasted only seven minutes, so you can not be too ambiguous. In addition, anyone who reads the cartoon IMDb synopsis can deduce what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> In the end a little bit heartbreaking. In fact, it's probably the saddest thing I've ever experienced watching a cartoon. But this means only that touched me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoons and a lot of others. Or, hell, the fact that I actually remember this cartoon at all because of its emotional impact on me - I have not seen him since. But the cartoon really ends on a positive note, and I was glad to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Second only to Warner Bros. cartoon "Peace on Earth", this is the most I have ever been touched by an animated short.
