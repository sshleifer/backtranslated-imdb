I visited Chesapeake camp. It was located at the head of the Chesapeake Bay in the north-east of the river in the MD. It was this type of summer camp with cabins. It was created Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started as a young camper, and then became a junior, senior adviser, and then, the Waterfront Director. If the camp continued, I would have done everything in my power to become the director of the camp. Unfortunately powers YMCA decided to close the camp and sell it to the state of MD. I visited the former camp a few years later on the boat and was alarmed by the state of neglect of MD and natural destruction of native wildlife. 350 acres of land has served so much with all the benefits of contact with nature offers. Black man named Curtis Ford, and his family were residents and guardians of property. Curtis was a friend and teacher. I idolized him every creature. Even if he could not swim, he was the boatman. If I asked him where the fish are biting, he will appoint a place, and I would have the ball. Ther was also a family camp in the late summer. These memories will be with me forever.
