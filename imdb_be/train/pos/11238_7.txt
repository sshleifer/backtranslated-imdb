Hidden Frontier fan did a show in Star Trek world. The story takes place after the Voyager returned to the Delta Quadrant. It has a few characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them is an original show. The show takes place at Starbase Deep Space 12 and several spacecraft, which gives him the official show are not able to. The symbols have the opportunity rising in the hierarchy of the characters in the show with only one ship has. The show has a good computer animation of spacecraft, but acting is happening in front of a green screen, and it gives a green glow around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most of them are fine. Episodes are driving character and characters evolve over the episodes. It's a bit more like a Babylon 5 than in most of the official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier takes the taboo that even the official series clenched in use. In general, I enjoyed watching it.
