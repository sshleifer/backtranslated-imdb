Gorgeous Barbara Bach played by Jennifer quickly, a television reporter, who travels with his crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) in Solvang, California, to cover the Danish Festival. The problem lies in the fact that their position has failed and all hotels in town is full. So they travel out of town in a remote location and to take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (Sydney phenomenal Lassik). Do not you know, Ernest, and good-natured partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) hiding a big secret in its basement: pitifully deformed, diaper-clad "Junior" (Stephen Furst, in a great performance) that ultimately terrorizes women. <br /> <br /> tasty crazy Lassick plays a monster in this disturbing little horror film. He is slowly but surely building an intense confrontation / menopause, Sun providing the horror in small doses until the last half hour. Hotel and foreboding basement - large echoes "Psycho" here - great setting. Most of all, an insidious plot includes incest and patricide, allowing the film to take on a truly dark quality. And yet it becomes bitter, as we understand, the youngest is not a one-dimensional evil dominant, but as much a victim as the girls. The last frame is particularly sad. <br /> <br /> Â«Invisible" is a solid little horror film worthy of discovery. <br /> <br /> 8/10
