I just watched it on Turner Classic Movies Last night, for the first time ever seen him, and I loved it. I like a lot of old movies, particularly because of the lack of profanity and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most contemporary films. I also think that they have been made much better in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart special favorite of mine. I just thought that this film was a lot of fun to watch, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you feel the same way about the old movies, I do not think you can go wrong with it. I believe that the "You've Got Mail" is a remake (though a bit different and very enjoyable film.) This is a movie. For a relaxing evening with a movie, you should not be shy, if your children or who walks on your view, to get it, or catch it on one of the classic movie channel.
