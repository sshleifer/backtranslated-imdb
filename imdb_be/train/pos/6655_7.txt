This is one of the best Indian films I've seen lately, instead of a cheesy song and dance or slum dog movies. All the actors have shown the right emotions at the desired intensity with the right time. This is a sign of a good film that will make viewers come back and explore a subject that is exactly what I did check on Harilal. I always love the subtle style of actor Akshay Hannah and I wondered if he had a rather difficult relationship with his own father Vinod Khanna, though not as dramatic as Gandhi wondering how it helped him to essay this character. I was impressed by the direction and the 2 thumb up for Anil Kapoor to produce such a cool movie.
