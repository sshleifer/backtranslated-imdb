Thief in the night you have to be the best of all time end thriller. I have no idea what people are complaining that people complain about when they say that these films scared them in making God. They just had to find an excuse and accused thief in the night. Do not listen! These films do not just say, one of the many features of sadness, but they are also fun to watch in its simplicity. They really low budget, and it's a bit obvious, but not too obvious at the first viewing. I had no idea, because I really suggest that a lot of films, as is done in the 70 years include the low level of budget constantly. <br /> <br /> thief in the night tells the story of a young and cynical Patty Myers, who lives for whatever comes her way, while her husband, and almost all of its members disappear in a prophetic ecstasy all warned her about. First, the film is not all based around it, until there is no ecstasy. What this leads to show that all the others around it are Christians and believe in Christ, which is usually what happens with a lot of people. All around them, they once knew and loved disappear forever, and those who left the one who blames everyone but himself. No one can ever blame yourself, because they are always right. <br /> <br /> Just as those whiners who complain about the film. These people need to be full-grown adult. I'm thirteen, and you do not see me whining, especially because I was just like Patty, before I again accepted Christ into your heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a bit of everything thrown in a Christian film instead of stereo-typical all other wrong movies than you will enjoy a thief in the night. Do not knock before you try. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.
