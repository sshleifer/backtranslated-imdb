If you purists, do not waste your time - otherwise, hold on to your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I've seen it dozens of times, but this film is just as good, but different. I will not detail the differences, because it can spoil the film. Also, it's nice to see again Alison Doody (I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Swayze well as Quatermain and the supporting cast is superb. I believe the quality of the carrier dropped a trademark stamp production, and this film was no exception. Cinematography gorgeous and assessment is improved. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
