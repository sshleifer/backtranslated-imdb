Old Film fans will know why I would call this "people in a gray flannel robe." Most of the films based on the Bible, mainly schlock-, that can bring a smile and giggles here as hell trying to raise awareness on the different psychological and social problems, with a spear bearing Neanderthals all about it. The Big Romance, it falls flat like cakes. But there's something gripping about this movie. With all the big Hollywood pictures of the Bible is most clearly conveys the average American dual attitude towards the faith in the biblical God. Thesis Billy Sunday is duking it out with the antithesis H.L. Menken throughout the script. Who gets the best of him in the Heavenly Chorus backs synthesis depends on your point of view. In addition, D & B has good performances Pekka (especially in the final repentance scene) and Jayne Meadows as his bitter first wife, Michal, bright, oppressive atmosphere (a good idea to install the most active at dawn or at night), and exciting performance of the twenty-third at the end of the psalm.
