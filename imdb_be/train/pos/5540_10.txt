Firstly, this film seems to be so bad that I almost fell into a trance for the first time I saw it.It was like a bad dream.A space bore.But I gave him a second chance, then another and another, etc. . ... in the end I'm addicted to this film, because of its fabulous slow pace, excellent natural sets, bathed in the soft autumn light, and especially the score, which is made out of a '70s progressive rock and absolute elegant folk songs actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lam (Troubadour) .You should see the song of walnut wood, silver, trout and ladies disappear into thin air ... heard in the middle and towards the end of this film.There are some bodily scenes in the beginning, Wich allow to appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki.If, that the film was made by some "repertoire" directors like Bergman, Lars von or Jean triers-Luc Goddard, critics would have rolled on the floor, raved about the film, as if it were a space masterpiece.I personally I think that this film is one million times greater than any of Fellini's cinematic w # Â¤ @ T! Definitely not for the pretentious.
