I've never been a supporter of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. It was really weird in this movie. Emotions she must have been shot retake after retake entirely bare thinking about. It was very difficult to watch a movie, the subject of strongly unpleasant, and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity. I really feel that all this is somewhat lowered when her friends returned to the house, and I did not find the conclusion of all believable. The director seemed very keen to use the height of his shots and loved by a mirror reflection, I believe that he should pay more attention to the pace in the second half of this part. I'm sure it makes a hell of a powerful piece of theater, the movie for me, even though he is worthy, just not justified.
