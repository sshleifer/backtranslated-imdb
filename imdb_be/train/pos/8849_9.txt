Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently, has its act together) and Hank (obviously not his act together) need the money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get the dough, which will have consequences for the entire Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This film delivers. This layered, full-blooded roller coaster that knows exactly what she's doing. As crime drama / thriller, I'd like to compare it to the 'old topic. While both films have have an adequate supply of the drama characters and thrills, "The Devil" is more on the side of a thriller because of its fast pace. "No Country" is not colder and darker film that you really admire, while the "devil" is a bit more enjoyable. There is certainly less violence in "The Devil" than "No Country. Steps also provides. Ethan Hawke, sometimes made of wood in the past, it brings fear, sweating, and deer-in-headlight-look at the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman like Andy, is the hardest scenes of the film and quickly becomes an actor who you think can do something. <br /> <br /> There really is not much wrong with this film. He jumps back and forth, not . confusing future events spiral out of control, but the film never does - writing (first-timer Kelly Masterson), directing (in eteran Sidney Lumet) and editing to remain tight as a drum. In many categories, an award-caliber stuff, though perhaps such films as «The Departed» and «No» Country squeezed it to mean. If you like what you'll like it.
