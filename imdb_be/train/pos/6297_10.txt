My friends and I were just discussing how disappointed we are with the way movies, especially romantic comedy's done. We take offense at the schlock that Hollywood serves these days as they act like everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Well, not all is well ... except for a few bright spots, like this film. He has no great actor name, a big budget, I do not think it was a big release (I rented a Hollywood video) is really has nothing that most big-budget romantic comedy is. <br /> <br /> But this is what most of this shortcoming. It was a great chemistry between love interest, "Parker» (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam» (Alison Eastwood). Their love story has not been imposed on us, like so many. The director took the time to allow these characters to really know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorite, "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> supporting cast are added not only very funny comedic moments, but the depth of history as well. character James Legros was absolutely priceless. Sam gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his colleagues in the psychic hot line was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I remembered how great it feels to fall in love.
