This documentary, I stumbled by chance on the channel UK TV More4, and I must say that I found it very interesting and thoughtful. I too am looking for a book that was the source material for this documentary. Basically it is the theory of Professor Jared Diamond on why some parts of the Earth flourished society and others did not. The argument he presents was new to me and argued that, as a condition of correct and proper animal cultures where able domesticated, of course, is a compelling one. As for the documentary is well-shot and well-narrated with not a lot of restored scenes that spoil a lot of contemporary documentary film. Diamond also helps without being condescending to which is the fault of many intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses. People have argued that his theory is a Marxist, but I do not buy it and see it more socially geologist. It was also refreshing to hear a theory of the evolution of society, not based around religion. It is highly recommended viewing.
