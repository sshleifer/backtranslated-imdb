Director Sirko kills again with this, Grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This magnificent, trash saga masterpiece, perfectly combining all the elements soapers Sirk and strategically placing them all in one movie. "Written on the Wind" is very obviously influenced the 1980s TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty", as it's basically a full-length version of these late night soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, beautifully and subtly played by Lucy Moore, New York secretary who marries oil tycoon, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet but sexy secretary. They all go back to the family house of Kyle, Texas, where we meet him white trash whore-at-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in the Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! Sparks begin to fly - from ballads to Boyko, it's old-fashioned trip. Not only that, Mitch has to contend with the feelings he has for the wife of his best friend, but Marylee trying to sleep with anyone, as it can not be her one true love that Mitch. Topping it all, Kyle learns that he is impotent, but somehow Lucy ends the pregnancy. <br /> <br /> This is a pure soap and clean melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film shows one of the most popular of Universal movies and one of the best works in the Cirque director. Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors thrown in different directions - the theme of wind across large. Acting big, although Bacall fully underloaded despite getting top billing over the Hudson. Loss Oscar Stack reportedly devastated him. He thought it was his best performance, and apparently was not too pleased to lose. And he got a fabulous performance as an alcoholic whimper. What a great movie! This film proves that I thought for centuries - Sirk is a master of classic melodrama. Where his Oscar? <br /> <br />
