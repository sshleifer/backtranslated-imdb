The first time I saw a trace of this in the DVD HiFi show Nov 2006 in London (I was not really in a cream so far !!). It is thanks to the high end Arcam system, it sounds great with dts.I should get this DVD and let me tell you, this is definitely the most exciting music DVD I've ever watched.The cream performance at their age simply stunning sound quality and the best I heard music DVD.It does not matter what type of music you like, this is one to be determined to grow on you.It is obvious brilliance of their performance, which will allow you to watch it again and again.Even new music does not cut the mustard in these days, as these old rockers.
