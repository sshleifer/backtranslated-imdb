This is the story of the case docudrama Linda Chamberlain and look at is the impact on Australian society. This is especially looking at the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectations when dealing with real-life drama. <br /> <br /> One issue deals with the story as it is expected, people will give you the same emotional response to a similar situation. Not everyone goes into the wild hysteria melodramatic to every serious crisis. Just because the characters in the film and television act in a certain way there is no reason to expect real people to do it. This is especially likely for journalists and news editors, who seem to be looking for more tearful scene that will pull ratings. This is a question that needs to be constantly addressed. <br /> <br /> The Chiefs are playing characters with depth, a special and sensitive. And they are ably supported by a large cast of all playing individual, based-on-fact. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story people are more known comedians in Australia. He again impose its view that the comedians are doing some of the best supports in dramas, as with comedy they know how to install a quick impression of the individuals. <br /> <br /> (! Spoiler) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very private here; that I actually former Adventists, who was a practicing member in Australia at the moment of the incident; so I have a little different impression from stories than most. I think that it is handled with surprising creativity and personality, and the emotional heart. I think the best scene is the one where the couple as harried new choppers. He captured the theme of the history brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Once I heard Fred Schepsi said in an interview that he told the actors to "play at the best of their character they could." Although it is particularly suitable for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should be applied to all the action as well.
