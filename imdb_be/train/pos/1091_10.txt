I loved this movie. I first saw it when I was 20 (it was only four years ago), and I liked so much, I brought my own copy of the next day. Comedy is well played by all participants. I always rewind and rewatch the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found the water to 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also look for Jason Robards father, who plays Mr. push. Talent ran in the family.
