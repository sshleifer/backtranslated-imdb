This documentary makes you travel around the world. It contains rare and wonderful sequels from the desert. It shows how diverse and how fragile our planet can be. The future of the polar bear will be highlighted at the beginning and the end. In the end, his bleak future is closely linked to the effects of global warming. The documentary, however, is a simplistic approach such a serious environmental problem. Nevertheless, it can easily be seen by young children, as it has remained largely descriptive. Scientists may well be disappointed, because this is not a remake of the film "An Inconvenient Truth," Al Gore, but to be honest ... that the description !!! The question may then arise: Is not it worth preserving the beauty of our world? Since this film proves that in 2007 such beauty still exists, in spite of various pollution. Living in cities, we tend to forget that we are part and parcel of this nature. All things considered, this film reminds us that we have a common treasure called "Earth".
