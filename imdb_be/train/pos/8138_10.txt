CB4 was horrible, but it may have given him a better idea Cundieff. More Spinal Tap, than anything else, the film is smart from the start. He surprised those who saw him back in the mid nineties. Performances are played for laughs, but not so much that they are cartoon characters, more like the Marx Brothers. These guys are real and a little more diverse. They react to the situation, as any of us can. Well, we can not throw a tantrum when our hats performance late for a concert, or pull the gun and beat down Exec record company, but you get the picture. N (n *** a) W (a) H (hats) takes itself seriously enough to reel you, you are hooked. to rent or to get it at any cost, even if you do not really rap music, it still leaves you gassing aloud. Comparing this CB4 as a comparison with Star Wars Gil Gerards'Buck Rogers, George Lucas, I think you see my point
