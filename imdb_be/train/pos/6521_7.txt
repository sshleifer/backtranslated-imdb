Taken in the context of the time it was done, I found that this is a worthwhile film. Although the details may be "dramatized", a common history was a good primer. In addition, I found the spot I knew the actors a real pleasure. Who would have guessed that Ben Cartwright as a mean-spirited lout? I will leave the rest of the star spot for you. As for the secondary casting, this film (as one would expect from a film made in the late thirties) has a lot of pleasant character actor, but kudos to the top of the right hand of Andrew Jackson Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with beautiful courts and competent actions on all of, I recommend it for anyone with a taste for a little camp, or eye for a double portion of the period set in the early days of America, and made at the time when the big names and top actors expression of character, were a pleasure to use.
