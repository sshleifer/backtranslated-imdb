I found this film quite by accident, but I'm glad that I did. performance of Kenneth Branagh was close to stealing the film with Helen Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie. This film is brought to memory the wonderful films that Branagh, Emma Thompson made. Carter's star turn here as disabled young women seeking to complete itself was a good show, as I saw from the female lead for a long time. Drawing invalid difficult to pull off, but mostly just her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life, she made it so believable. When this movie came out after the current wave of films with beautiful women «uglying» yourself in the role (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I fell confident Carter would have a strong consideration for an Oscar. If you meet this movie on cable late at night when I have, believe me, it's worth the lost sleep.
