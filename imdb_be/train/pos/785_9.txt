I, being of Irish descent, loved this movie, not only was the hot guy and funny, he was also a sincere and honest. I liked a girl, he fell in love with it, she was beautiful. They're such a cute couple. The ending was so sad. I love this movie! Although it is a bit dirty, it is reminiscent of the British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie you have to watch the Prime Minister. Same story line of a young man falls for older women, older women, falls for a young guy. Many paths cross, in the end, the best solution is adopted, or the task is completed. I have nothing else to say without destroying the whole movie, all I thought that French guy was ugly and less appealing to me. Hmmm ... if you like Irish films, I would recommend the "Circle of Friends" that the movie so well. Quick quote, you can not get if you do not watch "well, here is my dinner spoiled.Â» LOL
