GBS wrote his own adaptation of the winning game of the Nobel Prize, but did not live up to its production (he won an Oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 play Pygmalion). If Preminger set (producer and director) is the production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he noted British author Graham Greene to make adaptations, and it was a good choice. <br /> <br /> Taking a cue from Shaw own script, Greene uses material from the epilogue stage to create a framing device to merge two pieces act (one early and one late in the history of Joan) in single and most satisfying around. If in step tone shift buffer with intermission, here it works just as well, with a return to the bedroom of King Charles Balois (where people put on the throne Joan dreams of events that led to his current situation), and more material with an epilogue Shaw. - the introduction of Warwick in the shadows of John Gielgud (English "king-makerÂ») <br /> <br /> Most of language is solid GBS, and the performance of tall Shauvians (eg, Felix Inquisitor Aymler or Harry Andrews de Stogumber) relative newcomers (film set a career Jean Seberg in) the first year. It can shake some only familiar with many villains Widmark movie, see how he played the gentle and somewhat silly Dauphin, but performance - amazing top bills - is a professional, even if it is possible <br /> miscast <br />. the symbolism of the opening credits and director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white shooting are all show and the story well. I go waiting for quality entertainment, and you will not be disappointed.
