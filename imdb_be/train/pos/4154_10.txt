It was one of the best episodes continuously. Officer Sean Cooper was killed in a police car back to 68. The dying prisoner in the state prison reveals that he stole a block of heroin out of the car after the shooting. His case once again on the assumption that it has been damaged as a police officer. <br /> <br /> Its further investigation as a police officer and a person shows a war veteran involved in forbidden love. This type of love is considered shameful and something, at least, to keep secret at the time. <br /> <br /> While it's not the kind of love which I personally support, he was still a policeman and a man and should not 't was killed for it. The sound track was beautiful (keeps me look at the DVR) and the selective use of black and white combined with color to emphasize one object or give a special feeling to the scene was particularly attractive. I will look at this again!
