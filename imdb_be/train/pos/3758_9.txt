This movie is awesome. If it's too serious, of course, you will hate it; However, this is the number of "dudes" and "right" supplements brings laughter and faint memories of 15 years ago. I like his ability to make me a chuckle at the obvious jokes and nonsense, and his ability to make me want to keep track of its predecessor, "Bill and Ted's Great Adventure" (1989). If you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes, and quite mature humor, do not watch; However, if you want a film that with a sense of humor and silly, but smart and attractive, you will enjoy it. I actually want more of this kind of painting emerged in modern cinemas. And hey, it's Keanu Reeves acts like all parodies it, how does ... right ... does not get much better than this :)
