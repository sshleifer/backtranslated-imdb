OK this is how I do it. I Film Class 10 components. Each component will essentially start with 5 points. Then he may lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10, or 0. <br /> <br /> Mood: Action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense - I give this component 10 points. It was the perfect balance of all five aspects. Action was fun and exiting. Romance is not exaggerated, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed long and hard throughout the film, and so far I have been fascinated by the fantastic drama and thrilling suspense <br /> <br /> The plot -. I give this component is 10 points. I thought that all good fairy tales have been told. I found myself sitting in the theater, he returned to his childhood, and at the same time, I again believe in unicorns, evil sorcerers and falling stars that make dreams <br /> <br /> Cinema Photos -. I give this component 8 points. While the film has captured the story very well in most of the corners, I found my self not just trying to figure out what happened in the immediate vicinity of the camera <br /> <br /> FX -. I give this component is 10 points. I like that they used C.G.I. economically. Epic scenes were believable. Magical powers were frighteningly realistic. In general, the smaller the better, and that was all! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and experienced actors, so that the cast was amazing! . Michelle Pfeiffer was amazingly angry, Charlie Cox Tristan revive, Claire Danes gave emotion to the stars, and I will never look and Robert De Niro same again <br /> <br /> duties - I give this component is 10 points. Even novice actors played their rolls to perfection. Again, I'll never watch, and Robert De Niro same again <br /> <br /> character development -. I give this component 9 points. It was a bit rushed, and I think that if the film was little more they could do a little better the character justice <br /> <br /> Dialogue. - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was clever, witty, funny ?? even gruel was good dialogue <br /> <br /> Evaluation -. I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the film. I'm not complaining, but what music can be more memorable <br /> <br /> Ending. - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect end! I feel that some aspects of the end should be more pronounced, while others might be more muted, but none of the streams are not left isolated <br /> <br /> Total :. 93% buy DVD? HEL YES! Look at the theater? Most definitely! Result: A great movie for everyone! EPIC! I highly recommend seeing it in the theater, I know that I will be going back for seconds!
