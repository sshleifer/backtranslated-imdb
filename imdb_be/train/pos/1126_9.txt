My concern has been raised, as I was flipping through and saw the name of Iphigenia. My name is Eugene, so I thought, well, let's see what it is. I'm so glad that I stayed on the channel. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some on top of the action, but a great time to be had. I watch it, and it makes me sad for all the nonsense the film industry produces, and these wonderful little gems get transferred. Iphigenia Give a try, and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. I even got my kids (27, 25, 20 and 17) in order to enjoy it. He starts slowly, however, the drama builds, and you will be shown in this story. Watching this wonderful movie made me want envelops more than a Greek tragedy and pathos.
