Its time to pay tribute to the great Charlton Heston after his recent death, but this film is not the only one. His other films of the last generation were Ben Hur, ten COMMANDENTS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET Monkey was his best work. <br /> <br /> This film, shot in 1973, attempts to prophesy the future of the earth in 2022, so crowded that the human race has been manipulated authorities universally produced food product called «Soylent Green», which is made from human flesh . It's strange and implausible movie was funny at the time of its release as it is now, and suggests the population of India, which will be about 2 billion this stage will then meat eaters, not knowing about it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston's character SuperS this secret international conspiracy that world powers have come up to meet the nutritional needs of overpopulation via cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the producers of the film Green messages they deliver Sun Green Party today ethos thank God. Sun cannibalism practiced the indigenous population of New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo until only 40 years before the film was made, but it has long refused to human civilization. <br /> <br /> Another silly forecast in the film, that women become sex slaves quasi turning back of radical feminism, which has been on the rise in 1972, when this film was made. <br /> <br /> the movie was stupid then, and how silly now, but it does contain a very unmemorable last film appearance in the late and great Edward G. Robinson, but there is still no valid reason to reconsider the film, except for scientific purposes . <br /> <br /> This is a hopeless film, and I do not even recommend it to Baby Boomers or fans Charlton Heston. All the other reviews of this film, I read all sound the same with reference to the dystopian future society in which the central theme seems to only involve the United States, where there was an ecological disaster. <br /> <br /> the only merit of the film is that the land does face overcrowding.
