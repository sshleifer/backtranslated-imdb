It's actually a clockwork-clean film, made on a budget does not differ in the fraction crinkliness video. It takes a while to warm up to him. Actions so bad that soon becomes Zen charm. After a few scenes, you cease to notice the awkward line or sound rehearsed some supplies. all symbols of development brisk charm, especially "Richard." Forget Anthony Hopkins, Dev guy I would hire to play raving psychopath. He just seems to like it so very much! Interspersed with scenes of mad-slasher gore and zombie invasion some really visually effective images of the hero title, «The Midnight Skater» scaling of the campus in a black hoodie, looking for all the world like a cross between death and, say, The Silver Surfer . These images sometimes do stupid things the characters say about Skater seems almost sinister. The soundtrack has some very funny ringtones Garage-Punk and raspy, hoarse meanness it blends well with the mood of the film. Thumbs upish, I say.
