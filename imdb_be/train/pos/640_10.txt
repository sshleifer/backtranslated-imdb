my sister and I saw the Prime Minister last night ... it was so good that we were all glued to it .. hahaha..i thinks I'm hooked for the season !! .... they have some really good actors in this thing .. head coach and fellow player who loves Pete were very good and the plot has got me, but I do not understand how they keep it stretched the whole season .. there probably will be some great twist tho..i can not wait until Tuesday .. finally Sumpter who is he? I can tell he's going great !! it was soo good, we fell in love with his character at once .. I can not wait for the next episode .. Jeremy the GO! <br /> <br /> "Aimee
