I really liked this film when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel hope about life in general, and the people too ... one of the things that I love movies Kezdany. In addition to positive emotions from the film, there are other reasons to like the Grand Canyon. On the one hand, he has a wonderful actor ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. On my view, Crash, very famous film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very similar to the film. The difference lies in the fact that the Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I would choose the Grand Canyon for a collapse any day.
