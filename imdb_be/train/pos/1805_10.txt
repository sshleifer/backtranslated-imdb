I just saw this movie, I first saw it when I was 7, and he could only remember the end. so I watched it like 10 minutes ago, and (I may sound like a child, as I 12 go-go), I started to cry in the finals, I forgot how it was boring. I think I was mostly sad for Anne-Marie, because she said: "I love you, Charlie," and "I'll miss you, Charlie, just made me really cry haha. it has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie worth seeing. SEE IT ha ha, that's all I can tell XD <br /> <br /> But, I love this movie, his true classic. <br /> <br /> th th Maverick 10/10
