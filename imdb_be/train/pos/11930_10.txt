This movie was pretty good. I'm not really a big fan of baseball, but it's the film that was made to help you understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr. brought by a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport. The plot was plausible, and I love the message. William Dear and the guys put together a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports films revolve around real-life stories or events, and they often do not work well. But this film strikes 10 on a scale of perfection, even though there were a few minor bugs here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
