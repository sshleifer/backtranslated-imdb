The first time I came to the delirium, I just heard. I listened to all the comedic performance and I have never laughed so much in my life. Eddie ability to draw funny pictures in our minds and do a great imitation of bribes. When I finally see him perform this action, I had to have. performance of Eddie Murphy Delirious to show his genius! With it being in the new millennium, his actions in 1983, as ridiculous today as it was then. My parents loved it as a teenager and I (age eighteen) love it. From that moment on, I had to look for other Murphy films such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
