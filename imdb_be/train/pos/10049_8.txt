I am not a father, nor I am a man. But I was able to identify with the heartache and pain of each character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie teens should look. Maybe so, they again begin to appreciate the importance of the family. I really feel sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing. And it's great to see the 19-year-old Ben Affleck gives his best in a moving and sincere performance. He showed an early age that he is able heart of the drama. It should be offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland ... his first major role in years, and he went out and won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This film can be evaluated by people of all ages. Maybe it is not necessary to look at children under the age of 10, because they are afraid that the same thing could happen to their families, but I would recommend it as a family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched it with my friends many times. Because it reflects the values ​​that are important in life.
