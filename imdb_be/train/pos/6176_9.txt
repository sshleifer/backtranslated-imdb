1986 TV movie The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series. However, the Creator Spirit Eisner did not like the film, and therefore, not a series produced. I thought that it was a very interesting film and captured the spirit (sorry) comic modern twist. I regret that did not materialize in the series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was an excellent spirit. Nana Visitor was good Ellen Dolan and, of course, would later go on to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine years later. Perhaps with the release of version on the big screen of Frank Miller's The Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare gem history of the spirit. It seems that when Hollywood makes a film with an already established character or ideas, someone inevitably finds a previous version of the object and release it on video to make a few dollars. If Antonio Banderas donned the mask of Zorro, we were able to get an earlier version of the masked hero on DVD, such as a large version of Alain Delon 1970 (although all copies I have ever seen were heavily edited). Heres hoping someone will release a TV adventure DVD Ghost in the near future.
