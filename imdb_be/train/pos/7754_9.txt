Any way the wind blows He Barmans (which is also known as the frontman of the rock «Deus») debut film. Shot entirely in Antwerp (Belgium), the film opens on Friday morning and the sun slips rather superficially between the events that fill the day, a dozen main characters. When the movie ends, you have a lot of things to think about, because most of the different storylines wide open. <br /> <br /> The film has a (purely instrumental) track that will rock your socks off. In most scenes, the music really enhances the overall atmosphere and feel really makes the film look hallucinations at some point in time. The main scene in the movie, party, very good shot. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use methods of video clips that have their main characters dancing in one of the best tracks I've heard in recent times. <br /> <br /> scenario excellent material. Camera angles and the color is very well chosen. In the "costumes" are very hot and very "seventies", too. And I love (most) activities. <br /> <br /> What I really liked in the film, are subtle touches of the absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor, which alternate. <br /> <br /> no claim to comedy (this film is certainly not a comedy, but rather an alternative to a work of art), it still manages to have his audience chuckling and even laughed a few times. <br /> <br /> This is one more debut directors that should not be the end. I hope I see you again, Tom Barman in future movies because I had a good time. Greetings.
