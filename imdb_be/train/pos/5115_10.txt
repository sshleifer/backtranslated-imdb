I have not seen this movie in the cinema. I admit a bias anti-Vinnie Barbarina. Who the hell was John Travolta will star in a movie? I remember Oscar broadcast this year, with Travolta looking absolutely devastated when he did not win. How dare he, when they were "real" actors in the race? I'm sorry, John, you have to win. Having caught this movie on cable years ago, I fell in love with the whole film. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, of Wes, all well done. I also admit, never passing it when I surf the channel. I have to stop and stare. Over the years, I learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with my fingers in my belt, and learned to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointment that I had control over the soundtrack, some of the music from the Urban Cowboy. "Looking for love" determine the movie, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics, which were not included in the soundtrack. He was supposed to be a double CD ........
