I remember this game. He always sat on some shelves, until one day I decided to try something new for a change, and got this game. I watched in fear of him, since it was the first game for the PS1, I owned that had 4 drives. When I played, I could not put the controller down, seriously. <br /> <br /> The plot of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as Final Fantasy VII Storyline, and it is difficult to achieve. If you play the game, you get so passionate about the characters, it's incredible, it's just a game PS1, as it feels like a movie. And I believe that it should be made into a film. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this game is very unheard game and almost no one played or enjoyed as it is one of those games, which sit at the end of the shelves, with the sign of the 50% is sitting on it, trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at those at the ends, and try them out, and most of them are very good. Heck, that's how I got into the Final Fantasy VII, looking at the directory and find it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> The Legend of Dragoon, is the only game or RPG, it's better than most games Square Enix, surprisingly. I would not be surprised if it was done Square Enix, but it is not. Hardly any game I'm playing better than Final Fantasy series, or series Dragon Quest, but this one is. But what really bugs me is why very little is known and praised what it should be. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty good for the PS1 games, but what can you expect from him? It PS1 people who made history in 1999, I have already mentioned Surprisingly, almost beats VII. Symbols are amazing, you get involved so much with them and their actions. <br /> <br /> A definite 10 out of 10. Definitely deserves more praise, and very well done RPG another company than Square Enix,
