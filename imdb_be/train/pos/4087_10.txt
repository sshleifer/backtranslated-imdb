I must say, I thought I saw it all. I'm very jaded movie buff. This film is not shocked me, by any means. I'm way past that point. But it is to me a certain emotional places I do not know, I could go. I had no idea I could find (IR) beastiality erotic idea. Never ever ever. Ever. Ever. But there you go. He did it. I have to give credit to the director. He pulled it out. <br /> <br /> During the first 40 minutes of this film is TOTAL hole. We begin with some very obvious shots of two horses who have sex. Five minutes later, I began to wonder, if you buy this film was not a mistake. Then the old man in a wheelchair is talking to some other old marry about two people. Then some nervous guy shaves. Then we see (briefly) hot chick gets it the butler (but it is very short). At this point, I cursed out loud the film, trying to sleep. In fact, I fell asleep about 40 minutes, and forced myself to finish it the next night. <br /> <br /> We finally get the good stuff, when the girl (who knows who she is, or does anyone have in this movie) is the dream of the Victorian era Goals being ravaged by a beast-thing in the woods. The scene goes on for some time, and it's really the meat (hehe) the entire transaction. It is beautifully filmed, superbly edited, and do not deliver the goods. They are trying to wrap up the story at the end, and it kind of makes sense, but probably not. Oh, well. I would definitely recommend this film. The first 40 minutes I wanted to shoot myself (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes completely buys.
