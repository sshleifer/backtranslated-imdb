I was not expecting much, and frankly, I do not like this movie for the first time, but watch it again, and I realized that it's cool. Of course, this is one film a joke, but it's funny gag. <br /> <br /> Someone wrote that it may be better to write, and it can be. I think that this film had the potential to be a top-of My Cousin Vinny. But with horror instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately, this is a missed opportunity. With just a little big writing, it can be a classic. Children under-utilized there is no reason why they should withdraw to Elvira. Besides the obvious reasons. It would be great to see their relationship thrive. I know that it's a comedy, but it's the small differences that separate the good from the great movies. <br /> <br /> Elvira itself is always fun and attractive. Not to mention flirtatious. Every time she smiles, you too. It is difficult to break through the film, the main character is so sweet. And it's really her charm, do not let it misleading you into thinking that it is some kind of tart. Well, it is. But it's good. the kind of person you would allow to care for their children. would not have allowed her to cook for them, though ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend to give it a go. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> It is more than just a great set of boobs. It is also an incredible pair of legs.
