<br /> <br /> So, not being a poet myself, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Efforts movement Goldsworthy as he molds the beauty of nature in his work is captivating. See his cane stick together on the web hanging from a tree in close-up for a few minutes while he talks about his work, and then get the win when the camera cuts to a wide shot. You will be surprised by the ease with which it works, and then to realize the futility when the breeze hit by the entire Internet. <br /> <br /> Genius Goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds, as his inspiration from nature itself. It is a substantial change in the nature, where his work, though complete in its own sphere, has regained consciousness.
