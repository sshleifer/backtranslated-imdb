It was a really cool movie. This proves once again that you do not need silly Liv things like continuity and scripts to make the film. It crosses continents in a matter of seconds, people shoot and nothing happens to them, swords arson, samuari fight to sink galleon, David Essex is the epitome of meanness Slimey and John Rhys Davies just a dude. I enjoyed this film, but I like s ** t movies, this is the perfect example of a very s ** t movie that just rips. If you like Battlefield Earth, you will love this film, his daring, his fast, his stupid, it samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It also looks as if it was done in 1972
