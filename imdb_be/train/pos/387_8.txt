This movie is good. This is not the best of the great CG kung fu movie, but it is pretty good. First thing first, the story is really good. The whole idea of ​​the gods against the fallen gods of the transaction type with superpowers pretty cool. My problem Theres too many characters! He got very confused when they passed the scene! The special effects were incredible! The fight scenes were very fast paced and complex. This film almost all computer generated. Acting wonderful, as always expected from such high-profile players. Ekin Cheng makes a great hero, a single character. Zhang Ziyi did not do anything for me in this film. I thought that it would have a big part, but she did a fight scene and a whole bunch of barking. The bad guy, the whole skull army and all the blood cloud that is very scary. The music is also fine. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series, not just one movie. Theres too many stories to cram in 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something, I'd be able to keep up with all the characters and details. This movie is the story of the victim integrity actions. I recommend Storm Riders over this any day.
