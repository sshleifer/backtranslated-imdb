People call it a comedy, but when I just watched it, I was laughing <br /> <br /> only once. I think the problem is that I first saw him when I was 14, <br /> <br /> I was not old enough to understand that it was not to be <br /> <br /> seriously, There were a lot of scenes that were <br /> <br /> to be funny, but I cared too much about what the characters laugh <br /> <br /> them. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love, <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you will find that, in spite of a few stupid <br /> <br /> shortcomings, it is one of the most touching love story you ever saw.
