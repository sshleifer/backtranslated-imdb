Second Bears Care film is very better than its predecessor. It has a deep storyline, character development, and the best tunes (especially the closing song) are vivid and heartfelt. Of course, the film tends to be more stressful than caring, but come on, this is a film Bears Care. This film is the big picture, to show the child, because it emphasizes friendship, love, and again, care. Not to mention the Caring bear is just too adorable!
