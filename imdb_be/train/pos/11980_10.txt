Full House has been and is still a great show. This is a good show for all ages, as well as a good family show. There really is no show like this anymore. Children are very cute and even though it's a little cheesy, it's still good, especially for those who watched it when they were a child. I would like to see cast interviews at this time. Any one who would like to see an interview with the cast, such as the same is now where things like special features DVD, must go to the website and sign the petition place a petition titled Full House Reunion on DVD, as is the application of it in the hope that the cast You may want to do this. Yay for a Full House!
