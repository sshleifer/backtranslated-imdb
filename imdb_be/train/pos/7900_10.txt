I admit the first time I watched Cowgirls even bored, I do not think it was very memorable in every way. But now after watching his 7th time, I recognize that it is very grown on me. Characters Sissi, Ms. Jellybean, and the Countess became very cute. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think that the satirical humor more than makes up for it. Then there's a kick-ass soundtrack that features an extremely talented K.D. Lang (who reminds me a bit of Patsy Cline) at its best. I can not think of any movie, "grown on me" after a sinister first impressions, as well as a Cowgirls.
