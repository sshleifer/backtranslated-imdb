BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This off-the-wall film starring South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.They play two slacker friends who create sports in their driveway, which goes on to become a national sensation. Most of the gags are really fun, but the funny part of the movie, when the players are trying to "psyche" of the other members of the opposing team. There are no rules about what is not allowed, so naturally, they do crazy things possible. One disadvantage of this film is that the pace is too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found the question: "Wow, that on this for" Another fun part of the movie was like Joe and Doug constantly pester Squeak, which It is promoted little guy. BASEketball is a comedy classic with some very Quotable lines, and it is very interesting to watch!
