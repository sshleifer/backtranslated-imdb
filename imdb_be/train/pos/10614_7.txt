Three girls (all-female crew of the media, including the iconic actress Barbara Bach, at least), visiting a small town to cover the festival, eventually rent a room in the home, they should avoid like the plague. Well done little shocker, suffers a bit from some redundant dialogue scenes and a rather thin story line (which is not doing very well hide their secrets). One main theme, in particular, is quite disturbing (eg: Vintage shock materials), and it is basically what the movie is booming. Performances and the cinematography is quite a lot higher than the nominal value (in comparison with many other late 70's 80's films in the same vein / early), but what really makes me recommend this film is quite long climax scene in the basement of the establishment . Since then, as a symbol of «Keller Junior" was introduced, his performance made my jaw drop open and not close to the end of the film. A very pleasant surprise to see the actor Sydney Lassik (which was surprisingly Wacko in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", and is now completely insane in «The Unseen») to take on a leading role.
