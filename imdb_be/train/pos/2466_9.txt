I've never seen four o'clock goes by so fast as when I saw this movie. This film restores the power and art of Hamlet, that it should always be. Even those on the so-known speech made in new and inventive ways. And the cast is incredibly, Brannagh the brightest star. It is his charisma, power and command of the role that defines the film. Making it a full and complete version of the fill so many holes and allows a new understanding of the tragedy, despite its length. Where one would expect a dark, gloomy castle template, we were treated to a feast for the eyes. Only comes from the gloom of Hamlet, as it should be. Well worth your time, all four o'clock it.
