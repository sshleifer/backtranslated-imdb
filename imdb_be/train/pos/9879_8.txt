Presenting Lily Mars, may have provided, Judy Garland with a lighter roles she had while in the MGM, because Lily Mars, of course, the nature of it can be identified. Young girl with talent enough for ten, she knows what it takes to make it in the theater, no matter how much the producer Van Heflin from his hometown scares her. <br /> <br /> I really liked this one Judy, the girl decided to make it in the theater. Because this is Judy Garland Judy Garland with a talent you in the audience know that she has the right stuff, even if it takes Van Heflin almost the entire film, to be sure. <br /> <br /> And Judy and Heflin hails from the same small town, Dad Heflin was an urban doctor who gave it to Heflin and while he may have moved and become a major producer of Broadway, their respective mothers Fay Beynter Bayintonom and keep in touch. This is her entr√©e, but Heflin-x is constantly bombarded with stagestruck children, but never anyone quite like Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> No real hit songs did not come out of Presenting Lily Mars for Garland, although she sings her number. Best in the film is the revival of the Gaslight era chestnut, Every Little movement has a meaning all its own. Judy sings with Connie Gilchrist plays the cleaning lady in the Broadway theater where the show Heflin is currently being produced. Gilchrist was a star back in the days FloraDora girls, and she and Judy put the song in great style with Kony. This is the best scene in the movie, like Gilchrist encouraged Judy to keep at it. Composer Carl Hoshna died a long time ago, but lyricist Otto Harbach was still alive, and I'm betting that he liked what he heard. <br /> <br /> The European musical star in March Eggert in Presenting Lily Mars, as the stars of the show who first stunned, then angry, and finally understanding Garland and Heflin. She made a couple of films with MGM, and then returned to Europe for further work on the continent. I bet, MGM did not know what to do with her and her thick Hungarian accent, although Louis B. Mayer had never met the soprano does not like it. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin also makes the patient's manufacturer, which agrees with a lot of Garland and Eggerth. Heflin simply leaves his Oscar for Johnny Eager last year, he and Garland Sun seems to be the ideal team of the screen, but they are not bad together. <br /> <br /> Presenting Lily Mars is an excellent showcase for the talents of Judy Garland. And it should not divide the screen into another backstage movie with Mickey Rooney.
