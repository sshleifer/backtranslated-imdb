This is a great movie. I sowed, some people think that it can not be based on a true story. Regardless of this !!, the film is excellent, and everything you can think of, is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends with a flight to the city of a mermaid, and so on, instead of thinking that the "desire for a little girl has come true", and that It means that all of our peaceful dreams will come true, if we have faith in us, and do everything in the world to make them true. Little girl (Desi - in the film), and her mother, were the best actors I've seen in a long time. Good as they are, for all participants, all for the director. If someone can tell them this, please tell them, "25-year-old from Romania says thank you for this film."
