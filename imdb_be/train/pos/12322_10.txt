This film is one of my favorites. This genre mixture with ingredients Action- / Horror- / romantic / Comedygenre. Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards. This slight drawback is easily ignored. There is so much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two protagonists are so beautiful that it hurts. Visual and beautiful. Whichever is greater, which is not surprising, she comes from Hong Kong, the home of the best fighters in the world. Humor sometimes seems a bit silly, but in a good way. Anyway, this movie is an opportunity to balance the different moods and continues to be good. Absolutely recommended.
