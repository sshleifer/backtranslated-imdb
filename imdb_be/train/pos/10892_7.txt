What's not to love about this film? Every year, you know what you're going to get one or two Yule tide movies during Christmas, and most of them will be awful. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that pulled pretty good. Very funny take on the rich young man to pay a family, to simulate a real Christmas for him. What's the use of having that kind of money, if you can not do fun things with them. It was a win-win situation. Regular family receives six digits and the rich guy knows Christmas as he had imagined. Only if. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with, and it was just a riot to see the family are reluctant to comply with its absurd demands. It was fun and funny movie.
