Well, I can say that this film really got, it's not so bad for me, as many people say, I really liked it, although the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it is not. First of all, I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it does come with the film. Secondly simple story, and drama Ghost gets your attention. One thing I like most is that they do not give a horse a human voice to interact with other horses, it makes the film more realistic, not a lot of animation, it seems realistic now do they ?, but ... I do not know making animals speak just ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animation in 2002, in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, not just children :), because it is very relaxing.
