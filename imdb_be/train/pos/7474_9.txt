This is one of those movies that are hard to see, do not give out the plot. Suffice it to say that there are strange things, and unexpected twists that occur after the initial surface "screws Tom Cruise around with several women" plot. <br /> <br /> The quality of cast lift this movie above standards, and all actors are well suited for their parts: Cruise as the annoyingly smug playboy who has it all - and then lose it all, Diaz is attractive, but a little crazy abandoned lover, Cruz is an exotic new girl on the scene, and Russell, as a parent psychologist. History includes elements of romance, morality, murder, mystery, suspense and science fiction, and, as a rule, recreational trips. <br /> <br /> I would like to add that the picture is also uniformly excellent and the introduction of various visual metaphors beautiful, once you understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> If you like well behaved movies with twists and suspense, and are willing to take a little weird resolution Dick style, then this is a must see, <br /> <br /> 9/10
