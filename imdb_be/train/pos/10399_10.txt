It was a favorite of my childhood - I remember it on television and addictive to it every time. Now, when I grew up and have a child of my own, I would like to introduce him to this classic film. We have seen this on Friday, and he liked it. During the battle with the giant spider Abu, my son's hand crept up and took my hand - it was really scary. "Is he going to beat the spider, Dad?" Just watch, you'll see. He has no historical reference to talk (eight years), the grandson of Baghdad under Harun al-Rashid, and can also be a Ozmom Oz. <br /> <br /> I think that he is particularly fond of many heroics and recklessness were perfect boy-thief, but not an adult king. In fact, if you are a deconstruction of the narrative of the film slightly, King Koresh thief not a hero at all - that should be very nice creative, enterprising young boys. <br /> <br /> It's definitely part of the period - I suspect that by the time he was eleven or twelve, my son will find it corny "or whatever word the next generation will be used if a little one-dimensional love story -. as a cynical one remarked, "Why Ahmad princess love story Since it requires?". Abu Ready to put yourself in danger (repeatedly) for the ignorant, love deposed king is equally unlikely. But to argue about such things taking flying mechanical horse, and fifty feet gin and Temple all-seeing eye will be meaningless in the extreme. Pleasure to see the prophecies in the climax of the film is enormous, as the last shot of the Abu triumphantly flying it (kidnapping) a magic carpet, searching for "fun and adventure at last!"
