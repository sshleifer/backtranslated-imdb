«That« 70s Show », by far the most fun show currently on television. I started watching it for about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw him, I could tell that it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also a strange character, when he was there, I really hope that he will be back, because he was hilarious. This is a classic when Fez goes "you son of a bitch!" And when Kelso yell "fire!" That always makes me laugh. They are both great character and always has something funny to say. Jackie to be hot just another reason to watch the show; she began to be very good looking, but damn, somewhere around 5-6 season is just really hot. I had seen most of the episodes more than once, some, like 10 times, and still have fun. This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over again, and still laugh just as I did the first time I saw him. Throw a classic; almost all the funny show where many only have a few funny characters. I'll be sad to see the show end of next year, but it will leave the air as one of the best shows ever.
