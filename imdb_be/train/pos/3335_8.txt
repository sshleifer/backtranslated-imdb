The film shocked me. Personally, I had a herd of mostly bad buzz. Well, finally, after the DVD of ownership in a few months, I pooped on him a sleepless night. Although the film does drag more images have been used for the purpose of the seriousness of his passion and his restoration of additions to the game would be less realistic if they left any scene. The best thing about the film is the relationship line. There were no former or never pop characters threaten relations. I mean, as a rule, we see that the girl meets boy some amazing twist of fate, they are, what we have seen the arrival of breaks them up, and then they come together in the last five minutes of the film. but this film does not follow that mold. In fact, we tested the relationship, and it's flaws and although the characters were there moments of anti-love that they do not have a dramatic pause, they were gone and done all the cutting 15 and then reunited in love again. I felt the film was predictable, as the rest of the Romance movies. The story was unique and true reality of how I felt that these people in the film were the most believable that I have seen in a romance film of the modern times.And it does not hurt that all baseball games were real, and they were at the actual world series since fate to brake a little bit there. It is not "My Fair Lady", but it is a brave and honest film. I'll just say I like it.
