Each film critic and metal heads hated this movie, but I liked it. I saw it as a kid on TV somewhere and was struck by the scene where Sammy comes on stage and plays Trick or Treat on Fastway. <br /> <br /> The film itself was a typical '80s, the guy gets pushed around by bullies and recruiting supernatural help beat the bullies, but goes far and should be discarded. <br /> <br /> Matt with Melrose Place takes Skippy by family ties, so Skippy gets a report about Tony Fields of Gene Simmons, to comfort him and all hell loose, set aside time when Toni sings (Lip-sync) and dancing on a metal song to Shyt hit the fan. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of mistakes and things, but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep his fists pumping 8 out of 10
