This is a great documentary. Any fan of racing must have a copy of this remarkable film. Director of "Stephen Lowe" did a great job, as well as the main stars of the film, the father and son, Mario and Michael Andretti. DVD looks and sounds amazing. And best of all it's IMAX! Large home theater test disc.
