<br /> <br /> Presenting Lily Mars is one of the film's genre, which, unfortunately, seems to have disappeared from the studio system. Okay, now that you know my bias, here are some reasons why I think this film really stands out. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) is sent to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of its directors (Van Heflin) is fairly shares the history of the Hollywood period, the authors make a change Thread it up a bit more than usual. Although Lily gets her big break when a star quits, it is not successful and must swallow their pride and return to play a secondary role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) <br /> <br /> 3. The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Bayinton Lily's mother is really lovely, Faye Beynter (directed by her mother - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). Supporting outstanding performance, although there is the character of actress Connie Gilchrist Frankie, once the actress turned theater keeper. <br /> <br /> Worth hours for sure. One of those films that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
