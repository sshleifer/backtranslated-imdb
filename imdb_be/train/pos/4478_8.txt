In general, it is a lovely, relaxing, romantic, musical comedy. I believe small case could be made for the film to long. But I'm not sure if you could cut. Singing Kelly and Sinatra do? No. Fairy dancing, Kelly does? No. the film takes time to develop the story and the characters develop a relationship? Year (it seems to be a common complaint many times that the later films did not develop the character). <br /> <br /> Some of the comments that Iturbi did not bring a lot of movies, but it gives us a chance to see and hear a lot of talent from the 1040s. So what if he was not an actor? He was an important part of the movie as the main plot was to get Grayson listening to him. <br /> <br /> Initially, Kathryn Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test, which included an aria. During her audition in the movie is shot in brass MGM nodded and smiled. You can just imagine it was like that when she was a before made it a real test screen years. <br /> <br /> This film is so full of life, it is difficult to hit all the highlights. More use of color and lighting throughout the film. You can understand why Frank Sinatra became a star, he did. Good counter point in the movie, Sinatra (a womanizer, even then) plays a role in the desire to find a date while on holiday. You will feel good after watching this movie. 7/10
