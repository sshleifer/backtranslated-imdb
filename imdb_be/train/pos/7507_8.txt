Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron accumulates quite a list of films that provide an insight into their particular era. Her previous «I Shot Andy Warhol» and "American Psycho" was at its best, commenting on the quirkiness of society during this period. Although «The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously about Ms. Page, is every bit as much as the peak behind the curtain in the world of kinky photo shoot in the 50s. <br /> <br /> The film is fun to watch from the point of view of history and the technical aspect of how it was made and put together. Granular B & W film and photographs capture time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through photographs bunny Yeager very well done. <br /> <br /> strong supporting cast Strathairn (fresh from his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. Star of the movie is amazingly talented and underrated and earn Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings edge and spirit to their roles. It was absolutely fascinating to the little seen, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here it is famous Bettie Page. Her smile is charming and her body perfectly. She seems to really like this role and helps us understand how the girl next door to the Tennessee could become criminals Pin-up queen. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of these performers. Although the film alludes to the creation of history in this area, the final third interesting prevent falls flat pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Betty Paige make it a fun movie to watch and one that will give endless screenings on HBO in the near future. Now someone will please refer to the g-Mol into a star, it should be?
