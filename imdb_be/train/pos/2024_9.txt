I loved this miniseries. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job, which shows Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding together with his young son with a mysterious past. As an anglophile who love ballads ... this movie was just my cup of tea, and I would recommend it to those looking to escape for a few hours in the England of the 1800s. I should also mention that Toby Stephens, who paints a very magnetic Gilbert Markham is reason enough to see this wonderful production.
