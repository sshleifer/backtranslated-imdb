Oh, what fun is there! <br /> <br /> Hekerling smell for comedy direction (Fast Times, at Ridgemont High, who's talking), but here, it seems, she told the actor to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton wafts through the role of Johnny, easily his best performance of the screen. Joe Piscopo as big as the appropriately named Deni Vermin, what a shame directors do not pick up on it. And I even remembered Richard Demetrius play Moronie and unique character dictionary. I do not think it's a coincidence that most of the character's name written MORON. <br /> <br /> The good lines permeate the film with Peter Boyle, Griffith Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner good data lines, even actors with small roles as Butkus and Alan Hale get good lines. <br /> <br /> recommend it to a friend.
