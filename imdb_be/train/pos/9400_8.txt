If the man in the white suit was made in America, you can not see how Danny Kaye and Jerry Lewis tries to Alec Guinness Sidney Stratton for size? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Alec Guinness's films and, of course, one of the best that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom had failed. It is so perfectly fit in time for the new Labor government and society he is trying to build. It's amazing how in a crisis of capital and labor can come to an agreement. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness this good-natured little schnook man obsessed with the idea that he can come up with clothes that will never need to be cleaned, that actually repels all kinds of foreign matter at the moment, this applies to clothing. <br /> <br /> He is persistent and swear he is happy. Of course, the consequences are not very thoughtful about the impact a garment like that will have on society. In the end, everyone has it, how they are fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre with M or Orson Welles' The Stranger, or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> This is the sign of a great comedy that potentially serious situation as this pursuit, as described in some of the major films that I mentioned can be played for laughs. poor Guinness suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> In addition to the best performances of Guinness with Cecil Parker as another pompous fool, Joan Greenwood as his daughter and siren Ernest Tesayger the largest clothing manufacturer in the United Kingdom> <br /> <br /> Come to think about it even Paramount borrow this costume with Ealing and give him a John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever?
