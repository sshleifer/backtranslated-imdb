It would seem a perfect day for sailing. Normal family wants to take advantage of it and take a trip to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is trapped under the pier and neither his wife, nor his young son can help him get out of it - while the tide is rising. Woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and looking for help. <br /> <br /> short film of John Sturges (69 minutes) is powerful because of unresolved issues. Stanwyck is a guy who could help, but there is the price she must pay for it. There is a double question is a film. How far would you go to help the person that you love, and on the other hand - that the observed behavior Stanwyck in relation to others - does she really loves her husband? Like a good story this film leaves the viewer to question himself, he can only answer yourself.
