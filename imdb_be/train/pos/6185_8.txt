I just considered murder on vanities in the recently released set of Universal Pre-Code, and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed the end of the vehicle to the end. Most other commentators have covered the story, murder mystery within a musical, but I would like to add some additional notes. Brisson and Carlisle relatively mild compared to even the most minor players, and no one really seems to be the right voice for what they sing (Carlisle be trained opera singer, Brisson little shaky on some of its high and low notes). Large Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well from each other, with a great sense of time, which keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan girls are vanity, but let's not forget, a great jazz singer Ernestine Anderson among «Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of her early performances, sounding a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick will go on to become the executive producer of the TV series Perry Mason TV. Then there's Jessie Ralph as wardrobe mistress - you will tarnish her and David Copperfield (as Peggoty aunt) and Bank detective. The music is very good - Brisson introduction of standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Sweet Marijuana" with barely dressed girls bud in the background (dripping blood on the white skin of the chorus was surprisingly frightening); «Ebony Rhapsody" with the Duke Ellington Orchestra, and a bevy of beautiful dancers, black and white, mixing it up. And I think this is one of the few early musicals show such a mixture - and costumes leave nothing to the imagination.
