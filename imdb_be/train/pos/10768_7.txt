I saw it many years ago, when I was younger and could never remember the name, until one day I looked through film credits John Candy on IMDb and saw a record called "One crime ...". Something rang, and I clicked on it, and after reading a short story he brought back many memories. <br /> <br /> I found this at the age quite well, despite the fact that this is not some sort of means "big" comedy. This, however, is quite nice and a good riff formula Hitchcock mistaken identity and the world of thrills. <br /> <br /> The film has a great cast of characters, including an American couple who find a dog woman during a holiday in Europe and decided to return it to her for a fee - only to find her body on arrival. From there the story gets crazy and stupid, and they go on the run after police believe that they are killers. <br /> <br /> The view from the mixture between "This Mad Mad Mad Mad WorldÂ» and easier function Hitchcock was sent to Eugene Levy, and he was able to get some of his good friends - such as John Candy - star in it . The film is mainly to attract because of its cast, and the end of a fun little twist that is not entirely unexpected, but also partly unexpected.
