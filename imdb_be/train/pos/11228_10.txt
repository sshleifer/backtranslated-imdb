It's short and to the point. History writing is used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier surprisingly well. Acting all over the map, but the main characters over the years, it seems to work on improving their skills. Hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years, and will come to an end in mid-May 2007 <br /> <br /> I will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphs. Given that this is an all-volunteer, without any profit, it is rather strange. <br /> <br /> If this is being evaluated as a professional production, I would give it a 5 for a good story, but terrible sets. However, as the production of the fan based on I should give it an excellent rating is the exception with several other efforts, it is in its own league. For sheer volume, I do not think that it was backed up. Congratulates actor and the team for the effort that many are addicted.
