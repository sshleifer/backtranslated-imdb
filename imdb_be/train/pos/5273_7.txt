It was directed by Deodato, a real symbol for the many fans of the horror movie, after he had sent the seed and the notorious Cannibal Holocaust. However, do not expect to find such popularity in the film discussed here as it is an incredibly tame in comparison, and plays a more inspired Conan outlet for a young audience. <br /> <br /> This description can instantly put off most fans just inspired Conan Sword and Sorcery genre, but before you turn your nose in it, I must say, this film is so much fun! <br /> <br /> He mostly played for laughs and has two huge and very cute characters as David and Peter Paul aka. Barbarian Brothers, who seem to be having a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> In the film loved Richard Lynch appears as the main villain in the piece, and it is also great to see the role of Big George Eastman and Berryman. <br /> <br /> in the annex to this, the house is stunning to behold and thus scantily clad for the entire period films (and a staple ingredient in many greeted the genre!) <br /> <br /> What I I can say - it's just a lot of fun and light-hearted look at the genre, and I recommend it with all my heart!
