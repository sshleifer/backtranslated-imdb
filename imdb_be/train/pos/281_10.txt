This game was very large and quite challenging. It has a great, terrible story and graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game all the horror lover and very exciting from start to finish. The only problem with this game, I would like more weapons, but that's just me. <br /> <br /> Really great game for fans of RPG and Shoot'em'up. <br /> <br />>
