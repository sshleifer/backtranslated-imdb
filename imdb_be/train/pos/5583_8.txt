I pick at least a few people watched it on Sept.2 on that. If you know that Hedy had to change his name to avoid being associated with this film, when she came to the US It was a huge scandal, and I realized that the initial release in the US has been so chopped up by the censors, that it was almost incomprehensible, I watched because I just saw a documentary about the "bad" women, the actress in the United States transferred film censorship council, created in the early 30s. He looked at me as if they got off a lot more than most "sensational" Hedi boom in the film "Ecstasy". In fact Hedy species positively innocent of this, by today's standards, and it was nice to see her earlier pristine beauty. It was a good, lyrical film unwind. I loved it for what it was: a romance. I watched it after a pre-recorded it during a sleepless early AM I would like to see the first version released in the US for comparison's sake.
