This film is really cool. every thing looks like it came out of comics. sets, costumes and story are excellent. Clark Bartram again our favorite Batman. He looked a little better than a dead end, but he still pulls it off. Superman is too large. flying effects OK. but its fan-film, so we can not expect that they will be the greatest. shot with Superman caught the car was very believable. it was cool. This is a movie I would definitely see if it was real. its got everything you want in / superman batman movie. The only exception, though, I would have thrown a joker instead of the 2-person ..... all in all I give this film 10 because its a great film.
