What surprised me the most in this film was pure audience it attracted. Such films such as Anita and I never caused as much excitement as there is in this movie, but I think that this is probably due to the mention of the "Beckham" in the title more than anything else. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant film to put across the message brilliant -. you can do anything if you decide enough and put your mind to it, which is a positive message to those who watch this movie <br /> <br /> I think it's one of the best films Keira Knightley, and I think that it is a brilliant actress, and was perfect for the role. Parminder heating was brilliant too. Unfortunately, I can not say that it is for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I do not think he's so many good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little scary. <br /> <br /> In general, a brilliant film and a brilliant story
