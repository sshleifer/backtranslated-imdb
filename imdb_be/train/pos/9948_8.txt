Oh yeah! Jenna Jameson has done it again! Yeah Baby! This movie rocks. It was one of the 1st I've seen her films. And I must say that I feel in love with her, she was great in this movement. <br /> <br /> Her performance was outstanding, and what I liked most, the scenery and the wardrobe was amazing, you can tell they put a lot into the film fabric girl was strange. <br /> <br /> I hope this comment will help, and you can buy the film, the plot is amazing is very unique and I'm sure going to like this. Jenna amazed us once again, and it is not surprising that the film did not win so many awards. Her makeup and wardrobe very very sexy and girl on girl scene of strange. especially one where she looks like an angel. This is a must see, and I hope to share my interests
