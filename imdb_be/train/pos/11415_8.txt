This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I both love to dance and ran this movie in a video store. We had to get it. In the absence of violence and a history of his great-warming film to relax and just enjoy the night. I would recommend this film to any family or just a bunch of girls looking cute movie.
