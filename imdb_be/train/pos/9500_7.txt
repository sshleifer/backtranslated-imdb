I saw this movie on TV and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a neat movie and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and of course Mccomb. While I was thrilled to watch this movie and since then I try to VCD of this movie, but I can not find it. Huge African lions pretend INT his film, and we'll spell is limited only by the size of these animals and their grace. All sections of the audience can watch this movie especially children will enjoy this film. But some scenes featuring McComb forces parental guidance for this film. This pleasant holiday movie for everyone.
