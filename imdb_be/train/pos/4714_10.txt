The famous words of the owner of the external nightclub Roman Maroni, that "nasty cork sucker" who spends the entire movie, not only as Johnny formidable opponent, but to butcher the English language as well. <br /> <br /> Another underrated classic that you can only find in the afternoon matinees or «Late Late Late Show» 's, Johnny Dangerously stunning satirical punch of a good cordial boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay medical help mother and put his brother through law school. <, Br /> <br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares ?? Cast, which includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Meryl Henner, and Alan Hale Jr. will keep you waiting to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> There's too many laughs in this to put here. As the aircraft, you have to pay attention, or you miss something. Highly recommend to anyone who could use a good laugh or two !!!
