I'm the only one who saw the connection between the discussion of Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus "and Mary's life? Camus in the version a person is doomed to spend eternity with him a giant boulder that he must roll up hill. Unfortunately, every time he reaches the top of the boulder escapes and ends back at the bottom for him to start. maybe a buzzard peck at his eyes, I'm not sure right now. in the film, Mary spends his life struggling to get her life together, unfortunately, every time it receives any support, it falls down and loses everything. an example would be the party she throws where she gets drunk, insults her falafel lover, and almost attacked Leah schrieber. if the issue with this theory, note how this scene ends with her trying to climb a flight of stars while the book fall from anywhere without disturbing its progress, until in the end it will not work. The next morning when she wakes up, she was still on the stairs, before reaching the summit.
