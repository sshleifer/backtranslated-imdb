I must say, although I despise this kind of show, shock horror, I'm a girl, I feel that I have to express their opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez, before I saw Jackass and I think that is the way Jackass is superior in terms of software solutions. Story lines and interviews between woven to create a more interesting show. I saw a few minutes Jackass movie the other night and could not believe how bad it was to connect, everything just put in line jokes after jokes, not the relationship between anything. It must be very quick, simple show ever to edit, shockingly amateurish. While drinking vomiting is not really my thing, how significant is entertaining show, Dirty Sanchez is leaving the Jackass League.
