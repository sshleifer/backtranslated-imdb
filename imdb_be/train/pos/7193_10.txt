God! Zorro was the subject of about the same number of films as Tarzan, and probably about how many actors in the main roles. <br /> <br /> This show is one of my personal favorites, and, as mentioned earlier, it is one of the Top 5 Serial Sound. Ironically, this is one production, published in that water strait year 1939. * At the time of production in '39, Zorro was very well known as (Pulp) literary and cinematic character. The film begins with a small footnote on the history of the struggle for freedom from Mexico's rules of European monarchy, namely Spain. History offers a comparison with the American revolutionary war. <br /> <br /> the story focuses on the mythical province of San-Mendelito and "Council". This is solved Benito Juarez ** against them gold mine to the new Republic of Mexico. Deliveries of gold should get through Mexico. <br /> <br /> Don Diego Vega's uncle Francisco, claims that he organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for gold convoys.A thug with Don Del Oro black, the steps in the "insult" for themselves and challenge Don Francisco in a duel with swords, Don Frasncisco getting run over. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, a dark-clad masked swordsman, it seems, a sword fight and after carving brand "Z" on the face of the bad guy, he sends it to the ancestors. Don Francisco declares its breath to it the arrival of Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew from the city of Los Angeles. He is trying to say about the true identity of Don del Oro, but ends before the end of the contract. <br /> <br /> There is a large reception to Diego Hacienda Don Francisco, where Diego disappointing Ramon'sister (Ward and Don Francisco) with its timid ak am. "Dude !!", she said. <br /> <br /> Later, Diego Ramon and escape, to join with the meeting of the volunteers. If they ask, "Who will lead us to Don Francisco is now dead?" Ramon says "Zorro, Zorro, we fight the Legion!" Well, there's a big battle with the Legion, now all dressed in gray, with masks and capes, protecting the gold train. Then Zorro seems a trap on the artificial avalanche intended for the convoy when, well, you know, Cliffhanger end of the first section. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for one chapter, but, like most other serials, the opening of a longer and has a lot of land for laying, to create a storyline. Let's just let it suffice to say that 11 more good, well done, action-filled subsequent Chapters. <br /> <br /> FIGHTING LEGION Zorro has all the elements that made the upper action climbers. We have an unknown evil leader who is inciting trouble between the different groups. There are a number of suspects as to who was really behind the mask of "Don del Oro." We were soldiers, renegade Whites, hostile Indians and the Legion. <br /> <br /> In short, we can say with certainty that there is everything one could want and then some, in this series. And by the way, they wisely decided not actors affect Mexican accents. <br /> <br /> As soon as that is here, that makes ZFL stand out from the rest? How is it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First of all, it has a much more complex and exciting musical score playing and emphasizing the drama and action on the screen. The topic is opened even appear in the flamenco guitar by Cantina in the first part. It's probably the only time when such a highly specialized innovation is a serial track. <br /> <br /> And yet, there is another feature that really sets the Fighting Legion saga ahead of everyone else. That is, the film is not only a heroic theme music, but it also sports the lyrics, yes, Legionairres sing! We hear them singing in the opening credits of a few sections! It really works well and adds to the feelings that we get from view. <br /> <br /> If the series was first shown on our local television (about 1955), all the gang recognized the voice Reed Hadley as belonging to the "Captain Braddock with racket squads TV series. Hadley was very distinctive, deep voice. *** He also handled the role very well. His costume and especially elongated mask looked very good, and probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a small slip up. A couple of minor anachronism occurs in the presence of Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) referring to Sana-Mendelito Council Juarez was about 18 years old at the time (1824), and although it was later, perhaps the most significant figure in the history of Mexico, he of course, we did not reach such an outstanding yet. Its inclusion in the history probably had to earn to release JUAREZ Warner Brothers, in the same year, which starred Paul Muni in the title role. <br /> <br /> This is not only my choice as the top 5 audio series, but my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We are reminded of the great harvest of the best flight films in the same year, with Gone with the Wind, mr.smith travels to Washington, the citadel, Juarez magician OZ, Of Mice and Men, One Million BC ., Zenobia, we want all the mummies ranked to be released in this year. <br /> <br /> ** Once again, Juarez Nia does not ascend to a national importance, until around 1850, about 25 years later. In addition, the political subdivisions referred to as "region" in history. In fact, they are called the «States». Just as we have called the United States, just south of the border they call them the United States of Mexico Repubhlic. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was prominent in some of the "A" pictures in which his richly toned voice exploited the good effect. Watch and listen to his story in a house on 92nd Street (1945) and Guadalcanal Diaries (1945).
