This opus by the Swedish king shit-Mats Helge Olsson. Rarely a film of this scale has been made in Sweden, and it really stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in the Swedish film to date. Who pays for it? <br /> <br /> The Russian nuclear scientist Mark wants to defect to Sweden. But his plans are thwarted by the Russian military, who kidnapped him and tell him that he arrived in Sweden. This deception is their way of seeing the Mark continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the entire planet. The CIA, however, bent on getting Markov to the west and to send them a ninja to release it. <br /> <br /> The practice of the presence of Swedish actors speaking in English is that Mats-Helge perfected in his later works. Cheap B-movie feeling it creates is probably unmatched for performance. But apart from that? Well, the standard style action straight to video. Machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians die. People are running around in black suits ninja trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> What really stands out though is the incredibly poor way of fighting choreography scene. When they say «Ninja» in the title, I wait for the martial arts, I'm waiting for close combat. But, maybe two or three scenes of real martial arts in this film. And they're funny. It's so bad, I do not have enough words to describe it. If Ninja move slowly their hearts stop. And, of course, the whole movie ends with an explosion, which indicates a budget special effects, consisting of four food stamps and vouchers McDonald. <br /> <br /> So the verdict? Instant classic known. Never before the movie was made, that it is so obvious, it is intended for consumption together with large amounts of alcohol. It's the ultimate party film. Insert video and laughter. It is only necessary to understand that films such as they have not done more. This is the story of the film. <br /> <br /> Therefore, rating 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 and 10/10 quality for accents.
