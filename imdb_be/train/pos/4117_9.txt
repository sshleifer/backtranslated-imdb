"DO desu ka den" it is the first color film master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly not a samurai, ronins, warlords or the battlefields. He is in very poor communities in slums in Tokyo, where residents are homeless drunks, beggars, vagrants, abused women who have lost. I do not know why Kurosawa chose this tragic subject and the environment, to put flowers, but they are actually very sad stories, some of them heartbreaking. I personally, as a touching story of a boy and his father, who dreams of a house, and they built; History retardation boy who believes he is piloting the train; story about a man who raises five children, as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of a young woman abused by her stepfather. . My vote is nine <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O ?? Dodes'ka-den Caminho da Vida" ( "?? Dodes'ka-den Life Path")
