This is easily the most underrated film courtyard Brooks gun. Of course, its shortcomings. It does not give a realistic picture of homelessness (as opposed to, say, Citizen Kane gave a realistic picture of the singers living room, or the Titanic gave a realistic picture of Italians idiots). Many of the jokes fall flat. But still, this film is very much attractive comedies are not in the way, and to implement it in the history of some of the more traditional members of society have spoken truly impressive. He was not Fisher King, but not crap either. My only complaint is that Brooks had to give someone else to come (I love Mel as a director and screenwriter, not so much as lead).
