Oh, come on, learn to have a little fun. When I was a child, about, this film was Oscar worthy of me. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best films I've seen. <br /> <br /> At the moment, it's a little silly, but come on. If you liked «Excellent Adventure», you should most likely have fun with "Bogus Journey". It was a movie before, "Dude, where's my car?". Only this one is really funny. As I said, it's just a good time. Not to be taken seriously, and if you enjoyed the first one, you have to as «Bogus Journey». It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. Just for your pleasure to watch him let go, and remember that this is a silly comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
