Another example of the unique talents of Cary Grant. The performance is noteworthy Oscar, the Academy once again avoided. Mr. Grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to leave the big city. Pitfalls of building a house is well chronicled, and became the basis of (free) for more than a modern car of Tom Hanks Â«The Money Pit". <br /> <br /> If you like a good old comedy without curses and so gratuitous sex, this film is a must see.
