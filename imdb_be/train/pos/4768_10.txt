I loved it and so destroyed, that does not make another season !!! I wish they would! it was the best show ever !!!!!! there probably is not any chance of them went there not to cancel the show! haha I wish it was though! I would so excited !! I really would! I miss her! and it was particularly destroyed, so as not to know what is happening with Jason !! I think they need to do another .... I also think it silly that you have to writr ten lines to leave a comment .. this makes your comment on..and resistance no one will read !! I really want to know what would have happened between Jason and Nicole ... maybe they could do to spin !!
