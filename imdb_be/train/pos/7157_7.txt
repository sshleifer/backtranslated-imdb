This film is an entertaining, fun and quality of the film. The film is very reasonably necessary recommendations if the book, and seeks to adhere to the exact lines. Actors suited, and one would expect them to be a part of. They use some well-known actors who give a great effect on the film. Graphics a bit quirky in some parts, and there are a lot of mistakes in the course of the film. There's no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard, for example. The camp is not as bad as described in the book, and they usually do not show taking place in the camp as much as books. His group is mentioned a lot in the book, but not in the film. Overall, a great film for a rainy day
