"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films, announced Thats a masterpiece with good reason - it's really one of the best films ever made in America. It acts as an artistic still readily available and commercial. Not surprisingly, it was a huge hit when originally released. But keep in mind, it is also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. Symbols are stored, is well developed, and ultimately tragic. The creators of the film is to be welcomed, that does not give us a Hollywood ending, that was basically a must in the 80s. Nevertheless, this is why I appreciate the years of 1967 to 1977 for the American film. His time, if well done, innovative, and most of all the gloomy films can be made with big budgets that Hollywood has to offer. It ended until "Star Wars" was released. <br /> <br /> Directed by John Schlesinger makes the work material. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films that feature the psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" aged very well. It is still as powerful as it was when originally released. Actions, however, that makes this a masterpiece. backgrounds characters never fully explained, but the performances make them fully developed. And Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman absolutely unforgettable and nice (although they are sometimes evil actions). Besides, being a fan of vintage exploitation films, I loved the scenes set in the shamefully neglected 42nd Street. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made. (10/10)
