This film was made in 1948, but still rings true today. Very, very funny. It begins with a family wishing to buy a small place in the country and "build" there. Anyone who has ever built a house, will find this film very attractive. Large throw. Cary Grant and peaceful Lloyd excellent in this film. This is a classic black and white film, which reflects a great style of 40-ies .... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made to the value of things, and the comparison with the current costs rather strange. I can not imagine anyone not fully enjoy this movie. I'm surprised by the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. A true classic.
