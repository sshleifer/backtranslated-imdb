One can only imagine the film Mr. Wells might have ended without the intervention of the studio! This film is an imperfect Wells, but it's worth every minute, because you can see the greatness, perhaps best directed films of America of all time! <br /> <br /> We can see the loss he took on Orson Welles filming of this movie. History is replete with holes in it, perhaps, because of the requirements of the studio executives who do not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to read some of the views submitted by IMDB, which is compared with Orson Welles Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when he has to be all of those directors who are to be regarded as followers of a great master himself . No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Wells. Fortunately we still have the inheritance or retrospective look, for example, as a film festival in New York, has just ended, and his movies either on tape or a DVD-shape. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here. If she was beautiful with her red hair, the blonde, she's just too overwhelming for words. Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders made an outstanding contribution to cinema. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could make this film one more masterpiece will be added to Orson Welles' body of work, his own appearance in it. If he focused at directing, and there was another actor to interpret Michael O'Hara, another film could be achieved as a whole. Orson Welles must be credited for what is perhaps the pioneer in taking the camera from a studio lot on the street. Visuals in this film is so strange that we come out of the theater after watching this film really impress for work, vision and talent, he has given us.
