Great movie -I loved him. Great editing and soundtrack. It captures a real sense of Indian life, but we can all relate. Well-chosen cast with some great characters. The film develops the characters, so that you really care about them all, and you feel like you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some scenes of football is great and the area really works, as well as all off as real and natural. You just can not help but root for Jesse in the movie! The action was really good, even tomboyish walk and posture of both the leading give very convincing as someone that has played a lot of football.
