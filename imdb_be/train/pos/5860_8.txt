Enjoyable game that offers fun and easy to play and a fair opportunity to play. Staying true to the comic, and ensuring a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action cartridges today. In addition, the story and the animated scenes, which are used (although long animations are replaced with a slide show on the Nintendo 64 version) to take full advantage of the opportunities of platforms.
