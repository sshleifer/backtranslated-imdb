Hard to say, comes out on top, charm and energy of James Cagney or the opening of three large surpluses Busby Berkeley lining at the end of mouth-. I give him a tie with a light-flooded ramp Parade is one of the funniest and fastest of the early thirties musicals. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondel adds immeasurably good-natured storyline. <br /> <br /> And that story? It is about Chester Kent (Cagney), which produces musicals and now just about out of business as cordless phones take over. He begins to make opening, live musical entertainment is offered at the stage before the start of the film. He gets the idea to make a larger and more of them, moving them around the country. He fireball and ideas, and he needs all the ideas that he can get to inevitably produce these things. But rival spy on him and stealing his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondel), his wise cracking secretary, loves him, but he was too busy, too much notice; office girl in a black-rimmed round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants a chance to dance; his wife turns up saying that she divorced him after all; blonde prospector sets its hooks in him; his partners cheated him ... God, what's next? This may sound like a lot to digest, but it is fast, with Cagney sun bouncing, strutting, walking, finger-clicking, barking orders and occasionally - much to the last number, if he goes all out to sing and dance - take a step or two to show how it's done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's put on a show, the gang" we "We need to build three shows in three days, so to lock the doors and let us begin to rehearse." These three super entrance is going to feature 40 chorines, spectacular effects, and will mean a rich contract with Kent forty units in luxurious theaters ... the whole movie Apollo chain of home! Depletion face, legs hurt, but all these unbilled chorines open costumes (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour, you can quickly determine Sothern but Lamour is more common) to keep the course, dancing their hearts, giggling and chattering and looks fine unsweaty , <br /> <br /> And then the curtains are raised each Prologue presented in separate cinemas, one after the other on the same night, the owner Apollo scheme is going to determine what the night will he save the skin of Chester or not. <br /> <br /> First of all, this "honeymoon hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in 9 minutes, the serial number, which shows a lot of useful profligacy of the brides and grooms (some of them may even be married) bedrooms and beds and doors with a "do not disturb" signs. <br /> <br /> Then on to the next stage and 11 minutes, "waterfall", which is likely to have an accountant worrying about Warner Brothers bankruptcy. This number is so excessive - dozens of waterfowl girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with slides, a giant swimming pool - you never think it was depression on Berre. cus pulls all their tricks - synchronization, human samples, foot and hand make all kinds of precise things - and he does it in the water, with lots of underwater photography, looking up Girls are sure that the game they come with water smile in their eyes.. and still hit their marks. All of this was incredibly difficult and tiring. Ruby Keeler, who has a few quick shots in the water, is the only one who looks like a little cautious. <br /> <br /> Finally, a killer final ... 11 minutes Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler in "Shanghai Liv" with all kinds of bar girls and their clients, unusual in the fact that the races are mixed, There Cagney Keeler and dancing on the bar, dancing on the table, Cagney fighting. There is what looks like fifty or sixty marching infantry, hupping back and forth, threw the gun and caught. Then ... it's true ... and human image of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle. This may be the only Hollywood musical performance ever signs Roosevelt, a large federal agency and a bevy of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> That's entertainment, people. That's fine! <br /> <br /> Of course, the opening of Chester to get a big contract and Nan gets Chester. The film is full of juicy clich√©s that make us smile. Ruby Keeler as endearing as it truly stomps her elbows with her hands to fly, you want to help it along. Joan Blondel makes us forget about many Hollywood women who may have been more beautiful, but which were much less intelligence and personality. The film, however, belongs to Cagney, who grasps and shakes it, and at Berkeley, a man for whom too much was never too much.
