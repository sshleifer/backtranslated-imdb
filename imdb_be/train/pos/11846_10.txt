I liked this movie a lot. Animation was well done and the romance was sweet. I liked most songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer score was excellent. What many people do not realize how well it relates to the Darkness / Apocalypse theme today Heart (what happens when the so-called "civilization" breaks someone's house, it means to be "civilized", etc.), Outdoor decorations and music were very mix. lamentations film in America, which was once beautiful.
