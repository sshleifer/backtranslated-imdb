It was one of the highlights of ST: half-forgotten second season of TNG, before they are "grown" or grown in their own in the third season and beyond. It was not only a showcase for up-and-alien, as Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but also the continuation of Data search for him "humanity", this time through the concept of comedy. Another one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> On a side note, I'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with which window the character was going to have a date (after Teri Hatcher character in) before rudely interrupted by Lt Worf. I remember watching this episode, "the first perspective" my friends the comic shop back in the day, and we all thought that she was a perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beauty is actually ...
