This is one of those little Christmas movie for everyone. Our Scrooge Ben Affleck, who decides the money is not enough, so he rents a family that lives where he thought his family did. OK? This is a great little high school soap, the PG-13, but small links sex comedy, so if your child can not cope with them, they can not live in the real world, either. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a hunk, and, as usual passes through this fun, OMG, remember when we did ..., part of an ensemble, as if he was in the final stages of some neuroinfectious disease. But that's okay, because even the old Oracle continues to hope that when Ben that well built all over, well, there's hope for us yet give. Fortunately, the rest of the ensemble - Catherine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - fill in and keep this shadow side the Ozzie-and-Harriet Christmas alternately cheerful, comfortable and warm <. br /> <br /> The film is a kind of, you can jump up and get the popcorn, and when you come back, they all want to support him, to show you what you missed. <br /> <br /> This is a happy film, in the end, and it leaves you feeling good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There really is something for everyone.
