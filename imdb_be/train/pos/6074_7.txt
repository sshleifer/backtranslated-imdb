Laurence Fishburne is a great actor, and deserves credit for that, but he was not in a class with a lot Shakespeareans both Olivier and Welles; and then he suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, pure dwarfs away. Olivier acknowledged that the potential in its production, and threw it with someone he knew he could eclipse. I almost did not realize the potential of Yaga, the most evil character of Shakespeare, but Branagh shows us the depth. Nice to see views of Venice too.
