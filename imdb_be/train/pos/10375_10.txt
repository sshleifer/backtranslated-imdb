Country boy, the Aussie rules player (Mat) comes to town the night before a big test for all of the match AFL, where he should be picked up his cousin. And then everything goes wrong. <br /> <br /> It's not-hoper cousin became involved in a drug deal with the local loan sharks / drug dealer Crumb (which looks like any thug anywhere, but it is definitely Australia). Needless to say, Matt becomes entangled in the chaos, and it is not long before the thought of tomorrow's match is shunted on his head like crazy events to unravel the night. <br /> <br /> implementation of the Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone put in a sterling performance as a young naive country boy Mat and successfully plays the role well below his age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as a youngster, and entertaining role of David Ngumbuzharra as a police officer, after the events. Roll is developing rapidly, often funny, and very helpful to use an hour.
