I thought that the film may be a bit more complicated, in the psychological sense, perhaps, but the action and voice were at the highest level. Animation CG was heavy in many scenes, but very good at it. This is one of Batman Returns / Ever-type films, which include songs and conflicts Wayne and motives for dating. 007 supporters love it, and so will be a female, a great theme song! Wayne was portrayed very well in this film, and Penquin has not returned to its present form, regardless of the mutant genes him this time! I liked the fact Robin did not use too much, Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd, a few of the Indigo Child or the future mind. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was made of some kind of soap opera star, worthy of the talents and characters are painted to look like the voice actors too. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's less fantasy, Return of the Joker and Batman vs Dracula, but he liked the script better smarter than I used minus. 7/10
