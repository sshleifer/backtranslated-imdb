I rented this for my son who recently found interest in 9/11. He was in kindergarten at the time and had no idea what was unfolding. I liked how it was said as a "documentary." If there was one film that I would recommend to see in regard to 9/11, it will be one! Normally you see the movie, he has actors who are well known. This film was nobody knows. In addition, you see the film with respect to 9/11, you hear about the fire or the loss of two of their lives saving people. I do not think it was any of it! I just rented this film and, of course, you can add it to your collection! Very well done indeed! My heart survivors and families of victims of 9/11!
