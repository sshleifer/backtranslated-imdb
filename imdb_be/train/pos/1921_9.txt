ABC has done more for this show, allowing the TV veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast of the show. First, the show watchable and even predictable with John Ritter and Sagan. Loss John shocked the world. Kate and three children really solid professional cast. Hour lesson, after John's death in real life hit home with me. I lost my father in 17 years and could sympathize with and understand their pain and suffering. ABC should be proud to support this show and even save it as the ultimate desire of John. This show has matured and developed due to such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Amy.
