Theodore Rex, perhaps the greatest cinematic experiences of all time, and, of course, is a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this exciting intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel aligns itself with the great directors of the 20th century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorsese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. Special effects are no less spectacular, and do any work Spielberg look trite and trivial. At the time of his release, Theodore Rex was so revolutionary gem, which he raised the bar to a level of filmmaking never unraveled filmmakers. The concept of creation not only films with the participation of the dinosaur, but adapting the action, an exciting detective story together looking at the "conversation" with a dinosaur postmodern name, such as "Theodore" and existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it. The world may never be the same after experiencing such a wonderful beauty. Watching Theodore Rex is a lot like looking into the face of God and hear His words, "you're my favorite work." This is one of the few films that is simply to die for !!!
