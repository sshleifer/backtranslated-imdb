Paul Reiser did a poor job in the writing of this film. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. He is worthy of an Academy Award. It was one of the most touching and funny films of the year. wit Reiser is fantastic, and it is as good as it gets, and he was in his long-running television comedy "Crazy on You". Peter Falk did a masterful job, like his father, and Peter, who is now 78 years young made us laugh and cry at the same time. supporting cast was equal to the task particularly gorgeous gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins. This is a must see film for 2005. I bet that all in all ages and faiths are going to love this movie, and one way or another connected with it in one form or another. We have fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, as in the film. We all had good and bad times together and I wish you all had the same thing, but in a different way.
