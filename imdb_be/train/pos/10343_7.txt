In "The Amazing Mr. Williams' star Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which was with Nina Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondel (Maxine), who also made five films this year, three of which they are made together! Lieutenant Douglas Williams, and he and his colleagues Horts presented with a dead body, and they have to find out what really happened. Viewers learn their employee - actors (Clarence flasks, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) have always played a position of power ... senators, bank presidents, policemen. This one-dunnit smell of comedy to it - the police are always throwing punches at each other, even Williams and his girlfriend fight verbally. Some funny jokes - Williams even takes the man they arrested together on a date with his girlfriend. There's a lot of cool stuff here, so go slow start and wait for the funny things later. I do not want to give away any spoilers, so you have to catch it on Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall made mostly comedies, and was reportedly engaged to Lucy at some point.
