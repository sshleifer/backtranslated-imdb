Do not fall for the skeptics. It is surprisingly awful movie. It was a thesis project for the writer / director, JT Patty. He did a great job, that I was on the edge of my seat. I never knew what to expect, and jaded horror movie goer, this is nirvana! The film refers to the elderly, who lives in an isolated cabin in the woods. One day, in search of the cat in the woods, he witnesses the murder of a child, or is he? He is tormented about it the rest of the film. The most unusual in this film is that there is no dialogue until the last few scenes. I found it intriguing. The writer was able to take possession of your senses and gives them the relentless tug. Give this film to go, you will not be disappointed.
