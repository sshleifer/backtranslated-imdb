It is almost valid for less than the film follows Jack, insomnia, as it goes through hallucinations, visit friends dead, thrown from the building, and, for a long time could not tell reality from hallucination. <, Br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan Jack, really believable. Confused and scared, but sluggish and sometimes indifferent acceptance of what he sees, we follow him, trying to understand what he sees and to find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Imagine that says a dog (another hallucination), and children who appear suddenly in the bathroom and the bedroom Jack without any explanation as to how they got there (a hallucination), and you there are interesting, incredible, 43 minutes, and shower scene is enough to get any fan Dom return again and again.
