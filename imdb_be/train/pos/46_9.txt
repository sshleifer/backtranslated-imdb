Just finished watching this movie, perhaps the 7th or 8th time, picked it for one night before looked at Blockbuster and absolutely loved it, I showed it to 4 people so far, and they enjoyed it. Avoid all the Hollywood glamor and special effects of stress on the "shock factor", an independent film Paul F. Ryan hits the bullseye traumatic situations affecting the fight against AFTER. Occur after high school shooting, two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Diana (Erika Christensen) form unlikely bond. Alicia, a girl with a heart of stone, Goth, who has a pessimistic attitude towards life helps to overcome the problems of Diana of life and death and life thereafter. Meanwhile, Diana is trying to help Alicia to see some of the softness and light into the world again. Nha stressing on the shocking case of fire, but also in interpersonal relationships among those who survived, it sets this film apart. Despite the low budget and short shooting time, this film is far from the cheese. Ryan to pay respect to the fact that he had never experienced, and trying to break into the human psyche. With amazing and the nearest actress, Phillips adds necessary dramatic dialogue and common feeling for the film and Christensen helps balance the "pessimism" the feeling of the film can be. Overall, I recommend this movie, and if you love the topic of school aggression and violence, and to learn more about it, I also suggest the documentary "It Girls WorldÂ» extinguish the CBC in 2004, which deals with the theme of social conduct, comparing and contrasting the two one group of girls in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, a group of friends and acquaintances Dawn Marie Wellesley 14-year-old girl who killed herself after being severely bullied.
