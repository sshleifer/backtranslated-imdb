I love Paul McCartney. He, in my opinion, the greatest of all time. I could not, however, afford a ticket to his concert at the Tacoma Dome in time Back in the US tour. I was disappointed, to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as it is. Sex is still a man, and I will enjoy it for years to come. <br /> <br /> I have one complaint. I would be going to hear all of Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> In addition, Paul did not die. <br /> <br /> The only biggest concert DVD ever. <br /> <br /> ** *** ***** with.
