If you see a DVD cover you are convinced that this is some kind of class B cheesy cheap, the film made $ 1,000 in someone's yard. <br /> <br /> Not so! <br /> <br /> This is the quality of the material and is very good. It's a comedy, and smart in this. It is also very touching in spots, with a beautiful spot of kindness. the production values ​​are very good (it looks great), the actors are known, and the direction of the film sets are great. It's weird. Who would have thought, <br /> <br /> Carrie-Anne Moss, playing against type, is terrific as the "Helen Robinson" in June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly as big as a kind of grunting zombies «Fido»; Tim Blake Nelson ( "Mr. Theopolis») is a dial tone is neighbor to sexual zombie girlfriend «Tammy» and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as popes (check) is different, too Kn Ray as a young "Those Robinson," not be overlooked, either. in fact, he probably has more lines in the film, than anyone else. <br /> <br /> If I explain the story is going to sound so stupid that some of you will see. you just have to take the word of people here who loved it and found it to be very, very pleasant surprise. you need to c volumetric sense of humor, though; a high score of absurdity.
