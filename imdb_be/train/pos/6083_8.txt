Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, best of all, Faye, all in one movie. Wow is all I can think to say about it. These are four of the most underrated actors in the business, and they work well together. It's like poetry, as they play with each other and exude a natural ability to appear as if they were best friends for eons even film. <br /> <br /> the film a wonderful and one that can be intense enough to see for the first time, and four stars to help re-guard ability considerably. I can not describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Faye together on the screen, the greatest moment to be when they watch a couple of the race and complete the vocals himself, he almost brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> good movie, great cast, go see it. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
