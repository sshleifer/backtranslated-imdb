The ideal roll for a few persons of the drama. Simon died, but somehow resurrects from the outside. What he saw there appear as white spots planned for the beautiful score of the German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon pursued his death, comforted by the support of death, which he saw on the other side. His girlfriend tries to hold him back to life, but not in a state decides to follow him after he finally death that occurred. Very touchy and touching, deeply psychological, but a little slow, and in some cases even sad.
