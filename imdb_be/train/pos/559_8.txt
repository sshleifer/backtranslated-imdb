A good film with - for its time - intensive, stretch, pretty dark story is somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's "The Searchers", but not so tight. The story starts quickly and does not let up, with a few scenes really good dialogue (Stewart), Jeff Webster, Rondo Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film is in some ways reminiscent of the "River Bend" (1952), also in the Mann-Stewart, but I found it much less sentimental and more interesting. There are several warning: too-quickly wrapped (and rather sentimental) end; 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not very convincing as the naive French teenager, and, of course, the film takes place in the Mythic West, the land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics do not apply. But these trivial problems. James Stewart is surprisingly good as dark, separated man who thinks he cares for no one but himself, and the mountain scenery can not be beat. Lovely western costume drama.
