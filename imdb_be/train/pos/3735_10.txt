Really touching story recruitment camps in America, where young people are preparing for the war in Vietnam. human study has always appealed to me, when it comes to war, because it carries a personal, subjective thoughts about the war, the war against militants, where the action is, and technical data is analyzed at the expense of the human factor. <br /> <br /> The film manages to put a new spin on an already ancient objects, and was able to distance themselves from conventional war movies, especially with a focus on anti-hero from the point of view of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic Bozz, who fight escapes sucked inhuman war machine, and to give up control over their destiny and fight for what he believes in, spend their energies in search of a way to avoid going abroad, both for himself and his comrades and in the end only to find their own cause, finally, the war ironically. The perfect irony. <br /> <br /> action really exceptional, and shooting documentary style almost make you feel transposed into a movie. In addition, the film will provide food for thought for those who are drunk in action movies or conventional military war-games enthusiasts, we hope, prompting some generation of minds, which, fortunately, escaped the terror recruitment.
