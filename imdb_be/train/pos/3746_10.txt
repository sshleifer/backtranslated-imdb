I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele amazing! My favorite part of the French song and the name of the opening, when the spatula soldiers shout "spoons" I crack up every time. I would recommend this film to Knox Klaymation fans and people who enjoy other movies Jason's style. His style is very original animation. It takes a few opinions notice detailed backgrounds. His humor and fun, and definitely not what you want to hear before. As Max deformed spatula, having a sound and light system in your head that the beams beautiful lights and happy music when he talks about his miserable life. This is a great animation to watch at any time, anywhere.
