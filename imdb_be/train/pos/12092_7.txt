I first remember this one back in the 70s, when he was featured on television late at night. Scared the hell out of me. But when I was a teenager, in those days, and not as jaded about the films, as I now <br /> <br /> CASTLE OF BLOOD. (AKA: Danse Macabre) is an excellent example of 60s Italian horror genre, along with Black Sunday Mario Bavami (1960), the damned of the Living Dead (aka: kill CHILD break) (1966) and Mario Kaiano ~ d Nightmare CASTLE (1965 ). If you want the ghost of the atmosphere along with great writing, and then check them out as well. I also see them in the ranks of those earlier films Poe, Roger Corman makes the same period. <br /> <br /> I have seen the new Synapse DVD, which was taken from the French press, and this is a big step forward compared to that old pan-scan and print, which has been making the rounds on TV for years. He adds a few minutes of dialogue (in French), which does not really add a lot in the movie as a whole, but it's good to see it full, unabridged. Unfortunately, DVD does not offer any additional services beyond stills. <br /> <br /> One blooper I noticed was in the first scene, seeing the smoke of human effects near the camera reflected in the glass front door of Inn. I believe that the editors do not catch it in time, or perhaps they do not care, but it's something I had not noticed the first time. This DVD wonders. You can see all flubs, errors or details that were not apparent to the first time around. But no matter. <br /> <br /> But no matter that has not yet been received 7 per meter IMDB <br /> <br />
