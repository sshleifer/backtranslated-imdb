CI 10 so 2 1/2 movie stars you ask? ... good to see this, and maybe it will make more sense .. Hitchcock never mixed scenes together better .... The film weaves together the scene flawlessly from the start and until you get that scattered feeling you sometimes get, when the film passes through you, many of the characters he is trying to develop. Do you feel that the characters will show you something different about themselves, and then they will not disappoint you if they do. surreal tale Screenwriter / producer Phil Hay's life mixes with absolutely stunning soundtrack makes think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than the film of the same name ... I will look for more good things from this manufacturer in the future.
