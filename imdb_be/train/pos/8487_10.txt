I remember watching «Gung Ho», as a child with my mother, and asks why she is always crying in the last few minutes. Of course, I found the whole movie hilarious, especially the manner of the characters. It was not until I was much older and looked it over, I realized how deeply this show really is. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Hedda Watanabe shine in their role as mediators reluctantly. Keaton ceases to amaze me with his style of real supply lines, and Watanabe adds humor and pathos of the mixture. I also thought that Patty Yasutaka (Umeki) was just fabulous in her role as a comic. <br /> <br /> I think this film is one of the most underrated films of 80-ies. We can all learn a lesson from the merger of the American and Japanese workers in this movie ... sometimes you really * can * have a "best of both worlds." And now I understand why my mother felt like she was doing at that time of closing. I would like one of these cars, too.
