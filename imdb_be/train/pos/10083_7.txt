The fact that this film was put on a DVD has been formatted to the TV with fuzzy picture really irritated many purists movies ...... and rightly so. It deserves much better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story of a street performer who needs a son to pass on their trade (rules of the day) and end with a little girl, instead of (not the usual path) .... and the problems that follow later. Old bought a child on a controlled auction and soon discovers that the child is not a boy, whom he obviously thought it was. <br /> <br /> old «Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is a kind of funny looks from a missing front tooth and an infectious smile. Little Girl "Dog» (Zhou Renying) is a cutie. the rest of the story, as two control thereafter. I usually like a good sentimental ending, but it gets a little carried away in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> as a whole, is a story involving complete with drama, thriller, humor and sadness. Just do not expect good picture quality for the money that you spend on the DVD. As long as he does not come in widescreen, rent it.
