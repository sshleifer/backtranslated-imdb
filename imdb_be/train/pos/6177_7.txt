Adapting the spirit of Eisner on the TV screen there are many other proposals developed based on comic pages or a comic strip. (Note that the two are not exactly the same average) It is really ironic that this is one and only adaptation (as of this writing) Aleko Eisner smart, wise cracking, hollow super hero. <br /> <br /> The story goes that the Republic Pictures was interested in the film version and has been in talks with the owner of the copyright in the mid-40s, "but they have never been able to close the deal. Ported the game screen was a serial, MARVEL mask, one of the best. Perhaps it was just as well, for this studio had a penchant for tinkering with the material, designed from the comics, pulp magazines, radio and comics. <br /> <br /> As for this 1987 made for television movie, it's pretty obvious that this was a bad pilot for a proposed TV series. While the old, long time comic reader, like me, can be a bit harsh adaptation criticism, the audience is not familiar with the character, may be able to provide some new observations, from any preconceived notions of what this film adaptation will look like . <br /> <br /> Well, while to sit and watch the story unfold, with characters that interact in the background of some of the crime wave, Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) nailed it with a single operator. "It can not make up your mind, if it is serious or not!" It's a pretty good description of the spirit and its founder, Mr. Will Eisner, a true creative genius in the comics. <br /> <br /> The film is a sincere attempt to put the world Eisner on the screen. Casting Denny Colt / the Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really well done. Although in the present situation, it was still in the tradition of the "good old days", how are the costumes, you know, when men and women still wore hats! This raises the point, one final (and winding), and that the director and the production made a conscious effort, and failed to give the characters Will Eisner looks as facial expressions and body language. We say Kudos to them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It's just too bad that there was not a series! Oh well, in today's world of movies, comic adaptations seem to be a hot spot. Maybe some of the largest manufacturer of the timer and the director can make a really 1st class SPIRIT production for the big screen. We can only hope <br /> <br /> UPDATE :. Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 2008/04/06. By now, everyone who goes to the cinema multiplex in the mall saw a poster advertising a new movie spirit (subheading, MY CITY shouting); that Christmas 2008 is to be released Well, we can see just what we are talking about. Just keep your fingers crossed! TO BE CONTINUED ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: We have seen the new film, colors are written and directed by Frank Miller of the Spirit a few days ago. Well, we got our wish; but it's a good thing or a different case, "Be careful what you ask for because you might get it?" Please read our review elsewhere in IMDb.com. THANK YOU!
