Expecting to see another film with an average Nunsploitation abbess of abuse and torture their ward, Flavius ​​was much more than I expected. <br /> <br /> This is actually a feminist storyline, although I do not think there is such a term in an era in which the film is set. This, of course, was not practiced. Women (and Jews and the poor) really killed, and locked in an unqualified place in society. Throughout history, the Sun's sister Flavia (Balkan) witnesses the tyranny of his time, until she just can not sit there anymore and actually doing something about it, though, and with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> previous credit sequence has Flavia as a young teenager near a battlefield. She sees a wounded "evil" Muslim soldiers (one of the few still alive) and tries to help him. Before she could, her hatred of the father behead soldiers and waves his head in her face (large family dynamics, huh?). After that, her father forces her to enter a convent, where she sees more injustice. Although the scenes do involve violence, rape and nuns, I think this is more than a historical drama Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> In fact, many of the ingredients for a bad operation part is there, but the action, the camera-work, the story and the music is too good to keep it at this level. Most of the "nun" movies that I have seen, as a rule, have a basic premise: good girl like a wind in the convent where the abbess is the ultimate bitch that loves to whip people and / or make their lives hell <. br /> <br /> Flavia spends most of the first part of the movie, he passively questioning all the atrocities going on around her. Most of its passivity forgotten when she met with a strong spirit (but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside, as I do, but it is much easier for the guys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims to attack their abbey, Flavia and Agate not shrink in fear, like the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as their liberator (cruelty and slavery around the Abbey). In fact, it is a Christian, not a Muslim invader that permeates my dear sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> This is the death of Agatha, which sends Flavia its violent crusade against those who oppress her ... Her father treats her like dirt. Her Muslim lover, desert her in a very inconvenient time. I do not want to give too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and upset conclusion. This is a great movie, so do not be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as a trash epics. Besides, how on earth could a film with Balkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I am not familiar with other work Cazares, but Sister Agatha hell character. <br /> <br /> I have read many excellent reviews (US) Synapse issue, but I love my German X-rated cult of DVD copy. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but actually has a bit more information on the image of the ribs than the release <br /> <br /> synapses, and there are also many wonderful, wise or funny lines of dialogue (many Sister Agatha. ) <br /> <br /> «Why did God male? Father, Son and Holy Spirit ?? They are all men! »-Flavia <br /> <br />« These people afraid- look at them, Sister- Fearing their power will be taken away from them! »-Sr. Agatha (against Christians, who fled after the Muslims come) <br /> <br /> «Woman, where are you going? Muslims can not do anything for you, that Christians did not! Ha-ha-ha! »-Sr. Agate (a group of Christian women fleeing) <br /> <br /> «God bless these Moslems- for terrorizing these pompous Christians.» -Flavia <br /> <br /> «It carries if the mere sight of a Muslim to make you $ h! T your underwear? »-Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> The final message: "Flavia Gaetani, entirely Muslim - no longer a Christian - had been executed as a runaway nuns idea of ​​the film came from the events that occurred during the invasion of Italy Musalman climax. what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of Otranto AT 800 "
