I first watched stepping movies when I was about 8 years old, and I thought how Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they should be in any case, because, as watching movies, I tried to learn as much about real Sheriff Buford Pusser, as I can. All 3 of the film gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a hero, I just wish he were alive today, and that there were more people like him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crimes and to be so bold. I am sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. My heart goes out to them. Thus, a 30-year-old fan Sheriff Pusser and 3 of the Walking Tall movie and the actor portraying him, please do not be negative about these films and the actors, they are just trying to give us to know what a wonderful person real Buford Pusser it was the fact that the large family he had. And all the young people who may not have heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the movie and walking to know more about it.
