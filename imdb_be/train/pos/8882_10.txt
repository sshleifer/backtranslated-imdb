best film of John Singleton to remake blockbusters like wannabees shaft is reflection film with a total more action and excellent balance between the stories of the 3 main characters, each identified by a teenage problems. <br /> <br /> What we liked most is that it also covers selfpity problem among young blacks, the problem is largely ignored by the media and other films, which are mainly focused on the socio-economic problems and racism from whites. This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> power things about this film is that it has to deal with so many topics without getting shallow. It is not only about racism and how difficult it can be to accept the new world (college), date rape, showing sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rappaport and Kristy Swanson each provide excellent performance, and the supporting cast is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly as the Les (s) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes, as a college tramps, causing minor disturbances. <br /> <br /> the only negative caricature of Professor Laurence Fishburne ( «Peppermint?»). Of course, a lot of nutty professors. But they are not so flat. Skinheads also a bit of a caricature, but I think they look like in real life, too. <br /> <br /> In general, a large piece of undervalued filmwork, if you like American History X, you'll love this one. <br /> <br /> 8,5 10
