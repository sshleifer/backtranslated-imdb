I was lucky enough to catch this film while volunteering at the festival Maryland Film. I've always been a supporter of the classic horror films, and especially the tricks of William Castle, so it was definitely a must-see for me. <br /> <br /> It is about the life and work of William Castle, in my view, been underestimated director. However, he did some cheap budget schlocky horror movies, but he added something to these films: real live theatrical tricks that you do not see anymore. For example, he had the nurse in case someone had a heart attack in his films and put the vibrator in the bottoms of chairs in tingler. <br /> <br /> This is a really well-made documentary and brings this quite shaded director in the world, and to celebrate his contribution to the horror cinema. He also draws the castle as a larger than life character who was very well-liked and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most documentaries, which mostly show a will of film historians, spine tingler! It features interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. We must see classic horror and science fiction fans.
