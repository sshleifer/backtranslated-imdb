I was not born until 4 years after this great show first aired, but fortunately, I was able to catch the repeats in the middle of the 90s, and the rest is history ...... I was hooked. The room was quite simple; two seasoned agents Nemesis, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are partnering with an expert (if not younger) Doctor and Biologist (Sharron Macready) to go for the bamboo curtain to get a dangerous biological agent by the use of red porcelain . While making their escape, their plane came under machine-gun fire, and they crash into the heart of the Himalayas, where their lives are saved by the mysterious and previously undiscovered civilization that heal and strengthen the sense of the trio, thus setting the stage for many exciting adventure ahead ... <br /> <br /> The series lasted 30 episodes an hour long, and I believe that it was his relatively short time, in a single pass of the season that made him a cult status. <br /> <br /> Monty Berman producer, has been known to do things as cheaply as possible, and sometimes show suffered for it's incredibly tacky sets - especially in episodes such as «Happening» (Studio replaces the Australian outback) and 'kits of Dreams operation "Deep Freeze" and "Home", but if you can get past that and focus on the characters and storylines, the show was a lot of fun. It was the perfect combination of adventure, and a lot of quiet humor (mostly from some stunning liners from William Gaunt) <br /> <br /> Chemistry of three wires was fantastic. - you get the feeling that they were really having a lot of fun doing the show, and this is confirmed in the reunion documentary in 2005, where the three are reunited after more than 35 years to remember about the show (and laugh about Anthony Nichols terrible wig !!). they all share the same time on the screen and all had their moments to shine. I must say that I have always been a supporter of Richard Barrett - I loved his caustic humor with this dangerous point - he was, of course, a man whom you do not overlap, and those eyes ........ The Bluest eyes, you are likely to see on TV. In addition, I followed the career of Bill ghosts interest since. Nevertheless, Craig Stirling, of course, would have had his legion of fans, and I'm sure Bastedo was a whole queue of male admirers swooning over it, too. <br /> <br /> The show also had many guest stars to encourage. with, including Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wingard, Bert Kwak, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Lind, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely <br /> <br /> There are scenes for me were: "Auto Kill "" Interrogation, "" fanatics, "" The Mission "and" gilded cage ", but I am sure that each one has their personal favorites. <br /> <br /> If you get the opportunity to watch this show for the first time, or re-watch it many years later, remember to look at it in the context of the time it was done, and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and chemistry three findings is that made it a great show for me, and I do not think that I never tire of it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
