This film is not trash, despite the fantastic production of Luo and his relationship with TROMA productions. Dark fairy tale for adults. Operation topic of sugar cookies, and asks if the roll does not become a victim of said subject. Amazing movie with enticing visuals: shadows and contrast is visible. Definitely worth a look, especially for fans of Warhol and stylish decadence. Through all the cruelty and lawlessness, moral, albeit twisted, it can be gleamed.
