After not seen the previous two Bourne films in the trilogy, I was a bit reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However, it was a very exciting experience, and I did not have the problem, not understanding what was going on because of not seeing the first two films. Each part of the story was easy to understand, and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum, before he reached the interval! I do not think I've ever seen such exquisitely made, and exciting movie, especially action movie. Since I usually shy away from the action and thriller type movie, it was such good news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most exciting films, she captures the attention from the first second to the last minute before the credits roll. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was just fantastic as his role of Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances in Bourne 1 + 2, and now this fabulous actor another one to add to your list. I'm looking forward to see more of it in future movies <br /> <br /> Tricks have been treated in the style -. Each of them was brilliantly done, and I was shocked by this respectable film. Well done.
