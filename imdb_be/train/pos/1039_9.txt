I saw this movie a few times and watched it today (on the) solely because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is a very underrated actress, and I must admit, I was in love with her since I first saw it (possibly in "Wuthering Heights" 40 or more years ago). The real star in this film, however, Paul Lukas, and he deserves all the awards he has received. He makes it clear, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Nazism had to be stopped, and all that helped to make it was good. He gave his children a line about how bad and that they should not be bad, but, as he said earlier, dealing with adults, he would do this kind of thing again without hesitation. Lucas did give a great image of a man who got into this situation, and made it clear that he did, it was a very difficult thing to do. <br /> <br /> Some people think that he was the victim of the Nazis, but I don "t think - I think it was only after money. His Nazi colleagues knew that, and that's why they do not have much use for it. <br /> <br /> One interesting point in the movie, and probably also in the game, is the fact that Müller (Lucas) is a German. While the anti-German hysteria of the First World War was not repeated in the Second World War, there was considerable anti-German sentiment, and some Germans hiding like the one that occurred in California with people of Japanese descent. It was something an act of courage for Hellman, to write a play about good Germans at this time (maybe she thought that they were the ones who signed the German-Soviet pact!). In the end, the British military and the US Air Force and bombed German cities and having no doubts about the killing of innocent civilians. I think, however, that the bombing of Dresden and the fire occurred later, after the "Watch on the Rhine" was released. <br /> <br /> The name is something of a pun, as "clock" look west from Germany. In fact, I watch Rhein was the German army marching songs - used during World War II, but the Nazis had their own marching song, which was used as well. But Mueller German, and he is engaged in his "Wah am Rhein» <br /> <br /> All the other actors did an excellent job here. Bodo although there were too many have children like him. I am surprised that he did not give the secret of his father away. In real life, he can very well do it.
