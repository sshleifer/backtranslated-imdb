Monstervision was a show that I grew up. With late night hosting with Penn and Teller on one, single, Joe Bob Briggs. The show kept me on Friday night back in my high school years, and provided some of the best drive-in memory to ever outside the screwing. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the best late night television ever. If you do not stay, you're missing. <br /> <br /> I know, John Bloom and Joe Bob live, but I want them to where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... Does anyone else to sit through 4 hours of «The Swarm»? d :) <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
