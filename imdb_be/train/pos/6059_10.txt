This is a great documentary, full of race action beautiful pictures and great stories. IMAX camera gives you a very broad perspective, as the DVD movie is perfect. Your hear each speaker is working almost constantly, the film is not accelerated and just gives a natural feeling of 230mph. Of course, there are some sound effects added, but I think they are good, they give depth motor scenes ...
