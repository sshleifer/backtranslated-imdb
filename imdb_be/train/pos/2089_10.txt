«The Good Earth» is a great movie that you do not hear much about anymore. There are a lot of major disasters and events, but it is also a non-passionate love story. All this takes place in a little over two hours, which is short by today's standards. Special effects and costumes are very good for a period of time. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Luise Rainer won an Oscar for a marginal role. It basically only three emotions: .. humble, hungry and broken heart <br /> <br /> The performances of Asian and Asian-American actors terrible <br /> <br />
