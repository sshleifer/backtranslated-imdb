Perhaps my favorite film, the story of dedication, sacrifice and devotion to a noble cause, but it is not instructive or sad. He just never gets old, despite my seeing him about 15 or more times in the last 25 years. performance of Paul Lucas brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of his very few really nice role, it is a delight. Children are like Grandma says, more like a "midget dressed" than in children, but it only makes them more interesting to watch. And slowly wakes up to the mother what is happening in the world, and under its own roof believable and strange. If I had a dozen thumbs, they would be "up" for this film.
