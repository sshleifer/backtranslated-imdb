this film is a masterpiece of the history of a young woman during the war, and it's really going to happen, not like in the movies, but it's a great story, I had to hit the film, acting and stories, where the more I love this film because it is a true story, Giffen is my feeling that I was there, and I feel sorry for the co-rector, who plays Maruschka Detmers, because who wants to end his life in such a way here. I recommend that everyone should see this film, especially the young and we learn something from this film. This film can be compared whit soldier film of orange or a true story that occurred in the 2.
