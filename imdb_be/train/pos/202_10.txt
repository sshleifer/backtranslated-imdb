Giving the film 10/10, because it deserves 10/10. Two of the best actors of his time Matthau and George Burns to work with Neil Simon and all the other participants, who in this film directed by Herbert Ross + and everything that makes the stage come true adaptation. Sunlight Boys is one of the best 70's movies. I love the type of humor in this film, it just makes me laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> I got this film on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS, because it was cheaper only $ 3). I watched, as soon as I got home, but I had to watch it again, because I kept missing a few pieces for the first time. The second time I looked, he felt much better, and I laughed a lot harder. I'm definitely going to get it again on DVD, because I have to see the features. <br /> <br /> It is very funny how it happens. Two people working together as an entertainer / actor / songwriter. They get along well on the stage, but in fact to argue from the scene, they can not survive even a moment with each other, then about 15 years later, you want to combine them on a TV special. You may find that in this movie. Matthau & Burns was excellent in this film. It's very sad, they died. George Burns deserved Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance. He was also 78 when this film was made. Until now, he is the oldest actor, who won an Academy Award in old age. Jessica Tandy breaks record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. He earned a Golden Globe. Although many people may not agree with what I wanted to say, all gave good results in this movie. This comedy is a classic. I highly recommend it. Another thing: who hates this film is «Putz»
