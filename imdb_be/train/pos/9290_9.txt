It is very not the film for which John Wayne famous. He plays a diplomat, a person who gets things done through words and persuasion, rather than physical action. The film moves with a quiet realism through it looks uninteresting story. <br /> <br /> For unbiased, patient and thoughtful, this film is a rich image of the intriguing stories. <br /> <br /> There are two interwoven stories. Great story internalized, isolationist Japan and exported expansionist America confronted if their interests conflict. A small man, the story of an outsider Barbarian (Wayne) and the initial hostility civilized geisha and loves turning to mutual respect and love. Human history is a reflection of the larger story of the two peoples. <br /> <br /> The film is very well done, and all the actors play their roles well. The two leading roles are performed to perfection. John Wayne well as Townsend Harris, striking exactly the right combination of strength and negotiations in relations with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is as beautiful as the geisha name, charming and beautiful. The interaction between her character and John Wayne is especially good at drawing. This is exactly how these two people (as they are depicted in the film) would behave. <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. It lacks all the pomp. and realistic portrayal of how it could happen depicted events. The characters of these people who are not bashful "great" leaders of history. Furthermore, collision of interests and cultures depicted with great skill and fineness. Indeed, the clash of a traditionalist, and traditionally powerful isolationist Japan, and rising, the newly powerful country from overseas summed very well in an exchange between John Wayne and local Japanese tycoon. Wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors beheaded when they land in Japan, and that the ships pass can not even put into port for water. Baron says that Japan just wants to be left alone. character Wayne says that Japan is at a major crossroads of international traffic, and that if this continues, as before the nation will be seen as nothing more than a group of thieves have flooded an important bridge. A real review of what way the two countries are each saw themselves as the right, and saw others in error. The final clash of two self-righteous people with opposing interests have their own ideas throughout history, which continues a theme that echoes in the present and in the <br /> <br /> cinema and drawing the mid-nineteenth century, Japan is coming. accelerated growth of industrialization, which was to follow at the end of the century, is superb. Visual pleasure and enlightening understanding of Japanese ancient civilization. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend to anyone, whether it's a fan of John Wayne or not, watch this movie if you get the chance. Just be aware that this is not an action movie. This view is an interesting place and time in history, and is slowly boiling a love story, which (to my surprise) begins to dominate the personal lives of the two protagonists. See this film, in fact, without prejudice, immerse yourself in the story, and you will fully enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie.
