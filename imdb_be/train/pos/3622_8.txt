I knew I was going to see it, when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one of the reasons, but the theme of the dream to speak to me. People talk about it as a film for children, but I think it's a film for the baby boomers, who are coming to terms with aging, ailing parents, our own mortality, our children are growing up and leaving us, and all the other things that we We never thought it would happen to us. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of the tragedy; is that to live your dream means that if you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid too small for a pitcher, but he does it look good, and Rachel Griffiths does a small part as a wife in a thoughtful, layered performance. The camera-work is slow and sweet. If they put this movie together, they came out of nothing, that there was no need. Very good.
