Kafkaesque thriller alienation and paranoia. Very well done, and Polanski also performs a shy introvert, who is trying hard to adjust to his dim apartment in Paris and his colleagues tenants. Monstrous early due to imaginary average and selfish fellow citizens and affecting later when he develops his defenses, which will eventually be his undoing. Personally, I could do without changing the cross-member, but I take a bow Psycho and the fact that it was some logic, referring to the plot. Nevertheless, he could work without a little removed and used theatrical element, but then maybe it was supposed to, because yard, of course, seems to take on the appearance of the theater at the end. I can not feel that there are more than a few of their own feelings of the director to be "real" French and Jewish shoe. However, there's plenty to enjoy here including the excellent performance of the magnificent looking Isabelle Adjani and the good old Shelley Winters is as reliable as ever.
