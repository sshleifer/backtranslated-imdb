Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and dead Vicki Moriah are human stars of this film about a young man looking for answers about the death of his brother. Tires Mr, Mr Margolin and Mor'e all turn in the first rate performances in their respective roles; Phillips has a little less than enviable task of trying to revive the film made for television (twenty-five years ago), by filing a "sex interest" otherwise sexless movie. The real star, however, is «California Kid»; 1934 Ford coupe, borrowed from "Jake» Jacobs, put the camera and gave a workout that will leave the viewer heavy breathing, shortness of breath and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are impressive (although some of the dialog is a bit weak), which makes for a nice evening of distraction. That's how all the "movie car" should be done <br /> <br /> Try to catch the end of the film on the channel. it is well worth the missed sleep.
