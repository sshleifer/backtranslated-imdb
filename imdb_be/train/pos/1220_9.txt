Origin of Care Bears and their cousins. If you've seen the original film, you'll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins ​​rise bears care rather than meeting them later. However, I have no problem with it, preferring to consider movies as individual interpretation. Babies are adorable and it's fun to watch them play and grow. My favorite Swift rabbit heart. Villain perfectly menacing werewolf. I could empathize with her three children, since I was never good at sports, too. Cree Summer well as Christie. Sweet and catchy songs. If you have an open heart, love toys or use the original, it is not to be missed. 9/10
