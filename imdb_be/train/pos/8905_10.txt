Old horror movies interesting, a lot of screaming, a lot of screaming, a lot of humor to go along with it. "Drop" is a classic in its own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) played a teenager who is trying to be a hero in the city. Going on a date with his girlfriend fairly typical for all adolescents. But if the old man finds the same object provides form the sky, he ends up being the victim, and Steve makes it the best it can. If it is to teen power, this film does provide it. I know that most teens have their own difficulties when they act up, when danger comes, they have to learn to forget the past and start to do something good, to save mankind. If the adults in eventually learn the hard way about the "drop" running amok, they must learn to trust young people and not allow their behavior to get the best of them. Oozing Juggernaut was quite nice in the day, and, in my opinion, I think it was Jell-O! If all the pitches to stop the threat, the city is safe again, thanks to the good old cooperation. I still eat jelly and watch this movie all the time if you do not like jelly, RELIABILITY! 5 star rating
