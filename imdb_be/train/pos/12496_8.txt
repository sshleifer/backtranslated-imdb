Over the years we have seen every horror film that comes out of Hollywood dull retread as Saw 2, terrible indie releases that are completely unique ... we suffer through all the bad movies, hoping to find little gems like «Dark residues" . <br /> <br /> We were able to catch a showing of the film in Shriekfest 2005. loved it public, and I believe that ultimately win the award for best film. <br /> <br /> although this may not be budget studio film or star, it packs a serious punch in a terrible atmosphere and panic katego zijfu. Actions and cinematography the highest class, but this is the direction that makes this film worth seeing. The story and characters are developed just the right pace to provide some fantastic horror stories. <br /> <br /> editing and visual FX Summit also . although many horror movies can not use music in their favor, the price for «Dark Remains» only adds to this horror. <br /> <br /> I know that the film is shown on a bunch of festivals, but none were near me, so I can not wait to hear if he will finally be O dit on DVD. Believe me, even if you are tired of the current state of horror films, give it a try ... you will not regret it!
