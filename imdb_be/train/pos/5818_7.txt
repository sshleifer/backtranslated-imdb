In fact, this film is my silly moments, like in the claymation parts, and Joe Pesci, and the children's part, and it is much worse than in other MZhah films as «The Wiz», «Captain AI" and "Ghosts". But as tenacious Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years (Yes, that's half of my life, you guys!), I can not complain too much about it. Just seeing this great guy and hear his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. But as the film is not good, and I'm afraid that it will get much lower quality for me, when my dear Mike was not alone in the lead role in it. But since no one but Mike rover, he should get 7 out of 10 from me.
