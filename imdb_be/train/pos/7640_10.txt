Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 stars <br /> <br /> The theme of "Mr. Destiny" return of the many films that cover the many different years. Its theme is in the range from the last parody of such sites (see "Scrooged"), in addition, a more serious and dramatic views, who worked in "It's a Wonderful Life," a hundred years ago in the history of Scrooge, as Charles said, Dickens "A Christmas Carol". "This includes the ungrateful man driven on a tour of his life and witnessed how his life could be (or would have) firsthand. <br /> <br /> In most of these types of films in a guardian angel rescues man from the ingratitude and shows him his life in retrospect, or how it could be. If. would. in this case we have shown by a businessman named Larry (James Belushi). He hates his life. He lives with his uninteresting wife (Linda Hamilton) and tends to be more life with more meaning. If he hit the ball at the state championships in high school years ago. he is convinced that his life would be better. I think he remember this seemingly small moment of his life, because he has made a great impact on the part of his subconscious, but I doubt that a grown man would miss a high school certificate. However, it works in the movies. <br /> <br /> In any case, Larry rides home from work one night, where he stuffer with Jon Lovitz, if this greeting s car breaks down. He walks into a bar, looking for a pay phone, and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender (Michael Caine) about how his life produces. Here we first see him remember his childhood baseball blow-out. <br /> <br /> bartender listens and nods his head, apparently without having to worry about any other clients. This is probably due to the fact that the bar, albeit old and ragged, never seems to have been occupied by the living people to save these two men. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about never having seen a bar before. It is likely, for a reason that the audience waits before Larry. <br /> <br /> So, the bartender, who just might be an angel of God incarnate as Clarence, Larry captures his special drink, which ends up putting the life of Larry on the reverse, showing him that his life had been, as if he hit a home run all those years before. But Larry has not the slightest idea of ​​any changes in the first, as well as Jimmy Stewart did not understand that Clarence rubbed his life, until he went to the bar and threw Larry is still not paying attention to any changes as long as he does not go to his home to find another lawn outside, and a great wrestler type of person who takes it home. <br /> <br /> Larry soon finds out that his life would have been very different indeed, if he had hit a home run. Rather than marry Linda Hamilton, he married Rene Russo and moved to a large house with the children. He learns that Jon Lovitz is not his friend, but his employee. And most surprising of all, that with his new life, that Larry always wanted to ... he feels thirsty after his older wife, Linda Hamilton; proof that sometimes the money and look great even shallow wife does not make everything in a person's life as intelligent and wife love and true happiness. Just as "It's a Wonderful Life" showed the audience a person's life is that he was doing, and that everyone has an impact on people, "Mr. Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth, the lesson taught us again and again, but not quite so fluffy, forgettable and really sweet, as we have shown in the "Mr. destiny". <br /> <br /> «Mr. Destiny" never very funny, but it's sweet, good-natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously. The problem with all "It's a Wonderful Life" retreads out there as «The Family Man» is that they are trying to be as powerful and memorable as "It's a Wonderful Life" was. But there's only so many times you can single-handedly disrupt known film, and "Mr. Destiny" is aware of this, and plays on the right. He does not try to be anything it is not; rather, it is the fact that he was not trying to be, and it is obvious to the audience. <br /> <br />
