I was amazed at how a movie can be a cheesy and wonderful at the same time. Frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, but the special effects when Krell attacked were surprising for a film that was made more than half a century ago! Life in the Middle East, I saw shades of Islam creep when JJ Adams suggested Alt should dress modestly, and as an engineer, was struck by the presentation used for the "futuristic" gadgets and gizmos invented props department. In general, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing a dude and a chance to see Leslie Nielsen as a "young" man
