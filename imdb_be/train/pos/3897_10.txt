This video was my first encounter with Eddie Izzard. We had a couple of friends for one night, but for some reason or the other was the channel moved to HBO for the evening. Someone named "Eddie Izzard" on.I was trying not to laugh too loud in the first few jokes. I do not want to bear the "responsibility" for the rest of the group to meet something that was obviously killing me. After holding in my laughter more than was healthy, I was let go - like the other of us (we do not beat the way, and not to mention insurance and pensions ...). We panted after. Storylines, plot, bizarre yet creative connections on all sketches are not other than gloss. I have since become addicted to each Eddie Izzard-piece-of-the-comedy I can get my hands on. His work exists genius. His comedy seems easy. He seems more like that hysterically funny one hanging in your home and rambling about this or that ... it convulsively funny. He gives the impression that a joke between you and .. he only real fans of humor, after all. If you are disappointed in this video, you do not have a sense of humor in the penultimate - or humor, as they say in the UK.
