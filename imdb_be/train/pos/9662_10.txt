A longtime fan of Bette Midler, I have to say it saved my favorite concerts. Betty delights us with his jokes and brings us to tears with his ballads. Literal rainbow of emotions and talent, Betty shows us her best from her solid repertoire as well as new songs from "Betty Rose" album. Spanning generations, it offers something for everyone. One and only Divine Diva proves here that it is the most intensely talented performer around.
