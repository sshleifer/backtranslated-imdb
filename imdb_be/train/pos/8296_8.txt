All Suburbia in an idyllic, small family moved to the father got a new job at a computer company there. But none of paradise would not be complete without the snake. Strange things are happening as a family joins the local country club without the man, because he certainly has secrets. Father is not a joiner, but the pressure on him to join, as all anyone in the area, and at work, are members. good guy of the Robert Urich is a bit cool, but Joanna Cassidy as a good-natured housewife turning ugly hissing. Intense and well-made chiller Bitchy Lucci in the club chairman. Look out for the iconic Berryman in a cameo role as a valet. The film captures a sense of paranoia and special effects to the final to be expected. I saw this film quite a few times.
