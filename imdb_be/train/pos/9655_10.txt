It may be "almost nothing" is not the best movie ever made ... But it is better than many of you have said. I still have not seen a homo-themed film is better than this one. <br /> <br /> You Americans are accustomed to look very narrative films with a clear beginning, development and outcome. But European films less descriptive, but make a lot of thinking and feeling. <br /> <br /> Many of you have not understood the meaning of the film .. The aim of this friend did not show us a "summer loving cinema", with commercial characters who "fall in love and live forever happy." Summer holidays and the beach is just a backdrop, and this film is aimed at a young boy who can feel identified with these boys. <br /> <br /> Maybe some of you do not understand so well this film, because of him- parts, shown as a flashback. These 3 points: - Summertime in Pornichet, when they meet, and love. - After six years of living together in Nantes, Mathieu does not go to the very mental. He's trying to make suicide something, and Cedric brings him to the hospital. Later, he is talking to a psychiatrist to find the cause of it made it. -. In the last part, when Mathieu back to Pornichet, winter, alone .. to think about how his life has changed, how his life was to be and trying to find yourself <br /> <br /> It is possible that some people do not You can understand, it's all good, because all the scenes are mixed between them. But in any case, as I said ... it's not a funny movie. If what one wants to see the meat, for this we have BelAmi movies. <br /> <br /> Almost anything that they want to show us how hard life can be for a little boy, who is not sure about his feelings and not sure what to do in life. Mother just wants to get away from home, and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him happiness .. But that seemed perfect in the beginning .. later is not as good as he thought, and he became restless and feel he was lost in his life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do, or something that makes him happy. In the end, he gets depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, it's ridiculous? Nha funny movie. Very hot scene? only a few .. but this is not a movie for entertainment. It's all about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, misery, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel identified with the life and problems of Mathieu, and that's what the director wanted to make a movie .. that show us the harsh reality of the boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me the best homo-themed film ever.
