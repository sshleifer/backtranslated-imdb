I think this film is very funny movie, and one of the best films "National Comedian", he also has a very catchy title parody that basically sums up the entire film about .... Men in white !!!! History parody of many films, including the film of Smith, as you probably guessed, "Men in Black". I will not give the ending away, but it has a very good ending to a very funny (Leslie Nielsen style of humor) from beginning to end, especially the bit near the start, when your on the street, collecting dustbins (trash cans). In addition, they have a fairly steep Dustbin Truck (Garbage Truck Collect) in this scene too. Act is not great, in fact, is not very good, but that's what makes the movie funny, it's a comedy, relax !! I love the story line, in part because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (or should that be Un-thin), they rip off all the other movies. I'm a big fan of AEs, serious falsification of films, but I am also a supporter of the real thing, and with these films, it is difficult to decide which is better, the film is basically rips (I mentioned before this review) or the actual movie is, but if you are actually doing a parody of comedy films, in fact, it makes it even more difficult, but this film carries it successfully. Two garbage men are so funny, it reminds me of the TV sketch show in the UK called the «Little Britain». This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best story, the film National Lampoon today !!
