I loved it! McMurray beautiful as Skid Johnson, some arrogant, but proud at the same time very vulnerable saxophonist, who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always there for him. They are found in Panama after Maggie off the ship and end up in the bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony gets punched in the nose after she insults Maggie, thinking her a loose woman - all because she took off her hat in public. A big fight and Maggie end up stuck in Panama. Romance. Carol and Arthur perfectly together. Maggie is always there for him when he needed her. She convinces him to go to New York, where (good to watch a movie and learn). They have these wonderful scene together, where she sings in his hands when he plays the saxophone. I would definitely recommend.
