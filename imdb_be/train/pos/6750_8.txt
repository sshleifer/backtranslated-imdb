This is a very well-made film, well directed, and with some excellent character acting that sometimes very touching - for example, the scene with a loyal but inexperienced buddy cop and his wife. The plot is clearly designed and exciting. Gangster character is particularly interesting and plays almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero. He made it clear that the cops just as rough and ready as underworld characters <br /> <br /> A couple of minor reservations :. I found the ending a little one-sided, as it marks the successful integration of the hero in the structure of the police and justice system, which destroyed the ambiguity of police characters that have been stored up to that point. In addition, I found that the leading female character is rather weak: a little more than a catalyst in order to save the hero, whatever it is, it seems, does cry and swoon as the cool kids fight.
