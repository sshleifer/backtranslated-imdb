I first caught the film on its first run on HBO in (probably) in 1981 and the next 15 years, I thought that movie was hilarious. I remember seeing pictures of Alfred Newman, mentioned in the theatrical trailers. If MAD Magazine satired movie and suddenly stopped half-way through an apology from the "usual gang" to reduce himself satire of such a piece of crap, I just assumed that they were making fun of him, I'm sure they were, but they seriously find (and Ron Liebman) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credit, I was very surprised. Of course, there are many worse movies that will be associated with. Watching a movie on the video now (at age 32) to MAD links restored, I still get a kick out of it. And the future fan Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, where Poppa?) I think it was his performances Pearl (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
