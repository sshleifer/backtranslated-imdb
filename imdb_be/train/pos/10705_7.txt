Trailer of the film did not do the film justice. And although the film did not know what he really wanted to get across, the first half of the film is a light romantic comedy and the second is more serious, romantic drama, the overall effect was much better than I thought it would will be. This film was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it to a large extent the thriller, which he never appeared. Kidman, being one of my favorite, of course, I'm biased, but this movie was easy, sensitive, when a few quirky film that deserves better. Three out of four stars. 9.5.02.
