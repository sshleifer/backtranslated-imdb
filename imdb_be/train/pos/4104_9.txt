It helps if you understand Czech, and you can see it in the original language and understand the Czechs obsession "Professionals", but if not, «Jedna Ruka netlaska» another great Czech film. It's funny, dark, and very pleasant. The highest compliment I can pay it is that you never know exactly what will happen next, and even keep that feels good in the second and third viewing. <br /> <br /> For a small country of the Czech Republic made a surprising number of world-class film and literature, with Hrabal, Hasek, and Kundera movie Menzel Svěrák and many others. Czech humor by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising, but often naive and warm feeling behind it. This film is just that, it's bad and has to deal with a less attractive part of the person, but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promises, good intentions and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this and most other projects Trojan and Machacek Enjoy participating in this film, made for just that reason. - in any case, it is as close as the Czechs ever to write a truly happy ending ...
