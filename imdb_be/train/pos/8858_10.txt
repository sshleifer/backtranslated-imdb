I have to admit that this type of film, which I usually shy away from, but I rented this is mainly due to the stars. Of course, I was not sorry. In fact, as you can see, I estimated it five stars. This film is a perfect blend of sharp direction and superb acting. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson brothers who decide to commit crimes uncouth rob their parents' jewelry store. Crime goes horribly wrong - thus beginning the examination of three men in the Hanson family. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn about Charles Hanson and come to understand the strained relationship between father and sons. <br /> <br /> younger brother, Hank basically screw up. He always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind. Hank is a dangerous, cowardly, and greatly influenced by his older brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank "nailed to the T" and gives what is probably his best performance so far. He shows us a man who basically kind, but under the influence of external forces, which he is unable to perform any important task <br /> <br /> Andy. - on the surface - it appears to be a successful businessman, but we soon discovered that he was addicted to drugs and was a waste of his company to pay for his habit. This is Andy, who comes up with a scheme to rob their parents' shop, and it gets sluggish Hank commit an act. Philip Seymour Hoffman - definitely one of the best actors of our time - playing Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to reflect the person who, on the surface, is a charming businessman like his friends, but the real slime ball down. It is absolutely perfect for the part of Andy and we can say that he, in his fine cast, made Andy ~ d undivided. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation. Charles Hanson is not bad or unfeeling man, but he has a lousy relationship with his sons, because he never knew what was needed in the education of the positive connection between his sons and himself. He was always too quick to criticize and admonish. He always made it clear that he favored his younger son at his age, thus causing a wide emotional gap between him and Andy. As we know, Charles and Andy, Andy thought of forming a plan to rob his father becomes less than incredible. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I can not believe how Charles Hanson reminded me of my father, and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and me. Perhaps, this may be one of the reasons why I enjoyed the film so much as the story of the distant, critical father, a successful older brother, and less successful younger brother hit so close to home. Fortunately, my brother and I had never come into the state of the crime against my suggestion, we Fathers made from Sterner and moral things. <br /> <br /> This complex entities and actions has been qualified to put together a film director Sidney Lumet. In eighty-three, he still has the chops to give the viewer a fascinating characters and blade seat action that is mesmerizing. 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years before the Games of the devil, but he has not lost a bit of its magic touch, showing us the characters that will be long remembered. <br /> <br /> events and characters of the game Devil's harsh and ugly, and it's certainly not a feel-good movie. However, it is two o'clock end entertainment, which I thoroughly recommend.
