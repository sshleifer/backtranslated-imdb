Early career Abe Lincoln beautifully presented Ford. Not that anyone alive has not seen the footage of the real Lincoln, but the Fonda, wearing a fake nose, unclean, like Lincoln, with the voice, delivery, walking, and other mannerisms - exactly as one might imagine Lincoln was . Ford, in the first of three consecutive films that he made with the Fonda, is at the top of their form, perfectly evoking the early 19th-century America. The story focuses on a couple accused of murder, Lincoln protects and the scene is very well done in the hall of the court. the supporting cast includes many of the regulars Ford. It was the last film of Alice Brady, since she died months after its release.
