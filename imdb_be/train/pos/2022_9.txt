The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that she is sexy up. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on the screen for some strange reason. Do they think that the public is too stupid to figure out if they were not shown all due right? In addition, it is very good quality. All the actors are doing amazing work that brings his characters to life. For small women there, it is worth watching if only because, Toby Stephens, Gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen, I'd conveniently forgotten that I was still married to the minute I laid eyes on him ... <br /> <br /> Rod End scene in spoiler- funny twist, that happened in the book.
