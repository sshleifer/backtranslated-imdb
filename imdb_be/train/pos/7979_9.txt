Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally, I think he can be a little shouting and bad, and his work is obviously suffering, in comparison with the fact that it is quite well-known brother, but it is quite possibly the best of his film. <br /> <br /> what makes this film so great that Scott gives Denzel (on red-hot form, better than Training Day) and the discovery that Dakota Fanning is the time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. Set to absolutely not boring, but it takes time - is the involvement of, and takes us on a short journey into the characters - including the supreme role of Radha Mitchell as a mother. All this serves to make the action so much more efficient, since we are so invested in the characters, for all of them too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge of its entirety, rather than the police at the end too. <br /> <br /> The film will not, of course, not anything Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so much Duff roles when it is quite clear as well as almost every leading man there (I can only really think about something else, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on the power of the screen these days), this film was supposed to be huge, given his status and because of its performance and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if the studio Sun reserves the film to the hilt, he ends up going straight to video. I would get a chance to see it on the big screen.
