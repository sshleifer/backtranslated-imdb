Saved the life of being pimped by her father (.. and alcoholic waitress), who dies as a result of the explosion, Lilly States (Barbara Stanwyck, which is just perfect) unkempt its way through a branch within the banking business in the big city gote. If you belong to the murder of her lover, who was to be his next-in-law (and the new Lily's lover), the sky is the limit for Lily as she recorded her various relationships Entries and subtlety makes it known documents get that if a fee is not included in her hands. The newly appointed president of the bank, Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), sends Lille to Paris, rather than a product of a lot of dough, but soon finds himself madly in love after various meetings with her in love. This makes the Water Lily Company, as now it has reached the pedestal of success tempts man of wealth and prestige to bring the richness of its path. Although the circumstances that arise bring her to make a decision that jeopardizes its successful way to achieve these riches..Trenholm, it is now her husband, now accused in jail and probably lose the pot. He needs money Lily now has in its possession or it will not be anything at all. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the whole movie, although it is a usual polish Warner Brothers. Being set in the pre-Code era gives the filmmakers the opportunity to develop on taboo topics such as women using sex to succeed and how it can lead to tragedy. Good direction of Alfred E Green shows through the subtlety of a hint in different manners and speech through good actions of seductive performance Stanwyck the stage without actually showing an obvious act. Obviously, the film shows that money is not everything, and all that jazz, as love comes in the heart of the dead Lily heart. This is the end, Lily has to achieve excellent metamorphosis someone did not call me a true love. She spent all this time to get to the platform only to fall to a man who was not essentially different from the other she used to him.
