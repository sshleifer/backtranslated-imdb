Thats My Bush is first of all a very interesting display of Parker and Stone, I thought. It is often very, very funny, and it is quite disruptive and crazy. South Park fans will surely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the price of the product here. A lot of money to be put into it, and it shows. Many dear little details. He was not a little show. And Comedy Central channel is not very rich, but they put a lot on the show, apparently. In a sense, I understand that was the death of the show, and the truth, too costy. This, of course, could be done more cheaply and went on the loose was there. <br /> <br /> critics liked it, and it was his few supporters, but he does not get a large audience. As you know, the show stopped after 8 episodes, I think, almost 1 season. <br /> <br /> How can I really enjoyed the show it does have its drawbacks. The problem shows pretend that he does not know what he wants to be in reality. Its like he's trying to be a sitcom parody sitcom simultaneously. The actors do a good job, and some of them are well-cast, but, in my opinion, they do not seem to always receive 100% of the bizarre humor, they must submit. <br /> <br /> I personally think that the show needed some characters that were more down to earth for the show to work. In South Park you've got Kyle and Stan, which are a kind of realistic flying in a Looney universe. I think that's kind of what makes South Park job. You need sensible characters that you can relate to realistic and making crazy things much more interesting, because it makes you too take them seriously on some level. If all the archetypes and stereotypes it difficult emotionally included in the show, which is actually Thats My Bush is the biggest problem. Kyle and Stan South Park characters, making sense of the madness of the show. We do not have anything like that here, and this show is suffering from it. <br /> <br /> Another anchorpoint Parker and stones flirt with Republicans. Its only about them, I do not get what they're trying to do. Nha painting Bush as nothing more than a dumb Homer Simpson attractive character like subversive in a world where a lot of people who can not stand it, and think that it is worse than President Nixon, and parallel to the comedy world Letterman and so on, only mocks his every move ... but it is difficult to understand, when Parker and Stone really means that it is nothing. It's like a joke to us, but somehow did not hit the target. It seems awkward because it does not remind you of the real Bush at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, I actually thought that the show was very enjoyable. Some of the jokes are funny. On the life of a fan, which was aborted fetus survived, probably one of my favorite jokes them in any show. And the show is packed with great stuff, and sometimes incredibly funny, if you use your head a little, watching him.
