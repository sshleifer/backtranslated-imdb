In romantic comedies go, it was nice and winning. I thought that the letter could be stronger, to create the final connection a little better, but it's not a huge point of the trip. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolfe give good performances and as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was just happy to see them cast as the romantic lead. I hope that I will see them throw in a few projects in the near future. <br /> <br /> In general, this film does not change your life, but a sweet, warm and winning. Not a bad thing to be at all.
