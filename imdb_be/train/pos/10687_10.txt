I must admit that I was totally shocked by this film. On the one hand, I went to see it on a whim, waiting for something mediocre, but considering this is the most shocking was the fact that it was in the populist American cinema in general. This is British comedy at its best - the dark, quirky and funny in a way that American films are simply not. I must stop here, however, I recommend it to any whole heart; I went to see it with a few people, some English, some European and some American and while some of us loved it (mainly from the first two groups), some hated it and found that it does not cost anything. If you think that this kind of thing, then go. If not, then not. 10/10.
