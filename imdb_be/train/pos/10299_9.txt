I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed my ass while Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I wanted him in his serious films, especially The Truman Show. It is a cross between one of his very funny side, and his serious side. He, of course, very funny in this movie, but there are details that are very serious, and he pulls it off with a lot of ease. he really multifunctional actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, I was pleased with the actor Jennifer Aniston. I think it is more than just a good pair of tits and a great ass. Morgan Freeman makes a very cool God. As for Steve Karel, his limited scenes are very funny, especially in the anchor stage. <br /> <br /> In general, I would rate at 9. Good acting, funny script and some very serious situation make it very good film.
