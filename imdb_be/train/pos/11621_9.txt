I was bored one night, and Red Eye was included and I thought why not. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best films for a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean, I just got into the film cause it was just so bright. <br /> <br /> history of the new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also has two large leads in the film with Rachel McAdams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> action just fine, and you get a feel for the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> music is just fine, it will give you chills and can also make you feel relax. <br /> <br /> I just love how the movie was just so well done, and it never gets boring. <br /> <br /> Red-eye simply phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> This is a great thriller. <br /> <br /> In general, I like Red Eye so much that I can watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> If you like Red Eye, then I recommend Electric and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 of 10 <br /> <br /> A great movie
