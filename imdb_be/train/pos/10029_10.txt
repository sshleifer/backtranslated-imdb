Why do people bitch about this film, not scary movies like The Godfather. Titanic's greatest film 21 Century.With great actor, director, effects, music and everything. This film is always reset all because one day someone said that they do not like is not the case in most countries of the world have decided to accept. There's nothing wrong with this film. All I can say is that this film is not only being the most heavily Oscar awarded movie of all time, the most money ever made ever, and, unfortunately, one of the most underrated movies that I have ever seen. Also, what is really the best movie of all time. Only movies that have come close to the way things Star Wars and Lord of the Rings or anything masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. It's all good films and directors, but none match up to James Cameron's Masterpiece TITANIC.
