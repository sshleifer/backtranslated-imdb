Nothing brilliant, innovative or groundbreaking, but «Dog Days» for any reason, research is extremely exciting character. It's like CRASH off on a bad dose of heroin, but not really. This Austrian film following the lives of several of depression, disturbed and annoyed people and their abusive relationship with one another. This is alarming, but very well acted, and it's fun to watch a crazy little thing these characters do. Certainly not for the faint of heart, this is a very pessimistic film does not give or enter into an opening in the end, we just see the life of these nasty people in two days. Grade: B
