"Almost nothing," is the story of two young boys fall in love during summer vacation on the beach. I do not want to say the story, because it's not that the most important thing in this movie (but you can be sure that this is an interesting and original). The best part of this film is the cinematography. The visual side of the "almost nothing" is so bizarre that it deserves the highest note. This leaves you fascinated by its beauty. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is shown in a non-uniform, a rather complicated manner. There is no simple chronology, nor have all the answers, the film brings. But this is what makes "almost nothing" even more interesting. I recommend this movie for all people, for whom the artistic side of the film is very important, and they will not be disappointed.
