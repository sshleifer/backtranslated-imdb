Freebird perfect marriage of the road trip comedy capers group, "Stoner" film and well-being of British cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant lead characters that set this film different from other movies in this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, Garry Stretch and Jeff Bell has a great chemistry and make their characters very nice and realistic. Storylines centered around his road trip from London to Wales, and the adventures and misadventures that occur along the way. This short film also has a big heart - it's not just for bike lovers, as it establishes the character around the relationship with each other, including dreams and regret, such as Fred Harry longingly stretch for the family he left behind. Cinematography is also great. - a love letter to the Welsh countryside, as well as the seizure of grain London streets and the typical life of a pub in Welsh cities <br /> <br /> The stylish, sleek, a fantastic soundtrack, charming characters and a funny story - I would recommend Freebird in a heartbeat!
