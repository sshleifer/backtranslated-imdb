Okay, I admit, casting in the film is really strange - part of this is due to the plot, but I still was a little hard to believe, Pierce Brosnan plays this conclusion (though it actually has done a very good job). <br /> <br /> It is based on the true story of an Englishman who went to live with Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He argued that the mixed blood Indian. He was, in fact, so successful and well thought that people came from all over to hear his lectures and take him desert hikes - despite the fact that he was not of mixed blood Indian and all his knowledge was from books or fake! cinema center, this is what happened when the fraud was discovered. <br /> <br /> actions and settings were great and I really liked this film (as soon as I stopped believing about Brosnan). He did not get wide distribution - probably because it was quite cerebral - not a movie Bond or romance - just really odd film about a remarkable man.
