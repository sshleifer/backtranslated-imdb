I would not venture to say that this film is better than the original, but it is very good in its own right. The comedy in this movie as good as the original, but there are so many scenes that get me laugh just thinking about them. <br /> <br /> The story in this film is even more amazing than the original, but that's what makes it so great. Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast. The nucleus of the original cast of the film returns to his character in the film, and all do a fantastic job with their roles. I do not care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both of these films, as I did, Bill Alex Winter. I was very glad to see George Carlin returns to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr., who plays the role of father Ted Logan makes a very good job. The scene in which Ted has his body parents and Hal London Jr. begins to act like Fyodor big stage, and he pulls it clearly good. I can not forget to mention William Sadler as death, he completely made the film for me. The rest of the cast is quite good as well. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first series installment Bill and Ted, I hope you would like this film as well. But do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
