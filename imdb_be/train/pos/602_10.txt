I've never danced flamenco before, but somehow I feel that this movie was perfect. Colors like blatant dances were Gypsies, and opponents all together made the film, which seemed to have ended too soon. I've seen other films Carlos Saura and I agree that this film could be his best production. I feel that the best features of his past films have been merged and aligned to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in the detection of activity going on behind the cameras. While watching this movie, I felt like I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, comfortably watch a dancer bang on a wooden board over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this film fits like a glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this film in the US over the next few years. I recommend this film to anyone who is drawn to the existence of other cultures. It is safe to say that this movie is definitely on my list of favorites.
