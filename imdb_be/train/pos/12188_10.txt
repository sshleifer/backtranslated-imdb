Pure genius Orson Welles makes this one of the greatest films. Wells is drawn into a plot murder only be created as a scapegoat, which is what he refers to a sarcastic comment "big dummy, I am." The plot is so complex that I still do not know whether he knew the victim that his life was to be lost. Shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed. One only this scene is worth the price of admission. This is the only time when Rita Hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character. Nobody except Wells would not have had the nerve to cut her hair blond and painted brass. No one should miss this picture.
