For what it is, this is a very good movie. I like how Johns -Stamos ( "Full House") & Stockwell ( "Christine", "Top Gun"). They both give strong performances. The love interest in the procedure, but this is more of a movie guy than a good date movie. I love Harleys, and I could not bear to see them paint "14 layers of hand-rubbed lacquer" with a good old army olive. There is a little history lesson here is that the Harley-Davidson motorcycles play a key role in World War II. I do not know when the training was enough, as it clots! The film kept my interest all the way to the end without getting slowly anywhere, with good driving action sequences. I love to look at the demographics of the history of the vote - a 18-year-old gave a roller 10 (a true lover of the bicycle, I think). I would not give it a 10, but I give him 8. I do not weigh each film with the same scale. There are movies that were big-budget, big actors who you expect to be good, so when they fail, they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I, my best example), I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought that the episode I was weak in comparison. So he gets a lower rating from me more than this film. I expect more from George Lucas.
