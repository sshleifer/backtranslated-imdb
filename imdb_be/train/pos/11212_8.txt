This picture was published in 1975, and it was the second in a three part series of life Sheriff Buford Pusser. After Swanson takes the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays a role Mobster Pinky Dobson. Recently, we have seen, Sheriff Pusser he lay in a hospital bed after he and his wife, who was killed in an ambush on Sunday morning drive. Pusser After recovering he goes after the men who killed his wife. Pusser have the opportunity to complete the revenge, that after the crowd or try to take it before it advances. The only thing that bothers me about this picture that it was actually a true story. How could you leave in this type of crime, and yet nothing about it to do. Since there was no real name of the actress in the film, I can not give it 10 stars please, but I can give 8
