A great story about following your dream and actually taking a stab at doing something about them when the chance strikes. Nothing was ever easy to Maurice, he had a family, work, OPPS job elsewheres, mortgages, etc., it was not like he could just drop what he was doing, and carefree jump on greyhound play AAA ball for 4 months. It took guts. I am pleased that they showed his indecision, almost to "Sesame CallUp he got in the majors. <br /> <br /> I remember him pitch against the Red Sox (I think ...), it was a great story. Though actually, Maurice looks like John Kruk or Watson Mills than Quaid-this is normal. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a very good job playing man, teacher, coach, and "the oldest rookie" .... As someone who is in the same age group, of course, I can ID with him plight. You are not quite too old to do what you dreamed of as a child, but it becomes all there. You should do this before LATOR. <br /> <br /> plausibly I said, well edited, walked, played, good to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> good job all around, glad to see it's impressive. <br /> <br /> *** **** outta ... who could have been thought that the Tampa Devil Rays may have been the subject of such a good film at an early stage?
