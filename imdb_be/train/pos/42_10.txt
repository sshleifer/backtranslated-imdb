Busy Phillips put in one hell of a performance as a comedy and drama. Erika Christensen was good, but Busy eclipsed. It was a nice touch after smokers, the film starring the Busy, which was not all that great. If Busy does not get the nomination of any kind for this film would be a disaster. Forget the Mona Lisa's smile, see Home Room.
