the second film by Woody Allen, arranged in London. Killer Tha Tarot killing prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) receives a tip that he might be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She begins to romance him, but quickly falls in love. She helped magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), who does not like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I do it better than the over rated "Match Point" in the last year wanted. He was shorter and moved more quickly. The plot is old, but I was entertained and kept me guessing until the very end. It's not quite a comedy, but a mystery with some very good comedy lines (all by Allen of course). This is not one of Elena is better, but it is much better than it worse. <br /> <br /> It acts, for the most part, very good. Allen is bad, but he played the character a million times before and it has become tedious. But Johansson and Jackman just great - they look fantastic and give two very attractive believable performances. Allen also (strangely) works on sexual attractiveness - is the sequence in which they are both in their bathing suits to show off their beautiful bodies. The only real debit, that Allen still does not seem sure how to shoot in London. He did not so much from the way it was on the "Match Point", though -., Perhaps he will only get better as it goes along <br /> <br /> It is worth a look. I give it an 8.
