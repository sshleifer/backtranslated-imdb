I read other reviews and found to be a comparison of the film about the real life (for example, what it takes to get to a music school), Britney bashing, and so on, and so on, so let's focus on the film and message. <, Br /> <br /> I appreciated this film 7 of 10 to the age range of 8 to 14 years, as well as for a family film. For an average adult man .... 2 of 10 <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock musician, I'm 45. I know what Britney Spears, but did not realize that she actually sang Stronger yet I read these reviews and loans. I did not recognize her poster on the wall, so I'm not worried about any "self-promotion". <br /> <br /> I watch movies to be entertained. I do not care about the casting, Lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the movie and does it please me. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie for the message. The largest epidemic in the world is the low self-esteem (that's another story), so it looked with the message in the form, as this area of ​​interest. The film is light, bright and fresh, perfect for children. I found that the Texas strum began to disappear throughout the film, and, of course, there's only so many ways to pass / do not give messages to give, so Yeh, it was a bit predictable. Great message, though ... there should be more. <br /> <br /> This film is a great family film, but for a guy to look at ourselves, get Hannibal.
