Just Cause takes some of the best parts of the three films, Cape Fear, Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs, and mixes them together to come up with a good thriller movie. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery Professor liberal law, married to a former assistant district attorney, and he Capshaw crusader against the death penalty. Grandma Blair Underwood Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at the conference, and convinces him to call upon her grandson. He sits on death row for the murder of a young girl. <br /> <br /> If Connery arrives in the rural district of Florida, he played against the cruel sheriff Laurence Fishburne, who is about as ruthless in its decision of crime as Orson Welles' Touch of Evil was. <br /> <br /> In the future, after Connery received the verdict canceling the evidence he discovered, it feels very good about myself. At this point, the film takes an undeniable necessity Touching Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that all is not what it seems, to put it mildly. Throw rotates uniformly in good performances. Special mention must be made Ed Harris, which plays Hannibal Lektera as serial killer death row to Underwood. He will make your skin crawl, and he begins to make Konnray reconsider some of these handy liberal premises he based his belief on. Many confirmed liberal I know came to think very differently once they have been a victim of crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, the converse is also true. Many laws and order conservative, if they are ever involved in the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make a real, that all his rights are truly guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not the end, but the process never ends and one in the fact that for the whole society. I think if Just Cause is morality, which would probably be it.
