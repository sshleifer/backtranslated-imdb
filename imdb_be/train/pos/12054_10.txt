I first saw this film here in the UK, in December 1989, when the Central Television broadcast. I still have the videotape, although worn (over the years a lot of friends and family members borrowed it and is also cooled by it!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember coming home that night, grabbing a Christmas drink, switching the light and observing what is advertised as a "Christmas Ghost StoryÂ». Even now, I remember some of the scenes, which are still sent the hairs on my neck stood on end ... <br /> <br /> I've seen some comments about the film, which say that it is not and it is not that ... I think these people are afraid of Friday 13, etc., stem and lash Rummel, which are ridiculous. This "traditional" ghost story; no big budget action or special effects ... NO swearing, no blood, no gratuitous sex scenes, without a chainsaw or gun, etc ... So how refreshing !!!! This atmospheric. If you like the monstrous horror, well-written, well-acted, and with a really frightening atmosphere, this is a movie for you. I like the original horror; Once I saw the original Ghosts and it's a great movie last night. Very atmospheric again - and so The Woman in Black. The end of the film differs from the book, but still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you * would * like this, if you like the traditional ghost stories of SO ... ... turn off the lights, turn up the fire, close the door, grab a drink and enjoy ... ...: )
