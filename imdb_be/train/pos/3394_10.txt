I watched this movie as if by accident, having bought it in the direction B at Omega Man DVD. Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - for a start, it was clear that the inspiration for 28 days later, with the exception, the rest is just a matter of television films. But Soylent Green is in a completely different league. I bet it's one of the favorites of Tarantino. There are at least three scenes in the film that I've never seen anything like this before. Heston accidentally getting into bed with the "furniture", discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people scooped up a fleet of mechanical diggers! The priest takes confession and shoot confessor. Well, maybe it was done so - but not a lot of films that are so consistently as the original. And what the hell is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Whether it is unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Fortunately, I've seen this movie, not knowing the ending - apparently rare. Then I watched it again, and enjoyed all the little clues that make long early scenes are. Very good script - and some great sets, too. Just when you thought you've seen everything. ,,
