One of the few musical about sailors on leave, it usually marks meets girl, complicated post, I found out happily kind of plot. It goes on smoothly enough, but it makes resistance in places too. Dialogue not as slick as the «Top Hat», for example, and Randolph Scott, does not seem out of place. <br /> <br /> There is compensation. He has chosen some of Irving Berlin songs, including «Let Yourself Go», «I put all your eggs in one basket" and "Let's Face Music and Dance." He is Fred and Ginger, who, when they dance to take any film in the heavenly heights, and they do not disappoint here. They are doing an energetic tap dancing and wandering comic dance hooked graceful dance, all in one movie! Versatility and artistry. <br /> <br /> He also Harriet Hilliard, which is pretty good in his role. She has had a varied career, becoming more famous Harriet Nelson Ozzy. Here it is in contact, without being sentimental.Her two songs simply and effectively delivered. It makes a nice contrast with ginger, but you can believe that they are a sister in the film. <br /> <br /> More than pulling the film did even better. Very good, though.
