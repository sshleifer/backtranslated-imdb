Renowned conductor decides after a heart attack to get back to the village where he was born, to live a quiet life. There, he comes in the Dutch language with the local church choir, which will change his life <br /> <br /> I did not have any expectations when I saw this film for the first time yesterday. I like to watch foreign films that are not English, and I've seen a couple of Swedish films in my life, but this one was the best so far. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this film is a gem, thanks to many things, one of which is an outstanding effect. Nyqvist is ideal as a thoughtful, almost shy and dedicated conductor Daniel Dareus. Beautiful Frida Hallgren captivates with her beautiful smile and her fine performances. Choir members are well-developed, interesting characters with their own history of each. <br /> <br /> This film tells the story, a wonderful story, music, love, pain, memory, death of a man who dedicated his life to music, and who are trying to create a peaceful existence in the village where he was born, trying to to make peace with the past and with the way his life was before. Kay Pollak shows us that the Swedish outstanding filmmakers. Immediately evident S√Å catfish I himmelen, is a film that makes you think about life and love, and it's also comforting in some way.
