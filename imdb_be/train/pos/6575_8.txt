"Arms and the Man" is one of the funniest plays of Shaw, if handled correctly, and this production does a good enough job. Helena Bonham-Carter, pre-movie stardom, is Raina, the daughter of a military family, which has a peacock groom (Patrick Rayekart), and who is hiding from enemy soldiers (Pip Torrens) during a raid on the city. <br /> <br /> Full of color and energy, this production is galloping ahead at a good pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as a maid is a little overshadowed by the other actors, they still hold their ground. Kika Markhee and Dinsdale Landen as parents are wonderful, and the whole game in general happy. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
