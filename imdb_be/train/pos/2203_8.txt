I also loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952, I was 5 and my family always watched the show. My favorite character was the one played by Marion Lorne as a rather stuttering, awkward and very attractive "aunt" people. I still can remember her then, "Abba Bubba um um" comments like, how it will try to say something important. And then when she came back and played Aunt Clara in mesmerizing it was great casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I remember seeing Matthau whose career I was going as a fan for many years <br /> <br /> I have a question, if someone can check out :. was a title or end credits music "Swedish RhapsodyÂ» Hugo Alva? Every time I hear that playing on my classical radio station here in Southern California, it brings to mind the image of Mr. Peepers departing back to the camera. I'm not even sure if this image in my view is the right one.
