When we speak of Hollywood Hotel, we could be talking about one of three things, the actual hotel, a radio program, and this film, which was partly inspired by the first two. Dick Powell was the host of the program Hollywood Hotel on the CBS radio network, in which Louella Parsons convex weekly scoop on the stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons Hollywood Hotel debuted the program in 1934, so by 1937 it had its fair share of radio listeners. Powell took, sang, and kibitzed with Louella and her movie star guests. With the strength she had with her column, she was able to get different stars to move on and to connect their latest films in vain. <br /> <br /> Then she stepped in the American Federation of Radio Artists and demanded pay wages respectively, and they won. It ended Hollywood Hotel program in 1938. Of course, as Powell and Louella went to other radio space. The whole story is covered in the book, Tony Thomas, Movies Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before the plug pulled this film came out of Powell's home studio Warner Brothers inspirational radio. Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with the band of Benny Goodman, who receives the contract signed by Hollywood. But if he gets in Hollywood, he gets himself tangled with selfish movie star Lola Lane, its double dual real-life sister, Rosemary Lane and ham actor Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> If Mowbray encouraged to sing in the epic Civil War he was doing with Lola Lane, is the voice they use Powell. Then Mowbray develops Lina Lamont problem when he asked to go to Hollywood Hotel radio, broadcast from Hollywood Hotel. This is a studio in the excitement. For example, the problem can not be solved as he sings in the rain, but Powell's manager Ted Healy is resourceful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer provide a very good score for the film. Big hit song comes at the very beginning, as a group with Benny Goodman jazz singing Johnny Davis to sing the national anthem in Hollywood, Hooray for Hollywood. My favorite, however, Powell and Rosemary Lane sing, I'm like a fish out of water. Just listen to the lyrics of Johnny Mercer Ginger Rogers works in the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without a fan, it is a collection of American popular culture in the thirties. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley choreography does here and while the film doesn "t have imagined soaring material that his early work with Warner Brothers has, the rooms are well staged. Berkeley is a great time to travel to the diner where Powell and Healy were forced to get a job. Number starts with Benny Goodman broadcast from Hollywood hotel does let this be a lesson to you, and then screwing Powell, Lane and the whole place to start joining in the song irritated by Edgar Kennedy owner. And you know what you can expect from Edgar Kennedy irritation. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman gets to show why he was named king of swing, when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and Lionel Hampton xylophonist within its ensemble. This, together with Frances Langford singing as well. And, perhaps, the last surviving cast member of the group was a man who had a small piece as a radio announcer. He died in 2004, but not before he became the 40th president of the United States. Ronald Reagan always attributed to Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as the two guys at Warner Brothers, who have been most useful for the impatient young player wants to make his mark. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel is one film and entertainment, dating, but so magical.
