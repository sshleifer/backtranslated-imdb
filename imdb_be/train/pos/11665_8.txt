I would have about this film did not know if it was not his "surprise" an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature Film. Fortunately, it happened that I was able to watch this animated little treasures. <br /> <br /> The story about a child, Brendan, who was the nephew of a large and overly Abbot of Kells village. The main occupation of the Abbot to build a wall to defend Kells from attacking the Viking. Once, Aiden, a well-known illustrator of Iona, sought refuge in them. Aiden opens his eyes Brendan art illustration and temptations of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan befriended white wood sprite Aisling, he tried to restore the ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration. <br /> <br /> Â«The Secret of Kells" in contrast to the majority of animation released these days. This kind of atavism, as an illustration made in frozen geometric lines and design without much care for its realism, as well as symbolism. Movement of these lines resemble a simplified yet fluid animation style used at the beginning of a sequence of "Kung Fu Panda." Nevertheless, this is a great use of color, which is the main source of wonder to the audience. Red wines, which are used in the invasion of the Vikings sequence is unforgettably haunting. <br /> <br /> Try to catch the soft stone of the film. This is a welcome respite from all the mindless bombast current animated fare such as "Monsters vs. Aliens" and the like. Rare Celtic score is effective in evoking a sense of fantasy that saturates the film. Well, the story may be a bit small and ending with a bit wanting. I would like to know more about the book that Brendan and Aiden worked. But clearly, the star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized work of art, as they say, on the basis of a work of art in real Book of Kells.
