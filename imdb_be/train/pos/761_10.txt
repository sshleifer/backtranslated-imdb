I just want to say that among all the so-called classical HipHop Ive seen films like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars, etc. ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among others. Every time I ask other people about where their favorite, it seems that the BEAT STREET pops up the most. But still, it is the lowest rank of all. 4.3 is simply a hit "below the belt" (if we say, 5 points is the area). I love the musical performances, the breakdancing I want back, RAMO makes me want to throw a piece of ... c'mon, its classic !! !
