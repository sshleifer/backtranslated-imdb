This one has a lot going for it - Sinatra, Stein, a Cahn, Pamela Britt -And a smaller number of scale - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a little ho hum - Kelly. It was the first real film Sinatra, where the producer has spent a dollar, and you could see it on the screen (he had previously appeared in two low budgeters higher and higher, and faster), but if they only relied on the tube Sinatra and deep sixed ego -raschaplenne Piano Grayson spot plus Iturbi we would have stayed in a much more rigid film and the best showcase for Sinatra. How is it kills a large extent in all his songs, two duets with Kelly - We hate to leave, I begged her - her own solo that makes the sunset, charm you, and I Fall In Love too easily. Despite this step Lively remains the best music of the forties Sinatra on one-tenth of the budget.
