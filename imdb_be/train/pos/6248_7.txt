Being an Austrian himself it was a direct knock on my face. Fortunately, I do not live far from the place where the film takes place, but, unfortunately, it reflects everything that the rest of the Austria Vienna hates about men (or people close to this area). And it's very easy to read, that it is the intention of the director: "My God, how can it be possible," so that your head is lowered into their own hands and say. No, not with me, then (in my opinion) very exaggerated uncensored swingers club scene is not necessary, I watch porn, of course, but in this context I was pretty nasty, you put in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells the story of how misled the people who are suffering from a lack of education or bad companies are trying to survive and live in peace, redundant and boring horizons. The girl, who is regarded as a whore by her super-jealous boyfriend (and still keeps coming back), a female teacher who discovers her masochism, putting the life of her super-tight "lover" on the line, the old couple that has an almost mathematical daily cycle (it is "the official replacement of" his ex-wife), a couple who had just got divorced, and the ex-husband has suffered under the acts of his ex-wife, obviously, having a relationship with her masseuse and, finally, with a mind of her companion who asks drivers most unusual questions and stretches your nerves, Olka being super annoying. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, you do not feel almost anything. You do not even shocked, sad, depressed or feel like doing anything ... Maybe that's why I gave him 7 points, it made me react the way I never reacted before. If it is good or bad for you!
