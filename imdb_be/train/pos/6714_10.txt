Why I like the show in the last episode? Because of the true talent of Melissa Joan Hart and her supporting cast had to demonstrate that whit, comedy, light-hearted humor and profound thought can indeed coexist. What I liked most was that I could come home from a hard day's work, and bust smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to watch how this divine man was so happy to help others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was a hero to my mind ... even if it was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from ours ... are very different; it had the power to her fingertip, wants, and a team that can be used for good or bad, that can only exist in many of our fantasies. Most of all, what we see is, know about, on their own, or even the desire ... can be used for good or bad, and how we choose to define what determines a person we are. <br /> <br /> She has traveled around the world and other areas with these constant and unwaivering ideas in mind ... to learn, to live, laugh and love. She's always learning how to improve their skills for the benefit of all around her; she made mistakes when she lived life through various ways's growth, as it is, aunts and Salem (undervalued, but an imperfect hero) did so to show that even a mistake, you can be noble, gifted, and excellent. <br /> <br /> It also showed a lot of dedication, learning and loving acts, she went on her way. If this is not reason enough for the 10 stars in this war torn world, where people are so hostile to each other, not understanding how differences spice of life, rather than a reason to kill ... then I do not know what it is that the show was definitely the best trip in the world, as well as inspiration to better themselves and the gift is intended to bust our chops smile ... I heard from the doctor to the fact that everything I mentioned above leads to a healthy "deer" ... and not what we all need? :)
