Where Sidewalk Ends (1950) <br /> <br /> where it ends, another begins <br /> <br /> This prototype noir, and as such, is quite impeccable, the style and content points of view. Photographing and night settings first speed (cinematographer LaShell allows theater seen in scene after scene), and close-up on the faces of pure expressionism. I can watch this film for the visual appearance alone, even if the actors are fighting and the plot stinks. <br /> <br /> But acting is first rate here, and the plot features that I believe the core of most film noir, the alienation of man's role (which is a lot of people who have returned home to the United States after the war changed the feeling of lost myself). In fact, not only Dana Andrews is really convincing as the troubled, solitary detective, he has a small but important counterpart in the film, the (first) husband the male Sandrovo decorated ex-GI fallen on hard times and drink. The fact that one person kills another may be of monumental importance, overall-- next guy fights through its internal problems, to success, and a medal to wear men slip into the accidental death of a silver plate in his head. This woman goes from one to another - we assume that they marry and have children, as suggested earlier in the film. Even if it is pushing the explanation of it after the fact, we can still see the path of a person with any psychological baggage, racing through the crisis to the highest level of moral order - turning itself over a small offense only at the point he actually went out of them. <br /> <br /> This film belongs to Andrews. He plays a much more restrained and moving type than Kirk Douglas plays the same role in the detective story Wyler made only one year later, and Andrews, of course, less theatrical. You can easily see how the movies side by Bocquet to compare and contrast the tutorial session. The fact that Andrews as Dixon Detective moral struggles through it all, and Douglas as Detective McLeod present, may explain why one person gets the girl, while others do not. Gene Tierney pulls pretty huge, demurring, and ultimately, a common and "pretty" type of woman - not just cardboard desirable, but someone you would like Dixon actually marry. <br /> <br /> criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but effective enough in the game with the types and clich√©s. Bits of the stored instantaneous, small parts (such as a portable table for a game of dice) nice things, distant from the actors or the nature of the glamor of gambling in Casablanca. But then, a great movie Curtiz is a landmark even in the details - it makes no effort to be subtle and realistic and insightful, but instead sweeping and memorable and inspiring. They come to the opposite end of the war, and are opposed to the possibility of their leading men. Bogart began his active duty, Dixon, Dixon, and people killed, all to the end. Through carefully, but did not arrive. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that many, perhaps most, Noir has what you might call a "happy" endings. Man overcomes his opponents and makes his inner being, and moviegoers, then and now, understands how nice that must feel.
