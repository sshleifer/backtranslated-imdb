Unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of NIMH and The Land Before Time, it was very touching bitter cartoon. I remember it very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. So begins a bit dark, the dog fled the pound, and dies from an old friend, in the end, in heaven, and returns. But he becomes sweet when he befriends an orphan girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a little scary, unlike other cartoons, as a series of Charlie's dreams, but everything else was fine, and the songs were fair. Memorable role Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love this guy, ahehehe. And Barca jaws Revenge can rest her soul, the poor girl, she does not deserve to die, but she is in heaven now, all good people go to heaven. In general this is a very good animated film Don Bluth classic enough to put anime and Disney to shame. It recommended for the whole family. And you know, if you have the original video, you will find after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message must love that guy, ahehehe.
