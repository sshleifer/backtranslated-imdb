The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg to go to the mall to revive flagging spirits Sally is enough reason alone to enjoy this film, but wait! There's more! This crackling good sendup daytime television, film stars on the way down (and up) and horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr. shows the lighter side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty gorgeous. Witty dialogue and physical humor made with consummate skill. This is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the art of acting, directing, and writing.
