I do not see how this show as OC at all. <br /> <br /> Firstly, OTs centers around young people and their parents, trying to get through life. North Shore about the hotel staff, who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time. Secondly, The OC takes place in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> Why do Fox show as well as one of his other shows in the same network? I think it's a great show with good actors, for the most part. It has a good storyline and plot. I like the place and how people care about them and their work. The most recent episode was amazing how the story developed. This was predictable, like most of the stories in most of the show. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps it in the air.
