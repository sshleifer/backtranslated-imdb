This film is a little ray of light in the darkest time of the year. He says the quality is best described as plain old friendliness. Morgan Freeman plays a character very similar to the Freeman - a successful actor, pushing 70. He went to a small, quite dirty grocery store, which is intended to explore the role that it could play as the manager of this location. Soon he entices employees and customers, especially beautiful when the moody young woman (Paz Vega), who heads the "10 items or less" lane control. <br /> <br /> 10 Items Or Less is not a big statement to make, and does not pretend that he does. It follows Freeman and Vega, they became friends, and as the older man offers him advice in exchange for a ride home - in a gofer film companies, which are supposed to pick it never shows, and Freeman forgot your number phone, so he could not call for help. I had a little case of the blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York, and is a film to cure sick me.
