I just got back from the show "My Left Foot" in our public library. Which is an emotional experience - I feel drained and raised <br /> <br /> This is the story Christy Brown, an Irish writer and artist, and on the basis of the author's autobiographical. "My Left Foot." Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy, so that only the extremity he had a good grip on his left foot. Doctors advised his father that he was hopelessly retarded, but his mother was not given to him, and a little like Annie Sullivan took Helen Keller helped him to achieve a breakthrough, in which he learned the alphabet and then to read, write, and paint <br /> <br /> This film won an Oscar for Daniel Day-Lewis (best actor), and best Supporting actor for the actress playing his mother. He also won an Oscar for best film, best director and best adapted screenplay. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, while many movies can entertain me, many of them also often leave me, do not lose sight of the gross mind. inventions or improbability in realistic psychological reactions <br /> <br /> Not this film - it was absolutely "spot on" drawing a typical Irish parental roles & behavior (see, for example, see a typical Irish family in McGoldrick in "Ethnos & family therapy "), as well as uneven emotional maturation of Christy Brown. - some immature reaction of the person, which were further strengthened its gathering features of his father <br /> <br /> film is most true when you change certain sequences in its development (painting and writing) and condensing several important people in one person for the sake of telling a coherent story believable, not burdened by small, distracted, less important realities. (See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for greater accuracy.) DVD version we had some English subtitles were shown, which were a great help in understanding speech Christi (and some of the Irish language); the initial release of the film may not have enough of it. (If you see this on DVD, enable this option.) <br /> <br /> The play Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the biggest, believable acting jobs I've ever seen. Really wonderful, outstanding, wonderful. <br /> <br /> «My Left Foot" has more than a resemblance to the more recent film "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly," that each reflect the real life of a man successfully overcome imprisonment and isolation of very severe physical disability <br /> <br /> and in this, it resonates with Henley in "Invictus» which begins with the words. "from the night that covers me, Black as // Pit from pole to pole, // I thank whatever gods may be // For my unconquerable soul. "
