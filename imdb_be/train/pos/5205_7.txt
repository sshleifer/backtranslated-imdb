A bunch of American students and their teacher decided to visit the ugly part of Ireland in order to study the ancient religious practices. Despite the fact that he had repeatedly warned of the danger of straying off the beaten path (local awful Irish guy, of course), they are just that, and the wind with their interior on the outside of the grace of the family of inbred cannibals (descendants of the infamous Scottish Bean clan, which, in accordance with silly plot of the film, raised the wand from Scotland and settled on the Emerald Isle). <br /> <br /> If you think that porn star plus low-budget horror automatically makes a ton of nudity and terrible action, then think again: Evil Breed bubble with older stars, but really, there is not much nudity as one would expect, given the "talent" is involved, and act, though far from Oscar worthy, not all that bad (except for Ginger Lynn Allen, who we know can make a wonderful "French", but whose Irish lousy). <br /> <br /> Evil Breed opens in fine style with a tight pair of lovers slaughter campers: after a short stand under the cloth, silicone extension beauty is pulled out of the tent and torn in half; guy has his hands and feet cut off and roasted on a spit. This is a very bloody beginning, and bodes well for the rest of the film <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start, things start to go seriously downhill :. We are introduced to the main characters, irritable bunch of twenty-something just begging to become a cannibal chow, and subjected to a sufficient amount of time to spend in the form of some terrible false panic, a lot of Blarney on the bloodthirsty Druidic from local Irish oddities Harry (Simon Peacock), and worst of all, some sub-Creek, post-modern talk about the conventions of horror films (how clever!). <br /> <br /> Then, just as it looks as if the film is never going to get any better director Christian Viel decides seriously guy gets a knife rammed through his head, and there is free sex scene-in-shower showing excellent light Gillian Leigh (not a porn star, but I'm sure there's a career there waiting when she wants). After that, things quickly improved as a cannibal carnivorous kick to the top gear, and the film turns into a real massacre: Harry machete rammed his ass (about time!), And strangled his intestines; Ginger Lynn kick boxing mutant; Jenna Jameson is broken, gutted and has her silicone breast implant gnawed by an intricate man-eater; guy gets beheaded cheese wire; and Taylor Hayes seen bloody, bruised and bare a dead fetus between the legs (Apparantly, it was captured and used as breeding stock). <br /> <br /> All of this so ugly mountain, which makes sitting through less interesting material should be, and receives Evil Breed final ranking 7/10. <br /> <br /> Note. Very hectic and production studio led to the intervention of Christian Viel eventually abandon the project. Re-shoots have been made, and the blood was severely trimmed for the American release. The good news is that, although the film does not flow as well as it can be, and cursed with a terrible end, UK a DVD (version I looked), seems to have remained relatively untouched, as sprays are concerned (only 13s were cut from film in total).
