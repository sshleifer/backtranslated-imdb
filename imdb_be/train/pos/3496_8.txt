I'm surprised how many people give this step at least 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they simply do not understand the film. <br /> <br /> The story about growing up in a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for their grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there's a good reason why so many critics as the film. <br /> <br /> And the reason is that they understand this film. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the low scores given by some people. <br /> <br /> I would like to just write a brief summary of the movie, but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I do not have anything else to say.
