It's so nice to see a large piece of art is transformed into the other without distortion or adaptation. I had assumptions about how such an unusual piece of literature can be retrieved as a film worth seeing. If you loved the book Bulgakov you would, for obvious reasons, fearing to see some mistaken interpretation has done more for the project art film than actually causing the deeper meaning of the story on the screen. There are several examples of this from the Master and Margarita. In a complex and far-fetched, as the story, the film does not leave anything. It is as if the director has read a work of Bulgakov as well as orchestral conductor reads the number - not to miss a note. Why can not we find such talent here in the US? So now it's my favorite book and the film has the same name.
