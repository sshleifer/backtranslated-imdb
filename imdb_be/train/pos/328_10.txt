Spectacular I came to I Am Curious (Yellow), and is a companion piece with great excitement. I have read numerous reports about his well-publicized disputes and obvious sex. The fact that I was not, but thoroughly thoughtful and engaging movie experience unlike any other. I truly believe that most commentators who think this movie was 'lame' or 'sad' approached the film as if it were pornography. Perhaps it is pornography, believing that pornography is that it is designed to tickle the senses, but deliberately non-erotic. Lena, the main character, throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and human, which is simply convincing and durable. Her breasts may be sagging, her nipples are unusually large, her fat thighs, and her face puffy. But by the end of the film, the viewer comes to identify with her and accept her shortcomings as a man. This touch gives it more credibility out of necessity. If the director threw Briget Bardot bombshell effect it would be canceled. I can not more highly recommend this thought provoking piece. Be prepared to invest a lot of thought into this film deliberately go. The patient and unassuming viewer will be fully rewarded ways most other films could dream of.
