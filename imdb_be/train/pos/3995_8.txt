Kureishi not exactly been blessed films that justify the quality of his writing. Latest Tv adapted as "Intimacy" ruined a lot of writing. But Mother surpasses all its previous incarnations, eclipsing even My Beautiful facilities. Middle-aged woman overcomes widow-hood, having a very carnal relationship with her boyfriend of her daughter's emotional and weak. The fact that you think that all this is the merit of quality acting as the final gift of writing. And Daniel Craig we have a bombastic, cocky, rude anti-hero who denies the audience ever doubts why the young stallion to see bedding grandmother sagging. Beautifully shot, the film can not be only a weak picture of peripheral characters, but as the study unfathomable lust, it's a winner.
