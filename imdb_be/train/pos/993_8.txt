In fact, this film is not so bad. It contains an action comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, such as the Arc Hutchison (Percy of "The Green Mile"), who plays Bristol. Another well-known Jamie Kennedy actor, with "Scream" and "Three Kings." The main characters played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was pretty nice and funny, but the one who surprised me the most, David Morse, as Edgar Clenteen. he plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films such as "the Green mile», «Indian Runner», "The Negotiator" and "The Langoliers", he plays a very sympathetic person, and in the "bait" of the play almost opposite, a person without any emotions that It was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this movie are a few photos of the World Trade Center, which makes the film may look a bit dated. Overall, I thought it was a very good little film!
