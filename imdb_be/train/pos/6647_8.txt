Gandhi my father, like looking through a book chapter chapter you will read it (with your eyes) and you will learn more about Charilaus Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi this issue. So little is known about both of them, and this film describes them clearly. The name is misleading, though, as his film about Gandhi and his son, as his Harilal about his mother. And Akshay Khanna and Shefali Chayya do full justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> Films such as leap years. They come after only so much time. <br /> <br /> Gandhi my father, also an internal struggle that is sometimes harder than any fight for freedom ever undertaken. <br /> <br /> Be careful, if you love quality cinema.
