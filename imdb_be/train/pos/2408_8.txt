Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ and disturbed bloody violence would want to see this film instead. Although it was not a box office success in meters or television ratings, The Fox Movie Channel is still a very good reason to show it anually. I liked the way they are trained by Chris Sarandon, and men who reflect his students to sing in Hebrew.Though Sarandon have long hair, like any other, and Jesus in the other films, it looks very similar to the fact that the Jewish people will, that surprised me and impressed me was the scene where Caiaphas said to Jesus of Pilate "And never forget that you are a Jew!" While this may not have been a racist remark, Colin Blakely tried to do, Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of prominent people image those, days.Keith Michell Pilate was clumsy in paragraph aravnanni with his previous performances in "The story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The story of David." But if you compare it with the image of Pilate Savalas th or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he is really good painted impression of the Roman procurator.
