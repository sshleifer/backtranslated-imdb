What a wonderful, quirky film "Stardust" is. <br /> <br /> I could easily finish it with this one statement, and suffice it to say that could be taken as a very strong recommendation to go see. <, Br /> <br /> at a time when Hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats, «Stardust» makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place - to get away from reality for a few hours and explore other lives, other times and other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us in all three places, without much effort, and with the children's joy, we all long <br /> <br /> «Stardust" full of all the characters that we remember as kids :. Princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and villains. He has a girl in trouble, the hero, rogues, obstruction spell, antidotes, orders, and even a touch of the speed of light, to make it a quasi-date. <br /> <br /> «Stardust" of people from the city wall, which is conveniently located next to the wall that separates them from the magical city of the kingdom. The only way past the wall through the buttock, which carefully guards the dowdy old codger (played superbly by David Kelly). One day a young man from the wall by the name of Ben Barnes, maneuvers of the old guard and escapes through the breech. He stumbles upon an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold, where he meets on who wanted (and very sexy) young lady by the name of Una. She is a prisoner of the witches and tied by an unbroken chain. While the witch off, Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way. Ben returns to the wall without incident and continued his life. But nine months later, he was summoned to the breech wall where the old guard hands him what you might expect. - boy <br /> <br /> A boy named Tristan grows rather hapless young man (Charlie Cox), which is punishable with a girl way out of his league, and betrothed to another. However, the young lady (named Victoria and played Sienna Miller) is published once Tristain and he professes his love for her. Once they Varney candles, she tells him that he can have it when he gets a star and brings it back to her. He agrees and goes on his quest that will take him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> At the same time in the realm of Stormhold, the old king (Peter O'Toole played well) was dying, he called his son remained alive to tell them who is to succeed him to the throne. The names of his sons are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. Other sons were killed by other brothers in a humorous contest to see who lives in order to gain the throne. <br /> <br /> In any case, he throws his ruby ​​charm to the sky and voila, what brings a star on the ground. <br /> <br /> Star crash in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Danes), and she, of course, wearing a charm. But little does she know that she is being persuaded to Tristain, princes, as well as an aging witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), who wants to cut out the heart of a star to regain his own youth. <br /> <br /> Complicated? Yes. But it all comes together as the adventure unfolds. <br /> <br /> Tristain is the first to find Yvaine but so blinded by their devotion to Victoria, he does not recognize the growing connection between him and Yvaine. His initial interest lies only in the return Yvaine Victoria as proof of his love. But he must pass the prince and Lamia in the first place. Princes are not such a big problem, because they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" - never death was so funny. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also meets a witch, who took control of his mother (though he does not know that it was his mother) and a group of flying pirates led by Robert De Niro. <br /> <br /> Its most important character in the film and DeNiro plays his tee. He steals the movie with his strength and soon we will know disguised secret that will leave the audience on the floor laughing. Although his role is small in length, DeNiro extraordinary <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer as beautiful as Lamia - sexy evil witch. Danes is most suitable as an intricate and problematic Yvaine. It makes perfect girl. Jason Fleming, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong to add the perfect dose of levity as martial princes, who as they die ghosts return Ali "Blithe Spirit" and «High Spirits». <br /> <br /> In addition the director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other directing experience was "Layer Cake," weave a fascinating story that everyone will enjoy. <br /> <br /> «Stardust" may be too complicated for younger children, but anyone over the age of 13 years want to see this movie several times. This is very good. "Stardust" is that movies should be. Excellent written entirely discard does directed and beautifully acted. In other words ... perfect.
