Personally, I think, Sayonara was the greatest movie he has ever made. It touched every emotion from anger to romance that ended in tragedy. And Brando had to win for Best Actor. In any case, the film is awesome, man is appealing to both men and women, and now you have no reason not to see it! Do so and fall in love.
