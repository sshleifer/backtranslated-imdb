I grew up watching Scooby and was an advocate for good. This cartoon is moving away from the same old routine, which can get boring for the spectators. Scammers in the mask routine and boring This cartoon is a transition from this. This is not meant to replace the Scooby gang is just a break from the same old crimes, both for the audience and writers, I'm sure. The focus is on the cartoon Scooby and Shaggy, who inherits a large sum of money and use that money to thwart the plans of world conquest by a mad scientist and his thugs. Small homage gangs and gang signs themselves from time to time. If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo, you can evaluate the relationship between a boy and his talking dog, along with the jokes that come with it. Just Enjoythe Cartoon and support the creator / writer and producer, so it will not be the last cartoon Scooby.
