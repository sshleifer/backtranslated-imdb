This is one of the best films I've seen in the last 2 years (I saw the premiere in Tel Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, when it was the last war began ...) The problem in communication between people, leading wars, interesting to me for a long time, and it does not matter, aimed guys, straight and gay people, Jews and Arabs ... I saw a bubble already 3 times, and it is still amazing and exciting me- every character reminds me one of the many people I know, and the difference between them as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... the last time I would achyv it- was with my friend, who a Christian Arab, and it was on the day of Independence of Israel (the symbolic I could, how ironic) ... and he was crying in the end !!! - when he was moved, and not all will be touched embarrassed- Bubble!
