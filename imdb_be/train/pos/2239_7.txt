I think this film will only work on people who have all been turned off a giant hype Lord of the Rings. Well, I was. And so I really love this movie. Especially I like all these flawless superheroes from LotR to be so cool and disrespectful parodied. Most clearly this is an analogue of Gandalf (brave and wise, and absolutely no sense of humor know-it-all master): Almghandi, cowardice and brain dead transvestite. copy of Sauron ( «Sauraus» East Germany, of course) will be wearing a bucket with eye holes in the form of a helmet. Aragorns alter ego one more accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ( "Ulrik" legend) tape. And «Strunzdumm» (Wormtong double) really has a strong resemblance to Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... haha
