* I note where there are spoilers! General comments: If you can make a serious movie, go see it. I have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Do not leave the theater because you are confused as to what's going on! The film is combined well in the second half. I'm going to take my mom to see him again, if the film officially opens. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to see it screened a couple of weeks ago, when Will is going around the promotion of the film. He was great - spent a lot of time with the fans. Thank you for the picture of Will! On the performance of Will: A lot of times when you see a movie with the actor is really known any other film / show, you always think of them in their current work as well as you think of them because of their past activities. This is not the case with Will Smith in the movie. I can not imagine Fresh Prince (laughs), when I watched this movie. He was entirely convincing in this very, very serious role. He grew up much like an actor. I think that he, at least, get the nod Oscar for this performance <br /> <br /> About his character :. Ben is very contradicting and suffer. He is sad ... guilt-ridden ... very strongly, but very scary. Very true to himself. His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow, Will was able to bring it to life <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario). Rosario did a good job, which shows Emily, a woman is very far behind her taxes. Maybe it is not shining star in this film, but she was very persuasive. I think her character is just not much to work with, as Will did <br /> <br /> On the subject (NO spoilers) :. I admit that I did not want the film to the second half. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it, and nothing will make sense to the second part, or thereabouts. But if something is finally fit together, wow. Amazingly well written and well thought out. This is an extremely intense film that really sticks with you. <br /> <br /> it actually takes a lot of you to watch. In the theater I was in, most people end up crying - even adult men. If you understand what makes Ben, and why, is a very strong point ... <br /> <br /> ******* minor SPOILERS ***** That's why it's really hard to talk about the story, NOT giving basic things. I feel, knowing too much about this film really destroy it. There was a lot of symbolism in the film, which I enjoyed, though. I will mention some of them here (not trying to give away a lot). <br /> <br /> -The fish, which supported Ben in his hotel room. Firstly, it does not make any sense. It was a lot of talk in the movie theater, when people realize the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> -I hated Ben early in the film. By the end of this, I loved him and hated him. That's how strong Will. I thought that Ben was going to be a huge jerk Ezra, a blind person is just trying to make your way in the world. Why is he treated as Ezra has become quite clear later in the film. Wait, it's all the same. Everything in this movie :. Wait <br /> <br /> -Ben fundamentally a good man who made a big mistake, that he will never forgive himself for. It's not clear to me if he does what he does, because he was trying to get rid of their own guilt, or if he really wants to help people. I think it's a bit of both ... I think he wanted to help people, but also to get rid of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him, because you know that what he is doing nothing but as a country. You hate him because of what he does for himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Good work will be.
