That's why I love this site! I saw this film in 1980 on British television. For many years, it is one I wish I knew more about how he stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things I've ever seen in my life. Hardly a few key words to remember him, I watched a movie here, and a lot of information, including the fact that is about to become quite a Broadway musical! <br /> <br /> It is interesting that unlike the previous comment producer, I can not remember, find this movie boring, or operational. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter stuck in mind as a sign of great strength, honor and dignity. Ironic you can think of, taking into account the poverty of his life. Maybe it's because I live in the UK, where the fading grandeur has established language in the life of the old money, which misery is often tolerated as a sign of good breeding; I saw it as a rare and unique image of the huge spirit, a deep and profound sense of humor, which is very delicate and finely balanced material gave him poise and respect. In a sense, I was sorry that it was discussed as a "cult". Over the years, as he was lost in my opinion, it shone bright above the rest, as a friend of the brilliant and outstanding TV experience. It was such a deeply personal to expose, it seems strange to think that the public becomes so to be in the New York musical. But maybe, somewhere, a daughter will be thrilled with this outcome. It was she who has the last laugh, perhaps .. (They made musical with her in front of you Jackie O Â»)
