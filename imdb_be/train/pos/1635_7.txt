therefore, in my high school days in Salina, Kansas, they were filming something called «The Brave Young Men Of Weinberg" at the local level, and the filmmakers were very noticeable for several weeks. in the end, we found out that the film was "the Up Academy", and was a little ummm, "lower head" than we were led to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see it, because I was there, and the local audience seemed less than pleased with the show. I was 17 and thought it was quite ingenuous attempt to post «Animal House" type of comedy down to fart jokes. <br /> <br /> Watched it many times since then, and my opinion is slightly softened. it's stupid, but sometimes it catches a bit of a "frenzied" humor magazine, at least as well as most of the «Mad TV». Ron Liebman may hate it, but it is almost perfect and memorable. For me, my favorite moment was briefly scene at Avenue Santa Fe, where I parked the car, while I bought a few guitar strings. a brief appearance too bad my Pinto, as a rule, it seems to cut for television. have not seen the new DVD, but if my old colorful shows that they have a sale.
