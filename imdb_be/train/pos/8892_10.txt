Excellent, excellent, excellent! That is all I can say about this movie, but IMDB want at least four lines of text, so I will not go into details. The cast was great (Jerry O'Connell soooo cute!) The music was great (The sixties was the best music ever, IMHO), historical material was interesting, and it was like they did 90 years actors think that they actually it was there in the 60s. And most of all - the history of the main characters of tears to my eyes, and it is the greatness of any drama. BUT one word: GREAT!
