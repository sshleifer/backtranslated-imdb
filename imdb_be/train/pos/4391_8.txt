Are you waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. I appreciated the movie Audie Murphy 3 (i harsh grader), the second-lowest I ever gave Odie (the worst being "Battle of the Krivova scourge", if you're wondering). I give this film the rating of "8" (and I'm sharp grader) This is the story of the Civil War renegade "soldiers" if you want to call them that, against the North. People like Quantrell, and people who went to these criminals. <br /> <br /> The original version was watery, very clean cut, while still portraying the horror of what these people have done. In fact, movies like the old version, it is best to consider at an adult audience, who can distinguish the story. I would be more inclined to evaluate the original «R» and this, with his gruff character, general practitioner, because the new film gives a very honest option, the message is more easily deciphered minor than the old version. <, Br /> <br /> filmmakers since the early sixties boasted of "realism", but only a few of them deliver. Instead, they simply give the gray landscapes, gray suits and gray events, but with comic book characters cardboard stereotype weakness spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers realized the error. Obviously, in the beautiful western style we usually see today. This film is an example. This gives a realistic setting, but also gives us signs as we can tell, there is age. <br /> <br /> He has some slack, making full sit through a little difficult, and it has some inexplicable situation. But inexplicable situation well until the entire film holds, and the characters are quite intriguing. <br /> <br /> It starts a little cutesy, but actually improves. The protagonist of one, we can identify, at least, have some sympathy for. Audie Murphy character of early film does not cause any sympathy, and it is also samoopravdatsya without motivation. <br /> <br /> character in this film is worth a true anti-hero line. There is motivation, and the way his madness. We never feel that he is really "right", but we can see where he is. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in the film. There is also a bit of humor. One good scene, when the heroine tells the hero that she would not lie to him, and he was thinking that anymore. <br /> <br /> This film manages to do what the movie makers are trying to do for decades. This director and writer team got it right. <br /> <br /> recommended. A complete success.
