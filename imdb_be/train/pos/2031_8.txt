Such a masterpiece as the first of the two films Snowy River was the continuation of man with Snowy River has everything you should be tracking. He did not touch his predecessor, preferring to leave the legend that was the first film to live in some unique immortality. <br /> <br /> The man from Snowy River II is based on the return of Jim Craig to the river again after a three year absence. Thin film tells the history of changes in the nineteenth century, in Australia's history, legends and horses. The storyline shows a touch of Hollywood in lighter shades, an aspect that was completely absent in the first film, but it is a blend uniquely with a clear sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is much brighter than the first film, and much more spectacular, with the previous specific aspects included in the film, but with Man II Snowy River each has an essential characteristic of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, a stunning focal point of the Australian high country, while others have impressive shots of horses ever filmed, and a fantastic and very touching Rowland Bruce soundtrack, which is equal to the first in all respects. Jeff Burroughs did an excellent job with this film, and it is very worthy of recognition, especially in terms of quality of the Australian film industry. Lead shot, by Tom Borlinsona to Sigrid Thornton, and a good replacement for Brian Dennehy, make them part with the same enthusiasm and distinction as the first film. How a sequel can go, man from Snowy River II is a masterpiece; deeply moving and inspiring experience again.
