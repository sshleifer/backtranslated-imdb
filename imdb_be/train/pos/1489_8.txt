In general, the film OK. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than in Gubra period of its history, its sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that makes me touched. Yes, I agree that the boy (Muhsin) made his actions very well. Brilliant. I can say that his action is almost natural. <br /> <br /> However, the song «Ne Me Quitte Pas» Nina Simone really «" menaikkan "my" bull " 'Gypsy'. <br /> <br /> I love this song. And the song. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded a song. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> And a salute Yasmin. the end of the movie makes me credit again and touched. We can see how Jasmine really appreciated her parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves the Grand Prix of the international jury at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give from 8.5 to 1O stars.
