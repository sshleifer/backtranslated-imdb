I was very happy to see this movie. Finally, I think that Australia has made a good movie .. but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was the most pathetic attempt slasher ever. Ringwald sorry for having to go all the way to Australia to make a horrible film. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible (especially the Australian guy who is trying to speak with an American accent), and the story was also very bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this movie comes out, I thought the name was miserable (because it sounds like a cheesy film «Stab» in Scream 2), but I was willing to let it slide when it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> WARNING !!! Major spoilers !!! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about the movie was the ending. I was expecting a big surprise as to who was the killer .. but the killer was not even a man .. who has turned this into a realistic creepy slasher horror film. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie. . you probably will be disappointed!
