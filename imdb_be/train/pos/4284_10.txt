This film is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate images of mentality, which seems to be imbued with the Balkans once again, 45 years after the time drew. All ordinary characters and conflicts presented with anger, sadness and love together, it is impossible to decide whether to cry or laugh will be a more appropriate response. The accuracy of image types and hard times, however, make it a great movie to see if someone wants to understand a bit of what made the former Yugoslavia in his madness. In fact, none of the diplomat business with the region should not try anything until they have seen the film, and its twin, * Maratonci trce pocasni Krug. * Did I mention that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
