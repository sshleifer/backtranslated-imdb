Karloff and Lugosi - together again! This is one of those movies that casual fans will take over and, as a rule, do not appreciate more. This is not a total horror film, like the previous two hits of the duo, The Black Cat and The Raven. But, it is very worthy of both talent and a fun movie, revisited. <br /> <br /> An invisible beam from the Hilayer Lambert, a director who mostly westerns, but I wonder, in these last days Laemmles 'reign to Universal, he discovered that it is helming and Laemmles' final horror film, the daughter of Dracula. Both crispy outlined fantasies that are very light on the content of horror, despite the fantastical elements. <br /> <br /> Just as mad Lugosi in The Raven, a lot to say Hemming Karloff in Invisible Ray. One aspect of this story that is particularly unsatisfactory that the character Karloff, movement, acting so crazy before he poisoned by radium, X, which is actually not so much change as soon as it begins to glow. This is very similar to the complaints of the people about Jack Nicholson in shining - He basically crazy from the start. There is no real transformation. Just. Halfway through Karloff simply has an additional purpose for revenge in his head. I still use his performance, though, just as I Lugosi over-the-top antics in the crow. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Lugosi completely surprises you and offers a discreet and thoughtful turn as HP's rival in science Dr. Bennett. Lugosi also have some of the best lines in the film, including the memorable warning to the police, trying to catch the movement, with whom I am in alignment with the horror film writer John Soister on - "And if he (HF) affects any" the inspector asked. Lugosi hesitantly responds, so that only Lugosi can deliver, "They die." Just like Lugosi can be so far away, it can also be more perfect than any actor. This is one of those moments. <br /> <br /> Thus, Karloff and Lugosi interaction are all very well, we get crazy antics Karloff compared with cool logic against Lugosi. Karloff would continue to play a similar mad scientists many times, however, one wants Lugosi got to play a more direct role like this. He was just one more chance (Nina). <br /> <br /> invisible Ray is an interesting film, and a real treat for true lovers of Karloff and Lugosi. This is one of those films that improve each viewing, not because it is a masterpiece, but because of the charisma and talent of their stars and how this story complements the darker, more horrific mating they had. Special Effects by John Fulton has always innovative, are terrific actors and support all adequate. Francis Drake looks as beautiful as she did in the mad love and playing a strong woman, something rare in the classic horror films. The scene in the end, if Karloff has on her, and she does not cry is one of the most fascinating moments of the film. Stunning, funny film!
