Most of the 70s (and 80s) Kong Kong martial arts films barely function as movies; As a rule, there are several well-planned sequence of fights, but scraped the plot is quite thin, to fill in the gaps between these nodes. - as a porn film, in fact <br /> <br /> But this one does a few things well. The most honest, is the direction and choreography, which limits each of combatants to the "style". - it is in fact based on the Chinese circus acrobatics and comedy theater, but the effect works <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is the camera language, which uses some impressive techniques (even by today's measure), the change in the velocity projection on the real time time to slow down, and by filtering the unfiltered views reflect the direction of the history of the past or the future. <br /> <br /> A less obvious, but the most powerful and unexpected, it is construction. The winner of the contest is determined by who "unfolding" story. Master (author) sets the game, where the main character does not know who he was looking for, which is the same position we were in the audience. One by one, he finds out who is who, at the same rate, we find who is who. All this costs a tragedy / arc noir. The ending is committed to irony, a la «The Sting». Much more intelligent things than what we usually get from this genre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​"five poisons" is a template for Tarantino's "Deadly Viper assassins" of the volumes of "Kill Bill".
