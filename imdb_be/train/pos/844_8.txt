A chance meeting between the seller and the hit-man changes both their lives. This odd film that works, an impressive effort for a screenwriter and director Shepard. In boldly unpopular role that is far from James Bond, Brosnan surprisingly effective as a lone hit man who begins to buckle under the strain of his work, but can not connect emotionally with someone to help him cope. Kinnear is equally good as the seller, decent guy with the emptiness in his life. Davis well as the flirtatious wife of Kinnear in. Basically character study, the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, very dark comedy.
