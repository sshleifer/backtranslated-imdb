It is better adaptation of the book than the one with Paltrow (although I liked that one, too). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but the script better. Davis is a master Austen adaptation to film, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not quite as glossy Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought that the place and costumes actually worked better.
