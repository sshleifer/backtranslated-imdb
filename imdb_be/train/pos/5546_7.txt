Some people say it's the best film ever made China, I'm not too sure about that, because I have a fond place in my heart for some of their secrets. I will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they, or any other studio, large or small, has ever released. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. Ghost properly executed ferryman returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him, and all of them with the spring. In this mix comes a granddaughter of the ghosts of the victims, the current ferryman. She takes on the ferry business, like a ghost locked on the man she loves. <br /> <br /> enveloped in a thick fog, and set mainly in a bog to fix it more musical poem than a conventional feature film.Listen to the rhythms of dialogue, especially in the early stages, they are a poetic tone to them. Similarly, there is a similar tone to the camera as it moves back and forth through the swamp as if crossing to and fro through the door, as the difference between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or music lesson object more than the usual horror movie. Its an amazing piece of filmmaking, which is probably unique in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> It's not Lily guild. This low-budget horror movie / mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained. His story of love and revenge, that there is a value, not a poetic filmmaking and keeps your attention in the first place (the technical aspects of just being a show-off.) If there is a real lack of its low cost of production. The fog really sets the mood, but it also hides the fact that it is completely dry swamp land. Constant back and forth on it all right for a while, but even after 58 minutes, you want so that we can see something else. <br /> <br /> Or do not get me wrong, I like the film very much. Its a nice little movie that I, as some wish it was a little less poverty. It is definitely worth a look if you can find it.
