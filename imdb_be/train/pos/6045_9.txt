I was in the movie, too, but I do not know when they actually put this scene. On the way back from a school trip (in 2005), we stopped at a gas station at the same time as they did the movie, and we asked for (all of us) to run up and shouting Go! Freebird! We were all about 10 years, can anyone who has seen the film tell me when this piece was actually stored in the film, it would be nice to know! I remember that I thought that the film will never come, because it was two and a half years before he was released. All your comments, it seems okay, so I guess it was a pretty successful film, I could buy it, but first I would like to know if I'm in it! : D Thanks
