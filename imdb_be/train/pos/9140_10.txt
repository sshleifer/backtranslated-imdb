I love this movie !!! Purple Rain came out the year I was born, and it was my heart, because I remember. Prince is so tight in this film. I went to a special screening of Purple rain last night and it was like a concert, I was glad to see that some true fans call this film is so undervalued, it is truly one of the greatest films of all time. Music inviolable. A film about «The Kid», plays the prince, his family is inactive, his team is the hottest act in town, and he has his eye on Apollonia, the aspirant singer. There is no question why purple is my favorite color, I thank «The Kid» for it. So if you have not seen it, then you need as quickly as possible. This is a classic - 4ever!
