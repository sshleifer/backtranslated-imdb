It is interesting, fast-paced and fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those people who follow the loading and television load. I stumbled on this show while home sick with a bad case of the flu for one day, and was immediately hooked. I have developed quite a crush on John Burke. He and Claire did an amazing job hosting the show together. You can tell that they both loved their jobs. <br /> <br /> The segments super-collector were excellent. I discovered that he was interested in the things that I had never given any thought to <br /> <br /> What I really would like to know :. Whatever happened to Jack the dog? Is one of the hosts to take it?
