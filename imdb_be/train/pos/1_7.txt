If you love comedy cartoons for adults, like South Park, it is almost the same size, about the adventures of three young teenage girls in Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave explode candy and behaved like a bitch, I think Keisha good leader. There are also small stories that take place with the school's teachers. In the same idiotic chief, Mr. Putt, a teacher of mathematics nervous, and many others. The cast also fantastic, Lenny Henry Gina Jasher, EastEnders Chris Watts, Oberman, claps Pony Dun Makkichen, Dead ringers Mark Perry and oversight Nina Conti. I do not know what it is in Canada, but it's very good. Very good!
