This movie is terrible, because you can find yourself in relation to the ideas that they have and can remember other people are saying, and that have simialr ideas to make this a haunting well done film .... style CAMRA Sun Cuba to show that It draws you out of the movie, as the Blair witch it only adds to the raw "real" feeling of the film, which makes it.
