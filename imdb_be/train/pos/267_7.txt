It all starts with a series of thefts seemingly unrelated objects in a boarding school for students at Hickory Road, London. Worried about her sister, who was a housekeeper there, Miss Lemon asks Poirot to look into the matter. He agrees, but soon the rates go up, when the girl, who admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) of the theft, was found dead. <br /> <br /> «Hickory Dickory Dock» is a solid brain exercise, not being on the mind-numbingly complicated as "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe». Murder, theft and smuggling of diamonds is a crime related, and a final twist that ties all is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, in particular, a psychology student Colin McNabb and a mysterious American girl Sally Finch, Zhepp inspector have their funny moments (in perhaps the closest the series has come "toilet humor"), and Miss Lemon gets more integral part of the to the story than usual.
