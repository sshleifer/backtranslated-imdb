No, there is! <br /> <br /> For every fan of Star Wars should have an opinion about the I, II and III of, and because it is a biased opinion because we missed so much atmosphere and characters of the original trilogy I speak for the good moments, "Return of the Jedi" and several relevant prequel bad points. Of course, I loved the music, special effects, two android, but it was too discussed elsewhere <br /> <br /> What do we get in the original trilogy, and in this particular film: -. Strong environmental concerns - anti-militarist position - Exciting ideas about the Jedi Order and the forces - cute creatures - smile Harrison Ford - Killer Scene: Near the end, when Vader looks alternatively at the son and emperors. Lightning bolts mortals reflected in his black send. And when he had enough and betrays his master to save Luke, thereby risking their own lives! Oh, boy <br /> <br /> What is wrong in the prequel INMHO: - an element of a "human factor" that the original cast was able to move forward as there is not enough - The strength seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than wisdom - Jedis too much at once and too much light saber on the screen - the lack of experience of several actors threaten the coherence of the story too often <br /> <br /> By the way, if you use the theory of forces, as explained to the Ob Web (Ob Wen, I mean ) and Yoda, you should read some books about Buddhism and the form they took him in ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> magic of Star Wars, IMHO lie mainly within the spiritual heritage from master to apprentice, from father to son, although difficulties. "Mon âme De Ton AME» (from my soul to yours), as it would be to write Bejard until the end of the Zen master T. Deshimaru.
