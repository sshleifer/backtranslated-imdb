I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis. If Leo, Senior announces that he is HIV + reactions of family members only, and with each other is touching and yet strangely <br /> <br /> I've never seen a family that was physically demonstrative, like this one. none is probably shout at each other. I do not understand why the family believes that Jr can not cope with the news, but when something in the past that it is difficult I found it a thoroughly moving film. <br /> <br />
