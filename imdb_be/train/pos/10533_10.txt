I totally agree that "nothing" is not science fiction film, I have not laughed so much when I watched the movie for the ages! And David Hewlett and Andrew Miller fantastic in it! They really work well together! This film may not appeal to some people (I can not say why, without spoiling it!), but each to their own! I loved it and highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The direction of large, and some of the shots are very clever. it looks like though they may have had a lot of fun while filming it! <br /> <br /> But in fact there are only 2 main lane anazhav in the film and not a lot of props the actors were able to pull it out and make the film enjoyable to watch.
