Since it's been a few years since I reviewed this classic, I decided to go back and review it over to the department, but the first few insider notes from the film critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those, I grew up, it made my childhood joy, he made it strange to skip some of these things today that we clearly do not see as much as we did in those day, and a viewing ... <br /> <br /> Miracle on a bend, or Luftens Helte which it is called in Denmark is a great animated series, it is the same as the chip and Dale, DuckTales, and a lot of those old so that there is something strange feeling surrounding it, I can not remember this series as much as I would like to remember. <br /> <br /> But, in my opinion, it was very great, he came up with some message, not that of the wild reports, however it is one of the old, so that can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I do not want to seem old or anything, but I feel just slipped out of my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or anything else surprising as it is, we have all these new or nearly new shows like Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel that we have the same spirit in cartoons or real show, as we did in the early days. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that the time has changed a lot, to conclude, I would be happy to see this series as Miracles on bends release again on the TV screen instead of all new ones, give me back my children's cartoons, give them to the children, I have a certain day, to give them back ...
