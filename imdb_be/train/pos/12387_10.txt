Of all the films of the seventies, no one has captured the true essence of good versus evil battle, as did the Guardian. I mean, yes, there were such films as the caster and the other of them; but none of them have captured the human element of the protagonist, like this one. If you have time, check this one out. You may not be able to get past the dated devices per se, but this story is worth it to into.Then have all the stars and soon-to-be stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles, and Burgess Meredith. Then there is the subtle clues that lead to what is going on as well. Pay close attention. I had to watch it four times to catch all the smaller strange statements like "black and white cat, black and white cake." In addition, these books are really good as well. I just wish that they were not going to turn the second book in the film. It is so terrible that it would surpass the film.
