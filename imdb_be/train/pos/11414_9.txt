Great story with a message. Joan Plowright beautiful as "Phoebe" Mike Kopsa fun, as a "coach" and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "carmine" great. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" sets a good performance and Ingrid as "yellow" played his first leading role very well. This film is beautifully directed by Jo-Beth Williams. Modify the first speed.
