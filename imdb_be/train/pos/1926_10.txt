In 1967 I visited the glider port Lake Elsinore flying yellow Pratt Read glider. Back in Germany, the above-mentioned serious run on television and one segment was about a glider flight at high altitude in California in the early 50s. (Pilot real life Bill was Ivana, I do not know who played with him in a series) It was found that the glider in the film was the same (the same N-number) as the one I arrived at Lake Elsinore. Ever since I saw the segment I found for that and was wondering if it's somewhere there. (Other segments that were seriously about Baker Ejection seat; tool to find victims of avalanches, etc.
