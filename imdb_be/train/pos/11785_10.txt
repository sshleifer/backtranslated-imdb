I do not know how to explain Â«Darkend number" because it will be bored not really do it justice. It is the quintessence Lynchian short movie with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I'd say it's a short, definitely more on the "Mulholland Drive" Lynchian end of the spectrum, in contrast to the "Elephant Man" and "The Straight Story". It is hidden on the site of Lynch, and should look for.
