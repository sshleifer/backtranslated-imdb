Probably, the first Portuguese film I've seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The plot is connected both young officers seized power in Portugal in 1974, to the final defeat of the fascist government Cajetan and also to end the war in the colonies, ie Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film depict with accuracy the behavior of officers and soldiers to carry out a coup, the oppressed people who were very pleased with this new development and freedom, resistance men CAETANO, as well as a subtle way to the most conservative officials, including Spinola, who He took over as the new president. Portuguese revolution can remember, due to the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain has stated that Portugal should develop in a democratic way, and this is what the country has achieved a few years after the coup or coup. The film also shows that the officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies respected at the end.
