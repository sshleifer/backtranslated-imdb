I have not read this book, but all through the movie, I was struck with only one thought in my head: It's so Vonnegut. I've never seen the author of all life and intelligence work for the novel, translated as good films. This film was the same difficulty in the novels Vonnegut :. Jokes were often significant and symbolic, and the dramatic events and characters were often jokes <br /> <br /> Campbell was also very Vonnegut character, drew perfectly Nick Nolte. He had all the ear of Vonnegut's "hero" :. Neglect of political boundaries, ironic dark humor gives way to silent inaction in response to stress, and the unwillingness to put forward his version of reality to those who are around him <br /> <br /> as a whole, all the time I was surprised and impressed when I I watched this movie. It was the same feeling I had read "Cat's Cradle" my first Vonnegut novel, like most absolutely amazing what can happen, what he thought about it, and he made it real and important. Yes, he has nothing but the army surplus albums «White Christmas». So it goes!
