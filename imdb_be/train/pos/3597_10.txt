(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm blown away by this film. I rented a little on Movielink, and decided to check out this film with. Alot of boxing movies seem to inflate blood. In this film he shows it on the amature level. Although I would like to see perhaps more attention could be brought up, perhaps it improve its assessment. The film points out the problems, some families are facing the floor. <br /> <br /> I was a little concerned with the end. But the ending was disappointing too. <br /> <br /> I think it was quite clear from the title that she won. What was unexpected was that the two of them back together kind of late. <br /> <br /> I loved assessment for some scenes. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality :. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Replayable: 10/10
