... On stage, television, or in the book "Woman in Black" is an outstanding ghost story. Other reviewers have said just about everything that can be said about this film, but I thought I would add my review a little late too. The film is made for television is notoriously slow first act, which chronicles the protagonist of Arthur as he goes about his business as a lawyer in 1920 in London. I can understand why this may not appeal to all tastes. However, for me, I love the British style of narration similar to any of Â«Ghost Story for Christmas," the BBC adaptations of work by a large MG James. In the second act, the story of a ghost kicks Arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss to put in order the affairs of a deceased client. The third act inexorably builds to a spine tingling conclusion ... As a Londoner, I saw the game. I have books, DVD-R and has unabridged audio book on my iPod, too. What is undoubtedly for me, "Women in Black" in any medium ghost story with a few equals. It is about time that we had a legitimate area 2 DVD-release.
