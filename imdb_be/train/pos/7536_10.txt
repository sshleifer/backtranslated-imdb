Complain to the person who said that Pat Robertson is evil and it has nothing to harm the program, in order to compare what is evil and righteous. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people would call good evil and evil good! He does not even know that he has fulfilled Bible prophecy! If you do not know God and refuse to know now that everything is in order. He still loves you, but if you finally knelt before Him, and you will, it will be too late for you. God does not send to hell, not even you! You get your solutions and your Spewing defines it! May God have mercy on you and allow you to experience the road to Damascus. Club and Pat Robertson Ministry 700 is one of the reasons why I am still here. At the edge of alcoholism, adultery, and possibly death, God reached through the TV screen and use Pat Robertson, to do it, and thank God he did! You have the right to say what you said, but you have no right to curse with your words. God have mercy on you.
