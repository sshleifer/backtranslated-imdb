This is what the movie should be when trying to capture the essence of what is very surreal. He has this muddy overtones, which is rarely captured on film, it feels like a dream sequence, and really moves you into the dark memories haunt. The children were very believable, and I'm waiting for some things to come with him in the future. Very natural acting for such young, I do not know when Bill pulled it out of them, or is there just fine, but no less beautiful. Bill won, I understand, and comment on KevNJeff about Mr. Paxtons bad actor that can make one in that role. He played the role well enough, in my opinion. It comes from the one who said, well Hamlet (The Ethan Hawke version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. Great movie to make you feel very uncomfortable, if that's what you want? The operator receives a higher than average rating, too.
