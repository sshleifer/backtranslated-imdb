Gray Gardens is shocking, funny, sad and fascinating. I watched in amazement as a junior and senior Ediths argued and performed while remembering their past. Their existence in a dilapidated mansion (which they did not leave for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. This film will not soon forget.
