"Film noir" is an expression of abuse, when it comes to describing the movie. Each crime drama, it seems, "noir". But "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is indeed a good example of that genre of all. <br /> <br /> Very briefly, overzealous detective (Andrews) accidentally kills nya-goodnik, who works for the mafia. The murder blamed on his father (Tom Tully) Women Andrews meets and falls in love (Tierney). In order to save Dad from Old Sparky, Andrews captures the rest of the crowd and turns himself in. <br /> <br /> The moral blame the police controlled by pulses from the past. His father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail. But it does not does not justify his actions after he accidentally off in no-goodnik in self-defense. He immediately goes to the phone to report the incident, but he hesitates. He was already in hot water with the department, and it could end his career. Then, at the wrong time the phone rings. This partner Andrews and Andrews says he suspects they are trailing not home. He hides the body and dispose of it later, postponing the watchman and dumping the body in the river. <br /> <br /> What makes a guy do something so stupid? All right. His work was in danger. But now he has committed several criminal offenses. At least, I think they should be few. I counted obstruction of justice, assault, having a body without authorization, littering, first degree mopery and false witness against your neighbor. <br /> <br /> In the end, we do not know whether or not the root Andrews stands. The suspect did not deserve to die, it is true, but it still was an accident, because Andrews did not know that he was a war hero and "had a silver plate in his head." Maybe it's something ambiguity that made noir that it was, among other things, such as the distinctive lighting. If noir is not involved nothing more than black-and-white photographs, murder, criminals, secret and suspicious of women, then we would have to include all of Charlie Chan films under this heading. <br /> <br /> Andrews pretty good. He is a kind of Mark McPherson (from "Laura") left bitterness. He never laughs, and rarely smiles, even when sitting at a restaurant table with Gene Tierney, the situation is likely to prompt a smile from many men. He has no sense of humor at all. His jokes are few-downs. When he puts his snitch in the cockpit and a snitch says, "Caution. I almost hit my head, "Andrews has a riposte," That's good. The cab's insured. " Andrews may seem kind of wood at a time, but it's a role that requires a persistent sense of humor and determination, and he handles it well. Downplay its perfect for this role. Small twitching or blinking project their thoughts and emotional states. And I believe that the director, Preminger, stopped him on the pronunciation of the bullet as a «BOO Surrender" and the police as «POE-lice." I could never make up his mind about Gene Tierney. She's fine as the daughter of Thomas Tull, a model, but she, like Marilyn Monroe in the fact that you can not separate the accepted manner of real facial features. Is Tierney actually have such an innocent, almost righteous person? When she answered the phone at home, did her voice has the same sing, and the quality that it does on the screen? Poor Tierney walked through some bad mental things before any effective medications for bipolar disorder. And Andrews is also a nice guy, even though he seems to have been, slipped into alcoholism before finally recovery and the creation of social advertising. <br /> <br /> DVD-Peter Mueller comments unpretentious, informed and sometimes funny. <, Br /> <br /> In any case, it's a good movie and a good example of film noir. The good guys are not all good, but the bad guys are bad. Perhaps the ambiguity that makes it an adult instead of a picture of popcorn cinema. For children, only one shot on the screen and the head blows draws. Sorry.
