I do not mind soundtrack that is played today. <br /> <br /> However, Debra Winger is always interesting, and while it was before, the role for her, she's pretty good as Sissi, the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, lived in a trailer with Bud (Travolta ), only replaced by the time the city raincoats Smith-Osborne as a competitor. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous review about Scott Glenn, he used to plot thrown to the mix to create intrigue; the story is predictable and natural. <br /> <br /> In addition, even if I'm from the east, many of us do not like Â«Saturday Night Fever", while he had his moments, the eternal stereotypes beyond criticism in this point <br /> <br /> If you look at Debra Winger. she is still so cute, and never was that Hollywood persona we are exposed to too many actresses today. 7/10
