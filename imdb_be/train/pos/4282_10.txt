Superbly developed character in many funny situations full of spirit, and the absurdity of the Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, nice, interesting and unpredictable. The best moment in the film: the characters, then he humor, story and dialogues. Humor has the "inner development", rare in Serbian films. Thus, this is a consequence of characteristics well motivated, spontaneous and unquestionable. In addition, a sharp, intelligent and informed. Most of the movies, unfortunately, was built humor (to develop a joke and put it into a character's mouth) or the normal situation comedy, parody, farce. Some of the "art of immortality" are included in this film. A small masterpiece, hardly achievable.
