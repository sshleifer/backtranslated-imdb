I really liked this movie, yes, I know, it was pretty far-fetched, there is no way that Shelby car might have managed to stay on the road, as well as the 540i with all the traction control and the other stuff, but other than that the whole film was well together. Cage was excellent as usual, and the rest of the cast were also pretty good, with the exception of Brit Bad Guy, he was a bit "too" much do not you think? Anyway, a great film, great cars and great action. I for one have seen that my car was locked and alarmed at my remote control garage that night. :)
