I was 15 years old when the movie premieres on TV. Being brought up in Texas, I saw sadness & monotony of teenage life there. This film touched my impressionable teenage heart, and I remembered it gently through the last 12 years. Recently, I got to see it the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time thanks channel LOVE. I'm still crying, because the film reaches and touches my inner teenager confused.
