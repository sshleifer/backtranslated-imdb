This for me was a great introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. It is not only gorgeous, but the paddle in this film. (I think that Lucille Ball is modeled after her career in the style of Davis, who could be called "stupid beauty".) Vidor direction is easy, but sure hand, the history of chestnut, of course, but the acting is surprisingly modern and the stars smotryut element for silent fans with plenty of Kama, adds to the overall enjoyment. It combines elements of farce with an adult drama and good old-fashioned romance of eternal good enough. For all movie lovers who have knee-jerk reaction to watching silent films, to sit through it, and it can change your attitude. <br /> <br />
