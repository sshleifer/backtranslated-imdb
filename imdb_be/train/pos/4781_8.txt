Mulholland Drive gave me a final supporter of David Lynch. He was a modern genius, because he is not only a filmmaker. His stories and his style has a spell that crosses the screen. So simple story was quite a surprise to me, since it is easy to follow storyline and solar kits. However, Lynch is, and while it is far from his best, this is a film not to be missed. performance of the late Richard Farnsworth is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
