The year 2000 was a bad year for Indian films because of the lack of quality and imagination of the producers. Besides Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing stood out. CCCC was a lot of contraversy in connection with the financing of the film, and it is with knowing that the film has generated a good publicity and additional ticket sales for the film around India and abroad. Only information was that it was a thriller. The film has now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly good. The basic plot linked to the surrogate and well handled. And Salman Preiti gives a good idea of ​​where Salman did not actually take the shirt to be all..must effects !! Rani plays Salmans wife, but it's a little less demanding role than Preiti, who plays a prostitute who eventually becomes a surrogate mother. Three main conclusions confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they have a solid on-screen and off-screen chemistry (apparently). Salman Khan, who perfectly plays a major role in the film as a successful business person and pity is operated as a wannabe comedian in his other films, he is very undervalued in the film industry of Mumbai is partly due to the films he chooses. Rani's character does not know Preiti prostitute until the end ... it's kept from her and the other members of the family ... the rest you have to figure out how it will spoil the movie if I told you. All songs are well filmed especially dekhne Walon and the main title song. Other supporting actors do the minimum, but the outstanding efforts as Salmans loving family. Abbas Mastan's shot and edited the film subject tactfully..I say go and see it or rent it out, whatever you prefer!
