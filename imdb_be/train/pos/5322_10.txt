The true dark film noir and very graphic film, a good story about a man in pursuit of redemption that may simply have left it all too late. Visually, there's some really good scenes artistically strange as to what can be done with a minimal budget. Full marks to Gareth Maxwell Roberts and the team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, but hopefully more British actors would be great. Lisa Ray looked cute to see her for the first time and we hope to see her again in the future. The theme of all the interesting sex, drugs and violence. Bring it. I would definitely say rent this and check it out when you are in the mood for a semitrailer moody noir.
