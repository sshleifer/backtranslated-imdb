Give something real and true is a challenge. Knowing how to take it off and put it together without making it trivial even better. Ishai Setton film is one of those where you can learn about life in all its simplicity and beauty. I was touched by the "Big Bad SwimÂ» and from that moment on, I'll push it as far as I can. It's just a shame that I can not have something to show off to your friends (you know, such as a DVD ???), because to speak well ... but giving something to see better. Anyone who can not go to the festival, to identify the pearl like that this movie really worth it to put in there! Many thanks to the staff of this master piece, and I'm waiting for it to be distributed.
