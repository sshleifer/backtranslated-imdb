I saw this movie a few days ago. This film is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed about it - you can have it. This shows a great desire to come to pass trought happiness and sadness, hopelessness, and failure. But if you are strong enough, and your heart truly belongs to something that you love, you can do different things, and be happy.
