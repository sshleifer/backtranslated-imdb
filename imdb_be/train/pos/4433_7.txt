Her free spirit and a thirst for life is intriguing Bob, who suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. Her life is not as simple as it seems, however. Through Kathleen, Bob becomes entangled in a dangerous network. Kathleen will be able to gain his confidence <br /> <br /> Overview: The dialogue in this movie is very natural, and the story unfolds nicely, although it remains a bit on the surface, and it would be good if the character "psychology" would little more produced. Why do these people do what they do? what motivates your choice? This is what gives the film a depth and something to think about, in my opinion. the story never reaches an emotional climax, even if the characters go through enough to justify it. Thus, you can not know s that the signs at a deeper level. The actors provide good work and play in a very natural and "true" way, but I think he would have approached the film better if Kathleen was played over the young actress as naiveness this character is not quite work for grown- to the woman. The camera work is good, and there are some great pictures of nature on the island. I give the movie to 7/10.
