Despite the best efforts of Disney, it's quite a nice film about following your dreams. I was surprised that he did not hit me as overly sentimental; this film is played fairly. Dennis Quaid has been a very, very good in the role, which is saying something for a sports movie. I can not remember how many sports movies were little oddities that bothered me; here, everything looks the part. This film is surprisingly good, and I predict that it will do a strange thing as a G-rated film, which does not require the viewer to think. Ebert, on the contrary, this film is a success.
