A few years ago, when I first saw "Gray Gardens" I remember laughing and find it hilarious camp. Many years later I still laugh out loud when I look at it, but after many views I have come to see the beauty in strange, twisted relationship between inseparable "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter 'Little' Edith Bouvier Beale. <, Br /> <br /> Mother and daughter live together in their decaying 28 East Hampton mansion rooms add a new meaning to the term "shabby chic". With countless cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece Jackie O. allowed filmmakers Albert and David Maysles into their house to film their live life day by day. As a result, cheerful, beautiful, sad and moving through true love and anarchy rules. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Eddie is a testament to the indissoluble bond of love. And their life example of the drive, determination and free will. This film has more to recommend it than I can lay down in words. It is a rare experience that you should see for yourself. <br /> <br />
