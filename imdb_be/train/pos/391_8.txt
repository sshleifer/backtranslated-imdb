Â«Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain" was an impressive and classic! You would never have guessed that this was done in 1983. The use of Tsui Hark in special effects were very creative and inventive. (He continued to do so in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.) Even now, he can measure up to other movies in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is connected to "Zu" warriors with magic mountain "! No need to see the film to understand the plot of it. The plot is a little hard to follow. But, frankly, it doesn" t matter. It's all about the action and adventure! I always wondered what Tsui Hark would do when he got his hands on the CGI. Now we know that he made this film. Maybe it is sometimes too much, but the overall result is so beautiful, that I will not be crucial in this. There is so much happening on the screen, you just will not believe it! I think it's a great shame that this film was not shown in theaters here in Holland. Because this is a movie shouting at the screen time in cinemas! this film could easily beat the big-budget Hollywood productions like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing that I have mention is the lack of humor in most of Tsui Hark film, it combines drama, fantasy, martial arts and humor. like something is missing in this film. Again, I'm not going to be picky or ut these minor issues. "Legend of Zu" delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects that you see. A true classic!
