I saw this series when he was the world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea of ​​the film, where the two men got together and said, directors from each country to direct a film about 911. These producers have never met before, until the project was completed, and they saw what he looked like together. NOTE: Spoilers ahead !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All parts were very powerful, and some of them have been controversial. If you are an American, then you may not like this, as some of the parts can be found by anti-American. However, I know several Americans who use these series. A piece that I found the best one was from India. It was about how a Muslim family living in the United States, had two sons, and one of them was missing. Americans have given them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked to a terrorist bombing. It captures mothers despair and humiliation of these charges is so good that the tears in my eyes. In the end, we see that her son died trying to save many victims of the collapse of the towers. It was a true story, and that was what made it so real. There was a lot of emotional and strong parts and African piece was one of the best. It was a humorous yet just as powerful as the other. A must see for everyone, and we hope America unban it, and let him play in their country.
