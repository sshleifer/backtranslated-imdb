wow! this is a good movie! Act is not very good, but if you look at some points in the film, rewind and watch it again, it's genius! Man in the beginning of the film runs with a suitcase against three. WOW! I never expected. Then he puts the coke in your suitcase and runs away. I bet that guy smoking against the three was one of his companions, who were selling drugs later. And genius quotes: "" pleasant shades, I need a pair of "" "" of your .. if you think you can take them .. "" .. just Brilliant! And the fight is the best I've seen in a while. Look at the other guy, he takes down after he was hit in the head first guy to the table. HIT THAT! And in the middle of the film, a guy in a car fired once, then 3 Man falls, he is really good at aiming. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so fascinating that James Cahill walk 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot Jayson Peters after distracting moves. Jason Peters fall down and roll over again until he's dead! I can not say more than words how great this movie!
