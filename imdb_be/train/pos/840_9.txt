I was not sure what to expect from this film. I love watching Brosnan in any film, it is always good, but it was very different. He was a mess, and plays very well be a mess. In fact, he reminded me of myself a few times back at uni :) So yeah, there's not a lot of violence, there is not a lot of action, but the dialogue crack acting fine and very refreshing, and it's pretty funny too :) I do not think that you came out of the cinema is "wow! I was blown away, "but you come out smiling after enjoying a good movie. I can not ask for more than that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, some moron put ADverts reel in the wrong, and you will get flipped upside down, the negatives (back audio) advertising !! Brilliant. Nothing like watching ads Jack Daniels, where the drink comes back in a bottle made of glass with a rude American "Twin Peaks" comment :)
