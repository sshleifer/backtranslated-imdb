When I saw this film, I was amazed that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should be in theaters. I've seen a lot of movies that are about rape, but this one stands out. This film takes the form of realism, which is very rare in cinema today, not to mention the television movies. This is evidenced by the history, I'm sure it's very realistic, many rape victims in towns today, and I found it very believable (something difficult to find in another rape centered films). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were strange in those parts they played. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that are a bit harsh reality to them. I enjoyed it very much.
