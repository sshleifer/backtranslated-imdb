One of the best films for all ages. You'll never look at LION KING again without thinking about additional stories added this film. For almost 40 years I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight and I laughed and enjoyed the movie so much for a long time. <br /> <br /> Take some time out and look at it with the children, he will remind you of how Disney used to be when you were a young one.
