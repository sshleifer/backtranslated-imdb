While some point, I thought it would turn into a graduate, I have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an old woman. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad that this is a British film, because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if they were, they would have destroyed it is not the time to develop the characters. <br /> <br /> history is revealed slowly and realistically. Actions perfectly believable characters spoiled, and the dialogue is sensitive. Many times I have tried to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very intrigued by the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film. And I must admit, I always look at my mother in a different light!
