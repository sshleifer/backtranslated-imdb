This culinary competition show, Americanized. It will not be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I could care less about cooking, but this show is just fun to watch ... From the intensity embedded in the dish from the chefs to the stupid President. A really good way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the show for what guests like Marc Ecko as a judge ... but ... meh. It is entertaining enough to watch and generally deserves the prize winner. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and I'm bitter, John Besh such a new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Alla kitchen!
