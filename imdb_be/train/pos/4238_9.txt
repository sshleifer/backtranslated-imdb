On the surface, it is higher than the average postwar romantic comedy. Under the veneer, this MGM character actor stunt-casting for its funny. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is simple, but a lot of Secondary cast against type. Margaret Hamilton (aka The Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive-compulsive worrier), and Sig Ruman (Nemesis Marx Brothers in _Night In Casablanca_ and always-perfect _Night At The Opera_), plays the good intentions of the gang is trying to bring the two wires together rather than driving them apart, as they will do "normal" characters. <br /> <br /> He also makes fun of many conventions of romantic comedy, which is another indication that this may not be so much "right" romantic comedy as crooked promise of many post-war romantic comedies and their 2- dimensional, role. <br /> <br /> I have seen him only once, intermittently, so I can not be positive, but this film may be one of those who worked better in the context of the time in which it was made, but less well now that the audience "see" these secondary characters through an entirely different lens. I believe that this is the case, when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
