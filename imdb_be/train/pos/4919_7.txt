early noir Kazan won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here talk about the extraordinary detail and detail about the film and its symbolism, and appreciate it very high. I can almost see where they come. But I prefer to take a more subdued approach to the long-forgotten film that seems to have been shot on almost no budget and quasi-documentary style. Pneumonic plague is weakened in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to the military doctor (WIDMARK) and urban detective (Douglas) to delay the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, shot in harsh black and white, and makes very good use of places. Widmark is excellent, as usual. Forget the symbolism (the same offense disease, and the disease is equal to a crime) and just enjoy the chase. It's not always easy to watch a movie as it is now, when we are well into this new century, as it has a special style, which was very short (after the Second World War to the beginning of the 1950s), and is unlikely to be of interest to casual who watches the film. For those who will see it the first time, to sit for a great chase at the end. This is something different, and to be honest, I do not know how they filmed some of them. I can say that it probably took as long to remove the final, as did the first 90 percent of the film.
