I thought it was one of the best films I've seen in a very long time. It was a great story line and showed that people are so entangled in all kinds of different ways. I recommend it to all my friends !! I always enjoy a good storyline and the film was one of the best I've seen in a long time. I could see that I have a daughter and do the same thing, that Natalie had done to learn more about her life and loves. He showed how we are not only living with our families; but also part of our lives that we do not share with them. - as it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things that we do, that we are so proud <br /> <br /> I look forward to another such film, and will keep my eye.
