Ancient Mariner is really a classic part of the work, as the original poem was / is. Context / setting with the very old sailor fine, clearly and without pretense. Artwork that accompanies the reading of the poem is perfect time / period setting and the work itself, bringing the audience in the period yet, but moving support using different strategies still only good movement won a MTV era manufacturers and much less noticeable in the more current works. (MTV brought to television and video static traffic that races through, often insignificant reduction from topic to topic without progress and without a clear relationship to the theme or plot.) The voice, intonation and reading viability Redgrave brings this touching poem of life with all its fear, struggle and pain. In addition, smooth motion video emphasizes the tone and sometimes monotonous (in this case a positive mood for the theme of the story) rendition of the author sad and terrible tales of ancient Marek. It is a must for any love for classical poetry, sea, high tale that almost sounds plausible, and history, which has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of a "Albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" It's really a great experience. Thank you, Mr. DaSilva bringing this to life for us, we should never forget.
