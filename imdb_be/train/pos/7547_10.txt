Cat Soup at first seems very random animated film. The best way I was able to explain that it is quite sour. Although it is not entirely coincidental. The story of Nyatta, cat young boy and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako very sick and dies, however, Nyatta see your soul carries the death and may get half. The story of his quest to bring Nyaako fully back to life. <br /> <br /> While a lot of content in this film seems to be completely random, it is not. Most of them are for the symbolism of life, death and rebirth. You can also see links to other fairy tales such as Hansel and Gretal. It's surprisingly cute short film has an interesting history, packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the screen surface.
