When I first heard the name, I thought of «The Simpsons», as well as many other reviewers, but when I saw the actors, I was quite shocked that so many great character actors would actually be in it! First of all, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), which plays a major role in McBain. He saves from the Vietnamese POW camp, some of his friends, one of whom is Santos (Chick Wenner, Yankees), which breaks down the hundred dollar bill with McBain (Vietnam soldiers loaded with cash apparently), and said to him, he can again do a favor to him, if he'll ever get into trouble. <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christine (Maria Conchita Alonso, Running Man, Predator 2) to join the rebels in Colombia is trying to get rid of the evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, taxi driver, king of New York), and when the mission fails Santos, Christina goes to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain then asks him a good friend of Vietnam, to help him. Firstly, there is the hard token black guy, EASTLAND, which performs "American Ninja" 's Steve James, who was also the director James Glickenhaus' previous film, "exterminator", where the real name Exterminator was also Eastland, coincidence? I think not. There are many other references to the exterminator, among other things, the most notable of the fact that he wears welders mask McBain when Christina sees it for the first time when he works on the welding job at the top of the bridge! <br /> <br /> The other guys in the Vietnam-pack are: a rich guy who can afford all kinds of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), then there is a document Dalton (played by Jay Patterson, who does not look like a guy, IMDB is referred to, and I have not seen him in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, there is a police officer, Gil, who had it quite unsatisfactory work, he played Thomas G. Waites, that some of us can remember from the soldiers and things. <br /> <br /> and other great roles, we find Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way), as a small time drug dealer, who can not get a decent job. In addition, there is a Dick Bocelli as drug kingpin, who gets hung up at the tap on the top part of the roof on the McBain-gang, almost exactly the same as it was hung on a meat grinder John Eastland Exterminator in film! Now, I have not seen Glickenhaus The search / Blue Jean Cop "yet, but I'm almost willing to put half of the hundred-dollar dollars that Bocelli gets hung in this movie, too! <br /> <br /> Well, back to the story of this movie .. they go to Colombia and saves the day, it! But who cares about the plot in any case, a large cast, and the action scenes are very well done, and you will never get bored while watching this movie! it is highly recommended to all fans of action-packed!
