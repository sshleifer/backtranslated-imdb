I'm not a big fan of most of the anime Gundam Wing but it is really something else. Wing Gundam lacks all that stereotypical melodrama, which you might think of when you think of the anime, as the number of jokes over 17 hours will only double-digit, Gundam Wing gets straight to the point. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing as much political thriller as a series of actions. Large parts focus on Diplomatic Relations of war, not only in combat. Although the battle animations are missing parts in extreme cases where it would just be a pain to animate individual duels between the Gundams almost a work of art that examines animated using sophisticated mechanics and quick movements. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, this 49 episode plus one film series was picked up by the network of the cartoon in 2000, and then professionally voiced them too. dubbing just perfect. not only every word match, but the voices do make use of characters much more plausible. Many believe that the best way to watch anime with subtitles in English, but I just do not have the determination to do it. <br /> <br /> Not just a good voice, but the assessment is used for the series is quite impressive. I'm just saying, that left me scouring the net in vain to find the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The story of this series is something that will really engage the audience, and there is not hook you like a prime-time drama, like Lost, which was made only for the purpose of connection to you. explaining the story to deeply lead to many spoilers, because many of the characters do not even have a name until quite a few episodes in the series. A rough idea of ​​the series is that the land and its now independent space colonies having difficulty maintaining peace. Thus, the war began that resulted in military coups and difficult diplomatic situations. I feel that more details will distribute information that is crucial to the plot. <br /> <br /> I will end here that this series is perfect for those who love anime, anyone who thinks that all anime is stupid (they have good reason to think so), and all who He wants to go to an anime with a serious tone to it.
