A mom and others l Putain should be watched as a movie, which is associated with the time it was released (post-68) and the eternal in many ways. However, the actors do not "act" ... It is true that they talk a lot ... But what they are saying just what makes life worth living ... or die. Very long monologue says Françoise Lebrun, perhaps, the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about femininity, courage and love. It is easy to translate exactly, though. This film is a statement about the complexity of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors.
