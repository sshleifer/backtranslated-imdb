Phil Vance (William Powell) helps to solve several murders among the rich after the dog show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate too intricate secrets (like this), but I love this movie. It moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), beautifully directed by Michael Curtis (it uses tons of camera tricks that only accelerate the story together), has a very ingenious plot (including the decision to a locked room murder, was incredible) and has a very good shot . <br /> <br /> Powell respectable and big as Vance - Do not give it to act - he Vance! Mary Astor is not given much to do but it adds class and beauty of the production. Everything else is very good too, but the best thing is Eugene Pallette, as a Detective Heat. He is a very good actor with a very distinctive voice, and some of his lines were funny. <br /> <br /> Basically, the excellent 1930 Hollywood murder mystery. Well worth a look. <br /> <br />
