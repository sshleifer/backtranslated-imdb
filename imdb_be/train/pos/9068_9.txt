I thought the kids in the film were great. I deal with children in this age group, and I think that their behavior was very believable. I had problems with reference to the private parts, made 5-year-old. I do not think that comment was needed, and in fact slightly lowered my opinion of the film. <br /> <br /> I think that Luke Benvord up and coming stars. I would like to see more of it on the big screen. I enjoyed his reaction to the situation he found himself in. Often children in this age group do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all the actors doing it throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I also think that the message of hooliganism should be explored more in films with this age group. This is a serious problem in schools today. <br /> <br /> The ending was quite unexpected. Thoughts on Billy if he won or not won the bet was very strange. The way he handled the situation was beautiful. Too often today, children are not ready to compromise. Actors in the film showed that the compromise is an important part of life.
