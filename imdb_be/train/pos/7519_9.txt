Notorious Bettie PAGE (2006), *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lili Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol shines like legendary enjoy queen Betty Page biopic in comfort. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol, probably best known for being tauted, like The Next-It-Girl a few years ago, when nobody knew who she was, despite the infamous title of Vanity Fair among other dubbings media, but despite several major roles roles here and there she predicted the stars seemed to twinkle as brightly still. Here, as in the famous pin-up queen Betty Page, Gretchen Mol, really bright star on the rise. <br /> <br /> Betty Page was Tennessee born and raised as a God-fearing family oriented right girl, who seemed to find itself unreasonable object of desire and affection, as she got older. The gang-rape that flashbacked wise not graphically or thin running your own father, who has a low toxicity for worthy projects for his family, it is important to understand how Page managed to avoid the possibility of nightmarish life for a career as an actress, leading to New York City in the 1950s, when in fact it was the time and the place to be to catch lighting in a bottle. Page that do not realize that in fact it would be just that when she arrived. <br /> <br /> The beautiful black-haired favorite with a charming figure, Page spotted on Coney Island one summer day a black police officer with a request to take her picture, which leads to her posing in the basement of his home and eventually to the studio Irving Klaw (Bauer ) and his sister Paula (Taylor), who meet their vulgar, but are considered pornographic footage with a unique clientele :. fetish types <br /> <br /> While Page is quite naive it is certainly smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees, in the sense that it is under control - or at least someone lives that offered her as a work that is not improper, and she enjoyed it more and more less clothed portraits - until then, Congressional Country witch hunt is not looking for some scapegoats to make pornographic images crime. <br /> <br /> A talented director Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner, her partner screen writing ( "American Psycho" and «I Shot Andy Warhol») Management biopic entanglement pretty neat, and perhaps a bit hasty clone who was really Bettie Page although they were portrayed in the era of justice uptightness at its zenith. Many thanks to the gifted cinematographer Mott Höpfel for him sluggish stunning black and white images, and sprinkle with colored segments, reminiscent of Douglas Sirk era films for their melodramatic kindlings. Part of the contract and the feminists of the American dream fulfilled history sniffing along nicely with the excellent performances of its ensemble, including comic Bauer and Taylor, as brothers and sisters in the brain and Harris, having a field day as a fellow fotog tasteful wine and chatter. Strathairn's fun to see in a bit of stunt casting as a senator in the company for the truth after reflecting news bulldog Edward R. Murrow in his last outing, "Good night and good luck" as an opposite role of the table. <, Br /> <br /> but hats off to a truly outstanding talent as an uninhibited Mol still deeply morale and most importantly intelligent Bettie Page, which allows her childish innocence beam through its bold nudity and is now considered to-tame-and- quaint- borderline- vulgar poses that caught men's imagination for decades and are still favorites for human sexuality in this country and perhaps in the whole world. Mol perfect and ominously resembles the object of her portrait down to her knowing, teasing smile. Real Bettie Page, reportedly, is not associated with the project, but apparently gave her a blessing and continues to live more isolated lives, which was mentioned in the last minute to finding Jesus and absenteeism of its "notorious" image once and for all. It is a pity, because the film covers the surprisingly resounding decency into his theme that radiates for all to see in its naked glory.
