This film plays very well with the audience. Especially when the chase begins. In addition, Trevor Howard, with its sensual, intellectual charms and Gene Simmons of her innocent behavior and piercing eyes terrible together. <br /> <br /> The film begins as a psychological drama, but after the murder, he flows in the pursuit thriller two wires to go to the border. Some may think that the pursuit too, but in fact the pursuit is very important as it helps in clearing the mind of the character of Jean Simmons, getting her out of the oppressive household, and also helps identify the real killer - who suddenly put in such a position that they should finish work. Killer rightly believed that after the character Simmons was arrested, she will be clean. And it is true that her lack of control in the household - and also evidence to indicate the way - there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charges. The chase that follows helps to reveal the truth. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film. Look for it when you can find it.
