This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first few years as monarch of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> Â«The Young Victoria" has an amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated in impeccable detail. Extravagant costumes, luxurious space and landscaped gardens all make "The Young Victoria" is very impressive. I was most impressed by thoughtful cinema. As each person is in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, each scene is well composed. A scene that strikes me the most when Victoria says Melbourne. Melbourne has been located in the center of the door frame from Victoria angle, while the angle of Melbourne, Victoria was located between the space where Melbourne was holding his hand on his hip. <br /> <br /> History wise, it is too compressed to adhere to human-friendly and without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events have rushed through or even explained. I was expecting a grand scene of the coronation, and frustratingly it only lasted a few seconds. <br /> <br /> In general, "The Young Victoria," a good movie, and it would be even better if it was more, so that events can be properly explained without haste.
