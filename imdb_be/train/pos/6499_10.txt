After all these years I still think this is the best example of a series of World War II, production of the documentary. Interviews with a large number of participants from all countries to set it apart from any other project. It would be nice to see modern documentary (Ken Burns?) Take on this topic and try to collect information from veterans before they are all gone. With modern technology to improve the old archival footage and a lot of information, which was found in 1974, when he was promoted The World At War, an updated version of this series will be welcomed. History Channel has made some great shows on many aspects of the Second World War, but the expansive series such as World At War has not been successful with the original sample. If you are interested in this era do not miss this series. view is required.
