The film never pretend to be something spectacular, like many movies do. Film props like a fun and exciting time. And that's exactly what it was. It is a Korean version of men Bring. <br /> <br /> From the get-go, you can feel in the rest of the film, and how it will end, but pleasure is not unexpected nor enveloped him as the film is a carbon copy of the other. Instead, enjoy the journey carried out as 2 other "bandits" came to people in their own right. Thus, the film is fun and interesting. <br /> <br /> The camera work, special trolley moves were very well executed. The scenario being a bit weak, too pleasant is that the characters were not 2-dimensional, but they were full of life and desire. This film will not win an Oscar, nor any sale of DVD blockbuster, but fun to watch and fun experience.
