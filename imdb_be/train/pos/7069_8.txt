It was said that Durbin invented teenagery. This is the first film was one of the best. Humorous story introduced a beautiful 14-year-old Diana, little beauty with a beautiful voice, as "Miss Fixit» family split divorce. For a description of the plot, to see the other entries IMDb, but quickly Diana and her two older sisters are planning to go to America from Switzerland in order to prevent their parents remarry. With a great supporting cast and especially the reading Barbara Nan Gray, sisters, good direction and editing, the film is a success in an exciting one, even on subsequent viewings. With Diana in three songs, only «Il Bacio» from the classical repertoire, but when she sings in the police station scene, place the film in history is guaranteed. At least for this viewer, who was killed as a life with Deanna and classical music at the age of 15 years. One of the many nice touches that occur within three SMART GIRLS is a short glimpse drunk craning his neck for a final glimpse of Deanna, as police push him on! One unfortunate result of the success of this film is that these authors for Durbin cars were imprisoned in the theme of "Miss FIXIT», which quickly became stale. Diana herself had never done. Its growth as an actress more questionable than its charisma, it is, of course, it was not. I think that, like many other films face, it is substituted with "naturalness" for theatrical abilities, that it is not enough. The trick worked well for 21 feature films.
