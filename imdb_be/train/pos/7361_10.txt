This film is generally classified as the worst film ever production. Ever. But, in my opinion, this is probably the funniest. Terrible direction and the script makes this film priceless. I bought this film while sifting through DVD deal in my local store a pound. I and some members of the then watched it, however, until the rather drunk. Soon it happened that it was not a normal movie. Instead priceless heirloom that is likely to be the last film of James Cahill. At first we were confused and cried for the DVD-player will be turned off, but fortunately, in our abnormal nobody could be bothered. Instead, we watched the film through. In the end, we soon realized that we had found any spoiled in a dream, that you may want to laugh for a few hours, while laughing all the wrong reasons. In the near future we showed all our other friends, and they also agreed that it is not the work of a bottomless film. It was a movie that you can really wet myself laughing. It was a movie that everyone can enjoy. It was a genius.
