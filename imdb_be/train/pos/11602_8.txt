Now I had the pleasure of first viewing Contaminated People, if on television in December 2000, its premiere <br /> <br /> One expert on infectious diseases (William Hurt) loses his family when unknown disease enters his house and kill them, now a few years later, he is now in Russia or anywhere else. I do not know where it is, all I know, this is somewhere in this area. Anyway, due to budget cuts in the laboratory of infectious diseases, they are forced to lay off most of its employees. One of them, a disgruntled guard named Joseph Muller (played Peter Weller, best known for his role as a steadfast Robocop) goes out there and requires that they gave him a job back. He needs this job because he is divorced, he has to pay child support. Thus, it goes back to the fight, and some things, stumble, dangerous things. It was soon discovered that Mueller had been infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact it is so deadly a single drop of his blood would kill a man in seconds. Soon word gets out and the expert's disease (Hurt) is called to investigate and later he teamed up with an American reporter. Now Mueller decided to get home to see his wife and son, and will stop at nothing, even when he has to infect the entire population of Russia. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said, this film is a lot like Falling Down, We have a broken man (Weller here Michael Douglas in Falling Down), who will stop at nothing to achieve the goal there, even if they have to kill some people in this process. Next, we have the type of man a hero (Hurt here, Robert Duvall at Falling Down), which is both cute and decided to stop antagonist. <br /> <br /> Dirty People is actually a very good movie with a good story line and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
