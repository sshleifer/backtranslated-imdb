I can not say that the British comedy since World War II, made at Ealing Studios, is an acquired taste or not, but I totally admire and people in a white suit is one of the best. No need to go to a well-known story about the threat posed to both the textile industry and textile unions on the indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by naively idealistic Sidney Stratton in achieving its vision of a polymer to make a comedic delight. Many well-known personalities from the world of British character actors - nervous Cecil Parker, Michael Gough politely treacherous and ruthless right Ernest Thesinger - put in fine performances. Guinness - as always and forever - it's great, and Joan Greenwood is a beautiful, Daphne (exactly as she says the word "dad" does the whole movie worth seeing) <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !! !. !!!! "
