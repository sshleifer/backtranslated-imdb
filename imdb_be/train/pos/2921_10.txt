One and only was a great film. I just finished watching it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought it was good to reflect that life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made for 4 years before I was born, but I do not think that the severity of professional wrestling tour changed all that much. Sad, funny, and all around GREAT !!! **** 10+
