I really liked this movie. I have read several other comments, and even though I feel sorry for those who do not understand, I do not agree with some of the criticisms. Which, in a strange way, it makes me like this film more. I understand that they have a fairly intelligent throwing remake the film to the public, but it has so many levels and is still great to see. I also love movies like this that provoke so much debate, the theories, the possible endings and hidden subtext. Congratulations Mr.Crowe, definitely in my Top Ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. Saw it when it first came out while I was backpacking in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to go back to my hotel and I had a great trip paranoia! Where the end of the dream and the real start?
