Very clever humor Excellent performing I can not believe how people could think that deserves a 1/10! I hope that this film will be shown all over the world, so that everyone can enjoy If you ever have the opportunity to watch it ... do not miss it There is a part where the main operating entity management and singing "Happy Birthday" and "el payaso plinplinÂ» (Argentine song for children (I think ... it can also be South America, I'm not sure)). These are the two songs that have the same melody ... but people usually do not realize that ... it's just a rub! I tried to write it in Spanish and English, because it is an Argentine film ... but the page will not let me :( I hope you enjoy!
