One said, with regard to Nathaniel Hawthorne, his failures were more interesting than his successes. I believe that the same observation can meet to pictures McDonald screws. And especially this one. <br /> <br /> This, apparently, has many characteristics of a failed film: it's kitsch, the script because of censorship, it sounds inconsistently ?? However, this movie also gets a few good points: good music Rodgers-Hart ( "I married an angel", "Tira tira tira la"), a well-operating with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you do not like it, you can not forget. This amazing film actually leaves a very strong, fantastic, impression, and you are likely to have in mind for a few days, maybe in a few weeks. Why? In the thirties and early forties, films do not have the same average than today: it is directed, like a dream, to distract the public in order to make it hard to forget the reality. Of all the films dreams that have been made, at the time, this one should be particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> In short, let's say that the best way to appreciate this film to watch it, without wondering whether it is good or bad. To see how you could watch a dream.
