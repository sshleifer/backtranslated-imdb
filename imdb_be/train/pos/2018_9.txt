I loved it so much that I bought the DVD and novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including small Arthur) is amazing and exciting. <br /> <br /> It could use a little more screen time for yummy Frederick Lawrence (played by Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham was surprisingly "it" from the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Those who are most excited me through a strange shock and awe and wonder Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntington. I love him in The Forsyte Saga, and everything else I've seen him. But he surpasses himself here as Arthur. In my wildest dreams I could not imagine how he played a crazy lunatic, such as Arthur Huntington. But it does. And I love it. And I love it.
