This film is quite funny. Not only is the story brutal, but the acting is terrible. Special effects donkey and the entire film is in post-apocalyptic desert. However, this is definitely the funniest movie ever given permission to be produced. It's 101 minutes of laughter due to the fact that we all know that there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino years. There are other aspects, which I will not spoil, because they are what makes the film so wonderfully stupid. I highly recommend this movie only because of its complete idiocy. I have no idea who would watch it expecting it to be a sign of high quality, but if a good laugh is what you need to look Exterminators in 3000!
