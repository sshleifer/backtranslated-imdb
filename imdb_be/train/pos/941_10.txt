I first saw this version of «A Christmas Carol», when he first appeared on television. I'm actually supposed to see the film when it was announced, and it more than lived up to my expectations. Now I bought the DVD and I plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's a Wonderful Life" I think this version of «A Christmas Carol" is one of the best Christmas movie ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and a great cast headed by Roger Rees surrounds it! Scott proves once again that he one of the best actors of our time. Scott has artistic talent and acting ability to play any role, and retain the character that is unique to itself. how someone can remember and Patton and Scrooge? Scott makes it easy. the direction is amazing with fine sets, costumes and music that give the film a special for utstso time, place and era painted. You just love this movie and put it among their favorites to watch during the holiday season.
