I think it's probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. Harling scenario is almost perfect, just check the "quote" section; On second thought, just rent a DVD, as this supply, that actually does sing line. <br /> <br /> Sally Field gives comic, over-the-top performance as you've never seen it anywhere else and Kevin Kline easy cheerful. Robert Downey Jr., tends to be shiny, and in a very small role in the besieged Naji riot suit. I've never been much a fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she immediately great as a * real * person surrounded by hordes of cartoon characters on the set of Â«The Sun also sets" - that rumbling you feel under you Hemingway rolling in his grave. Either that or he was laughing very hard. <br /> <br /> Five Star. Funny, funny, funny.
