It contains spoilers! <br /> <br /> I saw an ad for it on video.Then my sister found out that we had a book, so I read it.I was filming a video on the same day, when I finished the thought book.I it was very memorable as it was in the book. The cast was brilliant.Tara Fitzgerald was very rich, like Helen and Rupert Graves was hated as Arthur.The costumes, music and stunningly beautiful setting. <br /> <br /> NOTE! Don `T to read more, if you do not smotryut it <br /> <br /> On the other hand there are some sex scenes that were added in and some videos so violence.This estimated 15. There are some other things that have been thrown in.After first part, I felt that the accuracy went down. Despite the fact that the book is better than that, I'm glad I saw it and would recommend it for people who have read the book, is a supporter of Bronte or as a costume drama (I have all 3!) By the time you FastForward through sex scenes. The book is quite underated.Anne Brontes book Don `T, it seems that we read or well-known as Jane Er or Wuthering Heights, which made it to television and film several times. Another thing.When I read the book, I was amazed at how religion was Ther in it, but here they are laid off, that's all! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
