The first week of May every year brings back memories of the Holocaust, through movies on a TV. Among the many films that they showed, it was one I had not seen. <br /> <br /> The story of Hilter life and how he came to power. It begins with his childhood and ends it holds the upper extreme position of power in Germany. <br /> <br /> The film was previously presented in the television series, and then converted to a movie format. Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with big guts, conviction and highlights to give a real picture of this person. <br /> <br /> This is a good script and a story that educates viewers on the main events that led Hitler to power, and tries to show the probable psychological makeup Hitler. The film is a biased point of view Dyugey director ?? which shows Hitler as a single track, menacing, angry, shouting man ?? which had such a strong influence on the Germans and the people around him. Unknown Hitler as someone having charishma and attraction, and the film is not able to convince Hitler's image. <br /> <br /> Although the company has been on television, all the components of a first-class production and on par with any main stream films. The cost of production, sets, costumes, etc. They were perfect. <br /> <br /> There are many critics of this film, the authenticity of the historical events that are presented. Still, the film captures, each interesting and exciting. Robert Carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen as no one else does. He is remarkably well ?? brilliant! I would like a more balanced view of life of Hitler, because I think Hitler was able to detect the dormant feelings of millions of Germans, and it's not the only one who should be blamed for the Holocaust. As I have repeatedly said that ?? very sad - our society loves a garland or to pursue one person as a representative of the company of good or evil, respectively.
