What I remember most about this film is that it is used to air on local TV KTLA (see. 5) during each Christmas season during the mid to late 70s, mainly due to the fact that the real story took place on or near Christmas Eve, he was always a little disturbing to see hell, this girl is going through, being the only survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. Graphical scene of this young girl pulling the leech from her infected leg made an impression on the young audience. Not really kind of Christmas cheer, I used to see at the time. Definitely not the production of Rankin-Bass.
