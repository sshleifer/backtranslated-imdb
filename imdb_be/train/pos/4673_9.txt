One of the things that interested me most about this film as the characters and related stories are developed for the summer. I believe that the authors would like to get the interest of the characters, not forced to feed their character. A prerequisite for the use of arts and crafts design and construction of furniture is a unique theme and / or similar to that of the family / brothers and sisters to go in life. The complexity of having twins to serve as a surrogate father and even her husband added a lot of stress to make this movie an emotionally engaging. In addition, although the story is not one that the masses can be directly linked to (ie, Jewish / twin / family businesses) are fairly universal themes, like every family has a black sheep in it. This made it very attractive.
