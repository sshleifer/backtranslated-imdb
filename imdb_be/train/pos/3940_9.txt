This film was not only one of John Ford's personal favorites, as well as numbered directors Sergei Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his high-profile supporters. Oddly enough, I just caught it himself with the help of newly-Disc Set 2 test after not enough for a couple of original language screenings of Italian television many years ago, and again a few times on TV while in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> film marked Ford first nine collaboration with Henry Foundation, and is a typical example vernacular Americana vein Ford. Nicely done and quite figurative poetry, in the hall of the court order (and the possible opening) in its second half still pack quite a wallop, in addition to providing a tall character actor Donald Mick remembered her meaty role as a prosecutor. <br /> <br /> Fonda, of course, perfectly cast as a shy, inexperienced, but rigorous and humanistic lawyer, who was to become president; Fonda will continue to reflect the other fictitious policy on film - especially the best man Sheffner (1964) and Sidney Lumet FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and this is strange, now, to see what he wanted at the time of acceptance of the role of Lincoln, as, in his opinion, is "like playing God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Ford has previously solved Abraham Lincoln (tangential) in prisoner Shark Island (1936), a remarkable, but perhaps little known gem that has, fortunately, has just been released as a Special Edition DVD of the Criterion stand «Masters of Cinema» Eureka label in the UK. In addition, I have two more films Abraham Lincoln in my DVD collection, I still watch and, incidentally, were sent Griffith - Birth of a Nation (1915) and Abraham Lincoln (1930) - and I was not only got a bunch movies I've never seen before now, I'd love to give them back, based on my experience of watching a highly satisfied with the young MR. LINCOLN.
