I do not know why some people criticize this show so much <br /> <br /> It's great, fun show. - probably not the right material for the main prime time, but still ... <br /> <br /> dynamics of family fun, and all still you see in most sitcoms. Supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. Graphs of individual episodes and frequent Siegfried & Roy ridicule only slightly above average, but very often you have sub-sections or sharpness that make you roll on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> This show was well worth the Â£ 8 I paid for it <br /> <br /> rating :. 8/10
