I am embarrassed to say that I missed the "Mother", when it was in theaters. I saw him this evening on the DVD. I gave him 10 votes, one of the very few that I have given here. This English independent filmed with such great care and quality. He drew me relentlessly. History, low key and purely human, is honest and very absorbent, thanks to the current Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is stunning. The cost of hard-wired to the plot. Epic story, brilliantly dressed writer Kureisha in worldly life. This story solves a big problem with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. And some of these big issues are very controversial, that probably explains the lack of awards won, despite numerous nominations. It's just one of my favorite movies.
