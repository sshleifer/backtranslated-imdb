Cinderella beautiful film, with beautiful songs, of course. In fact, this is one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think that all of the characters are depicted strange. You can see in the cruelty to the dictates of Cinderella's stepsisters and her stepmother, Cinderella sweetness. Mouse funny and sweet too. <br /> <br /> I think they changed a little fairy tale, but I think it's for the better. This is such a good movie, and I do not think that anyone could resist him deep down. <br /> <br /> I give it a 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it sure is a real classic.
