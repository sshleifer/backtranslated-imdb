I'm not a very good writer, so I'll keep this short. World at War is the best World War II documentary that I saw. I've seen various WWII documentaries (and not only in English / North American) and this documentary seems to be the most complete WWII documentary that I saw. I think it can speak a little more about the Great Depression, and why / how Hitler came to power, but it does a very good job in covering the war. It would seem that a complete and objective / fair for all. He does not exaggerate or reduce the role of the different nations. He has a lot of original footage, including color imaging and many eye witnesses (this was done in the '70s, when more were alive). It has great music and a narrator. All-in-all, I gave it a 10/10, because it is very good. (I did not see the events in DVD-version, so I can not comment on those)
