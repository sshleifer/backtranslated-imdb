This film could have been one of the most underrated film of Bollywood history.This one thousand nine hundred ninety-four blockbuster had all these good performances, music and direction.I remember, I was in Allahabad, when the film was launched, and it was somewhere in March Holyah time people were playing the song "Amma UNO" on your speakers at high volume. If someone likes to watch Some Like It Hot and Drools over Marilyn Monroe, he must see it to movie.Thumbs Govinda.How many of you know that this film was shot in South India and after Sholay can be one of very few blockbuter Silver screen.With hit films such as those of the Indian comedy could never be dead.
