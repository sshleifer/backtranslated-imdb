I can only repeat the praise of the other reviews here. It's a beautiful film with FEELGOOD factor that reaches, without crossing the line into sentimental sentimentality. . Naturally sweet - without added sugar <br /> <br /> One small point: it seems to me that the weak objection Ustinova Pendelton nature of being able to go and defeat the security system to ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / Savant in like that. Yes, the film was pretty computer illiterate, but it was a show Pendelton "studying computers" in his apartment, and I believe that the conclusion had to be that his gifts enabled him to just swallow the whole subject, virtually overnight. <br /> <br /> had a few strange moments when he appeared in some scenes, Gnatpole tried to check knowledge Pendelton and call his bluff. I'm not sure that we would have to believe that Pendelton cleverly weaselled its output of these situations, or whether he was really knowledgeable enough to pass the test. - it was a little unclear <br /> <br /> Of course, he had to know enough to create fictitious accounts. Presumably Wall Ustinov and relied on their own very vague idea of ​​how computers worked in those days, and in order to understand in detail what they were getting into, you need to know exactly what their concept. They knew that there was something about the "procedures", which is essential; they thought that the "smart light" can really control security, not simply indicate his status; they considered that the characteristics of the (dumb) terminal users will greatly affect what could have been done on the mainframe. - although, except for things like graphics features I do not see it meself <br /> <br /> In general, I think that they tried to avoid the subject of the actual computer operations, as far as they could, and they did it pretty well. Allowing them a bit of artistic license, I do not think that their efforts were some shortcomings worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> CD
