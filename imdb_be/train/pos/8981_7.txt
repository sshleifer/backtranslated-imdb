Dig! I would like to say to everyone, even if you do not like Metallica, to see "a monster" is a type of spinal tap documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world that act as mental children during the kind of disintegration. It is fun and exciting. In the same direction goes digging! The film is about "Dandy Warhol» and «The Brian Jonestown Massacre» Portland two groups, beginning a kind of music scene in there hometown only for one of the groups to be huge and one to fall by the wayside in the music history books. From the outset, these two groups are pulling in opposite directions, only on their ability to make decisions good or bad. Filmed over seven years, and sometimes painful to watch, we see the rapid growth of the dandy to fame (thanks to the fact that the Vodafone ad!) And Johnstown seed fall of the instigators of the scene in the disputes of imitators. Since the bands become more incoherent friendship stretched tight and the voltage at several points in the case binding even at the stage of combat. All of this half-funny, half tragic and believe it or not perversely watch able. As I said at the beginning, you can watch a movie Metallica, even if you have no interest in the group. Dig! On the other hand, it is a little different and more enjoyable and much easier to look at, if you have a passing interest in any group. Nevertheless, a good movie and more a testament to not be in the group than reassuring that in a career. Dig! It is a crazy ride on the rocks and the coat tails of the roll and an excellent example of the pitfalls of being and satisfaction, or want to be famous.
