This is a very difficult film to watch, in particular, as it is aimed at the inner core of our lives. But ultimately, it is very beautiful and deeply moving film. Anyone who thinks cynical, I must say that they have largely missed the point of the whole message of the film. For those who actually watch the film, they will see that the way issues are absolutely essential, and the result is ultimately uplifting. Of course, it is very difficult to observe, and even a heavy object hard. However, it is extremely important for society and everyone. It shows a peak that makes the world of cinema at the moment (I will not limit the term to the whole of France), and everyone should try to see it. I will say that it is better to go in with a clear head, without being influenced by conflicting views, and just let the film work for you.
