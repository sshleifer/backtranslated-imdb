It is an independent, B & W, DV function constantly shocking surprises and amuses with his ability to create the most insane situation, and then find the humor and interest in them. It's all fun and funny things, but just as absurd as a large part of the film should be, is the heart and reality here, holding a film reasonable, holds the entire piece from drifting into complete madness and this is the real message here. This film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad. This seems to be the heart of the film. After all, like crazy and off the wall as things get, Leon, '30. old newspaperman hero, always striving to keep it together. He's like a child forever trying to catch a balloon floating away so that all will be for the better, so that everyone can have what they want. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie could have gone far over the top, but really exceptional cast of holding a piece of cohesion. Van Meter, perhaps the best of the bunch here with the idea that shines through the ridiculous patients tics. Just like the characters in the film do, we do not notice her sudden gusts to see the real person underneath. <br /> <br /> Vladimir Mayakovsky true genius here. He makes maximum ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real. This is his script and his cast, which helps keep it all afloat. It is a real evidence of skill and Mayakovsky all participants that this film, with its grating of the plot and the characters, never worked nerves. Vladimir Mayakovsky took a film that could be abrasive and disgusting, and somehow gave his heart and humor. This unique film. Not to be missed. <br /> <br />
