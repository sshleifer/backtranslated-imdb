This film can not put the Catholic Church in the best light, but he was telling a story based on real events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, everything is fine and rosy. Sometimes people and groups are doing that at the time, it seems as right, but in retrospect do not look as great as they once did. «A Love Divided» tells the story of a family, but it does not include religion, but in fact the story of the family, as well as the ability of the family to stay together, no matter what is thrown at them. This film is also based on a true story, not to tell this story, scene by scene, it's true, but if you were to look at news articles from that period of time you could see that neither the church handled the incident path that was useful for the family. Both churches are to blame here, the Catholic Church to force such regulations on families in the first place, rather than reacting to the violence that comes with it and the Protestant church to say her mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest instead put up a fight. In this case, and let this family down. I believe that the film does a good job of showing how this struggle in the church and the family. This is in no way shape or form without delay the Catholic Church, on the contrary, it shows how one incident can change the course of thought, religion, and how one person can have the effect of achieving much more then just myself.
