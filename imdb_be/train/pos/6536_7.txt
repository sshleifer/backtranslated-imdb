Let's face it; Nancy Drew has never been a large literature. It is in the same category as babysitting club, Magic Tree House, ants, ABC Tyne. In fact, it was one of the original formulas of the stories. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, thoughtful, "good" does not have any internal conflicts ever! and it never changes. Ned almost the same. The film was faithful to this style, and I must say that I liked it. He will never be a great film, but it had the same nostalgic flavor of the books took place. It was just the right amount of suspense for my kids (8 and 10), there was almost no offensive language. I liked the push for a more conservative clothes. <br /> <br /> Corky was a little irritation. It was a bit from place to secondary schools in the town. I never got why he was there in the first place.
