Oh, it's so great to watch Silent Classic once in a while! Director Vidor just fine and even make a long (at least 1928), occasionally, as he himself. The history of success in life and how it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves his friends in a small studio comedy, to be part of a larger "drama" studios. It becomes a big star and the effects it actually separates from the real world. For a moment she even denies it (bad) the past! In a funny cameo, of course, the scene where the main character (Marion Davies) ... see Marion Davis in the studio, and concludes that it does not seem that much ... It must be one of the first movie-in-movie in here and for real freaks it is strange to see the camera and materials from back then. A must see, if you ask me !!
