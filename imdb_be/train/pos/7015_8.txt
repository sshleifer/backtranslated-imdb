Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who is practically giving away the store to everyone's surprise. IRS agent who is? <br /> <br /> Most of us have all heard the line by the IRS agent, "Hello, I'm with the IRS. . I am here to help "our smile then spreads into a laugh that says," Yes, yes. " <br /> <br /> As you further and further into the story, you can not understand this guy. He is simply one of those checked. Which is his motive? Whether it is from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do good? It helps so much, we want him to be our auditor should obtain the audit we have, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (Just kidding, just kidding) <br /> <br /> The pace of the film perfect and so much so that the keys have been ignored, that would tell me what was really going on. Intense, intense again, the focus was on Ben and stays there. The entire film is only because of Ben, as we try to understand it, and I do not see any clues (which keys you're talking about, Willis?). Do not read the box before watching a DVD movie was the best way to go here. By the end of the movie I was finally all together. Well, it was obvious at the time. And, yes, it is over the top, but it's still a great story, mainly because Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith was nominated for Best Actor. Other actors were very good as well. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is over the top and, in spite of the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you need to understand that the message of the film is not so. What message? Believe me, you will not need too many clues to figure it out. I did not. <br /> <br /> Violence: None Gender: Yeah, but do not get carried away. Bland. Nudity: None Language: No.
