Passing stones is definitely one of the best comedy independent film ever. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy it. This movie is for some reason did not receive the credit period. First, let's start with the storyline all love a good treasure hunt. If the dead father leaves behind a letter advising it is priceless, not only brings the two families together, but the Hurricane begins the adventure. Mix in the Polish translator, comatose mother, a crack head with turrets syndrome, twisted homosexual hypnotist, and a transvestite, money not only make the world revolves, but can turn into a family enemy. My favorite character in this film is to be a sister / crack addict with the syndrome turrets, her sudden burst of output will have you crying and simulating in a few weeks.
