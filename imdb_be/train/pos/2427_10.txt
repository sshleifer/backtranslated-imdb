It really is a great unknown movie.Perfect dialogue without the typical clich√©s.This film relied on the actor's talent and was pulled off.It even had a bit of comedy in it, but it is something that was not a crime drama overdone.Once in life should be instead of the typical special effect garbage thrown on the floor in.I especially I liked interracial aspects of it all. <br /> <br /> currently on the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was very rich in game career, Petty criminal.It shame that it is only allowed to show his talent in his own film. Welliver was incredible, like a useless half-brother in Fishburn. Eamonn Walker adds flavor to the already excellent cut of the film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a technician / drug lord.I loved acting since "King of New York." But the best acting in this film come Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were paired perfectly, like two improvised Calderon. <br /> <br /> Once in a life, it really is at the gate. **** 1/2 * to *****.
