A solid B movie. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. His understated delivery is refreshing at the time of the upper lip. I liked the relationship between father and son. the dynamics of the family liked. Wendigo looks ridiculous, but it's an idea toddler toys and dead deer. This association, like, see? It is a psychological history, and Freddy is not a slash to the instant gratification Flick. Watch it and reflect on your inner child and the fact that the film may have to tell you, and you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> A good job.
