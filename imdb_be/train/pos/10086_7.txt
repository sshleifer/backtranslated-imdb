That's a lot of nonsense about the woman from London who marries a tea planter from Ceylon, whom she barely knows. He is full of cliches and character of Liz Taylor is entirely believable. It has a great set some exotic location shooting. It shows Taylor at the height of her beauty. She looks amazing.
