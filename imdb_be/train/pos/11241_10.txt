I purchased it, one of my favorite movies on DVD in recent years and, as usual, while watching, it all just blew me away. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears, especially «Will You» track. This is pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. second best Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels) This bet. <br /> <br /> great soundtrack and beautiful view in Thatcherite Britain, the dismal 80s, where I grew up. The ending is so sad for a few hours after the end of the movie I, sobbed like a child. <br /> <br /> I expect to wear this DVD from repeated viewing, I can watch it over and over again and never get bored, just for the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry to hear about your dad darling. God bless you all. xx
