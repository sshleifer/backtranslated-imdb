I really must say that this has always been my favorite, when I went to see my grandmother. And it still. This is a very, very close to the book. As it is removed, and the players were all just perfect! I have to recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. Almost all I say I hate television films, but it was really great! I gave it a 10/10.
