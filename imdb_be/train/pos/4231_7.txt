When returning from a shopping trip on Christmas Eve, an abused suburban housewife (Basinger) finds himself in the fight for survival after a disagreement with a group of delinquent teens takes hard. <br /> <br /> Suffering humiliation directly to a DVD-release here in the UK, the directorial debut of Susan Montford will probably not be given the recognition it deserves. It's a shame, as the standard in writing, directing and acting very good in fact, and certainly superior to the quality of your average DVD movie directly. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger gives her best performance while the murdered wife abusive husband (Craig Sheffer). Although Schaffer really gave entirely to do anything more than to be a threatening presence in these short scenes together, which connects Basinger - showing vulnerability to even hinting at the rage that ultimately boil in its confrontation with the youth. It's really cool, low productivity, its transformation from victim to aggressor easy to play. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas Initially, I thought that was miscast, he (along with three other youths) just does not seem a lot of threat. However, if all four boys were physically more convincing later scenes in which Basinger turns the tables against them would not work at all. The fact that these four middle men, though a little upset, is the key why the film works as well as it does. <br /> <br /> In addition to several questions, the former in the latter half of the film and pairs cheese line here and there, we have here a great thriller that actually leaves the audience with something to think about when the movie ended. Some of them may be delayed slow - burn character of the opening scenes, or the sharp end. Other times by cruel violence. I say give him a chance, it is certainly more worthy of your time than Saw V.
