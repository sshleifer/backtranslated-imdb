I can not describe how amazing this movie. Suffice it to say, any time I'm depressed about how unfair or useless things, it seems, it's a movie, I go out, to put me in the right mood. Background music makes you aware of the existence of the ease and simplicity provides a great happiness. Indian girl who sings only one example of a character in the movie that does not try hard, and be happy as a result. Persifina, underwear colleague Ruby (Ashley Judd) is still = -her eyes and a smile can make a day of the heaviest person. I watch this movie, and I dream of better days or a good conversation with friends, and I understand that being alone - Ruby alone quite often - is not it the same as being lonely. Recommended for those who love the calm thoughtful movie.
