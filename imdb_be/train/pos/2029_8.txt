As a horse lover, only the film can be estimated. There are some movies that show how the art of riding one makes. I would like to know when Brian makes his ride in the film. I would also like to know if he loves horses. Brian was in a lot of movies where he rode. Where he learned to ride? The only part that's hard for me to accept the fact that the scene is always riding full tilt, as a horse can run forever on all cylinders. The camera-work is first rate and captures the horse in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of the horse. It would be very interesting to see how they have been casting the film to find all a very good rider.
