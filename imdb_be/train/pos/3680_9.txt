Paris, je t'aime (2006), the film is made up of 18 segments. You can do the math - 18 segments in 120 minutes means that each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story. The film is based on the fact that you can, of course, to tell a story in that short period of time. The premise of the work. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Each represents a different aspect of the Parisian experience, and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances with a cast of big and almost great actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful images in this film, it's difficult to choose one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable for me was Juliette Binoche as a grieving mother in the segment of "Plaza de Victoire," Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty «Quartier Latin» Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in a segment of "Loin du 16ème» and Margo Martindale as the postman Colorado who has learned to speak French, so that she can visit Paris ( «14ème Arrondissement» segment). <br /> <br /> Special mention should be given to Gulliver Hecq, probably a sneaky little boy ever molesting an American tourist in Paris metro stations (segment "Tuileries"). <br /> <br /> This is an outstanding film. My wife and I decided to rent it for a few months, so that we can catch some of the finer points, we certainly missed. However, Paris is photographed so beautifully, I would suggest that you try to see it on the big screen. In any case, do not miss!
