Cult Classics is almost impossible to predict. Who could have imagined that Vision Quest, Fight Club, and 2001: A Space Oddysey, movies that were panned by critics and audiences, so after their release, will become very popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a movie expert. Unlike most of those who hated Envy (indicates gloomy 4.4 rating), I found the Envy to be one of the funniest films of the last decade. <br /> <br /> The film is funny. Dialogue is not smart, scenes have little continuity, and the script, it seems like it was written by a fourth grader. But this is exactly why the film is so hilarious. You see, in order to evaluate the random genius of the Envy, you have to enjoy the movie with ironic, detached point of view. <br /> <br /> Why I love Envy? Because the movie bad for what he becomes good. This is a recipe for a cult and Envy definitely fits the bill.
