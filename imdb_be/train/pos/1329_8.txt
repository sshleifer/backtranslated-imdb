I grew up in Brazil, and I used to visit and enjoy the beautiful coastline, where the movie was filmed. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Green Coast" of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film brings back to life the world of the 16th century in Brazil, where Europeans just beginning to explore the coastline, which until now was in perfect condition and sparsely populated by various indigenous tribes. French and Portuguese fought each other for territory, and for the upper hand in the timber trade, Brazil, is constantly engaged in negotiations with the local people, who also fought with each other for any reason. <br /> <br /> One of the French mismatch ( "A mercenary") is to die his own countrymen, but he manages to escape and kept in captivity all-naked native tribe. While it is a "slave" chief, according to the customs of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for a few months, until the time is not appropriate for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge. <, Br /> <br /> what I love about this film is that it recreates in loving detail village natives and their way of operation (they were naked and were cannibals) and asks us to recognize and accept life in those days, as it was, in a beautiful garden of Idno life was messy, violent, full of miserable prejudices and strange customs. Europeans come and bring their own problems, including increased violence with the best weapons and greed. There's no romanticized "noble savage" or "heroic explorers" here, it's just people who are trying to survive in a cruel world. <br /> <br /> The film is neither too sympathetic nor disgust the natives. From what I know about the subject, the image is quite precise, which adds a unique atmosphere of the project: how many films you have seen on the life of the Brazilian natives and their early dealings with the Europeans?
