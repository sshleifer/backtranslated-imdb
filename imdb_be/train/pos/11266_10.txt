I looked at it recently, but when it started, I had no idea that the concept was about that topic ..... in short - I had no idea what it was. Whether it was a documentary, it was a comedy routine ..... Well, it was both of them. <br /> <br /> He started a little slow, but I think it's because I had absolutely no idea what kind of program I was watching. But it is rapidly absorbed me. The episode I saw was Robert Uul discuss fact and fiction in history. Basically, we (Americans) to learn about the history, which is not really true - and we got to see what we have done. He did it in such a way as to keep the audience fully entertained and interested. I actually learned a few things, and that is the true measure of how effective this type of program can be. <br /> <br /> I would like to see it picked up as a series for HBO. I believe that it can be just as fun and effective with different themes - especially if they are "taught" in the same type of way as this episode.
