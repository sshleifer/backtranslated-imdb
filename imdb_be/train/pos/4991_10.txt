It's a shame that this film is so hard to get your hands in the United States. I found him through a rare video dealer, and it is definitely worth it. This is without a doubt the best film made during the pre-Code era, and the best film of 1930. Workshops directed by Frank Borzage made wonderful films about depression, and with MAN'S CASTLE, he created a fairy tale in the midst of adversity era. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have excellent chemistry between them, and they help to make this film a wonderful novel. Young Trino sweet and hope, while Bill Tracy is rude and closed off. The dynamic between the nature creates one of the most difficult, but ultimately rewarding relationships on film. <br /> <br /> MAN CASTLE is a pre-code film most soft focus I saw. Borzage uses vague and dreamy technique to transform squatter village where Bill and Trina live in the palace. The hardships of the depression is never ignored, in fact they are an integral part of the film. But as Borzage crafts film as a soft focus of a fairy tale, love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh. This makes the film a warm and affectionate. <br /> <br /> MAN CASTLE is the crown of the previous era code. If only more people could see it.
