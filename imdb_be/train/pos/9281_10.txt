I do not know how and where to make Iranian filmmakers get their inspiration in coming up with the story as it is. In fact, this is a very simple story that many directors might come up --- but may not be able to project it on film, like Panahi made. <br /> <br /> The film is like a 2 worlds, rotating at the same time, one is connected to the other - a football match, and the struggle between men and women, what happens behind the walls of the stadium <br /> <br /> This It makes you feel like you're in a movie, and you. " re one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you would like to have an idea of ​​a football match. You will feel the same way, the excitement and the sense of how those women actors in the film. This is an exciting way that you would like to see the end, you want to know the verdict, you'll be dying to see what will happen with the girls. <br /> <br /> I like intermittent conversation between the girl smoking and one of the military trainee. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference in thinking between men and women and the struggle of women to gain equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is the second film Jafar Panahi, what I saw (the first Crimson Gold), and I'm looking forward to playing again. <br /> <br /> Am already hooked with the Iranian films and this one is a must see!
