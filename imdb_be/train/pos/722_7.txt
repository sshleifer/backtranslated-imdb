One of the biggest cult classic b- and c-movie producer Roger Corman was the Ramones car (originally intended for Cheap Trick), Rock N »Roll High School. It's just a simple, technically dated history (but will serve an extra dose of nostalgia humor, considering it was the kind of things that made Napoleon Dynamite characters funny - see van Eaglebauer in). About the kids who love rock 'n' roll <br /> <br /> Students Vince Lombardi High School met the resistance of evil principal, Miss Evelyn Togar (played by cult favorite, Mary Voronov), who fears that Roll Rock N »the child turns in uncontrolled, freak unethical and vows to make roll zone free of rock-N ». In fact, she intends to destroy Roll Rock N »for all students, regardless of whether it in school, and she has cooperation most adults, that could make the plan successful. <br /> <br /> But not if Riff Randell (PJ Soles) can help him. Ramones fanatic, she wrote several songs (including Rock N »Roll High School), she wants to give the Ramones, and in an attempt to make it as rejected Miss Togar, who does everything she can to keep her from going to see Ramones played in the city. It culminates in the final result riot deprecated amusing hating between adults and adolescents (in the end, over the edge resembling somewhat). After years of punk, when the glory of garage rockers, The Ramones (and others) will mark another shift in the evolution of music, it was great to see a film that celebrates the fun of it all and in a humorous, exaggerated. <br /> <br /> mostly mild comedy, but a great feeling, good comedy, however, if you are in the mood for something more laid back, to keep you entertained. With Jerry Zucker (airlines fame) and Joe Dante (Gremlins fame) as taking part in some of the direction, you can get an idea of ​​what kind of humor you for (not to mention, we expect to see Dick Miller, even if only for a few in the final minutes of the film). History must have inspired the later (and, thus, has been updated) in the comedy mid 90s, Detroit Rock City, which some minor changes in the character of the car for the older glam-rockers, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I would recommend passing on the car Corey Feldman, Rock N »Roll High School Forever, released nearly a decade later. The original is still the best.
