Tiempo de Valientes fit snugly into one thriller genre, but goes beyond its roots, thanks to the excellent cast, a huge rapport between his findings and outstanding photos. Diego Peretti star as Dr. Silverstein, shrink designed to ride shotgun with a detective Diaz (Luis Luke), who was appointed to investigate the murder of two minor hoods, which appear to have been involved in arms smuggling conspiracy in the morning. Diaz has been discharged from work, but he is the best person for the job and must have a professional mental health services to be restored. Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves entangled in a conspiracy with the participation of Argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at the crucial moment, allowing Silverstein develop some impressive tracking skills of their own. Peretti and Luke perfectly together and remind me of Terence screen team Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti not classically beautiful, like Hill. It is noteworthy that even in almost two hours in length Tiempo de Valientes Sun wears his admission, and in fact written and directed Shifron creates a potential sequel to the movie magic code. In general, a great and very interesting action comedy nor panders to naimaleyshemu common denominator and does not insult your intelligence.
