This film is as it should be a classic. It is not perfect, of course. Walk, while ideal for scenes in a movie is slow as a turtle with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is mishandled be too sweet and too soft. It fully shows enough acting talent, the ability and skill to convincingly play a smart, passionate, confident and Jeanne, but unfortunately, the director missed the point of the sign. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. No other game has been his dialogue was more dramatic or musical line more. However, treatment of this film requires you to look at it as a lawyer. This film is the case, and the audience is the judge. Here is how this picture will have. 7/10.
