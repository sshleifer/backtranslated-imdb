Growing up in New York in the late '80s / early' 90s club scene, I can personally say that it is one of the most important documentary films made in the coverage of that in this period of time. Neither Madonna did not come up with the idea Voguing, but it's where she got it from! Instead of taking the violence alone or bitchy cat fights, voguing allowed people to "fight" in the entire short touch each other (which guarantees the automatic suspension). Seeing this kind of extremely talented / well-planned "throw-downs" in the clubs there was nothing spectacular and all the big names from back in the day here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Dupree, Xtragavaganza etc ... all celebrated in the similar period of such pieces as Malcolm McLaren song "Deep in VogueÂ» ... it does not matter who you are and where you've been with, because when you have gone through that door in a "magic kingdom" of sorts, you become part of something bigger than yourself / you were important / and most importantly create your own movements and imagination ... and someone or with anyone could become King (or Queen), depending on the circumstances may be. Words and wit was as sharp as moving across the floor. All the tension, excitement and magic of this very city of New York energy captured in this film. BRILLIANT !!! Please release on DVD for the world to see !!! Thank you!
