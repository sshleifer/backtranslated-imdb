I just saw it on the film festival in Toronto, and I hope that he gets a wide release, because I want to see him again! It is a character-driven movie, and Andrew and David more than up to the task. Any discussion of the plot can be <br /> <br /> considered a spoiler, so I'll just say that the plot is clever, wonderful acting and the effects are amazing. Well shot and well-developed as well. One of the best films I've seen in ages, and very refreshing in this summer dreary <br /> <br /> cinema. It had the audience laughing all the time. if you can see it. (I particularly liked the "Candy Bar! Candy!" Scene.)
