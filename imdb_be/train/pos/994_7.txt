I watched this movie once, and I can watch it again, but while Jamie Foxx is good in the movie, I feel like they could use a "less fun" character as Alvin Sanders. Fox scenes, for example, in prison when he is faced with Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) is too funny. David Morse again a great portrayer cop. Its tough yet mostly calm features ideal for the role. Once again, Morse met Hutchison (Bristol) in the theater. Morse finishes coming down hard Hutchinson. They are both ideal for this scenario in every film. I personally love this quality in a film where the actors end up in the same situation as the previous film, as the two did in The Green Mile. Overall, it was a very good movie.
