Words seriously enough to convey the emotional power of this film; this is one of the most painful you'll ever see, but the ending is one of the most loving, tender and emotional performance you could hope for. Every actor in every role is terrific, especially the wise and understated, Jamie Lee Curtis, tightly twisted and tortuous Ray Liotta, and heart-stopping necessity Tom Hals, which should was for each award in the book. (He is the # 1 choice for Best Actor 1988 in Danny Peary Â«Alternate Oscars.") Over the past one and a half hours on the border of melodrama, but the film is received by each of his tears - and if you're not one stone will be many of them.
