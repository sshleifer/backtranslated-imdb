I do not have much to add to what has been said before, but it is very film this time, and the first (and probably only) time that the studio hung a movie completely on the dead-end kids. <, Br /> <br /> Warner gave the guys a lot of help from director Ray Enright and budget «A», to almost magically cast supporting actors. At every step, we get one of those valuable speeches from real professionals. They are too numerous to list, but I think just about everything on the Warner lot (Sans biggest stars) to go through this picture. (See if you can find John Ridgely) <br /> <br /> Common over the top performance from the always reliable Edward Chiannella as a mafia boss messianistic complex. He plays the character is almost the same as that Thuggie leader in "Gunga Din." It is something to watch! And Marjorie Main is great and gets his best role as «Dead End». <br /> <br /> May the rate for this is the second feature of a double bill with something of a "City for Conquest". <br /> <br Hooray /> for Warners!
