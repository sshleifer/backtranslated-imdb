I absolutely loved this show. I watched it since its first broadcast in the late 90's until the very last episode. In my view, really it was a great family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show can be seen from one or your children. Yes, things have changed a little bit with Joe since the last time we saw her in the books, but it was still fantastic with great stories and good lessons. The actress, who represents Joe Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does an excellent job, as does as an actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort) During the series we see developing romance between Joe and Nick, as well as daily stories and lessons for children and students learn. I recommend this show to everyone.
