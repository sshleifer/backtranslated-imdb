Atlantis: The Lost Empire a better film than I thought. I never thought that this film could lead to my expectations. However, this film started slowly, but as the movie wore on it became more to their liking. The story takes place in 1914, and a guy named Miley. Milo believes in fairy Atlantis. Together with friends of his grandfather, he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own. Along the way, he must call friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. Voice cast large. They certainly know how to carry movies only with their speakers. Music is nothing special, but it's nice anyway. Animation is not the best, but still good enough. Overall, this is a good family film for all ages. I rate this film 9/10.
