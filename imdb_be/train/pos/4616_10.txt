The name of this movie taken from the party game called "Seven Minutes in Heaven." The game was popular among friends of my husband when he was in high school in Brooklyn, New York, and he describes it as a kind of "spin-on- Bottle »,« Rescue Relay », and another teen kissing game. According to the rules, the name of the boy and the girl will be drawn, ordered and selected to enter into a dark closet together and remain there for seven minutes. At the same time, it would be speculation among the party guests as two, or not the nerve to hold hands, hug and / or kiss each other alone in the closet. At the end of the seven minutes of the game leader will say, "Time's up" or knock at the door of the cabinet, and the pair will come out of the closet. After eliciting the other guests, the couple will have to admit that they did during their "Seven Minutes in Heaven." Then the other couples will be chosen to go to the toilet until all the guests participated. The couple, who admitted to doing the most would be the game winner. <br /> <br /> These games serve as a social "icebreaker" for children and teenagers, but they can be uncomfortable and scary shy people, the film was given the title, because it deals with the first experience of adolescents with breaks, and romantic love.
