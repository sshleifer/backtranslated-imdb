I first encountered this show when I was in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the internet when I was looking for subtitled dramas to help me with the Japanese. host My mother warned me to stay away from him, because she thought it was weird, but I found it to be great! Koyuki showed such contradictory traits and spirit Matsujun made my day every time I tuned in! I first saw it on «Hana Yori Dango», but I liked it much better than this! <br /> <br /> While the characters are interesting and well-developed, I was disappointed that they have not changed very much throughout the show. Their relationship grew, but they are not really. However, the fun was all (even in Fukushima!).
