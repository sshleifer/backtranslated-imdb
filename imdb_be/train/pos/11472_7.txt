As a supporter of looking further into the phenomenon of school shootings, the film picked up interesting and different approach to this idea. Represented as a series of videos made by two caring people (I can not relate to those who kill the boys or teenagers), months of preparation leading up to the zero day (the code for the day on which they will attack) film tries to portray the situation from the opposite end of the gun. It seems intent on drawing the pain they are suffering, but the focus is on the preparation of the literal. The problem is that there is little in terms of emotion delivered. The only point at which it becomes the predominant emotion was ending, as expected. But leading up to that moment, he never quite clear why they are planning it. We are told the story of a mandatory, they mocked, but the film also seems to contradict this. Without destroying the film, it is easy to say that it was a great attempt and was as great intentions, but falls short due to sloppy filmmaking. Directing all amateur homemade videos to further the concept, but the history and continuity of the weak. The film seems to want the audience to solve a lot of, but also unable to provide information for such an event. The ending is abrupt and does not feel like he finishes all the film began.
