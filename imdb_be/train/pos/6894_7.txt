Men can slaver over Lollo, if they like (or lollos - she gave her name to slang terms for the breasts in French), but at home even tastier piece of the divine, Gerard Philippe, who is not only beautiful, but it can act. Do not be deterred if your version does not have subtitles, because in this simple, dashing story of love and war in which all means are good, they are not needed. All you need to know that, at the very beginning of the film, Lollobrigida reads Philipe hand and tells him that he will marry the daughter of the king. After that, the story is not clear from the Gallic gestures and running, jumping, and fencing. <br /> <br /> On the minus side, the evidence of history and despotic humorous tone becomes a bit tedious, and it is annoying that the French seem to consider themselves too superior to Hollywood to bother even trying to plausibility of his spectacular stunts. And, of course, do not miss the French-speaker random little ooh-la-la, such as the virtuous woman: I have to say that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, what made you think that I'm interested in that stuff?
