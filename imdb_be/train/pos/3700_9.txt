Cameron Grant is one of the best directors who make films for adults. His only rival Andrew Blake. Celeste dynamite all through the film, but the office of the sequence in the DR with her and two other houses just incredible. Almost as good performance of Asia Carrera with the construction workers. I highly recommend this film and gave it a 9. It's almost as good as an element of Cameron Grant lust, I gave 10.
