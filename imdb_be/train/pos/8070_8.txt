I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won the Best Actor Oscar for the film with the help of a three-way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty leads Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone, who were all in the same race. But the informant was still a great movie because John Ford would not have received his first Best Director Oscar if it was not. It is not involved in the award of a split. <br /> <br /> film and the story of Liam OFlaerti that it is based on does not include the poor simpleton man named Gypo Nolan, who once was a member of the Irish Republican Army, he was dismissed from her for some imbecilic trick he pulled out and wanted to return. He's down to the last penny, and if he can not get back, want enough for passage to America. There's a twenty-pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former companion named Frankie McPhillip played Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan gendarmerie and reports McPhillip. <br /> <br /> IRA really like to know who snitched McPhillip, and they're pretty sure it was McLaglen. He has no mind to actually cover their own tracks. He makes a feeble effort to engage the other person by the name of Peter Mulligan plays Donald Meek. It also raises sneak plays J.M. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> In general, the action takes place informers in 1922 in Dublin, about six o'clock in the evening to the early morning of the next day. Of necessity it is removed in the darkness and shadows, making it possibly the first film noir thriller. If it was made after the Second World War would have ranked high Informant noir classic, Odd Man Out, or third person, which she bares many similarities. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew that the world is very good. He spent some time during the uprising and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name to what was anglicized Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays an IRA Commandant Dan Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is difficult and despicable man than Foster here. I think that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans the introduction of some interest. He makes it clear that Foster should eliminate the informer, because Black and Tans will grab it and get a little more out of it and put the entire organization at risk. <br /> <br /> The process of IRA scene is the highlight of the film. If Donald Foster asks Mick if he recognizes the right of the court, Meek is not able to say no. justice and the writing of the King does not work here. It illustrates the moment, despite the occupation troops of the army and the gendarmerie, the English really lose their power over the population. <br /> <br /> Of course, the informer rather dark story of his contact John Ford, and less than one would expect. Even McLaglen spend their money on a drunken spree, R & D is always in the shadows, watching him, and counting every penny. <br /> <br /> informers is a story well told about Ireland's gloomy and sad time.
