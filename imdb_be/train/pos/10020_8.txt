The legendary Boris Karloff ended his remarkable career by making four cheapie fright flick clunker in Mexico. This marker capricious period gothic horror input from the clot. Karloff gives, as a rule, fit and worthy performance as Matthias Morteval, an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites some of his petty, greedy and not slander no counting relatives to his terrible run-down castle to read the will. Quite quickly hated, guests are faced with a lethal life-size toy people who inhabit the place. Mexican one-time sex symbol Andres Garcia shame «Tintorera» reflects the dashing hero police officer and Julissa looks quite wonderful as the only cute female character. Clumsy, plodding (in) direction, banal in a Room Scenario, ugly blurred cinematography ridiculous set of killing things (gross fat slob gets blown directly into the face of a miniature cannon!) Tears string number, morbid atmosphere of gloom, doom, in mostly lousy action (Karloff in particular, released), soft cheese gore, bad dubbing and exciting fiery conclusion all that gives pleasure to a terrible lemon lovingly Cruddy and thus, oddly amusing rat charm. This mannerism whistle.
