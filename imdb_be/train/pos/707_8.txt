We must be honest and say that I have not seen a lot of independent films, but I thought this one was very well done. Direction and cinematography were engaged without becoming a distraction. Angles and lighting settings are used successfully created a nightmarish world in which the protagonist was captured. Many haunting and memorable images from the movie stick in your mind long after it's over (always a sign of a good director).
