I got this film about a month ago, and now I'm a fanatic fan of Drew Barrymore. I love a happy ending, and this film gives a brilliant one hook slot Red Sox! It's about the math teacher who takes some promising kids on math trip in the company, where he successfully Lindsey (Drew) shows some information. This then leads to Ben (teacher) and Lindsey love. But it is not so simple when he admitted that the massive Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's good, but if it gets in the way baseball Lindseys life. It's all good in the end, and he made one shot to get Drew runs through the field !! I got it to two pounds in blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like films like this, I invite you to see some more work Drew as Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with Hugh Grant in the called Music and Lyrics.
