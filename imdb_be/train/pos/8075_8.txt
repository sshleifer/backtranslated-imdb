I chose not to believe what he says well-known film critic. Despite the fact that this film did not get the best commentary, this film made my day. That got me thinking. What is a false peace. <br /> <br /> what do you do when your closest fool you. He says that no matter how often you feed the snake's milk, it can never be precise and bite if given the chance. Similarly, some people are such that they have never been grateful. This film is about how selfish people can be and how it all eventually, just thinking about themselves and work for themselves. <br /> <br /> A brother dies inadvertently in the hands of bandits. surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real, and nobody is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave the performance of his life. New actor Aryan gave good results. The actress, who played the wife of Amitabh eclipsed. Her role was small, but it carefully so that one movable her work portrayed her role. Chawla was really great facial expressions, but her role was very limited and was not given the opportunity to fully express themselves. <br /> <br /> A great movie Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give some message to the audience. His films, like novels Nanak Singh (Punjabi novelist who novels always had a goal and a targeted social evils), because they have a real message to the audience. They entertain, as well as lesson-garden.
