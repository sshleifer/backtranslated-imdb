I really enjoyed this one, and although the ending made me angry, I still give it a 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) travels to Florida on the way they meet 2 guys (Turner, Davis), they really add nothing to the story, but at least somewhat cute. The girls agreed to meet with the guys in Florida for some fun, but they also have car problems and never do this. One of the girls decided to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay in the car. <br /> <br /> Soon, one of the girls has to use the bathroom, while in the middle of nowhere it has no choice but to go into the bushes. Soon she witnesses how people (March) suppresses a woman, terrified girl running area, it is not very far, but it is possible to get lost. <br /> <br /> Her friends in the car to go look for her, they also go into the woods and run into the same people, one of them sees the dead woman, the man responds by shooting the girls head, another girl runs away, unable to make it back in the car, where she also killed. <br /> <br /> In the end, the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into a petrol station arrested. This is when I started to get mad, these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the Redneck police do not believe them. <br /> <br /> They are ill-treated and one of them was left alone crazy to kill her in a cage, which remains one manages to escape, but not without getting into dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This film has nudity, a good actress, a shower scene that mimics Psycho, graphic violence against women and a solid history. Some women are likely to be offensive and sensitive people will not like the final, but behind all this is a great little unknown film.
