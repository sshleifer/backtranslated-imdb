This film is proof that timeless noir style, and very worthy to stay alive. For me, it is the best example of noir as Chinatown. <br /> <br /> It will not, unfortunately, does not get the recognition it deserves. He was never promoted properly when it was first released, and it was necessary to build their frames supporters through the center, like a movie Vanguard and word of mouth referrals rental. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment to rent this film, and plunged into a very twisted story.
