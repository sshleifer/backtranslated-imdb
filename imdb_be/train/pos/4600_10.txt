It's sad peak of this movie it should be at least 250 best films here. It is still the best action movie ever made. In action movies today are poorly made action actors and directors do not no how to do the fighting and stunts correctly. Only some do not like to do it mainly from Hong Kong, Jackie Chan. Tricks are so smart and wild, I do not think we will see these ever. Start where Chan and his team go down the hill a car chase through the hill town is just amazing. End combat tricks for me to fight the best stunts ever to hit the film. End trick sliding pole crash through the glass Jackie was badly damaged.
