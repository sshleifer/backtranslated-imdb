It's funny how your life can change in a moment ... to participate in the «» The Waterdance «» for the first time, it was an unforgettable experience, as you will need to get used to a new way of life, it may seem daunting, and noted that there are other people who are on a similar situation can help you move on. <br /> <br /> performance of Eric Stoltz and basically Helen Hunt (about people! Helen pure and graceful woman on the ground ...) excellent, Wesley Snipes and surprises in one of his last major role. The film is a simple and at the same time deeply that does not get to leave us indifferent to the message that is sent: to enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> In fact, in the film, both of that every hour was not present !!! (Sorry, it's the Brazilian expression ...).
