Well, the first one I hate commenting on this thing, but I felt like I was supposed to be in this film. So many people bashing on him, and I felt like people who would like to see what it is to get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First, Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the deepest of the film century. If this is what you are looking for somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it should be pretentious. It should make you feel good, and you should have fun watching it, and these two things are done skillfully. <br /> <br /> Secondly, acting, although not "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball," is still good. The film does not need to act like that is fair, so do not look for it. It's a family movie. If this is something you would like or you do not even have to look at this film honestly. <br /> <br /> And finally, it has a very nice story. I think it's well thought out, and it was interesting to watch. This is also very true to life, for the most part of this culture, so if you want to sit down and watch a movie, which you can enjoy and feel good about when you're done. If you are looking for something with a well thought-out plot lines and large dramatic scenes, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
