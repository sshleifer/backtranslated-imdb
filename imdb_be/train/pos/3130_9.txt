I am Belgian, and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown here (in the original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first, I was delighted. Unfortunately, there is caused a "panic hysteria" among mothers because Batman was considered too strong. Geez, compare the innocence of this series on the crap kids get to see these days. So because of my over-protective mother with 60s years, I've only got a chance to see, maybe two or three episodes! I'm so upset I started collecting comics and bubblegum card (still got them!) to compensate. I even got a view Master slides ... I had a desire see the caped Crusader. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Many years later I nareshts I got a chance to see reruns of adolescence, and I enjoyed it tremendously. The acting is insincere would avoid me, if I would have seen it as a child, but I realized it at the age of 17 years I've watched them all now and sometimes a kind soul on Internet postings episodes, because they have not released the series on DVD (to my knowledge) <br /> <br /> this evening I enjoyed "Return to the bat cave" ... it was fun, to watch because it was full of details and inside jokes. To see how Adam and Burt was a delight, and this TV movie is fantastic in every aspect. They play like they played a role in this series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations person who made this great nostalgic "holiday" ... I'm going to watch it again. My advice to all fans of Batman: see !!! Rent it !!! Lend it from one !!! Buy !!! I never expected myself to appreciate it as a 9/10 ... Very well done!
