People tend to complain about the number of films made about mentally disabled people. I do not see this as a legitimate criticism, no more than a complaint too much about some people movies. Van Dormal, Jacques does an excellent job with the script and the direction. Auteuil and Pascal Daquin work fine with Duquenne basically plays himself. The film covers a surprisingly large base of events, not just content to go beyond what has been seen in "Rain Man." The ending is very sad, but it does not spoil a wonderful story that came before. <br /> <br /> 7.8 10
