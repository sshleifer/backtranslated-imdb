A great example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s. The audience must have been very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Quite a contrast to his «Public Enemy» 2 years ago. Cagney & does add a spark interest in the fairly routine formulated driven storyline and plot. But the highlight of the film is 3 complex back-to-back production numbers. Firstly with a conservative number "Honeymoon Customers at", followed by a very impressive eye dazzling "waterfall" sequence, followed by the closing sequence of "Shanghai Liv" Cagney involved only in the latest issue of hoofing it on top of the meter panel with Ruby Keeler. "Shanghai Liv" Room with Cagney's fine, but a little Comedown and anti climax after the more exciting and incredibly incredible "waterfall» choreography.If I was the director, I would have put "Shanghai Lil 'room in the middle and close to the" waterfall "that blows other 2 amount of water, so to speak, and in my opinion, the best of the 3-digit. The 3 production rooms icing on the cake and a performance by James Cagney add decorations to the cake. Outstanding musical achievement 4 movie stars, the final musical worth a look, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
