Paul Verhoeven (genius and master cinematographer) strikes back with less than perfect but still fun in a "dirty old man type as" Hollow Man. The first two steps are so good that Cutter Final Act disappointing. Nevertheless, I give recommendations in this film, because it's awful special effects (maybe the best is still around) and two dandy performances retracted. moral issues Verhoeven, of course, makes you think, and although the film received many, this film is quite soft core for the old Verhoeven <br /> <br /> The two main drawbacks :. Josh Brolin (he went ape-man), and the entire transaction with an elevator. When was the access staircase, why they were trapped down in the lab? <br /> <br /> A fun horror movie for the Saturday night.
