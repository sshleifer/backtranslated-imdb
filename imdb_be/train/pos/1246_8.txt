The room may seem stupid, but because the nature of Murphy does not take it seriously, it helps to facilitate the audience in this mixture of mysticism and modern hard boiled child abduction. Excellent cast, in particular, and Charles Dance Charlotte Lewis and Murphy at the peak of his 80th peak in the comedy / action. There are also some great F / X, a very surreal dream sequence, and quite original story. Often overlooked in the pantheon Murphy clicks, but it's one worth watching.
