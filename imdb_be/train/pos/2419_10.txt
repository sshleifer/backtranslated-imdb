In addition to planes, trains and automobiles and Uncle Buck, this is the most funny movie John Candy. If he gets mesmerized with gambling cards (similar to The Manchurian Candidate) and becomes horny guy who does not know what he says, he does two very slogans (Both deal with the male anatomy). Love scene with foodstuffs must be visible, it can not be described. <br /> <br />
