I lost count of how many reviews I wrote Slaughter High. I read a lot of bad, and I'll say right now it's a fantastic film. Simon Skaddamor made his reputation in a short time a well-known suicide for him, and even if it was his only film he has made a film that is so great. At first I did not know Simon, until I read a review about his suicide. Then I found out that due to the current web page in www.IMDb.com he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon could play a most pitiful character known to man, but his real life on their own, of course, had their strenghths and weaknesses. He did a good acting job, who can not agree? I always wondered how he felt, showing himself naked in the film. It should have been quite uncomfortable, to say the least. I first saw this film when I was in sixth grade 12. I agree with some pointers as she would not take a bath after someone was killed, and that the high school did not have a bath! I think that Caroline Munro, who was 36 at the time was the only star that had some decent acting talent, and, unfortunately, to the death of Simon, he did not make any future films. Reason (s) for his suicide is a mystery, and I hope it will open soon. Doing the math on his web page, he tells you that he was 29 years old when he made Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this movie two thumbs up, the best horror film made. Probably due to their horrible actions of others do not fame in the movie business. -Jacob Young
