Of all breakdance / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986 1984 film Beat Street, it is undoubtedly the best option. The story follows the DJ, his younger brother, breakdancing, graffiti artist and wanna-be show business promoter through one winter, in which they try to escape from the ghetto, using their "street" talent. Actions are not always on top, and the characters are not fully drawn, but they are more than offset by the down to earth dialogue, believable stories, fantastic dance sequences and audio track timeless hip-hop. It should be noted that the film was shot at home breaks ( "This is not New York, it's the Bronx"), and especially the parents lit breakdancing, dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew provides the best scene in the movie, when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere of breakdancing club at the beginning of the 80s, Roxy. A must see for fans of hip-hop.
