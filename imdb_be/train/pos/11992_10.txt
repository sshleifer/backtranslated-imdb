Ever since I can remember, I loved airplanes and flying. I am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking to become commercial. I could never remember why I was so obsessed with this subject until I came across my old corkscrew tapes in my basement, and it hit me, it was him. My parents bought each tape they had, and it was the only show I would like to see as a child. I had memorized the topic, as I grew up, and I can still quote it again today. This is absolutely amazing, and I'm planning to buy a fast DVD ,! This is really great for kids and adults, and absolutely timeless. I can not get enough of this show.
