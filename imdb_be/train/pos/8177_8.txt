I am surprised that nobody thought to make a movie like this before. Horror is often most effective when it uses the real life of a nuisance as the theme. And no one (for Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors except) does not like to go to the dentist. Tooth torture was made earlier (see Marathan person, for example), but it brings the horror of the suburb. <br /> <br /> plot revolves around the dentist, Dr. Alana Feinstone (Bernsno) which goes into insanity. Now our dear doctor is not playing with a full deck, to begin with, but moving jealousy and obsessive-compulsive disorder, he starts to smell havoc on those around him. Doctors spiraling mental state is a sort of close to what we see in the character of Micheal Douglas in Falling Down, but with an edge of horror. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Stuart Gordon fellows horror and the Union, its witty and has a beautiful stream. signs also plays the police, it is ever welcome Ken Fori. <br /> <br /> Now, I believe that this film will not work without an absolutely fantastic performance from Bernsno. With really only saw him in the Los Angeles law before, I was blown away by his actions. <br /> <br /> Later Dentist 2 is also worth a look, but a little below par compared to the original. <br /> <br /> TTKK in Bottomline - fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe Capo (pun intended) on a great performance from Bernsna
