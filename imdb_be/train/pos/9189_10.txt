Let me start by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 pm one night I could not fall asleep until about 3:00 am <br /> <br /> This brief review may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm a longtime fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say that this is the best episode I've seen. I'm not saying that everyone should feel that way, but I do. . This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family, watching my own father in a coma in intensive care before he passed <br /> <br /> The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: it is the trader who mistakenly identity He believed that a man named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> so long already gone in ten minutes, I knew Tony dreamed, or I was watching some of the other shows. It was not like a normal Soprano, and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "by Kevin") looks at the sky in a helicopter, "Spotlight," and we see pushing through it, a doctor with a flashlight. We see it only for an instant, and the sequence plays out until we get back to real life, in a situation like the one I have just said. <br /> <br /> Tony came out of the coma, only for a moment. His boys take A.J. House and Carmella, overcome stress, breaks down in the hallway :. since the signing of the episode <br /> <br /> Throughout the remainder of the episode, we cut between the real world: a family dealing with potential. a negative result of the coma, and alternative reality Tony that parallels what is happening in his mind and in the real world around him <br /> <br /> Then comes the star moment in the episode: after AJ ends up telling his mother he flunked school she goes to see the meadow sits side <br /> <br /> Anthony is close to Tony, and give the best line of the episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" in the world of Tony, he enters the room dark and the hotel includes a light . He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. He is trying to score, but he can not - as if he was trying to say something to Carmella, but physically he could not bring himself to do it. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits up and looks out the window. Flickering light that is repeated throughout the episode now seems to be called to him from the other side of town. <br /> <br /> Â«If it is cold, I wanted to die" by Moby marries perfectly with the latest designs and helps to create an emotional rollercoaster episode <br /> <br /> 10 of 10. <br /> <br /> PS :. Watch the next episode. You will learn what light is. It's great.
