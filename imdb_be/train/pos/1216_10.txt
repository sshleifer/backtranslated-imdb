As a child, I preferred the first film Caring bear as this one seemed so dark. I always sat and watched the first. As I got older, I learned to prefer it. What I do think that this movie is too dark for children, but as you get older you learn to appreciate it, because you know what's more, it does not seem as dark as it was when you were a child. <, Br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, better than the first, so everything is much deeper. This may be contrary to the first film, but you need to ignore the first film to see this. Young is just too adorable, I because "Flying My Colors" stage. I tend to irritate everyone to sing. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great! Large hand Carol and Dean Parks. I love all the songs in this film, I downloaded all of them, and all that I am listening, I'm listening to "Our principle", also known as "recalling" at the moment. I have always preferred the sound track to the first, but I just totally love Carol Kings song in the first film, «Care-A-Lot». <br /> <br /> I think the animation is great, the animation in both films are fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and watched it for about 10 years later, and saw that the animation was a wonderful period of time. It was really weird. <br /> <br /> There is not a lot back from the others to say that this movie is great, but it is. I do not think it's weird / strange. I think it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is about how the Care Bears and happened to defeat the demon Dark Heart. End of weird and again, beats any «Pokemon Movie» with questions Care Bears Moral. It leaves the effect on you. Again, this film can teach all people of all ages about morality.
