Let's start with the fact that the theme song by Christopher Cross. The song "If you get caught between the moon and New York." It's a great theme and the song, even after all these years, he never becomes tedious. It's really a great song about New York as well. Anyway, the big star Dudley Moore CBE, like a spoiled drunk millionaire, who deals with the character in the film Eikenberry. Jill later star in LA Law. In any case, it is for its beautiful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won an Academy Award for her role in the film as best supporting actor. Arthur falls in love with the character Liza Minnelli, who is perfect in this film, in addition to performances in his Oscar winning role in Cabaret. No, Lisa, do not sing. It plays a diner waitress. Anyway, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald, as Bach matriarch of the family, which decides the fate of the family. In any case, it is incredible and should have received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting himself Actress. Barney Martin is best known as the father of Jerry Seinfeld plays Lisa's father. It's too big. The film was well written, acted, and delivered in the audience who wanted more.
