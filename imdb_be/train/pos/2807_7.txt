I caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was amazed at how painful it was. Even when one of the two victims of his most deteriorated, the camera continues to go. stored arrows corpse opened and its concentration camp figure archived in the bag body are both moving and depressing. Sun to watch this movie if your already in a depression. then again, do not look, if your feeling really good.
