I, like many supporters of the horrors that have been force-fed the same banal big budget remakes of Hollywood and MTV high school slasher scar in the last 20 years. Here, finally, the original horror film genre, which stands for all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> You want a hot lead actress, you want a vampire, you want cool weapons, you want to cool vehicles, and you want blood, a large amount of load of the bucket - you got it <br /> < br /> with excellent combat choreography and the supportive role of the Hammer horror scream queens most Stephanie Beach, it's really weird stuff. <br />. <br /> Despite this low budget, preferring to use a 35 mm margin and the addition of high-quality CG effects to the mix, director James Eaves created something that feels much larger. <br /> <br /> A must for fans of old school horror.
