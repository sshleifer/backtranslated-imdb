** Warning Soft Spoilers ahead! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I realize that it's hard to mess up a historical documentary, but I reveal some background and methods). <br /> <br /> This is an exceptional documentary, not only because of the excellent staff, but also because of the history behind it. Since Naudets not set to tell the story of 9/11, but rather from a rookie firefighter, men's emotions and communicate the viewer with them more real and powerful than they would in a standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In a sense, the film industry, "9/11" is textbook. If the events were the actual scenario, it would be great, as the characters are set, and then thrown out the curve to which they must respond. This is all the more surprising given the pain and emotions raw footage that the director had to wade through the pieces of the story together. <br /> <br /> Part of the film provides insight into life inside the fire station; In particular, as a rookie assimilates himself to the team veterans. One only this part pretty good, and it was documented was allowed to run its intended course, he probably would have been hard. Brothers are realistically depict the process of becoming a firefighter New York. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, all hell loose. Chaos after the WTC attacks clearly shows that the various characters that we got to know, is thrust into a terrible situation. Seeing not only attacks, but also the reaction of first-hand is very movable drawing extreme human emotions. <br /> <br /> When, where firefighters found lost and found is human drama at its peak. Life and death hang in the balance. Unlike many films, the viewer not only does not know who will live and die, but really cares about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say that Robert De Niro (who I love) Blurbs were uninformative and unnecessary, and does not move the story at all. They are likely to have been added only to attract more viewers <br /> <br /> The result :. The best documentary I've ever seen. Incomparable image raw human emotion and drama. 9.5 out of 10.
