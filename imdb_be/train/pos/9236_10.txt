Let's think people quit bad-mouthing the original, during which time the original series Battlestar was a masterpiece, even still with all the stars, storylines and art. Lorne Greene was great as Adama, Richard Hatch was perfect as Apollo Dirk Benedict and funny as Starbuck's, but I dare say, not as good as Starbuck Katee like. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with Pegasus and greetings from Earth was a good John was a big calico as Baltar, War of the Gods, was the best experiment in Terra, I thought it was a tribute to the way Heaven Can Wait, in you were women cruiser and not compare them, for example, Trichet, who incredibly beautiful as number six, but the beauty of Jane Seymour can not be compared with. Not to mention the Loerrta Spang, like Cassiopeia was fantastic .It was a beauty, that the rainbow will be confused. I loved the original as well as the new. <br /> <br /> You can imagine, when John had calico number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thankyou for listening.
