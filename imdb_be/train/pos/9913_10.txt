In addition, it is extremely funny movie, it can be added that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. This kind, fun loving woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two hungry daughter who wanted to get their hands on her money. This woman was lonely after the death of her husband. He invited her to the theater, which is going to be demolished. To prevent this, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid of her throwing "their" money and decided to take action. Cast of characters in this film are a big plus, too. I would give almost anything to get a copy of this film in my video library, but so far, it has never been released. Garden.
