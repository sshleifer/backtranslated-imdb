There was not a dry eye in the audience yesterday afternoon after I left the cinema to see this movie in a stone house sold out within the framework of the Hamburg Film Festival this year. And the tears shed were laughing. This movie was funny, there's no other way to say it. There was not one bit sad in this, I laughed right through him and with me the rest of us three hundred lovers of French cinema. <br /> <br /> Allen Shaban was absolutely stunning. Big clown when need be serious if the situation requires it. The play, of course, completely over the top, but it was exactly what you need and the history that made it work so well. Just great was Charlotte Gainsbourg, which I love to see a lot, and his mother was also a very strong performance. Sister might be a little more detail in the character script-wise, but other than that nothing to moan about. I had a great day seeing this film while Hamburg is buried in the rain on the street, and I want to films such as from France will receive the regular edition in Germany. But the distributors of this country do not seem to understand that the French make good movies. At least I can not wait to find a DVD, which offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?), Because I need to film house to see a few more times!
