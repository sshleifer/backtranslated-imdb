Just returned from the show's first Basic Instinct 2. I was going into it thinking that it would be crappy based on the preview of critics, and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Basic Instinct I think you will enjoy the # 2 as well, if not more. A great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. The music is beautiful, the sequel to the original motto. Do not go waiting Oscar material, go to see it for fun and entertainment. This is what movies are for - escapism. I can not think of a better way to escape than to run with Sharon Stone, which is as sexy as it ever was. I think about going to see it again this weekend. Go it!
