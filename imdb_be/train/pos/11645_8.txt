I was in France around March 05, and I love to go to this festival. I knew about this Cin√©mas d'Amerique Latine de Toulouse, but I never went to see him. I decided to go, and then I caught CERO in van 4. <br /> <br /> The film is stunning. It has not caused an impact on me as a Mexican users, because it was a French-subtitled, but it is still shocking. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire on urban violence, the kidnapping and crime in the streets of Mexico. This is a rough portrait of the city. Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with amazing Mia Maestro, who was also a satire of the kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone there, and I think some kind of connection with the Cero in van 4. And, like, the history of redemption and that it is too much much? Man on Fire, which was surprisingly strong, also, Sun satire, and a rough portrait on the streets of Mexico. Or it's like The Brave One. A film that shocks, and hits you in the gut is very difficult. It is suspected he has some twists and turns, but this makes it all the more believable. Verdict: A film that shocks and makes you believe that there is no security on the streets anymore. Excellent dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performances. Cero in Wan 4 is a film that you will not forget any time soon. Leaves you shaken and stunned.
