I was hooked from start to finish. Large horror comes from the disturbing images and organic shocks that are created will not make you jump, but to make you go "What the * ck I just saw?" The rest of the commentators gave a short summary of what a film about, so I will not to repeat what has already been said. I talked to other people about this film days after I had seen him only because still does not allow me to live. I even had a bad dream after seeing it, and I am a real horror fan not so easily scared scarred as «The Grudge» or «Silent Hill». What gave m no bad dreams had I felt uncomfortable about what I would do if I were in the cell with these guys. What would my personal horror? my subconscious took me there, and did not like it. They are my friends that's what a good horror film does for you! the best part of this movie is the fact that it is fine. it is not that the image of the enemy jump out at you, alien invasions, or a ton of gore. It's the opposite. The horror you create in your own mind. The irony of the four characters that terror does not come from an external force, which states that it is the power over them. Simply put, people are asking for one thing they want, and they get it ... but not the way they imagined. Thus, on the one hand, they get what they want from the occult books, but may eventually wish they had not. Sometimes the best place to be locked up in a prison cell to be!
