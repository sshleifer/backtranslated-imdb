Another one of those movies that you hear about from friends (... or read on IMDb). Not many false notes in this. I could see almost everyone here is really going on with the young girl fleeing from a deadlocked hometown in Tennessee Florida, with all her belongings in an old beaten-up car. <br /> <br /> The heroine, Ruby, he makes some false starts, but learn from them. I wondered why, why it can be tilted a little more on Mike's shoulder, but ... she has her own reasons, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> Just a thin film. The only thing I do not like this, I think is the name.
