Scarecrow was the funniest Killers I have ever seen in action! In addition, he is really bouncy most of the time he rode, which was awesome! In addition, he had a beautiful voice, I mean, it's just perfect for him. Storylines were excellent too. I like the way the shower the children were transferred to the Scarecrow, that was cool! Plus he has a reason for all this murder, I mean, after what these people have done to it ..... I would be angry too! Stuffed view was really good! his look gives this man «OMG!» reaction when they see it! Which was great, it looks he was funny! These people were stupid, who will look for so long! They must have looked and ran for their lives ... although that would not have made a difference!
