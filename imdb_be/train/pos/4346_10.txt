Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business. I have read two of his books, and think he's great. Peter Falk can deliver a punch line with the best of them. The combination of these two magic. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family really know each other. Through the trip father and son to connect for the first time in his life in midts of family crisis. They do all the things that parents and sons are suppose to do in life ... they just make them much later in life. The situation is very funny, but there is a feeling that they might happen to people in real life (not obsurdly over the top or cartoon). This is the first time I see Paul Reiser and fully believed all the emotions that are reflected. Sometimes his eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret film and a great story and plot. It has comedy and emotion, but uplifting message ... Olympia Dukakas does a great job too :)
