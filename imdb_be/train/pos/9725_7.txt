"How to Lose Friends & Alienate People" is not based on the infidelity of Tiger Woods. This is an ordinary romantic comedy based on the book Toby Young about his experiences as a journalist, pokryvayuscheh celebrities. The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, funny British journalist who takes a job at the famous celebrity magazine in New York. Young worrier will fall into all sorts of machinations to alienate everyone around him, hence the name of the movie. He was exuberant, bold and idiocy. Yet for some very strange reason, it is somewhat likeable character. Sydney befriends fellow journalist, was Alison Olsen, played quite well Kirsten Dunst. Nevertheless, the Sydney, first of all, the desire for the actress Sophie sexy woman! Maes plays Fantastic Ms. Megan Fox. This foxtrot short on acting, but high on the "eye candy" material. Sydney gets all kinds of entertainment and to move up the ladder in a magazine journalist with. This is the peak of the comic moments of the film. Nevertheless, I think that the director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter plane can lose part of the audience and alienated authentic rom-com material to design implausible romantic storyline between Sidney & Alison; even if the team did Weidstraughan formulate a fascinating story differently. Pegg did tie his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges again build a "Dude" bridges with his mysterious maintenance work as Clayton Harding, polite Pres magazine. But the rest of the film's action was not worthy to show here. "How to Lose Friends & Alienate People" should not be disposed of completely, but you may lose some friends to a movie if you publish it as a high romantic comedy. *** Average
