All dogs go to heaven, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. I'm not really a big fan of cartoons, but there's something about this one that makes it better than any other animated film I've seen. Music is beautiful, as is the performance Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, and especially of Ken Page as King Gator. "Let's make music together", perhaps one of my favorite songs of all musical film I've seen. This is definitely a must see for people of all ages.
