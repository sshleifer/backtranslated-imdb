this is what I call a great film. he lives trough fantastic actor skills and a simple, but human history. there are real characters who can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very tough, as the driver of the bus is.the alive and his son collect people trough the country (Yugoslavia) in their paths in Belgrade the capital. Funny and violent situations that occur on the road, connect people and pigs, who are traveling together. <br /> <br /> Watch and you'll remember it all my life ... full of humor and Slavic life <br /> <br /> another reason for his magic :. it is hard to get !!
