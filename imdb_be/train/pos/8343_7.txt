Australian Skepisi (Cry in the Dark) directs this comedy / melodrama that is fun, relaxing, and set in the spring. You will laugh while watching this film. Tim Robbins (The Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) mechanic Ed Walters, a high the IQ, which gets more with Albert Einstein, Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them their preppie shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail) Kathryn Boyd, Einstein's niece, who is a competent, but not so sure mathematician. Perhaps this is because it is surrounded by all that genius. She thinks that if she marries someone with great IQ her children will have a high IQ as well, but she does not know what she wants. Between Tim Robbins sweet smile and wit Meg is a refreshing film. I love the sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Ekaterina engaged with a jerk James Moreland, who works in animal behavior, but very stuffy. This is the love of the first sight type situation between the mechanics and mathematics. Witty lines and subliminal line! Cinematography nice. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. . With the great help of all these brilliant men Katherine falls Ed, not knowing that he was a mechanic <br /> <br /> Any scenes: Ed taking multiple-choice test to the crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein riding a motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris giving all research animals for free <br /> <br /> Any quote Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain interfere with your heart." Ed Walters: "When was the last time he said," Wahoo ""? Catherine Boyd: "Well, I'm sure I do not know," This is a refreshing film, I recommend it I have a tape and each time, and for a while I'll watch it again...
