As I drove to Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon a few years ago and was impressed with the scenery, I can not help but wish that this film, even if it has a beautiful color and spectacular views, would have been shot in this place. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a great place, but still not a real place where the film takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, that is, if I feel like Anthony Mann, who used the open spaces so well, could make the most if it is shot in the actual location. James Stewart here again people struggling inside, one side did not want to participate and help the people who stand in the way of his making money, and the other side is simply unable to look away from the people who are being killed. Ruth Roman bird woman who does not care who she is walking, Corinne Calvet is a good girl. Man perfectly guiding the bullet, but the high point of the film, how well it is doing in outdoor scenes. It uses the outdoors as much as he can, and it helps in the winter landscape, the predominant white, as it was with greens in «The Naked Spur» and brown colors in "The Man from Laramie." Like all Mann-Stewart, is a traditional Western, with a difference in the development of the character of Stuart, which is more complex.
