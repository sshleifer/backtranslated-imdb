Freebird I saw the movie and I think it's great! his laid back fun time on the British film industry has come through something entertaining !! it is good, as the guy who met them at the service station, said the way to the movies in the news agents, a nice touch. Urged acting (I'm a biker), they reminded me of some of the good times I've had in the bike scene. It was nice to see the director takes the action, well done John! At the end of the new crop referred to in Ireland is the foundation for the 2nd movie? I hope to keep them. Great movie, well written, realistic characters!
