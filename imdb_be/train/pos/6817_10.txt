I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie b / c the real meaning of family in it, the history of our country, fun action appears in the film. I look @ the top time of about 4 X this week, and I just love it! I would like to see a sequel was to have been done to see Susan's parents in the past, and watched as Susan DELT with her new sister and not having a phone, computer, Gameboys or anything in the 21st century. I hope I still enjoyed the movie as much as I did, I guess you could say I'm just at the top of a fanatic, and I do not mind. Liv boy in the film, Robert Lincoln Walker was just adorible I wonder who he is and how old it is today. Does anyone know when he played in more than a movie or a TV show?
