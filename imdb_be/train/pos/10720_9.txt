Hooray! Space film that does not take itself too seriously, and anyone can come to a thrilling ride that is the Space Camp. The film begins to slow, normal, and high mixture idiot pilots mixed together in Shifty soup. But when the going gets tough. - hard to get themselves sorted out, and this is not true, changes in the character, how can you believe that there is some kind of responsibility in their young minds <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the film, which is very annoying Capshaw as instructor "I'm right and you're wrong." I would recommend this as a nice evening in the cinema and 7 vote.
