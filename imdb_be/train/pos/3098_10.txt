I loved this show so much, and I was so incredibly boring it was canceled, I thought he came back, too, but only two dull weeks. Something terrible. I hate how we will never know how it ends. it sucks. Bring it back! ABC is stupid shows like Supernanny and whatnot, but it does not give time for good as six degrees. If they complain about ratings is probably because they have a bad slot, because it was a really good show, I could relate to and expected. JJ Abrams delivered, it is awesome, I want to ABC could just trust him enough to finish this story. I also liked the whole cast. I could not wait to see how things will ever meet each other at once. The history of each person is now left unfinished, now I'll never know, when Stephen and Whitney get together or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would have happened to Laura and Damien and all the rest. It is precisely such a loser.
