If you find yourself in the need of escape, something that will keep your attention for two hours and let you get lost in another world, the Domino will satisfy this need. It's fun in the end! The plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies (like The Usual Suspects), where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out. I wondered about the most Domino Harvey, her life has been of interest to Hollywood. As for the action, a lot of celebrities speaking entirely shown in the trailers. And any actor who makes me forget who they've done a good job. Not once did I think about Kiera in football shape or pirate costume. And got Mickey Rourke Mickey Rourke plays well and often, but here, in spite of the violence, it shows signs that are capable of taking care of other people.
