I loved this show from its first airing, and I always look forward to watch every episode of every week. Plot, characters, letters, and special influence was outstanding! Then, the sci-fi channel screwed up again and canceled the very entertaining, well-written show. I say bring it back, I know that all the actors back. I would suggest buying a DVD, I am. I hope the leaders of the sci-fi channel to receive a word from these comments, and I understand that they need to be more involved with their audience. I only watch one show on this channel right now, (Ghost Hunters), but I am quite sure that soon they will cancel it, too.
