I loved this movie. I thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget. I ran after the viewer to buy a DVD, OBV is not so easy to forget! <br /> <br /> script is brilliant and the cast could not be more perfect. Each character has his moment, and I seriously laughed throughout the movie, comedy was spot- time. <br /> <br />
