This is an ideal series for family viewing. We gathered around the TV to watch it on BBC America. This is an updated version of Robin Hood, and it appeals to children and adults. Our teen and tween-ager as they like to sit with Mom and Dad, and watch following the exploits of Robin. We can not wait for the next episode airing every week and am happy for free «On Demand» view. <br /> <br /> The cabinet has a place in modern fashion. There is a moral to every story. That's interesting. Violence over-the-top or unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with John William Feel it. This is an old world fairy tale that brought to life with a new world flair. <br /> <br /> There is so much rubbish on television from the brain rotting "reality" television to senseless violence. You have to take it for what it is, and that the new "Robin Hood" can not be compared with the film exploits Errol Flynn. This is a gem to be accessible to all. Parents who are concerned about their children watch too much violence will enjoy the fact that Robin had lost the taste for war and bloodshed. He Robin Hood who would prefer to try to talk your way out of a disagreement than fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive role model for young girls. Rather than stand by and do nothing, it takes its own role in helping the poor, as a "night watchman". Sheriff of Nottingham wonderful over the top of the wicked, as well as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne plays a very handsome actor, the one that makes most women want it does not reflect the role of the bad "Gaya". <br /> <br /> The only question that we have, "Where is Friar Tuck?"
