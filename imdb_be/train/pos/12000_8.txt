I think the film is informative. However, it does not address the issue that sparked so much controversy: polygamy. In addition, the film can not show that the LDS Church preaches. Great was the missed opportunity to tell the world what they really believe. I could not get a clear idea of ​​what it LDS views on the central theme of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends and they are good people. It would be nice to get a clearer picture of how they view the more controversial statements of its prophet. Maybe these statements are too controversial to be treated in a film format, but it would be great to hear the whole story really interesting life of Joseph Smith. In the end, it gives an idea of ​​the American idea of ​​religion in the 18th century. I hope that they make some documentaries about this fascinating subject, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. We can be the president of the Mormon anything. In the end, Smith ran for president.
