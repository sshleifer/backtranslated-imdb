This film was sitting on my Tivo for a few weeks before I watched it. I was afraid of self indulgent yuppie film about the relationship soured. I was wrong; It was a fascinating tour of the narrowed libido New Yorkers. <br /> <br /> The format is the same as Max Oph√ºls "La Ronde", based on the play by Arthur Schnitzler, which is given "inspired by" credit. It starts with one person, a prostitute standing on a street corner in Brooklyn. she picked up a home contractor who has sex with her on the hood of the car, but can not come. he refuses to pay it. If it is turned off Peeing, she answers his cell phone and receive the message. she runs off with their keys. <br / > <br /> Then the story switches to the contractor who pays a professional challenge for the rich, bored in New York women and that plays with him until he was excited, she pulls away, she tells him how desperate and unhappy she was, he tells her how beautiful she is, and lucky. When he leaves, she asks if he would have sex with it. it sits on top of him, bouncing up and down. this time it comes, it goes. <br /> <br /> the woman and her husband to throw a dinner party for their fashionable friends. Hubby (Robert) said business, wife (Elena) is bored, and changes the topic of sex, and how often men and women think about it. Husband switches the conversation to the desert. Later, after the guests leave, Ellen tries to seduce Robert sex. Robert did not want any of it, and put on a jazz record. Helen turns on the radio; Robert turns up the music; Helen turns on the TV; Robert is on a second TV. Cacophony is worth. Helen rises to the roof, Robert joins her. Helen confesses that she should feel more people, in addition to Robert men. Robert says that he, too, should feel the person. <br /> <br /> Next, we follow Robert as he visited the painter, Martin, played by Steve Buscemi. I wish Bush could have more roles like this, where it is sexy, smart, absolutely desirable guy. Robert praises the work of Martin, far more than he deserves, it promises to get him on the show. Martin is excited until he found out that Robert is talking to his crotch, it's mating dance. Robert Martin is trying to kiss on the lips, and Martin pulls back, saying that he is not gay. Robert says he's not gay either, Martin mocks. Both recognize that art is bad. Robert is about to leave, when Martin allows Robert to kiss him. They make out, and Robert Martin goes down. <br /> <br /> Next, we follow Martin, as he prepares for an art exhibition in a gallery in Manhattan. He killed the receptionist Anna, played by Rosario Dawson. (I had to cut some of that review, to keep it under 1000 words) ... and they make love with each other. <br /> <br /> Next, we go to Anna, sitting at lunch stand. Her friend, Nick (Adrian Grenier), enters, carrying flowers. It is cold to him; he tries to find out why. He coaxes from her the information that she had sex with someone while he was in San Francisco. She persuades him of the fact that he stayed with his ex-gf, and in San Francisco, and had sex with her. The latest discovery is a lie. Two of them make out in the diner, but she decides that they should disperse. Nick heartbroken. <br /> <br /> And we go for Nick, who confesses his problems to the old woman he meets on a park bench, Joey (Carol Kane). Joey is his native country and childish, but it's a good audience for Nick, who needs a nice ear. The two of them go to Coney Island at night and watch the stars. Nick Joey falls under the spell, despite the difference in age between them. They returned to the apartment, Joe, and Nick gradually realizes that he is going to have sex with a crazy old woman. She is on top of it, he does not want to let him go. But he manages to escape. <br /> <br /> (This, incidentally, the best part of Carol Kane, as she played Latke wife in a taxi.) Joey's phone rings, and it's people, calling Psychic partner network and Joey is one of psychic friends. Despite the fact that she is still hurt from Nick, she gradually get into her mental chip. Man in his office late at night and want to have phone sex with her. Despite the fact that this is not a business, Joey, Joey goes ahead and tries to persuade the person to come. She wants to talk, but people want to get off the phone, and learns that he has spent a lot of money from his company, and find out tomorrow. His life is ruined. Joe realizes that the person is going to commit suicide, and she tries to make him believe that she was his friend, that she cares about him. And she really cares about him. <br /> <br /> But the man packs a pistol in his briefcase and goes to look for a prostitute on the Brooklyn waterfront, and we return to the beginning, to the same prostitute, started La Ronde. She wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash, if it would kill him. He tried to commit suicide, but was unable to do so. A prostitute does not want to do it, but he insisted, holding her hand, holding a gun in his mouth, he told her where to aim. In the end, the gun goes off and we see a prostitute walking down the street and come to the corner where she normally does business. The contractor, who did not pay for it before in the movie pulls, rolls out the window. They look at each other. END.
