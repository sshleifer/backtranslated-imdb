Shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of, the film turned out far better than one would expect, of course, much more loyal to the book by Peter O'Donnell and comic book than the previous two films. You can read the tape now in reprints from Titan Books, or Comics Revue monthly. This is one of the biggest adventures of comics of all time. The film is not great, but unlike most of the low-budget movie is making the most of what he got, and it keeps your interest. On a DVD-extras, interviews with Tarantino, who apparently stoned, is a gas. Some people are disturbed Tarentino associate his name with the film, but without it never was. He is a supporter of Modesty Blaise, and chose a good writer and director. All things considered, costs 8 stars.
