Unpretentious, small and thin film "Men in a white suit" another breath of fresh air in a cinematic format with the Ealing studios. Although I suspect that some modern viewers can first find his hide, I doubt that many people would not be charmed by experts plot, theme and characters sluggish relayed during the course. <br /> <br /> A truly great movie Alec Guinness gives another characterization of thin film may not be so obvious virtuosity as Ealing inspired "Kind Hearts and Coronets" since 1949. This time, he just plays one character rather than eight, but not from the world of the inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, he always finds the right tone and expression. Along with the fine, precise performance of Guinness, the rest of the cast are effective. Of the major players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Tesayger really stand out. Thesiger is irresistibly absurd as a cripple, but an influential business grand, while Parker reliable as the more inefficient rod manufacturer and father. Father, that is, Joan Greenwood, in cleverly refined comic actress who is on her insurmountable peak in this film. Shiny and seductive aspect and diction, it is quite sublime in this movie, a great contrast with such unusual, but more uncomfortable Guinness. A scene in which she seemed to be trying to seduce him play so skillfully couple that it is both deep and funny slide ... <br /> <br /> Topics handled very efficiently, without the prostitute shown. The complexity of the relationship between science, business and labor are insightful and fun to discover. Experienced helmets Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically skilled in all areas; memories pictures, fitting sound effects and music and thoughtful script, all is calm impress. . Thoroughly satisfied with the film, with Guinness and Greenwood beautiful <br /> <br /> Rating: - 1/2 **** / *****
