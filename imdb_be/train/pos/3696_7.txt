Although I live in Minnesota, I was in France recently, and came across this quaint gem of the film. <br /> <br /> This film was strange, to say the least. Creative and unique film, different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first instinct is to try to match each of these little stories in the overall storyline, as well as it can be done from 2003 Love Actually. This attempt, however, makes the magic of each segment outdated. When you receive the par value, each of the short sections, taken as its own separate movie, love stories, with a beautiful message to tell <br /> <br /> The film is surprisingly strange sometimes. - often to the point of confusion - and each individual segment can be difficult to follow. However, the observer, who pays close attention to each of the segments, the short story line became clear after a short time. Confusion about intriguing; it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next. It leaves the viewer wondering "Is that really just happen?" But at the same leaves them happy with what he did, indeed, take place. This is a film where the viewer, when you exit the theater, can not really solve if they do it they love to hate it. the initial reaction is to go and watch it over and over again, to see those separate lives merge into a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> interesting decision to make a film that adds up to a multilingual range of people can relate. This adds to the reality of the film - here, American tourists talking in English, French, Parisians, etc. The number of people that the film includes leads to understanding the international language of love <br /> <br /> From disease to the supernatural love of parents for.. the love of the spouses, the film covers all the bases romantic story in its beautiful and quirky way, each unique event as something fell into place to tell the story:. that of all the types, sizes, nationalities and forms of love.
