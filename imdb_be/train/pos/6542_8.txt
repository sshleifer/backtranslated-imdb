Although it is well past the target audience, I've always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so I was naturally intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad film. The central mystery involving long-dead actress presented in simple strokes with the simplified conditions of danger for a young detective. Nancy and her friends will never take the threat seriously, so younger viewers will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> What I really appreciated was the history of the final results were very serious and significant and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great, as Nancy Drew, and hopefully we'll see it again in another mystery.
