I think that James Cameron could become my favorite director, because this is my second review of his films. Anyway, all remember the Titanic. It was a big, fast, and "unsinkable" ... up to April 1912 it was all over the news, and one of the greatest tragedies in the history. Well, James Cameron decided to make a film out of it, but the star the two fictional characters to be the focus, not on the ship. Well, the main review, but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero-fact and only that will attend the event from the film. <br /> <br /> Thus, our two main characters, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They do not irritate too much, but look at it, and you will know why they could be irritating (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain, I think it's bad luck, fate, God's hand (not blasphemy entirely designed), or simply Caledonia Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and you will get! Oh, yes! We get a love story on a sinking ship. The supporting characters are as follows: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (idk it was so good), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), and more. We also got a present day treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They have something to add to this story, something good. The action here is amazing, especially in the second half, the drama is also good. In the end, you can have your eyes dropping showers or silent tears. The story is simple, and it works. Treasure hunter looking for the Heart of the Ocean, and instead finds the image of women wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her the story of the Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class, and ultimately the fate of the ship. All about the history of work and very few disadvantages. Give Titanic, 86% strange
