Along with the "Brothers and Sisters," "Six Degrees" it was one of my favorite new drama autumn of 2006. <br /> <br /> The large cast all around, but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott (the come-back Photographers) and Hope Davis (recent widow of the journalist, who was killed in Iraq). <br /> <br /> In addition to the action, the letter was fresh and perfectly valid. The show was also filmed in New York, a real city, not Warner Bros. full-scale or any other studio, adding an additional layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the latest «Survivor» and other reality garbage. Too bad it did not last.
