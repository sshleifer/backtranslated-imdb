Fond memories David Tomlinson (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie for the first time, I was 4 years old, and I was fascinated by the story of witches in the 2nd World War. A scene that struck me most was the struggle between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was exceptional to see this army of walking without a body to deal with surprised sing their march. This film is fantastic, on a trip to Portobello Road (which was for me the most fantastic place in London) on a trip to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson really fantastic pair. It is always great, it seems like a good theta family and David with his face always surprised it is a great co-hero. we will miss him a lot.
