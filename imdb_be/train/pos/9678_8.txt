It made me wish that my own happy birds could talk. Tisk Fingered on the reviewer who dissed the film. Sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. Paulie is a lovely little treasure. He has quite a few clever lines that really made me laugh. I especially liked the dance sequence during his show business stay. You can forgive the obvious cliche as you cheer him in his quest to be reunited with Marie. Magic movie starring two strong characters who really Befriend a small parrot, separated from his young master. I would like to have seen more of a woman who becomes blind and must give up their mutual journey. I loved her artistic and poetic inspiration, ashamed that she could not share Poly reunification. Bless Paulie in his new home, finally, with Marie, possibly joined by a nice young man who had helped him defeat an antagonist to complete his journey.
