The original animated Dark Knight returns in this ace adventure that rivals fantasy masks in its coolness. There's a lot of style and intelligence in the mystery of Batwoman, much more than the Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. <br /> <br /> there is a new crime fighter in the streets of Gotham. She dresses like a bat, but she is not an adult Batgirl. And Batman has denied any connection with it. At the same time, Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work. . But Penguin, Bain and local Mob makes things a bit more complicated, <br /> <br /> I did not have high hopes, "so to be strongly lowered un, but a weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin ISN» on the signs so much here !), but I was delighted with the creative and exciting set pieces, clever plot and cocky sense of humor. This is certainly not a supporter of the film Batman should be without. Keep your ears open for a really catchy song called "I bet Neva," which figures prominently looping of them. <br /> <br /> This DVD is a shame is not so great. Do not get me wrong, there are some great opportunities (short «Chase Me» is amazing) and very steep Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but ... the film is presented in the Pan and Scan. Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in the 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1, compared with a widescreen clips shown in a particular figure is cut off on both sides. I find it very annoying, given the mask phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen. Warner had to re-release literally dozens of DVD movies, because people complained about the lack of the original aspect ratio available on some titles. Why they decided to make the same mistake, and here for me. <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD 5/5, but the lack of ROA brings the total score to 4/5. It's a shame because it would have completed a large widescreen DVD package.
