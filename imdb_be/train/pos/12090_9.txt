I saw this film when I was 10 or 11 years, one in the basement of my father on Saturday night. He points to the "Chiller Theater" ordinary fright feature that I watched as a young religious, "the UN. Now, I've seen a lot of old horror films through cooling Theater, but no one has ever stuck with me as «Danse Macabre» aka "Castle of Blood." I'm 51 now, and just last year I was lucky enough to find a relatively new, the quality of a DVD-edition of this amazing supernatural Shiver-inducing classics, on reflection, I would never be able to see him again. I've watched it four times, and I can not seem to get tired of it. <br /> <br /> They just do not make ominous movies like this anymore. Haunted Catacombs and fog shrouded graveyard just do not work as well in color, as they have done in black and white so a day. Anyway, this one has Edgar Allen and Barbara Steele, magical shadow, Web-wrap'ed sets the castle ghosts, caring spirits again take their death ... angrily ironic ending. <br /> <br /> IMO, this one is right up there with Robert Wise «The Haunting», «Innocent" (Deborah Kerr), and later «The Others».
