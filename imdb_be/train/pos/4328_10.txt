I bought this DVD version to compare the current version of the BBC in 2005 (which is brilliant). 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopkraft who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy TV, and who died this year (2005). I remember a lot of action, especially with Rigg and Elliot, and moving music. (Music in the 2005 version is much more understated, but very eloquent.) Just to pick up on a couple of other commentators point: Richard Carstone a boyfriend Ada Clare, Sun Esther. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played in any version of Crook, nor he played Esterhase Toby TTSS! Hook plays a comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby plays Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions of the noble and excellent fit large Dickens novel. Now read the book! It is not perfect, and sentimentality can make you wince occasionally, but I defy you not to cry - and laugh!
