This film is fantastic. Finally, well-written characters, which you can enjoy for all their good and bad. Pierce Brosnan flat out hysterical in this modest role. I think it's the best thing he ever did. He made other roles that exhibited shades able to complete the work of this kind, but this role, finally gave him room to work with him. I almost died when he passed through the hotel lobby in shorts and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis as the pair seek, as actors try too. Kinnear is so stupid cute, it's his turn, in the end, really nice. You give good actors a good job, to play, and they give us something more ago.
