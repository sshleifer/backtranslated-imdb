Quick and easy, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As some have mentioned, I too, I'm not from the south, do not really care about country music and never wore a cowboy hat. (I've never ridden in a car with a dead body in the trunk of my too, but I love «Goodfellas».) It's just a wonderful creation of the film. Shot in a ratio of 2.35 of the parties and beautifully transferred to DVD. (The VHS was 1.33 full screen). And so, a solid 5.1 mix for your enjoyment. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's just a great story of love / hate relationship set in Texas, with large overhangs. Travolta is fantastic. Next to the "Pulp Fiction", is the best thing he has done. This was in my top 5 for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Check this one out !!! It is 10 !!!!
