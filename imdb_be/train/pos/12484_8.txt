This movie scared the shit out of me! I must admit that I spent most of the movie to watch through your fingers, but what I saw was very frightening. I screamed loudly two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> The film making wise my favorite aspects were sound and pictures. The sound was especially great and the setting was really awful nice. I read somewhere that it was a strange kind of husband and wife team who have done it. For some reason, that makes it even unfamiliar to me. <br /> <br /> If you love horse racing and fear of scary movies than this one is for you! Very alarming and a great film shoot with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies, curled up on the couch screaming like little girls!
