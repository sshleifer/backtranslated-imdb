The jokes are obvious, the banal gag, and the characters are characatures - but I could not stop laughing at it very enjoyable movie. No matter how many times I see it, I still get a kick out of it, and I highly recommend it to all lovers of mindless entertainment. It contains many Quotable moments, and some of the best viewing-gags I've seen so far. If you had a bad week, and you have to laugh, to rent one on his way home on a Friday night to give your weekend a good start.
