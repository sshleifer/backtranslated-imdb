Homeless (or lack of housing, as shown George Carlin) has been a problem for years, but never plan to help those on the streets, which were once considered to be the person who did all that go to school, to work or vote on this issue. Most people think of the homeless as soon as a lost cause while to worry about such things as racism, the war in Iraq, putting pressure on children to succeed, the choice of technology, inflation, or worry if they are close to end up on the streets. <br /> <br /> But what if you get a bid to live in the streets for a month without any frills, you were once out of the house, entertainment sets, bathroom, painting on the wall, computer, and all you kogda the treasure to see that this is going to be homeless? This is a lesson. <br /> <br /> Goddard Bolt Mel Brooks (Manager), who stars as Bolt plays the rich man who has everything in the world before deciding to make a bet with a rival Sissya (Jeffrey Tambor) to see if he can live on the street for thirty days without the luxury; when Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with the future project to build more buildings. Bet on where the bolt thrown in the street with a bracelet on his leg to follow his every move, where he can not move away from the curb. He nicknamed Pepto a tramp after it is written on his forehead, where Bolt meets other characters, including a woman named Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), former dancer who got a divorce, before losing her home and her friends Sailor (Howard Morris) and smoke (Teddy Wilson), are already being used on the streets. They are survivors. Bolt not. It is not used in order to achieve mutual agreements, as it was once, to be rich, where it is fight or flight, kill or be killed. <br /> <br /> While the bond of love between Molly and Bolt did not have to build, I found the "Life stinks" to be one of the performing Mel Brooks films, where the fact to be a comedy, it shows the delicate side compared to his slapstick work, such as Blazing saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the case to show that it is still something of value before losing it the next day or the other, making a stupid bet all rich people do when they do not know what to do with their money. Maybe they have to give to the homeless rather than use it as Monopoly money. <br /> <br /> Or maybe, this film will inspire you to help others.
