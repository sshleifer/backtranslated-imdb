I saw the perfect Son of about three times. I do not understand how this movie gay film, I'm not even gay, but I do not see how a gay movie. This is a film with a gay character, I can not understand why every movie with a gay character is to be strictly a film about Gaia. I believe that the film is to be sympathetic to the study of death, the death of someone who is your relative. I think Theo turns his life rather quickly after a rehabilitation center, because he wants to, and watching his brother die in front of him makes him rethink his life. I found the dialogue in the scene where Theo Ryan says he's going to be a father to be a very moving, Ryan says he does not want to know about the things that he would never see or share with anyone. Is not it awful and boring? I highly recommend this film.
