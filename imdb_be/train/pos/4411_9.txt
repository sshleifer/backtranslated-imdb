Easy 9 out of 10 for the director of the film, we will continue to grow to admire. But do not watch this movie expecting to be "entertained". Ang Lee takes an objective view of the relatively unexplored aspect of the Civil War. What is beautiful about the film, as well as all Lee films, is that he does not "party" with their characters. He creates characters that embody in their lives, problems and confusion ... and endows them with a reality that is often hits much closer to home than that with which many of them conveniently. This film has the effect, but it is not for the amateur action, as violence is a very disturbing and far from gratuitous ... that is how the characters, it's real. And, as you would expect of one of the most terrible wars of mankind, terrible violence. <br /> <br /> But the study most of human ambiguity, which, of course, living in a civil war, it is a masterpiece. There was a war on slavery and abolitionism? Or seems fully prepared to blur the line went so popular in pictures like blue and gray. Neither of idealism, although, as can be seen from Gone With the Wind. We are talking about freedom, about the desire to have something that is yours, and fight for it. How do you see the characters that you will be asking yourself "how can they fight to save slavery?" The fact is, I do not think they really are, and that the film shows the problem of why so many of them have been caught in the vortex of civil war. <br /> <br /> The fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about the fight of a sense of loyalty to the "home", even though they may never be considered that the house is or whether or not they confess their values. Letter scene is very touching and at the same thin. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limit. And when the voltage finally snaps, and these characters are suddenly "free" ... we see the birth of new people. <br /> <br /> All of this mixed with Li incorporation beautiful environment of humanity with breathtaking views and frames. Has a style that it is something European in the "art" (slow camera, unrushed), Asians in the epic-ness and the development of history, and yet somehow familiar and readily available so much in North Americans. <Br /> <br /> Relax, let go of your preconceptions about what a civil war, that "western" as a genre, which war film should be ... and let Ang Lee takes you into the world is so fragile, so hard, so real that few of we can comfortably see it. <br /> <br /> in this, Lee continues what he has created in the Ice Storm. Again, the film is slow n and no apparent "direction" ... a sure sign of Lee's ability to direct without "imposing" on your history or screen. Its direction is enhanced by the fact that it brings with Jewel (yes, the singer), hitherto untested actress who puts in strange performance. <br /> <br /> A film for those who love the movie and fans of the standard Hollywood epic.
