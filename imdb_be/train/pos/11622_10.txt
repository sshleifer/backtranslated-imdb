Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star in this action / thriller written and directed by the master of suspense, Wes Craven himself. The entire film begins with some kind of trouble in The Lux Atlantic, a Miami hotel. The problem is fixed by Lisa Reisert, a hotel manager. Then she goes to the airport, and that's where all the problems started. She meets Jackson Rippner, who does not like to call from Jack name Jack the Ripper, if you know that you have it and I have in mind. Then they sit in the plane, and crazy enough, Rippner Reisert and sit next to each other. Over the next hour, Lisa terrorizes, bothered, and in horror from Rippner. I will not give anything away. Then we go back to where Jack chases Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa comes to her house to see if her father well, and quite mad, Rippner already have. There is almost twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout this scene. A total of about 25 minutes of intense action occurs at the end. <br /> <br /> Not only cinema intense, but it was a big portion of it. As I said, I will not give anything, because it's so shocking and exciting i anxiously / frightening. And acting on each character in the film, even those with no lines at all, everything was pitch perfect. It was unbelievable. Everything was awesome in this movie! Action, music, effects, make-up, directing, editing, recording, everything was fine! Wes Craven, of course, the master of suspense. Red Eye, definitely a must-see and definitely worth spending the money. You can watch this movie over and over and over again, and it will never ever sad. <br /> <br /> Red-Eye, I have to say that it is better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The original rating MPAA: PG-13: Some intense sequences of violence, and language <br /> <br /> My Rating MPAA: PG-13: Some very intense sequences of violence, and language <br / > <br /> My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, frightening scenes, Disturbing Content
