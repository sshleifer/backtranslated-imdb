This is not a film for those who like the usual horrible Lynch material. Most likely, this is for those who either appreciate a good story, or tired of ordinary things with an open sentimentality and frames-ish "This is such a wonderful movie, you have to see it!" - semantics (intent she is right this time!) . <br /> <br /> The story unfolds flawlessly, and we made along the way, which I think most of us would have to admit at some point. Compassionate, existentialist journey where we atone for our past, when approaching ourt imminent death. <br /> <br /> Acting without a glitch, cinematography and (sometimes quite brilliant!), and the dialogue leaves enough only to see to understand the details od history. <br /> <br /> warm film. Not too sentimental.
