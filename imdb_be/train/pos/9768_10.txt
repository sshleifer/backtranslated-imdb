This is the best piece of film ever created his master piece, which brought a tear to my eye. I will never forget my experience to view it. I do not understand why people do not think I dinosaur turns into a spectacle, reminiscent of DeNiro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface, and Crowe in Gladiator, combined. It should be released on DVD in Superbit format, so I can fully enjoy it as it was intended to enjoy, if they are made and filmed it. Whoppi Goldberg really is by living as a tough, rough cop who against her will, has teamed up with a hot shot of a dinosaur as its partner, the hi-jinx follows, to put it mildly. By the way, I am the complete opposite of what is the truth, this film is full of garbage.
