I first saw this film 3 years ago, and it was introduced and then the main Disney and Eisner real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago, he was back on TV, and this time I have it taped. Since then, I must have watched it at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a great, inspired, feel good film that intelligently written, acted and believable all concerned. She resists going for every sentimental trick in the book, as well as all the other cliches. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to see a movie where the kids are not jerks and have a whole bunch of behavioral problems, and jocks entirely portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads. <br /> <br /> it's just normal people who have a dream, like you and me <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood is left at the other extreme, what they call "gritty realism", making movies where all curses, and has problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This film is about a man who has a dream, and encouraged friends and family to pursue this dream. People in big lake TX seem so imposing that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not try to go overboard with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappoints. I watched him from the end of the 70s, and it is so underrated. <br /> <br /> But this film has excellent performances from all stakeholders, as well as the prestige of the authors. <br /> <br /> The jewel in the film near the end, when Jim practiced in the dugout before the big game, and his wife refers to him from the stands. He runs and reaches out to his family. A look at the faces of the three pitchers, sitting on a bench in the dugout is priceless. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a change of pace, then select the movie up.
