Oh, my God. This film really does show the talents of actors. Billy Connolly flex his acting muscles. Really amazing person, if you look at him as a rebel Absolution, The Boondock Saints like crazy / killer, and then, finally, Fido, like a zombie! His character Fido look cute with a terrible, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Anne Moss NO hack anything! Jumps in the career of the Matrix and Momento as a dark character, in the heart of the warm-conservative 1950s housewife! Rare these days to see an actor able to not type cast. HN <br /> <br /> Who storyline (NO spoilers, do not worry). This film will make Max Brooks (Author Guide Zombie Survival & World War Z) happy with joy! Finally, well done and the zombie comedy twist. <br /> <br /> If you love zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you're just bored, or if you are too busy to go to see this movie!
