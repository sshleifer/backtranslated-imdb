I saw this film when I was about 7 years old - that was 33 years ago - and I will never forget this movie! I was deeply touched and moved brave young boy and a beautiful eagle. And I just could not believe it when he turned to the eagle only when everyone in the theater, he was going to die ... <br /> <br /> My sister was in a movie with me, and I recently asked her if she I remember the movie we were watching the boy and an eagle, and she said that she remembered, as we have seen it only yesterday. So it's not just me <br /> <br /> This film is a must see !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget. - as well as my sister and I ...
