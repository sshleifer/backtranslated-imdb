I enjoyed the series Criminal Intent Law & Order for a long time. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, female detective is quite difficult, and feeling a little bitter in the criminal intent of the series. See her other side in this film. <br /> <br /> This film shows the softer side of this amazing talented actresses, and if you're a fan of the criminal intent of the film is rampant in its actions, and you get a pretty darn good yarn of family difficulties, to the south of the country. <br /> <br /> I did not want Albert Finneys role in this film, because he did such a convincing job acting senior fellow of the South, which is hard-headed and intolerant and unaccepting changes. He reminds me of so many people from my youth, and the image magically, but you will probably find it difficult to like in this film. <br /> <br /> Katryn Erbe easy as in this film, and why I would recommend it as 10 stars for Criminal Intent, Law & Order fans.
