I just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out. Toby Malone performance really stood out, I found that really care about what's going on with Matt throughout the film, which in itself is a very fun, very Pacey with a good mix of well-rounded characters, a great achievement, considering it is a short course of time. There are many good turns for how well it will keep you guessing until the end. Other characters to follow are quite deranged Little and mean attractive Jesse. He may not have a huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster, but do not let this put you off, you could do a lot worse than check it out, you will not regret it. Fun. 7/10
