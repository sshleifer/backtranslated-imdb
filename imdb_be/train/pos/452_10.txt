Lovely and sunny, gentle and calm, kind and charming, it's like a ray of sunshine on the face during the spring time, when you want to close your eyes and smile, and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. This is a film that really influenced my life. I watched it in difficult times, when I was lost, unhappy and lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events, and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about himself. That helped me regain my optimism and hopes that things can be changed, and all things are possible. I promised myself that no matter what I would get me out of misery and self-pity, and I would be grateful for every moment of life - with its joy and sorrow ... I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later I did this year, and I was not alone. <br /> <br /> Charming, charming and touching, "Enchanted April" is one of the best films ever made, and my eternal love. This little film of the highest quality diamond.
