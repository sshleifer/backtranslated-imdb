Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is the magnificent Jane never, and will never be more than one lush. It is visually stunning. That aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film. This is a great movie. He not only has a classic Tarzan aura, but also a sense of the ongoing saga. We become associated with two white hunters who are looking for ivory, one of them is in love with Jane, another fraudulent catalyst, the nature of which may be one of the most reliable and the most studied in the film history.And these characteristics, which makes it a great action movie stand out as classics. There inconvenient racism that depicted. However, Africans are portrayed as people, and in the end, the two even be more heroic than the white hunters, and distinguished as such. In fact, no one is named, probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters. Finals, is also one of the reasons to enjoy this film. Huge lion attack never duplicated, and horror are well aware of the nature of the reactions to a greater extent than the modern gore movie will do with a graphic pattern. If I left something, it's because I do not want to dirty picture for those who have not seen it. But this is all that you would like in the movies.
