Lovely gentle comedy gem until the last five minutes, which degenerated into perspective mill British television farce. The last five minutes cost him 2 points in my rating. Despite this basic plot and style flaw, it's worth looking at the nature of the action and the unique atmosphere of Cornwall. Many different small pieces, to savor, as tense eternity we all go through, waiting for the approval of the bank after the clerk swiped credit cards ... make it more spicy, if we do not - quite - that the card has not increased.
