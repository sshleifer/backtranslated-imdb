I really liked "The revolution will not be televised." This gave me more time, a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to manage. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in Venezuela, twenty percent of the rich people have made all the decisions for eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, if their coup failed; after an interim government dissolved the Supreme Court and the Constitution and the Ombudsman, and the electoral board and all civil rights, no one took the accomplice of the barn where he shot them. They do not even go to jail. The main conspirators live in Florida, carrying on. And the protection that they had been "Bolivarian Constitution" adopted by the majority of the Venezuelan people. This is not only a story that bites. Democracy can give you one hell of a clip, if you let him loose. And in Venezuela, it's free.
