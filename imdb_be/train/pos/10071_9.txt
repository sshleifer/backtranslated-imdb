If tradition dictates that the artist must convey their great skills and magic in the heir to the aging and very proud street performer, known to all as "The King of Masks" is becoming desperate for a young man, a disciple accept and develop. <, Br /> <br /> his warmth and humanity, tho, find it to pay a few dollars for the little man, displaced by devastating natural disasters in China, in this case, massive flooding in 1930. <br /> <br /> He takes his new 7-year-old companion, on a straw houseboat to live with it valuable and beautiful monkey, «General», only to discover that he is a child, she and her child. <br /> <br /> instantly transformed his life, as the love he feels for the little slave becomes intertwined in stupifying tradition which demands that he gave his only art on the young man. <br /> <br /> There are many stories in this one ... it touches many people, and culture of China opens itself to our Western eyes to watch. Thousands of years of heritage boil down to a glass of water, drama, and few people will leave this DVD for dry eyes. <br /> <br /> The very technical transfer is not as big as I found the sound level around the meter, and can actually see the video transmission line in several parts of the movie. Highly recommend :-) 9/10 stars.
