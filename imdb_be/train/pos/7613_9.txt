/ The first episode I saw lost made me think, I thought it was for people who hit and get chased by a giant monster. But it's not, it's much more than that, because they are not a monster at all, and each episode, you see Lost, and it gets better every time. deserted island with an underground bunker, and especially the relationship between the people who intersect with each other, before they fell. That's the real secret. Rules <br /> <br /> This series, and I can not wait to see what's really going on out there, I hope they do not last 2 episodes airing in theaters, this series deserves a 9 out of 10
