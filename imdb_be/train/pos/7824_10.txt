As someone old enough knows, South Africa have long suffered under the vile, racist oppression of apartheid, which is completely subjugated Black population. One of the most prominent anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko was, who was killed in prison. After the murder, the reporter Donald Woods was trying to get a message to the world of Biko. <br /> <br /> The «Cry Freedom", Woods (Kevin Kline) is friends Biko (Denzel Washington), before the latter was arrested on trumped-up charges. If Woods is trying to spread the word BIKO, he and his family begin to live under the threat of attack, and they were finally forced to flee the country. Gut wrenching last scene shows the police firing on protesters. <br /> <br /> As one of the two films (along with the "World Apart"), which helped galvanized anti-apartheid movement, «Cry Freedom» stands out as perhaps the best job for all participants.
