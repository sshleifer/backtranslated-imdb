"Man on the Moon" is quite a good movie. It is very touching at times and very well done in every way. I would not say that the movie was very original, but that these days? <br /> <br /> All the actors did a great job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age, and does a pretty good job. Jason London does an excellent job as well. And the only person I knew Sam Waterston, who has done a fantastic job with his role. I really liked the character of Sam (Matthew rags) a lot. At times he seemed to be parents if you are afraid of, but in the end you really like his character. The rest of the cast was very good as well. <br /> <br /> If you are in a moving film about growing up and deal with what life throws at you, then you should see this movie. I suggest to read the plot synopsis, and if this sounds like something you would be interested in, and then go for it. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
