I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and had no idea if I did a bad or a good purchase. It was later the outcome of my viewing the film from start to finish. Michelle Rodriguez (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne," "05, gave a performance and it looks beautiful, sexy, and, at the same time, the actual research in this area, as the action really performed. Diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he had given her mother. She decides to undergo training in boxing at a local Brooklyn gym, and not very well accepted by the male boxers. in her high school has a lot of friction between her classmate and steam room. there is a lot of action in the women's bathroom and links I to the private parts of men. If you like boxing, and seeing hot sexy gal to do a miracle in the wheel and knocked the boy to them, you know that this is a movie for you.
