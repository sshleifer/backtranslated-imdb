This interest-free adaptation of the novels by Clarence Mulford; Willaim lovers Boyd movies probably feel a bit in the sea here (and the reviews here so far reflect this). But I knew Hopalong of the novels of the first, and never cared much for Boyd movies once I got around them <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made the right choice. - he did not nostalgic "West"; Instead, he turned to the history of Cassidy as a slice of what we used to call "Americana"; or, that the older critics once called "homespun" How to tell the film, I found that more and more like the great "the Hallmark Theater. "version of Mark Twain's" Roughing It, "with James Garner narrativization. <br /> <br /> Both of these films remind us that while movies about the" old west "will probably always be mythical for the Americans, they do not should be "westerns" ;. They may very well be the only films that marked s to be an American at this time, in this place <br /> <br /> I never feel indulged, watch this movie, there is no effort to bury the legacy Boyd-Cassidy down our throats, wholly ironic, Sun Camp. so I get the sense of the characters he plays - or ride - for some real western America, I might as well go through a hundred years ago <br /> <br /> Given that the flat film -. it positively avoids anything we They became known as the "style" - it's all his favor; and the plain of the performers action fits in with it; Gosh, it really feels like some told around a campfire on the cattle drive - no visual refueling only oddity and good humor - and the sudden violence - what we expect from a good adventure story yarn. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and if the viewer sets aside encultured expectations, he or she will find a lot of pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I would give this film a 9-stars, but I'll give him ten times, because most observers here missed the point completely; and I encourage them to establish their own memories of Boyd aside and give this film one more chance <br /> <br /> Note 1 :. The reviewer complained that Hopalong shoots man dead in the film and not to shoot the gun with their hands (a la Cassidy Boyd); First, Cassidy does shoot dead in the novels; second, when Cassidy was a true cowboy, he would have shot the person died - a problem with shooting guns out of the hands of people that they can always get another gun -., who happens to be part of the subtext of the film <br /> <br / > Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the family Coppola, that they have a director of «The Godfather» among them, who can get them every opportunity to do movies that I can not; but a good film is a good film; and it's a good movie. If it's someone named "Coppola", well, that's just how it is. America is the land of opportunity (or was until Bush was in office) - is that great American novel all.
