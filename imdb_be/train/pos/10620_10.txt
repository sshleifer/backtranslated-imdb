After a first viewing, I found this story to be at least less irritable than other tales Cannon film. After many others, I think this is one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty bad, especially the song about love, but two things stand out that make movies, even singing, standing. One is the artistic direction. Like other fairy tales Cannon film is a beautifully designed part of the period; Each piece of fabric and values ​​(both of which are essential parts in the plot of this movie) looks fresh and new, and the contrast with the plain-clothed peasants. Even during a love song that I find myself studying dresses and princess hair perfectly done. Another thing comic timing. Many movies cheesy, but the emperor's vanity (and make fun of yourself, after all), suspect the security guard, security guard minting Nicholas and stupid prince, it was pretty funny, and seems to be funny at all on purpose, and sequence during the song Weave-O It makes for songs that were not so good.
