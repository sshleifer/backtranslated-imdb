In complete contradiction to another review of the opinion that the film was actually surprisingly good! Reluctantly, I went to see him, and as expected, it will be boring clich√©, obvious jokes and replays, all of which promise to the trailer. <br /> <br /> However, 5 minutes later, I discovered that really refreshing laugh and enjoy acting. With only one "toilet humor" gag, Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with a really funny script, and without spoiling anything too much, some of the things associated with fun animals. <br /> <br /> the main ingredients of a good movie are all there; the script, the director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands tall. <br /> <br /> Of course, you're not going to know anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will be more likely to have a good time!
