How can you not appreciate this film with 10/10? I admit, to say that this movie is not very interesting, but the goal is not to tell you the story, but the story! This is the first 'real' history of cinema film ( `Le Prince de Galles' was the first, but it was not enough ?? technically perfect), and this, of course, is of great international importance. These are people who you can see the finishing time in the movie had the opportunity to participate in a historic moment, becoming the first person to be able to see yourself moving! And above all shot beautiful shot! And it's very touching when you think of the first persons have seen that! What a moment! Historical Sciences for the first (since the Lumiere brothers invented the first Cin√©matographe for scientific purposes) and for art later. appreciate the movie!
