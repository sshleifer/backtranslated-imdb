Just caught him at the International Film Festival in Toronto. It's a good story told in an attractive way. Manual approach scenes cameras added to the intensity of the scenes (in a documentary style, not Blair Witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a big budget to make an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, especially the actor who plays in the spotlight events in the film, Boz.
