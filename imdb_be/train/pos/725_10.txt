Nazi main Miss Togar (Mary Raven, who lensing by an expert photographer Dean Candy, as if it was ten feet) has a plan to turn it into a high full square. Complications that arise to challenge this purpose wonderful rock'n'roller Riff Randell (PJ Soles, which lights up the screen - it has hot BOD, too), which is an obsessive fan of the punk band The Ramones. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose large frame glasses and brake part can not hide her incredible beauty) is teaming up with Riff, to put an end to the alleged murder of rock'n'roll crisis for good, it is desirable that the mission in Togar. <, Br /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a fun role as Tom Roberts, success in everything, but to be put. Kate Tom..if mind only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it. Clint Howard almost steals the film (to be honest, who can steal this film from Soles?) How Eaglebauer, «supplier», who can get anything. His office is in the toilet boy! Paul Bartel and paddle as a music teacher, who becomes an ally of Riff, if he enjoyed the concert The Ramones. <br /> <br /> High School raucous fuss that defies all the rules normalcy..and I loved him. It's like someone just says, "Let's make life more fun for 1 ½ hours." The film is really the story anarchy..a less havoc with love worshiping Ramones with all his heart (even if they are terrible actors, they have the opportunity to get a new audience with the film). <br /> <br /> ending pretty much sums up the film as whole..Riff and her classmates take for high school and begins a massive party. Frankly, I do not want the party to end! Not the usual in any way, this film just let loose madness. Accompanied by a large rock soundtrack featuring some of the best songs of The Ramones, this film allows the viewer to take time in life when the war is not dominated headlines and people just had a good time. Those, I think, were the days.
