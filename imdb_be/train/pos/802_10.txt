I know, I know, it was a good ending, but frankly it was awesome. I love when the movie ends stunning dark nature, but this time I was struck by Darth Vader turn against the Emperor, I was really impressed. The sequence in this film was painful when Luke torture and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. He's going to be destroyed, if Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, removes his dark master. A good victim. The cinematography of the film is impressive. I was surprised with all the vessels ships Rebel Battle and all ships and Imperial War Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought in the MES screen Calomari, Ewoks, in sullesteian (pilot with Lando) and a lot more ... Most of my favorite scenes in the movie: 1 If Vader destroys the Emperor and mortally wounded, 2 When Luke sees the spirit of Obi -Private and Yoda, and then it shows Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the biggest scene in Star Wars) 3- If Leia slays Jabba the Hutt suppresses crime lord. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the script and the Battle of Endor, representing ground and space combat, and the best match between Star Wars Darth Vader Vs Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-script: Scenes with Leah in a controlled bikini unforgettable. 9/10.
