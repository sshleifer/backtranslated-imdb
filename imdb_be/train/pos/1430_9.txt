It plays in our theater in Amsterdam, and the movie we wanted to see was sold out, so we went for it, other than that nothing about it was a documentary about the world without knowing it. We were very happy, we have the misfortune as it was a very powerful film about the life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the world's people. This movie has some of the most spectacular photos I've ever seen in a movie, and took my seat from the desert to the rain forest and the ocean is reflected things that I had never seen in film, television and book! "Earth" is a film that every student needs to see before they will be exhausted. I will encourage my niece to see this movie because it will inherit the planet we leave it. It is also a movie to see at the cinema or a very large TV, as the photo is so powerful and exotic.
