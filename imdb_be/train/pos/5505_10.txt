This is something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup d'etat and several Irish documentary filmmakers are right inside it. <br /> <br /> democratically elected president, who uses his power to bring literacy to his people, and encourages them to read the constitution slander private media openly, like a dictator, mentally unbalanced, the new Hitler, etc. without echoes from governments (like, say, silence them with bullets and other traditional methods of dictatorship). Oh, and they still claim that they are suppressed, of course. <br /> <br /> Look at how the media gloating about their own role in the coup on television after they overthrew the government with the help of rouge generals (how much more stupid can you get ??). <br /> <br /> and see how the people of Venezuela to go to the palace, holding the constitution in their hands, and reinstall the elected government. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it really happened, against the explicit wishes of the USA. Documentary historical masterpiece, shot from the center of action, sharp and very uncomfortable for the main supporters of the coup: the good, democratic, freedom-loving, benevolent US (which still send large sums of money on political opponents of Chavez). <br /> <br /> It is also very interesting and exciting. 10 points.
