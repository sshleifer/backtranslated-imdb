This smooth and rough film sequentially delivers. This is one of the best and most underrated films Frankenheimer and is easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you're scratching your thinking head, "but I loved Get the kid" You have to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures " feeling "for the characters of Leonardo better, John Glover 52 PICK-UP. Moving stories from Detroit (novel) in Hollywood (the film) is building the sleaze factor to the amazing story heights. be a man, have a few beers and watch the film. in reference to my favorite Leonard book: Swag, P m Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primitive and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite movies include Frankenheimer's Seconds and The Manchurian Candidate. I also have a real special place in my cold, cinema hearts to DEAD BANG and Black Sunday.
