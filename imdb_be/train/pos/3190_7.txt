This is your standard musical comedy from the '30s, with the big advantage that it has some well-known' 30s actor. <br /> <br small cool cameos in /> There is not a lot of history, and basically the film is all about his fun and generally a "no worries" of the atmosphere, with a typical Hal Roach comedy touch to it. Appereantly a "Cinderella story", but I certainly did not think of this as while watching a movie. History gets very confusing to the narrator, which shows a lot of different characters, as well as many small episodic when the main characters were the Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the highlight of the film, when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines. It's like watching a movie and get Laurel & Hardy short with him for free. As Laurel and Hardy regular Walter Long makes an appearance in a routine and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as director of the short. <br /> <br /> It is certainly true that all the cameo's and distract from the plot of the storyline and character, but in this case it is not a problem, since it is constantly way more fun and interesting to see what storyline and shallow typical protagonist. <br /> <br /> film is certainly no worse than any of his other genre films of the same period of time, although the rating here would suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
