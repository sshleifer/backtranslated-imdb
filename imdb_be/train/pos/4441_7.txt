Well, before we look at, I have to ask why it is not listed on an individual basis? It may simply be a TV point in Italy, but also overseas supporters Lambert Bova is its own movie. In America, the film is distributed on VHS and DVD as either a "man-eater" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know that this has nothing to do with the "demons" but one of the cast and crew. But yes, I personally was disappointed that it was so hard to find on this site, which is otherwise so useful. <br /> <br /> And finally, let's look at «The Ogre». I saw the trailer for this a lot of times on YouTube and honestly found it quite scary. The film itself (this is a feature, so make it a movie) has a lot of a lot of strong parts, and could not scare. I was unhappy with the last act, but in general I do not regret that I bought a DVD before seeing it (available from the Show squeal). I think the TV movie explains the origin of the last act. . I will not give any spoilers <br /> <br /> The plot is a little sign: American horror writer rested in the ancient castle of ghosts with her husband and son, only to find it exactly resembles the setting of his childhood nightmares. There are faint echoes of "The Shining", but this is a different brand of supernatural horror. Woman (Virginia Bryant) is more and more evidence that this is real life place her nightmares, but her husband did not believe her. Great atmosphere and the next horror. <br /> <br /> a few were quite bizarre nightmare sequences. Ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a bit of the resurrection of Uncle Frank's first «Hellraiser». There are also a few good punches and well done underwater scenes. I give them props, the film never stooped imitating American films with similar concepts, namely: "A Nightmare on Elm Street." "Cannibal" is the original. And he was a monster scary one, when he was presented correctly. <br /> <br /> On the screeching Show DVD has interviews Lamberto Bova, where he carefully noted that this is not part of his classic "" Demons series. It also gives a lot of credit to the real castle, which the film was made. In fact, this plant contributes a lot to the movie. Music by Simon Boswell helps too. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good things here. "Maneater" is not perfect, but it is very much worth a look. Take it Lambert Bova less achievement.
