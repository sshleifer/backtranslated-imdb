It is the story that could happen anywhere in fact, given the right circumstances. Street entertainers attracted the attention of a famous opera star and friendship moved. Aging is an entertainer / buy a male child, to convey his art. From there, we follow them through the rigors of their complex, but free life along the river. Traveling from town to town, he meets and has a certain degree of popularity. Despite the time and influence, a good man and a good one. <br /> <br /> In general, the performance of the first course, especially Xu Zhu, who draws a street performer. Child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful, and just the same strong, and can withstand the obvious prejudices well. The two main characters, along with support for help from polite opera singer, master Liang (interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting story about forgiveness, sorrow and love. Some mentioned the resemblance of the film BA WANG BIE CO (Farewell My Concubine); while this film may not be easy to own, any resemblance is remote at best. <br /> <br /> My only qualm with the KING OF MASKS, is the end. He was weak, clich√© and as subtle as a sledgehammer. Viewers have wrapped up in the story that it was a manipulation for itself? What a shame. In order to bring an excellent picture of the motion that far, only to surrender to the emotional (and banal) enthusiasm like this. He openly made this film a good and classic, it had to be. That aside, the king MASK still very well worth your time. I was glad to see the Shaw Brothers still give good films. Highly recommended.
