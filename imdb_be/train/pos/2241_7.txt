Another comedy about an ambitious small country struggling through the jungle of modern (for the forties) global world only cleverness and pluck to guide them, is a great entry into the gun Ealing. Terry-Thomas sparkles as usual, in the lead as the formless service people brought to the brink of disaster, when people allegedly responsible for launches, attracting the interest of the world, Ian Bannen makes a great romantic lead, Peter Sellers puts one of his quietest acted as and corrupt politics uber-Suave John Le Meserer plays against type as a durable revolutionary leader. Lots of fun was all, especially the viewer; perhaps not in the upper echelon of the classic Ealing, but quite high.
