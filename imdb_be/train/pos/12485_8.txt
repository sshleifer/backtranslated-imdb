I just watched this movie and I must say that I was very impressed. This is a very horrible and has a lot of moments that make you jump out of the saddle! I had to smoke a few "extra" cigarettes on the way to calm your nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that, perhaps, if anything, there was too much time of the jump. It got to the point where each new stage has finished with a jump, and it is gradually removed a striking effect, because you seem to be new, that will come. <br /> <br /> Though it contains almost all the clich√©s in the genre of the ghost, they were all so good, that he maintained a terrible fear factor. It had elements glow 6th Sense and substitution (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of substitution). <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend it anyone looking for a good old-fashioned fright!
