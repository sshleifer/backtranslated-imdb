The first time my best friend and I sat down to watch the film, we watched it for Alex Winter "Bill & Ted" fame. We did not know what to expect, except for who and what they mean. <br /> <br /> By the time the film ended, we knew that it was love at first sight. This film, though not quite historically accurate, was and is one of the best in its genre. I've seen other films that show the history of this famous summer and, in my opinion, none of the others can not match. She lied a bit in some parts, but these parts do not take away from the sheer elegance and romance stories. I've seen other movies this summer, and I think most of them to be good, but no one with such enthusiasm as this one. <br /> <br /> «Haunted Summer" does not possess the qualities of the painting. The colors and settings, it seems like something you would find on canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of houses in the eccentric. The costumes were gorgeous and, despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world, I wanted to find a seamstress to create a dress for themselves. the entire film was set on the picturesque lake Geneva (where I hope one day to go, because I see this film) and serenity that found there these historical figures. <br /> <br /> In this video, besides the spa oh we found all run away from sharp England judgment fad that surrounded this adventure as well. Yes, there were drugs. This was a fairly common practice at this time, a time when drugs were not illegal. And taking laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was the drug, as well as rest. Shelley suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered pain clubbed foot. It was not surprising that it would be strong prescription drugs that were at their disposal during the summer. And they were poets at a time when the experience was a key. There was no time for caution prim. Passion and experience were a big part of the Romantic period. And with the thoughts and discussions of science, religion and philosophy, came the creation of the legend: "Frankenstein» <br /> <br /> So, in this film we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (Single Shelley at the time) plays the beautiful and talented Alice Krige. It is a control factor to everything that happens, until it, too, is not inferior to the experience. But it is worth their land and experience things on their own terms. As the power that she had inherited from her mother and father. <br /> <br /> actors and actresses, it was perfect for the part they played. Music fitting. Direction captures the essence of summer, I read about it. This film was based on the excellent book "Haunted Summer" Anne Edwards. If you like this movie, read a book. The author takes the story of what she was able to collect from the actual magazines Mary Godwin Shelley, and other participants in this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (even small errors from time to time) and the Gothic romance and from, then this movie is for you. It shows the birth of a monster birthday, which even today teaches us about morality, "Playing God". <br /> <br /> Some must see movie!
