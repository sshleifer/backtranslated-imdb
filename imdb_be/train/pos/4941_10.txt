I think that a lot of people down the rating of the film, not because of lack of quality. But it does not follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some conflicts are not solved. The ending is just a little too real for others, but a journey of rich characters and provide a long list of supporters is both thoughtful and very interesting. Even the cinematography is excellent considering the conditions of the city, direction is also an excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> It's in my book 10, the film will be a place for you normal and expected a Hollywood script will not. They took some risks and do a few things differently. I think it worked well, I deliberately tried to avoid any direct reference to the movie, because to see it for yourself is the best answer, not taking someone else's interpretation.
