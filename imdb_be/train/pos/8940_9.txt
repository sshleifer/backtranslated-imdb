Autobiography, on which this film is based is one of the most heartbreaking books I have ever read. He tells the amazing story of two sisters who both have received devotion and respect that work well into their 70s as a teacher and a dentist, and then lived another 30 years, with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with its very nuanced performance of the role of the rebel "Black" certainly dentist. It not only expresses her anger, sadness, and wisdom, good; it allows you to know exactly where they come from using the words of the economy. Diahnn Carroll looks older sister, teacher, down fine, but I'm afraid that it will never make me believe that it is more than 100. No matter - the history, well worth talking about. Madigan little too extreme and compulsive acting depressed and insecure in the first half of the film, as a reporter Caucasian NY Times. It is also only a minor distraction. Stories, all true, engaging and even two or three received minor injuries in the translation, most of them do it through very well. <br /> <br /> I recommend this book as a must-read for all people, that I recommend any books. I can not really, but that's TV-movie in this rarefied air, but it certainly captures enough taste to be very useful in its own right.
