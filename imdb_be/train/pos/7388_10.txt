74th Oscar was very good. Whoopi work as an entertainer was very funny, and light. I personally loved it last Apperance, get some cold reviews of rough language and lewd jokes, but that's okay. The audience seemed to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen, Sidney Poitier did this Oscar telecast to remember. <br /> <br />
