"The Navy of the man" is, as other comments have shown a rare and well-removed look at the fleet is lighter than air (LTA) operations. LTA crews were rightly proud of the fact that convoys are shaded never lost a ship to submarine attack. And shooting in different places NAS provide valuable insight on the type of aircraft, it has long passed. Nevertheless, the first half of the film is all about Beery, his relationship with his friends, the service, and meeting the character Tom Drake and his mother, and get a leg Drake fixed. Only after this second start of the film. The second film in the main LTAS in action, taking on above-water submarine guys are killed and much damage. Appearance quite gritty and realistic, I think. Then we come to the South-East Asia. Is Navy has LTAS there? Nothing, this part is really wild, with airships used to extract some battered flight of the jungle. A Jap shoot like crazy. Shades of Vietnam, except for the flight is oh, do not hurry. This is what we are talking about the airship. After all, good health WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war.
