quote Nicholas Martin (nicmart) of Houston, Texas'. The thin film, but the DVD "reformatted for TV", April 8, 2002 - It's a magical and emotional film On the other hand, DVD I bought was "fit to reformat TV" on lumps at Columbia Tristar. There is no excuse for the failure of the film in widescreen format, except that Hollywood considers all films as stupid, disposable garbage that he was so used to the production. What a shame.
