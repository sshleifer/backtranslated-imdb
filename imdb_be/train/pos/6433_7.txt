Several posters Renoir quoted expressing his desire to make a film that shows Ingrid Bergman smiling at the camera. The short answer is we are not all as grim reality is that very few have to do it. At this stage of his career, Bergman could not be arrested; in 1949, she left Hollywood to take a picture in Europe, fell director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but within a year, after making it to Renoir, she was back where she belonged to Oscar to download for Anastasia. It is one of three films Renoir made in color at this time, and on balance it was better than the Golden Coach, which is not difficult, and even the French Can Can. Renoir, probably thought that so much going for it, Bergman could walk away with a pair of wooden leading men and Renoir took two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on real events in the history of France, but Renoir content to give him once more-easily and concentrate on replicating paintings his father created after setup. In their pastel colors reminiscent of another period film Les Grandes Manouvres which is not a bad thing. In general, there is a pleasant trifle, showing a beautiful and charismatic actress.
