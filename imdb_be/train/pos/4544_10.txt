Well, I know that I would not like this film, but I do. With an attractive interpretation of Pat Morita, the Japanese stereotype of an irritant cry Jay Leno, I laughed during this movie.As long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, it's a good MVIE. <br /> <br /> my favorite part Morita talking to his boss in Tokyo drinking runner.
