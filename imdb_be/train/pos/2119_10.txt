"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the greatest film director Ernst Lubitsch films. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Sallavan, it is filled with a stunning cast of the best character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart .They're type of character actors that Hollywood has, unfortunately, no longer hires. In fact, the film itself is a kind of movie that Hollywood does not do more. (Creators of "You've Got Mail" claim that their film will be a remake, but this is not only a lot of bloated self praise.) In any case, if you have love for romantic comedies of the 1940s, you will find "The Shop Around the Corner" does not It should be different as well. Just as well with repeated viewing. Enjoy!
