almost every review of this movie I saw was very bad. It's not too bad, it's actually pretty good, though not great. The character of Judy Garland could get annoying, but she would not let him. Somewhere along the line, I became a fan of brooding, powerful, replays Van Heflin, at least in the early 40s. Judy singing is great, but the movie has released a great chance, not showing more of their relationship. I gave it a 7.
