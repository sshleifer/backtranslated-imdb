Panic vile little gem of a movie - do you think that he realized in the first half only to realize, with great pleasure that Henry bromellite much better writer / director than that. <br /> <br /> The film builds slowly, one quietly devastating scene after another, all took quite a William H. Mays, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the most beautiful child actor I've seen in a long time, David Dorfman, the son of Mace, who delivers his lines as if they are completely unprepared thought created in his mind. Rich and rewarding, this film will stay with you long after the credits rolled.
