Sweet and very charming film, Shall We Dansu? He made me laugh and cry. At first appearance, Sugiyama-san - it was not very attractive - worried salaryman, seemingly devoted to his family, but all too easily captivated by the face in the window. The object of his obsession with a distant and cold. But by the end of the film, I was in love with him, she was his wife and daughter, all dance teachers and dance students. This uncomplicated story of transformation and upgrade a little gem that I like to see again.
