I watched this movie, expecting what I got: a good science fiction cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with very limited role <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to operate under these two restrictions :. You hardly any dialogue, because you play hardass, military robot, you can not show emotions through facial expressions! Howzat? Curious how to ask the divine to accomplish a great aria while plugged and tape. Although the words and expressionally handcuffs, Russell takes an incredible response. His robot becomes a man, despite the difficulties. ! Much work <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs guarantees that he will be remembered as a great portrayer of villains finished - the one you would like to see and quartered. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, and beautiful mother. I'm not sure how my impression based on her actions and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take your eyes from it. Unfortunately, Busey role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Most of the story is completely standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but as it is a science fiction comic feeling, I do not understand what happened to some weaknesses. By the end of the story the good guy wins, and grateful listener receives a large emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> Rod feeb, who thinks that Russell did not do a good job of acting the same form feeb missed the whole point.
