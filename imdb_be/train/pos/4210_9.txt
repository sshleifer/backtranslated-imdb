I really enjoyed this film. All aspects of the film are the highest quality, including the most important thing, for me anyway, the script and acting. This is definitely one of the strongest roles in Widmark. He is quite convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine Humphrey Bogart and Robert Mitchum could tackle the role. This is my first exposure to the work of Jean Peter, I remember. She was struck by so much here that I certainly will her other job search. Thelma Ritter in unglamourous roles, earned a nomination she received for playing the informant. This film works on every level. Black and white photography is appropriate and story hooks the audience from the start. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. It is strongly recommended, 9/10.
