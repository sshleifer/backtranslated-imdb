(Spoilers ??) <br /> <br /> I was not sure what to think about the film. Not too many kids film. Definitely we need to look to their parents, because it includes death and dying. But I was surprised that I was a bit amused him. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed with the 81 minutes of time we had. (Even less without credit) and the trailer gets you to think that the rodent is the main entity. But, unfortunately, they torture him. right up to the end of the film. These two colic docked film 2 stars. But I recommend this film. . Even to continue <br /> <br /> 8-10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 7/10
