Trailers of the film may show scenes of violence and sexuality are not the main, but these scenes are only rare fragments chosen to attract an audience. They, of course, showing the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> People who are constantly pushing their heads in their work and lives, using the power that they can have somewhere else to advance to oppress others. And on the lower end of the chains of oppression, mostly women. <br /> <br /> The film shows it as tough as Hundstage, of course, it is difficult to face, but you have to endure such life even more difficult. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is very similar to Short Cuts, but consists of episodes documentary style showing people like your neighbor, playing just the way they are. Without gloss, and most disturbingly, without any hope. His documentary style makes the film even more disturbing, because you realize that there are people, and there are many of them, although our society focuses on good external views. Where the porn industry has to make his business where unregistered domestic violence should be a place where hope should crumble. I'm sure I know these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie without any funny scenes (some might think that the disabled woman to repeat the top ten supermarket ridiculous, but it happens for real) and without any melodramatic, go see this film. However, he will lose if you focus on the subtitles, I am afraid, as the subtitle may not be accentuation transport.
