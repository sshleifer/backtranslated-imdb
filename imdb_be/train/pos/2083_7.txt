This film was an interesting look at Hollywood's novel of the same Pearl S. Buck. Although today some might think that has a lot of racial stereotypes, to the time when the idea of ​​Chinese characters was progressive in itself. I have found that white actors playing the Chinese were not as bad as I expected, it was not an Asian equivalent of the Negro. Then there was really no Asian actors in the US (not even acted Takei) and Rainer did a good job with her hand. It was not the greatest performance I've ever seen, but for the old school of the previous method of acting that was nice. Locusts scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that the release time of the Great Depression kind of turns this film into an allegory. Especially surprising political upheaval peasant farmers and how they seem to have left behind everything. <br /> <br /> The film had some parallels with John Ford style, but I think the Oriental influence touched him, and if it was a Western family, the locusts would have won in the end, punish the farmer for his honor, lust and gluttony. However, here he learns his lesson, you will win.
