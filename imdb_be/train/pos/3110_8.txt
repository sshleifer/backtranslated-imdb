The third and final part of the trilogy Bourne (Spirit), lacks a bit in the history of the department, but it covers a wide variety of scenes! Twi, in particular, takes a lot of time and work to make this movie better. <br /> <br /> The director and star (Damon) himself admitted that it was difficult to find a plot for the last part, because at the end of the second film was pretty ... expanded storyline-wise. How do they get around this? Scenes, this time, but they did the other thing, too, that I can not disclose, because it would be a spoiler. But if you watch the film, you notice it! Oddly enough, I've read that it is an adaptation of the book Bourne is the least accurate of the three films .. if that means something to you: o)
