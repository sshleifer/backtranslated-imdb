I went to see this movie is waiting for a nice relaxing time at the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I had to really control myself, to convince her that I was not scared. In many ways, still children's stories, but with a script that has a lot of potential. Maybe one of the worst movies, if you plan to a different audience.
