human castle is a perfect example of the film Pre-Code. It includes realistic events with a really nice and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a penny in his pocket. He makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city if he bored his entourage. One night he meets Trina, beauty by any standard, that's cold and alone. She refused to engage in prostitution, that she had not eaten for several days, but the two take very well with each other and form relationships. His free spirit tempts him to leave it, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between them, even if they live in a hut on the bank of the river. <br /> <br /> Tracey is one of the greatest actors of the silver screen. His characters are amazing and Relatable. We can see his thoughts on his face, making it easy to identify with, even if we believe that he is behaving badly. Young high in pre-code films.
