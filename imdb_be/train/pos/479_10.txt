Natalia Emily Watson is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character I've ever seen on the screen. She is the queen of this film, no doubt. Or it is transmuted to the king? Internecine weaving chess games and families struggle for control, power, and victory is overwhelming. Just as the players in the film making, the director plays a lot of games together with our mind immediately, but woven into the heavy and light samples. Period, costumes and images of the Lake District in the early twentieth century in Italy are captured perfectly. None of the square space is wasted. <br /> <br /> So many brilliant scenes abound, I can not tell you about all of them. I recommend to budget enough time to watch this movie twice, perhaps a week of each other, because they can not cover all the poetry within the 64 square has a multidimensional framework for a single installation. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book Nabakov, but try my analogy of what I read reminds me of another romantic poetry as a triumphant game film, Barry Levinson's The Natural. It completely threw pessimistic fatalistic final book Malamud in favor of romantic impressionism, which was the only American. Well, the director made it one better smoothly engage the Russian and Italian morals and manners as a background to enlightenment. True story here is that the zero-sum game; there is a winner and a loser, if both do not draw. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by the restrictions and conventions of life in the measure that we allow others to break our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, represented by Natalia Emily Watson, can exceed and will enable all of us to be enhanced by his gifts at the same time. Only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful film (10/10).
