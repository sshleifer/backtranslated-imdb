I can definitely say that I felt like a movie in his right point where the mind games of a dreamy reality enter the surreal aspect of the future faced by Tom Cruise. I do not care much about the acting skills of Tom Cruise, but I must say that it seems to make an impression at every point in the movie ... not just because of the charming storyline, but also because of its self be given the main hero .. ..they merge, and then speak it beautiful. However, I must say that this film does not come under "a wave of medium output" you choose at random and watch the joy; She has strong feelings and characters, so do not wash it down with beer and pop corns. It certainly needs more than that.
