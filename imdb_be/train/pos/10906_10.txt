I have a son two years old who suffer from the same conditions as John F. Kennedy. I never got a chance to meet him, but I never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much making the program helped their fellow sufferers, promoting this terrible condition. This man touched people in a way that a million charities leaflets could not. I believe that it should be mandatory viewing in schools. I also agree with other comments - I have to moan about? He took everything that life can throw at it, and still managed to keep a sense of humor. God Bless. I could not look the part, which showed his dressings changed. I have enough problems with my son.
