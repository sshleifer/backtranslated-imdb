I saw this movie when I saw the blue Crush and other films of Michel, I thought she had a bleak future in this business.I was very wrong after watching her performance in «Girlfight» I was amazed at how she captures the emotion of a fighter, but warrior.In this film as she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother, she sends anger upon receipt hit.Her characters learning curve in the film, she can always put a wall and hide from love, or simply because it has the power, it is used to win.I believe this role is to breathe odits ideal for Michelle, even if she did not have any experience, the director saw the talent, I criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her.
