Reviewed on September 12, 2006 2nd screening at Paramount Theater 1 at the International Film Festival in Toronto. The film was premi√®red on the eve of the World in Elgin VISA Screening Room Theater. <br /> <br /> The main plot involves Morgan Freeman plays once popular actor which is located on the slope down to his career, and who takes on the role that may be under him, but he still makes positive attitude, knowing that he has to pay rent, etc. downward slope indicates that it has been a long time between the roles of previous clicks on the DVD bargain bins and his future as a driver in the not too confident production assistant feed Freeman from the local community, a market where it's going to do the research for the role of a supermarket manager. He soon discovers that the market operates in a real-life iron-willed "10 Items or less" line control clerk played by Paz Vega. If the trip Freeman never returned and Vega need help in preparing for the interview circumstances force them to join forces on a trip through town to get Freeman to go home and get a job Vega, which will receive its more upwardly mobile ways of car ' EASURES. <br /> <br /> At the time the film was enjoyable, it felt like it was still a sketch or work. There were two extended musical sequences (one of Vega & Freeman teaching each other songs for children in the car, one that literally plays like a music video Paul Simon), who felt as padding to cause the time and even then, the film was only about 80 minute. <br /> <br /> This is a good thing, Morgan Freeman, and liked it, because without it, it would be too little. Of course, it was interesting in parts and Paz Vega pleasure as well, but just not enough here to say that it was a complete film. <br /> <br /> They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about the car is stopped to ask for directions and Paz Vega said she never does this. Who ever heard of a guy wants to ask for directions and the woman did not speak? In the real world, it is exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay for the money in the credits. Bit with the clerk of the purpose shops Morgan Freeman as Hustle sales just plain fun! Early in the bit where the driver Freeman insists that it is the voice of Freeman to "books on tape" reading was also pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega have been there for a short Q & A after screening. Silberling answered the question about what the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took over the role he actually changed very little that was there. Quite a compliment to record how Silberling and also about how Freeman can simply slip into the role and makes him feel full, he was born to play.
