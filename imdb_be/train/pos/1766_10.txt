I got a free pass to a preview of the film last night, and did not know what to expect. The room seemed silly, and I assumed that it would be a lot of small fun makeover-of-virgin humor. What a great surprise. I laughed so hard I cried some jokes. This film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK ..... this is not a movie, to go to your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or small children. Language filthy jokes (very) crude and sex talking about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What is surprising, however, is that the film has a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I loved it. Steve Carell is terrific, but (as The Office) supporting cast really makes the film work. All characters have their own drawbacks, but they also have depth and likability. Everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to get the DVD. I'm sure he will be there with office space for repetitions and quoted lines.
