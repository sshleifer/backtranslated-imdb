In Brooklyn, a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and competing voluntary fire brigades leads to the known rate of Brody that he could jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be familiar to many people across the Bugs Bunny parody, «Bowery Bugs» from 1949 <br /> <br /> As a general rule, it is a very enjoyable film is likely to be more widely available, if there were no the infamous and disturbing scenes involving some Chinese tenement dwellers - a time capsule of the antediluvian race relations, which gives the film a great historical interest, in my opinion.
