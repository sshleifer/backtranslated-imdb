It's always nice when a surprise film made for television is to entertain, such as Little Richard. This is a very watchable film about the history of rock-n-Roller, Little Richard played by actor named Leon, who I had never seen before, but it does a very good job. Most TV movies, it's a little tamer than if made for the movie, which is a shame because I'm sure there's a lot we could see of Little Richard, who was controversially. Instead, we see a lot of religous garbage that the only thing that spoils the film, and ultimately ruined a very promising career. Overall, this film is good and the action is above average ph telefilm. 7 10.
