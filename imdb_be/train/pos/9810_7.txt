Albuquerque film that has all the elements of class A Western, except for one: the story, which really belongs to the class B or C. It was acceptable at the time the film was made, when people were so excited to see Western in color, but now he looks very primitive. Nevertheless, for those who love old westerns, it's interesting, original color, and the sound is very well preserved on DVD, which was released recently. Gabby Hayes is a good partner, Lon Chaney, this means, as always, and Randolph Scott a little more cheerful than usual. The film titled Albuquerque one would expect to see something that will remind you of the city, but the city, which is listed here can be anywhere.
