Panned by critics at the time, but the fans favorite, the film has become a classic today. Mixing allegedly "surreal" footage shot at the home of John Lennon in other places with live footage Marc Bolan and T.Rex at their best, this film is not just a must for all who love Marc Bolan, but gives a fascinating insight into the era. <br /> <br /> This was a time, and you can even find a brief spot of another Reg Dwight [Elton John to you] bashing ivory in the country when Mark was friendly with the likes of Ringo Starr Beatles [who shot him] [ and never officially released] version of Tutti Frutti and rocking and ballad version Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There's also a great scene involving Chelita Secunda [say, "created the glam-rock" with its use of sequins, etc.], Mickey Finn, and even actor Catweazle !! <br /> <br /> the best scene for me in the garden, when Mark leaves the dining room table, sits down cross-legged in front of a string section and knocks acoustic versions of classics such as Get It On and The Slider. <, Br /> <br /> It is highly recommended !! Five Star [five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
