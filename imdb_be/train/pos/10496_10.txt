Great actors, actress Oscar nominees, gorgeous scenery, good strong story line and more laughs than can fit in my new handbag (and it is quite large). This film was brilliant. It is well acted in more serious scenes and funny moments were. .well, side-splitting. I had never heard of the movie the audience laugh so much, and tears flowed down my cheeks during the "stones ladies tea shop" scene. Well done to the British film industry and Craig Ferguson, whose magic ingredients are convinced this is one of my favorite films of the year, if not all the time.
