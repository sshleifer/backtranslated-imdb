I just saw this wonderful Japanese feature film at the 5th annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theater Champaign, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film, with subtitles in English, has a ballroom dancing his heart, the film really shows the world outside of Japan, as tight family structure, employment (salaryman ), and the rest still exist in contemporary Japan. <br /> <br /> The author / director His Masauki [I adhere to the first and the name (name) to the Japanese custom of presenting the name (s)] use is not very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the social structure of Japan. <br /> <br /> [In addition, I will not use names of the characters in the movie, when the world's readers may not be familiar with Japanese official names, which can be confusing. I will refer to <br /> <br /> actors of their professional action name as shown in the Internet Movie Database.] <br /> <br /> He enlists the help of his real life wife, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in her first and so far, only a movie. She is a dance teacher at a dance studio of his father. However, its real ambition is to compete again in the International competition of dance that she has been disqualified from the past. No, I will not say "why." See the movie. <br /> <br /> salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. Veteran about 25 films since 1979, it gives an idea of ​​what Sterling companyman <br / > <br /> 40-v, having a beautiful wife, teenage daughter, and just bought his house <br /> <br /> tight. <br /> <br /> and, nevertheless, something something is missing from their own inner happiness. Watch this film to see how he becomes "participation" with ballroom dancing and secretly travels to <br /> <br /> lessons. Most of the characters dancing freed from the traditional <br /> < br /> Japanese and rarhii social structure. They are friendly and warm and attractive. Of course, this is in stark contrast to the way Japanese society is structured with its "place for anyone and everyone in their place" philosophy. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of funny moments. in about 1500 spectators theater broke <br /> <br /> into spontaneous laughter in many comedic moments. This proves, <br /> <br /> that comedy does not have any foreign language. <br /> <br /> The veteran actor Naoto Takenaka funny and brilliant, and Erika Watanabe. They have two funny character actor. <br /> <br /> You can purchase and read the text of a book about the structure of college life in Japan, or you could watch this film and the thin beginning to understand how <br /> <br /> residents of Japan are growing at a fairly rigid social structure. Viewing of the film "Shall We Dansu?» Is a quick dip in the further study and review of other <br /> <br /> Japanese films. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, it's charming, it will make you cry a little, and it will warm your heart. <br /> <br />
