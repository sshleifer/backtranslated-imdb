I waited for the movie very few by looking only to pass a quiet hour - but that an hour later he found himself. Roll is an excellent, if not too serious small story about the "country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good", this is ridiculous everywhere, characters punish and tempo correctly. <, Br /> <br /> Toby Malone is a true star of the movie he was punished way Matt, the boy said the country and the local American Football hero came to the big city to experience one of the big teams. It is supported perfectly by John Batchelor, a local thug Tiny. Keep an eye on these two. <br /> <br /> It is recommended.
