"Elvira, the dark lady" is my native «Harper Valley parent-teachers' association" interspersed with the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) goes with difficulty, as the TV horror movie hostess, after the owner of the new station gets new to her. Now she's leaning on a show in Las Vegas, to carry it to the end, but recognizes that it must come up with more money to get the show started. Things look hopeless to raise the money until it receives notice of the death of his aunt, who then takes Elvira to Massachusetts for reading the will. The house needs repairs, dogs and table all that was left to her aunt, and again, it seems, Elvira problems, come up with the money for the show in Las Vegas. Adults are small and narrow minded city make things worse, making things more difficult for Elvira. Only local hunk (Daniel Greene), and a group of teenagers to make friends with her. Uncle Elvira "wine» (W. Morgan Sheppard), presses to make a deal with Elvira for a cookbook, but Elvira soon learns of her powerful legacy that includes magic, and a couple of very effective casserole. Sun Elvira no longer wants to sell a cookbook to his uncle, but he intends to get his hands on him, knowing his strength. Elvira then face burned at the stake on the old city of witchcraft charge, and a showdown between her and her uncle. The plot is fairly simple, but the humor and well-developed characters to keep it moving at a good pace. "Elvira, the dark lady" full cute, rude, obscene, and intelligent humor carried through many gags, puns, props, songs and parody. risks occult film to make it one of the best horror parody ever made. This is a well made movie with terrific acting by all the performers; including Makklorg, and Jeff Conaway (with «Grease»). There are also good special effects. Many people (including me) wondered when the Elvira character can carry a feature film, and the response is great, YES!
