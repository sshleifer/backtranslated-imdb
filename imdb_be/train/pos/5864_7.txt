I do not like pretentious and overrated Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite film of the Vietnam War is a deer hunter. Deer Hunter focused on one part of the war, and then focused on the life before the war. This film is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is too loose compared to the Deer Hunter. History never developed to the extent that the audience can really understand and feel made for characters like Deerhunter. Memories of Vietnam not captured or are involved as those in Deerhunter. So I can only give this film 7 of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the action was perfect. DeNiro and Harris truly amazing actors. They immerse themselves in their characters, and expressed great sadness of the two former friends, who had lost his best friend Bobby in combat. Harris half-dead character is an alcoholic who hides his guilt that he has in Bobby lose their lives trying to save him. <br /> <br /> I also like the support cast. Everyone in the city is a part of the film. The city clearly can not cope with the Vietnam vets very well. Like many small towns, it's all about the quiet, modest, and supervision of its business. Harris's character, however, can not be any of these things. I wonder how the people of war effect. Some people rebound quickly, while others never recover.
