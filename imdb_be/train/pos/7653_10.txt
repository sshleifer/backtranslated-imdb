Shot in the heart of the fine. He brilliantly illustrates the plight of Harry Gimore, a convicted murder who requested death. Shot in the heart indicates that the test Gilmour family, torn by hatred, passed. This film is an incredible psychological study, and amazingly depressing and uplifting. 10/10
