I immediately noticed that this movie really was not based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a good idea that Pong and son are now Perdita had their own pups. Cute Dalmatian to was, of course, little Snowball, which was completely speck until the very end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I do not know what to think when Cruella de Ville seemed to completely change the look. In fact, I have often thought about the possibility that it could be a friendly, but now that she had quickly turned into a "self" again and announced that it was Cruella again, I almost became really worried about Dalmatians Chloe. <, Br /> <br /> In fact, the scene in which puppies watched Lady and the Tramp, and Chloe and Kevin had their dinner, was much better than I expected. I also loved the parrot, who was playing at the dog, and it was incredible that the dogs learned so many tricks for this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was pleased that in the end, Dalmatians were rescued again, but I would like to know what will happen with Cruella after she lost all her property. And what on earth could be home with the dogs to do with such a huge amount of money? <br /> <br /> In the end, it was quite touching that Snowball also took place at the end of the film.
