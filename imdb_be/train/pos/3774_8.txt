In continuation of the genius of Bill and excellent adventure Ted, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chak De Nomolos sends two evil robots, under the guise of Bill and Ted on the earth, to kill a man of Bill and Ted's, in order to change the future . <br /> <br /> a great pairing of comedy, Winter and Reeves excels deliver a delicious sense of humor to the audience in this interesting course. Although lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey still has great phrases and dialogue with the leading pair, not to mention the gay played by William Sadler, who brings the humorous side of the figure depth Death. Watch for consecutive games, the best moment in the entire film, but one of the many great techniques that are used to justify this genre. <br /> <br /> Although it is still packed with humor, this film has a dramatic film for her, with a share to be more serious and the situation is more risky. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a large size, and other attractive features. The creators also expand the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and paradise future highly symbolic and are present in the story. Fantasy genre again spot on with this amazing time-traveling machine, although again a bit confusing at points with time, as well as objects and situations, which are placed before it takes place in the present, as can be seen in the final couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> The first watch I hated this extension, but the second time was a real joy as I appreciated the jokes and the story of more and while the jokes and the story is not as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey is enough to feel It feels good motives, the jokes and the story is quite stable, to make it good-natured family film.
