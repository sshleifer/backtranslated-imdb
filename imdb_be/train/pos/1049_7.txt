Sister-in-law will be released theatrically on March 24 in Sweden. A good reason for our northern friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. This has been shown in Gothenburg together with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto "directed at the focus" of the festival. She gave a master-class, very much appreciated, telling about his method as a documentary filmmaker, and told about the special circumstances that led her to take her sister-in-law twice: the first version is lost forever, so has organized the second shooting and the film turned out differently at the end. Pretty terrible problem happened in this case, to create the possibility of very strong film.
