Low-budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, it becomes a friend, and then finds it all a bit too much. A good shot and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we've all been here before. Several scenes a bit hysterical and O'Connor voice sounds very similar to Mini Mouse! She disappeared from view soon after to make this film - so that life can imitate art! A must see if you want to see a punk version of Star Is Born, though.
