The movie gets a gut tension between father and son. <br /> <br /> great dialogue beautiful scenery and a large current is an excellent way to present a bow that keeps peel back layers. <, Br /> <br /> The main issues of child rearing, communication and courage are considered indirectly. <br /> <br /> The fun ways curtain pulled back, the mask slip a little and the truth is exposed. <, Br /> <br /> All this is happening against the background of the road trip format. Background in the countryside of New York State in the early autumn just as the trees change color. WOW!
