This film incredible.With big characters, especially the old swordsman who can fly in the form of a fireball and jump over the tree, this film tells the classic story of the battle between the good and the forces of evil.The final battle especially breathtaking and the score is its native cool. <br /> <br /> very, very recommendable.Not for the youngest children though.This one deserves 10.
