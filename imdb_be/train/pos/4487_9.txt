«Fraidy Cat», 4 of these cartoons is good. At least, I like it, so I'm surprised that it gets mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most horrible stories than funny though it does have its moments of comedy. the atmosphere is dark and scary. Exciting another strong element here. As for the humor, it's mostly dark humor. <br /> <br /> in this short, Tom listens to a disastrous radio show at night and absolutely terrible, because it's about the ghost, he said. while Tom scared to death, Jerry's looking, and can not pom chi, but laugh all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torment him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner, it creates a large "ghost». <br /> <br /> Tom lives the most terrible experience of a his life. Although Jerry scares Tom without a good reason, as history is made in the end is ridiculous. Plus, again, there is no violence here, because this is one of the oldest cartoon Tom & Jerry. However, I do not understand that 9 lives joke Tom almost sucked into the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally finds out that all cans scheme and Jerry made a fool of him, Jerry "caught by the hand in the cookie jar" (he deserves to be discovered). However, Tom shows incredible patience before the reaction. He glares at Jerry for one minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and takes about a minute to realize that Tom was looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry is trying to be funny, but Tom did not laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, this is another peculiar and excellent experience of Tom and Jerry.
