Tony Hawk Underground came to a point where the series really begins to lose its luster, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 is not met expectations and left the series is really in the air that Neversoft and Activision could do with a series that would be different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground introduced storymode, which was pretty cool, because it made a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans. Another feature, which presented a lot of fans were in favor of that and was able to get off the skateboard, which is nice, because you can now get up, run, and do all sorts of new things. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft has also improved on the issue, which began with the Pro Skater 3, and it was a design length of the level. The first two games for the PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because levels have been good for a long time, and some hidden features in some of them. Pro Skater 3 and 4 have been reduced due to several features that have been added, and really pushed the system and its boundaries. In this version, they shorten these functions, there is not much interesting street people, in fact there is almost none in some levels, as well as graphics and physics of skiing tones down a bit, but not much. <, Br /> <br /> This game is one rock, then storymode bit short, of course, is Neversofts first time doing this with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it is quite understandable. However, with that being said you will definitely finish this game throughout the day. <br /> <br /> In general, a great app that was very refreshing.
