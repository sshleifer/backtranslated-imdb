If I was familiar with the production of Guys and Dolls stage before the film viewing, I could not be as fond of it as I am. Although in all fairness, I probably would have, so far, as the production of the film is better because of my total love as Brando (his actions) and Sinatra (his voice, although he is quite the actor, as well as see the Manchurian Candidate and hence eternity .) <br /> <br /> for some applications other reviewers about the songs, I have a soundtrack Broadway, and though his voice Isabelle Bingley dwarfs, Jean Simmons, is nothing more pleasant. I believe that to have a rather high-pitched quality. The voice of Jean Simmons is much more realistic, although it must be admitted that it is not always a lot of interest in musicals. In addition, the only time that I particularly noticed, in particular, weak vocal register Marlon Brando during execution «Luck Be A Lady» and only there, because I was previously familiar with the Sinatra version. I also believe the voice of Vivian Blaine will be much more enjoyable in the film than on Broadway. And only one voice Sinatra able to redeem the shortcomings of all the others, if they are really in need of redemption. (They were not) It is much better than Sam Levene, especially in my favorite song, "Sue Me». <br /> <br /> In addition, the complaint is that a lot of the songs have been excluded from the film for defective songs, I beg to differ. "Bushel and a Peck" is hardly a gem, and the song, replacing it with «Pet Me Poppa» and his performance a Hot Box material. I personally do not care, "Marry the man today" at all, and rejoice in the fact that it was not included in the film. I love "I've never been in love," and although it was not made in the film, instrumental version can be heard in the dressing room when Nathan Adelaide. song «A Woman in Love'expresses same feeling equally well and probably in the range that both stars could achieve more skillful. and the film will not be the same without the song "Adelaide", is not included on Broadway. in fact, when the film's soundtrack was available for sale, I would recommend buying it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen the original production, I can not imagine that the actions will be higher than that of the lead actors of the film. <br /> <br /> The important fact is that the story, as charming as ever, and the current G and son did not make it any less true.
