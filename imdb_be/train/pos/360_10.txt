11 Oscar nominations and zero gain !!! I am yet to understand why - it's not like the actors in the film did better after that you can do this by giving them rewards for trivial role, as it has done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, frames, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover, etc- were strange to get interesting discussion scenarios at the Oscars this year ...... he should go into the category of Shoulda-woulda-Coulda judges .... <br /> <br /> Its amazing book - but the truth is in the style of Alice Walker's letter it is a way to feel that she exaggerates his characters - so I'm so glad that they Zattu lyayuts adaptation took a few things. <br /> <br /> cinematography was amazing - African scene live to be desired - the African part of the book is to be found in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - NA oh no! Steven Spielberg believes that the world is so stupid that they can not think about Africa safari outside - so much so there has to be a free zebra and wildlife scenes, when we all know that there is no West Africa ---- and most why get people talking in Swahili --- which is in West Africa speaks Swahili ?? I just had to get that out of the way ....... <br /> <br /> But, as history - a wonderful, film - out of this world - yes CLASSIC !! <br /> <br /> I have, and I watch it when my soul is in need of some rejuvenation.
