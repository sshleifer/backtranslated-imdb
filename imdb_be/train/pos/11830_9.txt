This is a very beautiful film with all this made a total of six or seven colors. When he came over 15 years ago, he stunned the audience with their colors, being so different from everything else that's ever been put on film. Those colors, at least for me, to make it absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I want to freeze and could somehow convert them into the picture in order to study their art. <br /> <br /> The characters and the plot does not coincide with the grandeur of the photos, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. Famous actors who played them here have had a lot of fun on set, playing «Flatop», «Pruneface», «Lips", "mutters," etc. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Headley good as Dick Tracy and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she was as sweet and soft as her name. Another nice addition is Charlie Korsmo as a delinquent boy, Dick and Tess to take under his wing. Colorful other characters played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Patinkin, Madonna and other names you know, but too many to list here. Check the full credit on the home page, and you'll be surprised. <br /> <br /> The only negatives I found were the voice of Pacino cuts you after a while, tune singing voice of the Madonna and the fact that the film would have been better finished in about 10 minutes. This "error" all the insignificant, because in general, this is a fun movie .... cartoon strip comes to life in an incredibly scenic-modes ..... like nothing you have ever seen.
