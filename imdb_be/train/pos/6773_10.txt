I Caught this movie Last Night on TV And you know, Danny Masterson was a very good actor in the film, and its Great to see him in something other than That '70s Show. Isnt Rated film, but in my opinion, I would appreciate it (R) Just because there was already a lot of adults. But overall I loved it, I thought that the severity of the dirt was pretty funny. Its just basically about a guy who does not work, Girlfriend, or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (a messenger in fact.) It gets Framed for the murder of rock stars and rock stars is a Girlfriend one of the people who really need help. I Give It .... *** 3 stars.
