Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews on IMDb equate with low budget are not good. What would this movie, you may need more than the budget really is not a part of it. Large sets and lots of special effects have turned it into another movie Lara Croft. What we have here is a step or two better than that. <br /> <br /> Almost unknown Alexander captivating stage as a mysterious modesty, and it is very important for this film to work. Its clever smiles and knowing looks terrible, and you find yourself wishing that the camera is not Pluck her face. This makes it suitable for applications that bad boy Nicholas, also plays a little-known (in the US at least) Nikolaj Coaster-Valdano may take an unusually cerebral interest in it, something Modesty can exploit. It is able to distract him rape her just to shove and spitting out "stop wasting my time!" Then storms off between his heavily until suddenly uncertain henchmen. Creating a scene as it is believable not happen by accident. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have with thin rails Staden plays Modesty is just not very plausible for her to go hand in hand with athletic and muscular looking guy like Coaster-Valdano and beat him. It just does not Peta Wilson or PSP up Hilary Swank type of actress who can throw a convincing punch. Coaster-Valdano allowing themselves to be suppressed Staden looks like he's just roughhousing with his little sister. <br /> <br /> Since this is in fact not the gunman, it is not a big drawback. I just hope they do better on that, if and when they do continue.
