Thin funny parody of pretentious art house films ever made. <br /> <br /> This film reveals all the clich√©s, and then some! Painfully bad (Downs-syndrome!) Actors. Terribly hard very important dialogue. Scenes that should come as a shock, but fall flat. edit concussion. Pointless story. All wrapped in a kind of miasma smirky contempt for the audience and vague psycho-drivel. <br /> <br /> This is accomplished exactly what it was designed for. Very funny satire of these tedious films made of spoiled adolescents trust the sponsor to show their parents when they ask them what they have been doing for the past two years! After "What is it?" He received the award at the Cannes, leading Werner Herzog, according to rumors, it was said that the film is actually a parody, in the framework of his films! He allegedly blew up in the media. Until now, he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, see it and laugh, it will be a classic humor for many years.
