This is a Chinese film made me feel so much similarity to the culture of the members do not belong to and far. In almost Buddhist approach, the film helps to relate to each character, and fortunately for simple everyday things. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, and Xu Hzu exudes kindness and wisdom, but also vulnerable and average. Er Ming retarded brother shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes from the most disparate people in this universe. Another China, it is far from the Chinese realism, however, it has a lot of humanity and realism of a different kind. <br /> <br /> Get it. You will not be disappointed.
