It is not only pleasant and thoroughly entertaining comedy, but it's the cinematic memory of a bygone era, with the settings and scenarios, unfortunately, is now only a memory in British life. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton, who after accidental detonation of unexploded bombs, reveals a wealth of medieval treasures belonging to the 14th century, the Duke of Burgundy, who was buried deep beneath their little suburban street the last 600 years . <br /> <br />, accompanying the treasures of the ancient legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which was never officially canceled) argue that this particular street in London was declared Burgandian soil, which means that in the eyes of the international right, Pemberton and other locals are no longer British subjects, but the natives of Burgundy and their tiny street independent country in its own right and a law to themselves. <br /> <br /> This sets the war battered and impoverished RESI dents up in good stead, as they consider themselves to be outside the jurisdiction of English law and, therefore, they burn your diet book in the act of drunken defiance, and destroy ignore their clothing coupons, defiantly ignoring British licensing laws, etc., declaring himself fully independent from Great Britain. <br /> <br /> However, what happens when speculator, speculators and dishonest scammer should suit and crosses the border '' in Burgundy as a refuge from the constraints of the law and postwar sell their products Quirky and half of consumers in London to follow them to avoid diet, making them quiet happy little haven, a den of thieves and pretty crowded this. <br /> <br /> Referring to Whitehall for help, they said that in connection with the events is "now a foreign policy issue, His Majesty's Government is not willing to participate", which leaves residents high and dry. They nevertheless declare the legal boundaries of the area and thus to create a fully-equipped customs office at the end of the road, mostly to smuggling control than to provide any security for the residents of Pimlico. <br /> <br /> In the end, the boundary is completely closed, since most of the siege, Bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food, but not least, fighting in true British style. As one resident Bugundian quotes "we in English, and we have always been English, and it's only because we're British, we are fighting so hard to be BugundiansÂ» <br /> <br /> A feeling that soon repeated throughout the capital, when the rest of London found poor Bugundians distress they feel compelled to chip in and help them, throwing food and supply of barbed wire blockades. <br /> <br /> Will Whitehall, which affected so can invaders for centuries, finally to bring to it knees this new installment of foreigners, especially those of them are English !!!! <br /> <br /> Most of the tale, and great fun throughout. Not to be missed.
