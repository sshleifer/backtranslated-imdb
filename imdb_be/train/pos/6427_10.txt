If you r in the mood for fun ... and you want to just relax and enjoy ... goodbye Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the films to watch. Amitabh started quite well ... but it is Govinda, who steals the show with his hands ... a wonderful time and good dialogue delivery ..... its inspiration from the bad boys ... but it has Indian Masala him. .. people think that it can be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhawan and Govinda directs acts ... should not raise any issues .... other recommended films in the same genre (David Dhawan / Govinda combo) ... are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Suffering love collies there. 1, Jodi No. 1, Hero No.1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
