I have seen the original English version of the video. Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. I can not believe what I'm saying. The story of a young boy who meets a girl with a history intertwined with his own. Two thrown into one of the most fun and interesting storylines in any animated film. Animation quality great! If you've seen the work of Disney's Kiki's delivery service, you can see the quality in their production. It almost redeems them for stealing the history of Kimba the White Lion. (But not quite!) Finally Miyazaki's movies are available right! I can not wait to see the uncut English version of Nausicaa!
