I enjoyed this film, and I had very low expectations because of all the negative reviews that I read before going. I went because I was curious as to what all the fuss was because some of the entries were so angry with this film and with the Koreans. Yes, and it is from Korea, who put some of my favorite movies. I loved the host, but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi / fantasy film, so you can make sense of my taste :. Mirror, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City <br /> <br /> This is not embarrassed, as everyone says, and the monsters looked good and a great battle. There are some holes in the story, but really does not matter. I like to tune things like that, and stopped asking why a long time ago, when I see the summer blockbusters. Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation of the material was different, and I thought that the protagonist suspiciously dressed Korean actors in other shows. (Behr) Ethan's hair looked as Asia. <br /> <br /> Yes, it can be better, and I hope that in the future of Korea, with its unusual quirky sense of life, strong emotions and unexpected humor, can bring some variety to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of host and Dragon Wars in the future?
