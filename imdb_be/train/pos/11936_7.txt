I really liked this movie as a young kid. At this age, I thought it silly antics were funny baseball, and that the film was "cool" because it about the sport. Now, several years later, I can look back and see that it is well-designed movie. This film opened my eyes, like a little kid with the struggle of other children who are engaged in the issues and the real world. This kind of exposure is largely lacking in children's movies these days that I do not think that's the benefit of our society. Of course, baseball trick seems really dumb right now, but they drew the child. A lot of seven years are not going to ask to see a film about foster children, but they will ask to see a movie about baseball. Disney realized this fact and used it to teach the children an important lesson about the world. <br /> <br /> As a young adult performance of Al and the other angels it seems much less impressive, but I'll give credit to the actors playing both children and Danny Glover, who all did a fantastic job.
