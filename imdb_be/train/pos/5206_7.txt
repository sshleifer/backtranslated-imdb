This film Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain contains very little thought or effort. He ridiculed with specification ultrafast "chopper" death style and plain disgusting acts of death. Actions appreciated the two, the actors show very few opportunities, and the stupidity of the film is too uncertain. The way they portrayed that people their age acts as an incredibly different. Odd split porn suitable in the thought that really does not offer much, and any area which is respectable, but quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death. An example is the poor man, which is gutting his anus and the stage lasts about 5 minutes. It's horrible obvious how little the children put up the fight. This film is a good choice for those who like to watch terrible death and almost torture.
