Very slow, but intricately structured and ultimately very touching. Good, very accurate in my life to look at a small Florida town beach in the dead of winter. - I've been there, and it's exactly <br /> <br /> This is also the debut of actress Ashley Judd, and she makes a great impression here. Hard to believe that this film 12 years - I remember him in movie theaters, and I recently rented the "Rubin" again. 80 except looking clothes, he picked up very nicely. Ashely is so radiant and moving here, it's hard to think about his future career entirely wincing. Boy, talk about your failure to comply with a previous promise! Anyone see Ashley here in the "Ruby In ParadiseÂ» would suggest, these elegant, natural beauty went to all kinds of interesting art films and serious action - instead it has become a "go to" the girls for stupid fighters and chopper movies ! Very disappointing, but at least we have this excellent performance is preserved to showcase its early promise. <br /> <br /> As they say, some other commentators, it is not for everyone, it is a very slow pace. This is not a thriller, not whether it is really romantic. Director (Victor Nunez, "Ula Gold", another great character study) deals with the life of an ordinary young woman with deep respect by allowing her the story build slowly and with a lot of details. So I think this is one of the most touching and respectful transition age stories about young women who I can think of - it's not about the sexual awakening of Ruby or "how she lost her virginity," but about her choices in life and it is maturity. <br /> <br /> great movie, if you take the time to watch it ... I think it will be a really great film to show the teenager and young girl (or boy for that matter), and give them an opportunity to think and discuss it. <br /> <br /> Special kudos to director Nunez, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and well detailed, I assumed all through the film, which was based on a novel written by a female or a memoir, but in fact it is original work g Nunez. Nominal 8 of 10.
