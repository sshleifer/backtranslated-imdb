it was a favorite Christmas Special, I want them to be released on VHS or DVD, because my 33 RPM lost, and any tape, which I did, too, is long gone. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a big John Denver fan, but was very impressed with the music, which was basically a traditional favorites with spin The Muppet (ESP Little St. Nick!) It also contained a few small well-known songs (the original? ). <br /> <br /> Despite the fact it was done in the late 70's show it was a timeless feel to it. Hoping to find a copy in the near future !!!
