Hello: <br /> <br /> I've heard about lost by an employee who had obvious differences in opinion as spectacular as he loved her. Well, I watched an episode or two at the beginning of the season and was sad, so I set it. A few years later I came across a lost; bored with the current rate of sci-fi. Wow, I was surprised. Can you say, gravity well, damn I got sucked in. The pace and scenario very well, some flash forward / back as well with characters lamer, but for all the good. My favorite characters, Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, by Desmond, Jack and Dad. Jack and Michael definitely immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 step above them, Juliette was much more than a classy Kate. Mr. Eko way undervalued and Charlie level, if not more, too bad they both died. Man dressed in black talking with Jacob (reverse path) is present curiosity. In general, large, very layered series: looking for more <br /> <br /> Best regards.
