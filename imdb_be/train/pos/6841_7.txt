This is probably one of the most famous films of Brian De Palma, but it is not in his power. Body Double, Rage and Kerry are the best movies, but this film is better than the Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very dependent on Hitchcock, and this film is a take off on a psychopath. Angie Dickinson boring housewife who thinks to deal and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, turns down the offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery, and it is when he sleeps with him. After that point, it is best that you do not know what's going on, but there is a murder, and Nancy Allen call girl who gets a look at the killer. Dennis Franz detective on the case, which does not really trust Elena, and she must find the killer herself. This is a very good movie, but not one of De Palma's better.
