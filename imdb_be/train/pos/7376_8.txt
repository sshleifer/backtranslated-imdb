I really enjoyed this debut director rings, Hideo Nakata. If you've seen a ring in advance, then you will be familiar with the style and the idea of ​​this film. He has a thin spookiness about it, which works better than adults (and predictable) sting parasitizing most mainstream films of this genre. If you like films that give you chills, then you will probably like this. Good, disastrous debut of Hideo Nakata. 8/10
