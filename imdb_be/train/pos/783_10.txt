The first word that comes to mind after watching this film is a "beauty". Beauty around in acting (Andie wonderful as always), in a well-designed shots, and in the author's idea of ​​the red line - Love <br /> <br /> I think that the character of Kenny is the only white. in the otherwise dull and predictable life of these three WOMENS. His interaction makes the character of Andy in life, as entertaining as it might be. When he left, it became obvious that we can not appreciate and adhere to our internal beliefs and holy desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie is successfully recovering after this loss is not bad, but it shows that life prevails. any form, even in this small British countryside, which is illustrated perfectly <br /> <br /> Another reason why I love this movie is that it's so British in every way - all at home and "fagot "and accents :))). And Andie again does an excellent job! It's a shame that this film has received such low ratings. 10 out of ten!
