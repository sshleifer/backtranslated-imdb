"The film is aimed at adults" is a rarity these days, but Moonstruck is doing so well, and even better than the average film that is aging very well. Although this comic moments goal is lower than the rest of the film has an excellent specificity (Italians in Brooklyn) that is not used to shortchange signs or spectator. (That is, the bandits will never appear in acomplication. It never becomes grotesque as My Big Fat Greek Wedding) Secondary storylines narrated economically with short scenes that allow you to take a break from the main stream. These scenes, which are not currently available in today's films, where their immediate value can not be saved in the production and bump. I miss these scenes. It also includes a beautiful old characters. The film takes its own small, quiet way to the conclusion. There is not badly written scene included anywhere, to do some leaders of the sphincter relaxes. Cage and Cher doing a very good job. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck is old school, ethnic, everyday New York as well as "Marty", except Moonstruck is way less sanctimonious.
