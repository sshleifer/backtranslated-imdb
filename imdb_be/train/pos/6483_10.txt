This is a great series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, glossy, it should be said, the graphics start to the end of World War 2. The origins are not fully explored all the way from Germany, the fall in the hands of the Treaty of Versailles, which helped propel a demonic Hitler, but as one reviewer says , which should be difficult to do in a series of 26 parts with so much to cram. <br /> <br /> In addition to the expected battle pictures / action, there are many personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told to give the viewer an amazing view, especially if you do not necessarily World War 2 buff / fan. Episodes indicating "evidence" and what life was like on the home front's main allies / enemy, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the U.S.A. It was very instructive. Showing extreme violence of the war at the front, and, of course, the suffering of the civilian population, the death camps, etc., have been very well treated and exposed. I totally recommend it in any history class for the younger generation (of which one can say that I am one of 47!). <br /> <br /> Some things are pretty weird omitted, as the advent of a new jet of the epoch, with experimental jet Gloster Frank Whittle and the combat debut of Gloster Meteor, as well as that of the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially as it was seen wedge 1 debut and it was surprisingly less mention of V2. It's probably a little supervision, entirely referring to the more sensational and fantastic secret weapon that WW2 transferred to a barren old science. But the big series, which made its mark and made it to the days when, fortunately, is repeated. <br /> <br /> The series enjoyed as a box set from the point of view of history, on DVD for those especially who happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be well proud.
