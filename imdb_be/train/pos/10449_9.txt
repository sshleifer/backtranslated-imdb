I've never heard of this movie before a couple of weeks ago, but the concept has interested me when I heard it: the American man meets a European woman in his last night in Europe, and they spend the night together talking. This caused my interest, but I never expected it to be this nice. Before sunrise, it is a masterpiece, and it is also one of the most romantic of the recording films. To my surprise, it did not have enough cynicism 1990s. It is impossible to really talk too much about it because there is no real story, so to speak (although there are many thoroughly interesting things you could say it's kind of like My Dinner with Andre, where there is a conversation, but it is not just talk, that matters), but let me say to see it. See!
