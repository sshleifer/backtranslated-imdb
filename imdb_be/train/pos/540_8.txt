actually ... that "video camera" effect, this is exactly what is the effect, pretty good one .. this movie is actually better than the original (and not much about directing a movie you? know), it is very fun watch made for television, do not have to follow any rules. I believe that it is difficult to see the number 1 because he kills the first girl, her anxiety. and all this time we are routing for Judd Nelson to get away with it, we, as the audience on his side. I hope that one day we will see the third cabin on the lake, but I doubt it. Watching this film, you can see how real movies are made, so it's kind of like a film within a film. Judd is one of the most feared villains ever, and it is more realistic, it is not just mindlessly chopping people up, as in other horrors.
