I must say that sometimes "looks" all that matters, as well as Jeremy Clarkson from BBC pointed (but not on our land, though, but he's right anyway). <br /> <br /> When it comes to looks, this film is so incredibly stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes see. <br /> <br /> And then there is the face of the film, as well as interesting, with a charming voice reader and narrator of the story that will touch your heart as you watch these gorgeous images filmed. <br /> <br /> film probably will not affect your life, destroying the beauty, but it is, of course, remember how valuable our earth, we live in really is. <br /> <br /> the movie deserves it 10 stars, it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries I really enjoyed.
