"Life hits us in the face ........ we should try to stay beautiful» <br /> <br /> The debut film of one of the best artists of the Belgian (he sings the song), Tom Barman. The highly anticipated film, and --- happy joy joy Flemish film --- really worth watching, and promising piece of work! It takes us into the life with the 8 main characters who live through the night and Friday. The name says a lot about how we spend time with them: we are floating, as they do in the party on Friday night, when they are a sort of "meeting <br /> <br /> It is considered very rhytmic style of.". Excellent use of music. Sometimes it takes the upperhand to the images, and then you feel his power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 minutes ???) is an exciting visual experience as the reason that it is shot. It keeps you in fact with him while he's in a small place with lots of people having a big party ..... so it is difficult to remove. <br /> <br /> Thank menijèr bartender for taking this bold film in these for several years going, the poor times a Flemish film. You made my day!
