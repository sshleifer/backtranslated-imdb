This film has a clear storyline, which is quite unusual for the genre of music. "Cats", "Phantom of the Opera", as well as other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber can be regarded as metaphorical, since they use literary works within them. «Biarkan Bintang Menari» (BBM) 's story touches the very core of human relations, especially in the Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film was based on the "allegedly" a fairy tale, it really is a fantasy of "child" in Indonesian adults. Dance sequences are not ideal, but the songs are as Indonesians express. I think the choreographer should study the way Indonesian dance, for does not concern the fact that the development of dance in Indonesia tends to be more westernized. Dance sequences seem awkward in a certain sense and is not synchronized with the songs and / or music. Nevertheless, I still love this movie and view it as a new wave of Indonesian genre of film that I hope to improve in the future.
