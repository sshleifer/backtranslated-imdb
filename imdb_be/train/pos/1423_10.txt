You have to see it to believe it! Directed by Alastair Foterzhil and Mark Linfield made a thing is really big, it is 10 out of 10, so I can not believe that another user of the network was to evaluate him so poor, if they do not expect to see just a normal movie, people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentary films are a great way to awaken us to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with the documentary, Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth", mainly because of the long monologues, painful and "truth" are not always accurate, as many researchers have shown. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on the ground do not miss the Earth.
