T is not a Scorsese film that I would put in the list of my favorite movies. But this is the best I have run through my DVD-player for about five years. Figuring patient Scorsese favorite moments of the film, and how Hollywood works incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> This is a 3 DVD-saithe material cost. He must be a British production, since all of the American corporate culture would not be trampled quiet, methodical, no-nonsense, put-on-focus-on-content approach taken here. And US production would require, he said that he loved only movies that were popular favorites. I want it all took a page from his love for the cinema. You have to love the movies that you are doing for your personal, unique and specific reasons. Not just a "me too" voice to The Godfather, etc .. People have no idea what ideas are being explored in their favorite films. If they did, the movie will be more interesting than they are. Scorsese knows what ideas are being explored, and that makes it a compelling participating speaker on this topic. I really appreciate his articulate, generous interviews over the past decade. <br /> <br /> On a negative note, Scorsese is best if he's excited to show you some strange movie, and not when it instructive to teach you something about the history of the cinema settled. And I want him to pluck three hairs from his nose. It's very distracting.
