I have always believed that David and Bathsheba film was originally intended for Tyrone Power in 20th Century Fox, while Gregory Peck really gives a good account of himself as King David, a monarch with a wandering eye. <br /> <br /> The whole lot of biblical stories get covered in the film, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment, and in general what God expects from his followers. <br /> <br /> If you are the king, the king even in the biblical kingdom prorochestvovale you, of course, there are many perogatives not open to all of us. King David has many wives, including one really vicious one in Jayne Meadows, who was the daughter of Saul, David's predecessor. But his eyes see Bathsheba in her garden one evening. It turns out that she is unhappy married Uriah the Hittite, David quite a lot of women. Uriah is one of the military captains David. David sends for Bathsheba and him to be king, she comes Runnin ', because she had her eye on him, too. <br /> <br /> What happens, business, pregnancy, and carefully arranged for Uriah's death in battle. But all seeing and knowing dietary caught it all and not only to punish David and Bathsheba, but the entire kingdom of Israel punished with drought, disease and pestilence. <br /> <br /> sexist law calls a day Bathsheba have KOSTOCHKOVYBIVNYE death. David shows the weakness in his previous actions, but here he steps to the plate and asked what all this is put on it. He even puts his hands on the Ark of the Covenant, which was an instant death, as shown in the film. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of this is that God delights in the guts, even if you are not right, and it allows you to David and forgive them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon, and she and David are the ancestors of several heirs to the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah as long as they both won. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is sampling Bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage to Uriah plays Kieron Moore. The only thing that gets called Moore a good fight. I liked the performance of Kieron Moore as back bravely and quite stupid horse. <br /> <br /> No one can lay down the law as Raymond Massey. His Nathan the prophet, according to John Brown's character, which he played in two films, the same intensity. <br /> <br /> So, when his own law called for death, why God repented Beersheba and keep David on the throne. Maybe it was the fact he did not want to coach third guy for the job. He was replaced by Saul David already. <br /> <br /> But I think that the Christian interpretation may be that this was a hint of the New Testament implies that one can sin and get the grace, if anybody asks for it to blame. I will leave it to the biblical scholars present interpretation. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you can come up with an entirely new theory.
