I really thought that they did * excellent * job, there was nothing wrong with it at all, I do not know how the first commentator would say that it is terrible, it moved me to tears (I believe all moved to tears), but I try not to cry in a movie, because it's uncomfortable, but this one got me. It was SOOO good! I hope they release it on DVD, because I will certainly buy a copy! I feel that he renewed his faith and given me hope that I can not explain what made me strive to be a better person, they have been so many, and we kind of take it for granted, I think. Compared with this, I feel that our own tests, nothing. Well, not nothing, but they are almost in line with what they had to go through. I loved it. Who played Emma?
