I've seen this movie several times and for the life of me, I can not understand why some people compare it BABE. This film is not about the secret lives of all animals that can talk secretly. Instead, we are talking about the parrot that learns to speak, to help his owner, a little girl with a serious stutter overcome its bitter only to separate from her heart-wrenching scene at an early stage. Then a great journey begins. Paulie the parrot sets out to try to find him a great friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> Along the way he meets a number of prominent people, and many unpleasant people. He falls in love with a girl and a parrot loses it. He gets tricked into a life of crime, and then caught a bad scientist who wants to exploit it. <br /> <br /> He tells his story with a cute janitor in the laboratory, who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie. <br /> <br /> Shalhoub light, affectionately janitor who has an open mind and a big heart, and who decides to help little Paulie, despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across. <br /> <br /> There are some suggestive language, but this film is suitable for most children and even more if their parents join in on the fun and watching, too. It's witty, clever, animal epic adventure and ultimately a great love story about the birds and the little girl. He was looking for Marie ends quite unexpected surprise to most people who don ;. T know much about parrots <br /> <br /> The children who saw the savage tribes Green parrot in Los Angeles and Pasadena are particularly useful to see the film and understanding of birds, especially parrots are not disposable pets. All children in the world will see that pets form themselves, and that love and loyalty to a dog or a parrot is a gift to cherish. <br /> <br /> do not BABE here more incredible journey with a deep attachment twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to tear up at the sad parts.
