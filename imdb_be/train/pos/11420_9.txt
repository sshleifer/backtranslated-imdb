This film is all about the subtleties and difficulties of navigating the ever-changing customs borders, race relations and desires. Of course, this is not a film for everyone. There are no car chases, no buildings, no exploding homicide. Drama is in tension, the proposed views, minimal gestures, spatial boundaries, lighting and things left - sometimes very ostensibly - unsaid. It is about identity, memory, community belonging. Various parts of the movie work together to reinforce themselves and other motifs, identity, desires and limitations losses. He will reward the attentive and responsive audience. This angered those whose tastes require blasting, massive, spicy action. This beautifully filmed human history. That's all.
