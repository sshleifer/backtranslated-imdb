I was able to see this at the International New York Film Festival in November 2005 with my friend. We were both very impressed with the complexity of the story and found it to be emotionally moving. It was very well directed with strong imagery. Visual effects were amazing - especially for short. It was the original fantasy approach to the very real and serious theme: The film is about a young girl who attends a demon victim to help her situation with her father hard. There is also a surprising twist at the end, which caught me off guard. It leans towards gothic feel. I would like to see it as a full length feature film. - Carrie
