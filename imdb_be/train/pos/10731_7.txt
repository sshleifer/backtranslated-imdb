Notice version of DVD, there seems to be no scenes or lines between the wiring and start-up BSH. <br /> <br /> They must prove that they can win the right to sit in BSME except green team. <br /> <br /> Another scene, as in the time of their failure in the simulation, Kevin gets Joaquin to clam down. <br /> <br /> I think VHS edition except for ABC, would be all the missing things. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I would like to know which DVD release has the missing material. <br /> <br /> DVD I watched feels edited for television.
