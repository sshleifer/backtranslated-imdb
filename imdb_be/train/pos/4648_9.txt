Cheerful, flags, intricate, brilliant film. It reminds me of Bunuel's L'Age D'Or or the Holy Mountain-- many Jodorowsky in strange characters on tap and are looking for ..... what is it? I laughed almost the whole way through, all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the affected and sometimes frightened reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Exciting through and through, from the beginning to the guts and innards poisoned all the way to the end if it was the end. I just wish I could remember every detail. It has sometimes at me. <br /> <br /> To be honest, though, I have only the most positive memories of this film. Does not seem to be available to take home and watch, I suppose I'll have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover comes my way again with its large slide show (and subsequent "What is it?" Screening) ... I saw this film in Atlanta shortly after being involved in a rather devastating car accident, so I was a little taken aback at the time, which was probably a very good state of mind to watch the prophets speak arthropods and brakes in superhero costumes and godlike Glover its appropriate setting husky-Q, apavgolyya girls are raised off the floor, as a great Dadaist wet dream. <br /> <br /> This Statement of life as we know it? Of course, all WAITING art of being simple. I prefer to think that the truth is becoming more evident in the absence and in the negative space. What you do not tell us that we must conclude, but it is much more accurate than a lie that other people feed us every day. Most likely a "What's This" 5000 films as "Titanic" and "Sleepless in Seattle" (shudder, gag, groan). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Glover (optional fun person to look at the screen or on the Great slide show - smart, funny, quirky, and brutally hot). Make more films, writing more books, to keep alive a nightmare.
