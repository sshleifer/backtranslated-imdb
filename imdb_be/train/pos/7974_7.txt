I found this film to be an ordinary French spit in the face of America. The camera, too often focuses on people who are overweight, on the inaccurate homes and sticky countryside. While the story seems to sympathize and admire the small town people are introduced to the audience, film exploits, and humiliate them. There were, of course, thin people, which will be considered in the Glencoe and Equal organized homes, but Mull decided to show us the worst of what could be seen. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to show the American public the worst elements. I can assure you as a frequent guest in France, it is not all good there. Foreign immigrants are easy to digest, thereby creating serious social inequality. But the Americans do not want to expose the French for their bias against their own countrymen and their envy of the United States, so we are likely to see a movie on this subject no.
