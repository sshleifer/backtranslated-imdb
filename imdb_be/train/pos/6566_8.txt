Have you ever wondered where the idea for the romance novels and other papers released back come from? According to «Jake Speed» they are based on real people, living out the adventure they write and publish. This film is a quality family entertainment, a moderate amount of violence, and poor clothing at worst. Language, too, is not a problem, and the jokes are funny at all levels. This view "Austin Powers" in the "Indian Jones", no more tricks stamp of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this film for children in the 10 to 15 range.
