I first came across "My friendÂ» Tutor chance that one or two years ago, when the TV is surfing. Before that, I never watched any Korean films before in my life, so that the MTF was really the first Korean film I've ever watched. And, what a wonderful surprise! I was totally impressed from beginning to end, and had a great time, laughing. His comic style is very different from those of Hong Kong comic movies (which I was used to in my entire life and, therefore, tired as well), to breathe fresh air into my mundane movie watching experience. I thought you were a lot of scenes and stunts in the MTF, which is quite funny, witty and original, too. <br /> <br /> I watched MTF for a second time a few days ago, and after watching it once already, surprise / comic effect on me, kind of wears off. That is, however, in no way adversely affect my opinion of the film. Instead, something else has come through this time-it was moving mechanical story of how two young, it would seem, the "enemies" that you are completely incompatible to throw together, and how they gradually resolve their differences and begin to take care of each other, not understanding the feelings he reminds me of bygone days of high school. For me, Su and Wang Ji Hoon, in fact, compatible, because they both have something that is pure and true in them, a characteristic that distinguishes them from people, as they say, arrogant girlfriend. <br /> <br Ji Hoon in /> The film is divided into two parts- the 1st part is engaged in a "struggle" between Su and Wang Ji Hoon, and is a stronger and faster pace. After Ji Hoon gets a pass in his final examination and Su Wan dance (according to Ji Hoon) a provocative dance, things begin to change. The tempo slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes that he cares about Su Wan more than he could have imagined. So Part 2 is devoted to the development of their mutual feelings, leading, of course, a happy ending, accompanied by the final battle with the gang boss. <br /> <br /> Just one last comment. I believe that it will be a little unbelievable- the fact that the 21-year-old self-proclaimed "bad boy" would feel uncomfortable being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his "cool" just a little bit ... odd. I think that shows that Ji Hoon just a boy of pure heart and not quite what it seems to look. By the way, Kwon Sang Woo (Ji Hoon) DO have a sexy body and perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF, definitely in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.
