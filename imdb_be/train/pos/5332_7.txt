In light of the bad reviews - or car crashes - I feel obsessed to get a transfer and to send, to give credit where due, and do maintenance. I'm not sure that people have a license to say that it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to have suspense. This film kept the unknown is the whole length of, for me, in spite of any shortcomings that may be. How many movies can say that? Not even many large. Due to a simple premise, you never know when people will get out of life-threatening situation in which lasts the whole movie. Yeh, the suspension has been tough, and over some bumps shocks have done their job. This is not just a TV movie, but the film all the action; there is a point where it stops or a person, or becomes Talky. It would be difficult to make a film like this, always on the road. Only duel, or the speed of it, I remember. The best thing is that they have also been a constant voltage <br /> <br /> IV not bad :. The judge is just as good as before, and others. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT well. But the jury, as sometimes it can be - or appear to - a little crooked. What seems unreal it is not necessarily so. Your first decision is not always right, but I think that the leading actor was right that in this movie. <br /> <br /> Stunts mostly amazing, especially for a television movie. Their only drawback may be noticeable, and again obviously slower rate. But we all know how deceptively slow cars Grand Prix might look like. <br /> <br /> I liked that the beginning said, "inspired by a true story." So, you're not going to go as far as the truth? You know, just the basics. Normal "is based on a true story" makes me think that this should largely be true. But maybe it's my fault <br /> <br /> how to keep them :. Good idea reviewer to offer tow truck to lift the rear wheel up. Only a few inches will do. stunt driver can do it at 100 miles per hour. It is strange that they did not call the car expert - or auto mechanic or electrician. - to see if there is a way <br /> <br /> I hope that this review will put in the opposite direction that the disaster film. Or at least neutral. And help her to become a stunning success <br /> <br /> Pic quality is a little soft for DVD <br /> <br /> Spoiler: .. They would have been winched after the child, but it is surprising that the idea of ​​life-saving skill is considered in some playful conversation to fade it. I think we know why. The end of the film. Suspension of disbelief out the top window with a child.
