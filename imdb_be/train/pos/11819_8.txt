Just I took it on DVD and watched it again. I love bright colors vs. dark pattern. Not a big fan of Beatty, but this is a great popcorn movie. Pacino is amazing as always, and well, this film marked a time when Madonna was her absolute sexual. I want it to be stuck with «Breathless» to look at for a while. The first really big role Charlie Korsmo, other than, "What about Bob?". makeup effects were cutting edge and still keep the most part. Beautiful scenery and mood transport you straight to the comic strip medium. Cars, wardrobe, buildings, and even the street lights ET great tons, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the scenes with a lot of red can get a bit annoying, because it tends to blur the bit. Just I want Beattie got the chance to make a sequel. All in all, a fun few hours.
