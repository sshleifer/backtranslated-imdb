Errol Flynn was one of his favorite roles like cocky braggart with live Irish family, who went on to become a world champion at the time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) went around claiming that he "can beat anyone man alive ". Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably one of the best performances they had ever given on the screen. <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh sent a colorful history with a strong style, capturing the family life, as well as scenes that warm the heart and full of good humor. All contracted players Warner make a great shot - including the always reliable Alan Hale as a irrepressible father Flynn, was proud of the martial abilities of his son, and Alexis Smith, who makes the most of its role as a girl daring society that loves taking Flynn down a peg with daring one-liners do with his boastful manner. <br /> <br /> The whole atmosphere of the 1880s are captured in a nice B & W, though it's too bad Warners had no more faith in Flynn, to make a film in color. It comes in a rocky phase of his career in the cinema at the time, engaged in highly publicized rape trial that had all the tabloids busy sorting things. <br /> <br /> fight scenes are some of the best ever choreography for the screen, with Flynn, apparently in good shape and make very little use for most doubles action. A scene where Bond turns his award plaque Flynn at a public meeting is one of the best moments in Ward's long career as a character actor <br /> <br /> In summary :. Interest leads all the way to the end, regardless of whether you are a sports fan or not.
