I read the negative comments before watching this film and even then, when I went back and started watching. I admit that I had to rewind quite a few times, as the film is incredibly complex, and involves the complete details. It's a good thing, but, quite unexpectedly, in this culture chases, explosions, gratuitous sex and general violence, replacing the plot and character development. The fact that the desired departure, however, I was so used to not pay much attention to what I see. <br /> <br /> This film is full of character and the storyline; the kind that we used for the analysis, when I was in high school. It requires the actual mental participation from the audience. What a nice change. I would compare it with the "Men All the President in terms of the total subjects. That is, it is a mystery intensive misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with sufficient influence on officials, in fact," own "them. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the "President of All Men, the film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters are real identity. In this sense, the film is the character study as «The Negotiatior» Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In this film, their characters are employees of the city and the plot is very intense. Nevertheless, the plot depends on the ability of its characters to work together, to trust others, and ultimately unite against the corrupt police department. There is still fire a gun in this film and the specific story is different, but in general, have much in common. <br /> <br /> I will say that the municipality requires much greater concentration. In fact, I was struck by how parallel it was in the past and present political scandals that I have seen in my life to go back to Watergate. The fact is that the public knows that something is wrong, of course! but after the parts difficult to make. This film is not even close to be as complicated as real life, but in fact it is really life in its complexity. I think it's one of the reasons that the previous posters criticizing the film :. unrealistic expectations <br /> <br /> If one looks it, knowing that they are going to see and experience, it is really great! I watched it 3 times in a row! The acting is excellent and flawless direction. The weakest link is the focus Cusack in.
