One thing I can say about this movie is good for a long, long time! I actually just bought this film a couple of months ago, seeing that there is a new version comes out. I was pleased to discover that it was done in 1978, because 70 years (although I've never lived in them) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music! When I watched this movie the story was really very good in the beginning but then after about 50 minutes it started to get very boring and repetitive. I admitt animation made me impressed! There was nothing I had never seen before, and it was good to see a very cool. but the film honestly could have been a little better, it could have been much more to say and the story than just 15 to 20 minutes of scenes that just had a strange fight. the film took, and again got a good, but ended suddenly in the last 5 or 10 minutes. in my opinion, I thought that it was a long time ago. I know him 13 minutes to 2 hours, and that for a long time cartoon, but because it was boring for most of the film, he made it seem like it was a long time 4:00 !!!! but overall it's a good movie, I think, and I'll watch it again on one of those "do nothing" days. I will see a new, and I hope it's better!
