Japanese cyber-punk movies have never really done a lot for me, but of the few I've seen most of them were at least visually interesting, and at least in the main entertainment. Meatballs machine is the exception. <br /> <br /> storyline is not about types of parasites who take over human hosts, takes control of their bodies, turning them into «necroborgs», and forces them to fight each other for the sole purpose of absorption of each other - It can be seen as "play" to implement these parasites. The film mostly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other, but whose love-affair stops as the infestation, and forced to fight each other. It becomes a test of human will against the parasite control over their physical bodies ... <br /> <br /> meatballs machine will be unchanged compared to Tetsuo (most cyberpunk films), and for good reason, there are certainly some thematic parallels, although the movies, of course, different. There's a lot of fun, splattery moments meatballs machine and creature / Borg the FX, of course, the high point - a mixture Teego meets GWAR's, both of which are complex and inventive. Depending on your taste for these types of films, meatball machine may or may not be your thing. If you like the hyper-kinetic cyber-punk movies with a healthy dose of the spray - this is one for you ... 7/10
