This short was nominated for an Academy Award, and I want to win it! Mostly filmed zhemseyshn between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Jo Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood often embraces jazz (in particular, animations, believe it or not), but it's a rare look at the film in an improvisational jam. This was added to the list of stored movies, and deservedly so. TCM has been in as a filler and periodically run it every once in March for its 31 days of Oscar "tribute. From the city center at the buzzer, whistle, nothing but net and shot in such a smooth network barely moved. The most solid and highly recommended !! !
