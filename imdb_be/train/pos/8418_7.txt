Russian director emigrant in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) throws his epic about the Russian Revolution, and hires an old general who was in from the tsarist regime (Jannings) play the commander of the film, and two to relive the drama and the memory of a woman whom they share (of Evelyn brent), 11 years ago. <br /> <br /> Try as I might, I feel that it is difficult to warm up to «The Last Command» for all its virtues. "Docks of New York" was undoubtedly a great film, and "Underworld" is a movie that I've always wanted to see, but «The Last Command» pretty big going. The premise is interesting, but it really does cure the script come to life, with the exception of sequences in Hollywood, which shows Breadline employable extras and manipulation of a large film production with state-of-the-art technologies. <, Br /> <br /> Jannings is, predictably, an amazing Russian general, distinguishing between odd injured and infirm ex-general stood in his suffering, and vigorous, hearty officer last. <br /> <br /> the ending is great and worth the wait, but to get there you must be willing to be a little boring at times.
