Surprisingly enjoyable effort, combining appropriately contrived plot involving Adam and Burt, and flashbacks to the original series. Most retrospective scenes were lifted directly from the book Burt Ward Â«Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights," and I believe that his book was the inspiration for the creation of this film. As in the book, he left a supporter of the original series Hungering more. <br /> <br /> If you missed this show, it's certainly worth the effort to take a tape from a friend who might have recorded it. I make a copy for their children now.
