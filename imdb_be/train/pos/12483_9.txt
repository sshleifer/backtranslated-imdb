While I was in this film plays the role of Sheriff Hodges, she still managed to get me to jump in several places, and believe me, I'm not that easy. You can say that I am biased about the film, and, well, I do, but I have not seen the finished product before 12/27/2006 and was very pleased. I'm not a horror movie fan per se, but I like the old «B» films and black-and-white films Sci Fi. This film will make you "think" you know, if something happens, then it is not, then it does. It will keep you totally off balance. I would suggest watching the movie first, then music director and features. It is so well written, directed and filmed, and I can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew. I sincerely hope to be a part of Brian Lawrence and future projects.
