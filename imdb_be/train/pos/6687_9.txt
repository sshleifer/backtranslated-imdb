Although I can not claim that comic fanatic, I have read my fair share, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this film, and I was not disappointed. He has run out of steam towards the end, he was almost overflowing of ideas, and I think, Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, left on the floor of the room. In addition, little Hank Azaria in the Blue Raja can go a long way. However, it is easy to forgive all these faults, if you have a movie that is fun. All the actors seem to have a blast with their roles, particularly William H. Mays as a straight arrow in the shoveler and Janeane Garofalo as the bowler. And unlike some, I found the city of design to make jokes even funnier. I also liked the disco music of choice was the bad guys; somehow, it seems appropriate.
