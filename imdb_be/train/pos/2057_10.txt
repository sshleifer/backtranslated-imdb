There was not a day, I felt in 2002, where I pursued a scarecrow that this film is a serious problem handled well <br /> <br /> It brought back many memories, as it was so realistic, <br /> < br /> even today I have nightmares about corn on the cob, and can not even go near canned things in my life the fear <br /> <br /> I have to admit, though, at some point in the film I have to turn it off as he hit too close to home <br /> <br /> for those of you who have never been attacked by a stuffed, watching this film you might be aware of you m, as it felt for us sacrifice <br /> <br /> This film teaches us not to take life for granted or dirty with corn, believe me, I was there, and I have the scars <br /> <br / > See the film, his strange and educational
