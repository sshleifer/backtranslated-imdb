Future Things that uncommon rarity, a movie about ideas. Many movies are visions of the future, but several attempts to show us how the future held. The first part of the film, when the war comes to Everytown, a short but powerful. (Oddly enough, the viewers of the film in its year of release laughed at reports that the enemy planes attacked England - peace was at its height prediction Wells confirmed very quickly ..) Assembly endless war that follows, while overshadowed by the sub-par model work is the most effective. Explanatory names are strongly reminiscent of German Expressionism Graphic Design. Artistic director was great William Cameron Menzies, and its ruins are many Everytown among his best works. Margarette Scott is very seductive, as the chief mistress. Everytown 21st century is just as striking design. The current in the history of the 21st century is not convincing - perhaps it was an attempt not heard a contrast technocratic rationality that time barbarism 1970. Unfortunately, the model of which is angry crowds rush down elevated pedestrian walkway, it is ridiculously bad and could make much better, even with the 30-ies of technology. This is particularly outrageous, as a giant airplane scene very convincing. It paid off a great speech Raymond Massa, who ends the film - rarely has the ideal of scientific progress have been identified as good. Last question Mass more relevant than ever in the era of highly trimmed manned space flight. The scene is facilitated by mixing musician Sir Arthur Bliss, whose name I am proud to share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, VHS version of this movie is absolutely horrible, serious technical problems. Most versions have been cut rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines, which takes us from 1970 to 2038, I hope there is a good DVD of the film.
