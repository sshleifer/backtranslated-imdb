Just saw the film, and a terrible thing, people talk during the movie sounded just like actors. The film had its moments, but lagged behind and was very sick. All this was intended to be a farce, but once you see the miserable lives of people in the movies, you think to yourself, "Man, as it is all around us," All attempts to obtain the sympathy of the audience will be broken, as the actors do a silly after another. On the positive side, there are some great (and funny) insult. I think I'll wait for the video, but it was a good laugh. Warning- Jerry takes his shirt off during the movie !! (Not very nice!)
