Columbo top notch from start to finish. I especially enjoy the interaction between Columbia and murderers, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As an ardent supporter of Columbo, I can not remember another in which it does not establish the killer in the end, as he does in other episodes. In this way he is trying to determine the correct sequence of frames and "message" that his nephew was left behind, it finally dawned on him. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is very good as well as many others.
