I have not written a review on IMDb for the longest time, however, I felt compelled to write this! When searching for this film, I found one particular review, which urged people not to see this movie. Do not pay attention to these ignorant people! Nothing fancy film, full of laughter and above all ... imagination! Are not you sick and tired of being forced feeding of the same old cycle of garbage gum movies? Sometimes a film like NOTHING comes and gives you something you have never seen before. I do not even care if you do not like (even hatred) film, but nobody has the right to discredit the film. IMDb has a monumental impact on the reputation and no negative review should not discredit the film as it is. Just say that you hate and why you hate ... but do not try to tell people that they should not watch it. We have our minds and make our own minds thanks. <br /> <br /> If my opinion is nothing good, I would say that more and more people will enjoy this film, as opposed to those who hate him. <br /> <br /> Indulge your mind a bit of eye candy! See NOTHING!
