I'm not sure under what circumstances the director Visconti decided to film the novel by James Cain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I am not even sure if Viscounti acquired the rights to the book), but in the end the film is certainly interesting. This is not the best story of Cain (I like the best version of 1981), but thanks to the excellent directing and casting Visconti Clara Calamai and Zhirotti (very sensual pair), it is a must for fans of film noir. Visconti Neorealism mixes with the noir sensibility to great effect. The film is not perfect, however. My main complaint is that the film is a bit too long for its own sake; plot moves at a very slow pace (I do not think that Visconti was very good at editing their films). I think the film noir works best with short-time work. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. Anyway, just as I love this movie, and remakes, I think that no one has made a final version of such a high evaluation of Cain's books.
