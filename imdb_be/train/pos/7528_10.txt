If this film strikes you (as it was with us, and, apparently, the other at the commencement of the theater), how disappointingly thin, it may be because the subject itself is a little disappointing. The film introduces us to accurately Bettie Page as she probably was, almost playful innocent rural South, whose career as a "movie star queens of the universe" was just stupid, natural fun for her. Its possible moral, religious conversion and the sudden departure of the Kabbalah and nude modeling biographical accurate, but it is difficult to understand, given how serene she seemed her existence. <br /> <br /> There are many reasons to see this movie, even so, not least of which are strange to Noir & w cinematography B. Mott HÃ¶pfel III (complete with old-fashioned wipes and dissolves) 1950 s-correct actions cast under the direction of Mary Harron, pitch-perfect performances of some of our most underrated supporting cast (including Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts, and Victor Slezak), not to mention Oscar worthy and technically complex lead work Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> Ms, Mol makes some scenes completely naked and the majority of others in a strange period of underwear and "special" costumes (nicely collected costumes John A. Dunn), but it is surprisingly fun studied supports Bettie Page, in her magnificent body. To view Ms. Mol, like Ms. Paige, who seeks actress, progressing through a level less "bad" listening and effective student scene to see, really beautiful actress in complete control of his craft. <br /> <br /> scenario can not effectively lead us in 1950 to America, where child sexual abuse, lawless abduction and rape, as well as the legal suppression of pornography brands that now seem ridiculously tame, it is a reality. 50s in New York wakes up with a smooth-cut among news reel frame. 50s in Miami comes to life in a super-saturated color 16mm style. Real Bettie Page seems worn, smiling and posing in front of us, and yet the effect surprisingly light, almost indecent and dangerous. <br /> <br /> How strange that the biggest icon bondage should be so lacking in the venom and it is technically an excellent biopic should have so little sting.
