And I'm a fanatic Nicole Kidman. I would pay to see and hear her read the phone book in Moscow, which as far as I know, she may do as she says in Russian in this film. <br /> <br /> All four of the leaders is fine, but the film itself is some good shots and the best scenes held together by nothing. <br /> <br /> While one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie, this one asks too much of the viewer. <br /> <br /> This may have been a very funny (it's in parts) or quite scary (it's in the same scene), but the director did not seem to know where to go.
