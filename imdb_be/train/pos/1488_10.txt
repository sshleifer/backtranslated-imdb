This is one movie to see if you want to marry or married couple. Film portrais couple in Italy, and has to deal with such complex topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling work and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" that we are experiencing now badly and that movie in the world, will definitely make you think. <br /> <br /> A must see. I hope that it gets distributed as it should be. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the actors and the director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs up and evaluation of 10 stars from me!
