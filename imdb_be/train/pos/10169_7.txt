Over Her Dead Body was a good little movie.It was decent and interesting, while still quite funny.There were somewhat clich√©, but I found the best material fresh.At first I did not think it would be good at all if he began out.If you can go through the first 20 minutes, though, the film starts to get more interesting.This film does not burst out laughing cheerful, not OH MY GOSH wonderful.It was just a movie, you can sit back and enjoy how nice it was .I do not see how this film was bad.It rating is just a bit too low.I could have dealt with the 5.5 and 4.8? Moreover, giving this film 1 is disgraceful.It was pretty good, and there was nothing about it enough to give it a 1, which is something that most people gave him terrible.
