Although this film is not a classic by any stretch, it is very interesting, as I remember. I saw him about 15 years ago on HBO, and loved the movie. It was written by the same guy who wrote and "Arthur", and although it's not as funny as the movie, it shows the potential that Steve Gordon reached with "Arthur".
