I watched it last night with low expectations. Due to the fact I do not usually like "made for TV" movies and rarely I liked it "cast reunion" movies. But criticism of the Los Angeles Times, it seemed like it, so I gave him a chance. I am glad that I did. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves. But, in a sense, they act as their own, "Batman and Robin". They had to be mannered and not taking on, or this film too seriously. The film begins with their search for "George Barris" designed the Batmobile that someone stole before he was to be auctioned for the orphanage. While they are looking for a car, they also recalls a series of what they did together. This is stated in his memoirs. It was well done. Actors who they got for a young Burt Ward and Adam West were dead on. And for television movie, he got to the last of their actual behavior on and off the screen. I give it a 9/10, I liked that a lot.
