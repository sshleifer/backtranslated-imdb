This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc does not have any special features, or even the menu, but it's not necessarily that I care. <br /> <br /> I am inclined to judge the films in each case, depending on, among other things, if it's a big production studio or less of the film. It is less a movie, and I'm willing to forgive the small things. Nevertheless, I believe that it is one of the most creative and original title sequences I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the acting of all the major players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani may come across as unrealistic for some people, but I personally know real people with emotional problems that are very easy to look at the solutions of life as her character is doing. It helped me to pick up the nuances of where she is sick could go through the plywood of her humor. <br /> <br /> This is not a film for children, obviously, but it is not involved in the gratuitous sex and poverty. There is quite a lot of adult language, though, but sometimes it can be very funny. (In particular, the character of Alan Arkin, which can not even swear properly.) <br /> <br /> In addition, observe the cameos of famous actors of character.
