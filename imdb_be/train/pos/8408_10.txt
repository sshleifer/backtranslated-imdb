"It was not me! It was, um, my twin brother, Rupert! "Bobby said arc confronted about over at the site Sally. I used that line dozens of times over the years (no one has still believe in it, though). <br /> <br /> This film is one of the all-time best for pure fun and nonbelieveability. Steven Oliver was perfect for the part of the arc, so it was in 1978 in "Malibu Beach" as the same character (not a lot of screen time, though). <br /> <br /> "Nobody calls the arc and, turd!" is another line for ages. This classic film is definitely worth the price of admission.
