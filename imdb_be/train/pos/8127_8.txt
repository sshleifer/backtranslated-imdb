While little progress instructive on how saving grace of mankind, this is a great movie that predicts the sci-fi blockbuster special effects that will take another 40 years to come to the silver screen. He predicts the global chaos of World War II, but extends to the background, with the conflict over the past 30 years, and then tells the epic story of human struggle out from under the rubble and in the bowels of space. Act seems wooden and surprisingly sterile, but it may be the result of its difference from the visual, which should have been quite exciting at the time of release of the film, and which is still impressive today. This is a film not to be missed at all, at all interested in the SF genre.
