Spectacular film of the four city slickers in a crisis in Appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity. Each of the four businessmen solve their darkest fears as they solve complex Whitewater trip on the river is about to be replaced by a causeway. If the locals along the way decided to "have their way" with uninvited, this leads to the death of several people and injured loads for those who survived. Each of the travelers is outstanding, although Voight gives the lead and high performance. Rural landscapes and culture are well captured, including an exciting sequence of dueling banjos. I saw this today when he went out, not quite perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it). I kind of remember it as a dig dramatic performance for Burt, Voight has already been established. Nha sort movie you could watch every week, but it has a strong impact and beautifully filmed.
