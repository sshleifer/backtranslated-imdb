When I saw him for the first time I was actually directed impressed.The made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially at the end. Through all the story, viewers can expect to really kill Richard Thomas, or he will do it first.But..the important not conflict but..FRIENDSHIP! Old and mature one prayed to himself, to save the young, which has a lifetime life.It strange. Every time I watch it, I love it! Of course, it's pretty violent as the one fighter, but I think that this is acceptable. Many thanks to Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Awesome movie! I advise everyone to see it.I am sure that people will not regret it and will really have a good time.
