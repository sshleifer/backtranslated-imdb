"Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode as the other nations of the world were not tame animals, but the Europeans do, and that explains why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines." --- It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasoning behind this documentary or original book. Please do not spoil this great piece of your simple outlook. The reasons are much more complicated than the one thing you mentioned. Please read this book as an excellent source of information. I enjoyed it a lot. This book even taught as a text book in some universities.
