We have seen this in the "Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things should be stronger there "mouse" than usual. <br /> <br /> Since this film is only 74 minutes, and they had to inflate up to 2 hours of television broadcasting time, they were, and I'm not making this up, commercial breaks, which lasted from 6 to 7 minutes. And during those commercial breaks, they had another advertising in the form of "TV shows", organized on the so annoying Kelly Ripa, loudly declared that magical miracles "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come TrueÂ» <br /> <. br /> again and again, a break after break, Disney took a timeout real movie, to tell us a loyal audience that we need to get a copy of the sequel. Thanks, Disney, for that we services to create a sequel to your favorite gem of the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all this commercialism and cash register bell made a difficult task to get into the actual film "Cinderella", because by the time the commercials were over, I had forgotten where the story was interrupted. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the original "Cinderella" still retains its magic, and the story is still good, although we have seen this countless times. It's a shame that they had to reduce the price of it with all the marketing for what looks like a continuation of chromium.
