It's very, very funny. Do you know how to be a comedy. It also looks very good as Hollywood Spectacular needs. So, what else do you want? Howz about a very good Sally Fields. It is much better here than in anything else I've ever seen it, and it looks so damn good. This film is all that is needed to understand why she is a star. Those eyes! As silent movie star, but better. In fact, all eyes are so good. I used to pretend to be poor TV soap actor with my girlfriend. We wanted to do this thing where you look very quickly from one eye to the other to your partner. They do not do it at all in the soap dish. Excellent. Eyes Have It! (Sorry) <br /> <br /> There's so many great performances, its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear. There's a whole workshop takes place with Kevin Kline how to replay a very very thin. Got that? Yes, he's damn good. So Robert Downey Jr., who has since made a career playing Sumthin Slick, slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, rather than the most talented actress, so charismatic and riveting, especially when she's angry. Even Whoopi Goldberg well, it a natural choice while giving here a few flat delivery a little Zing. Okay, not bashing Whoopi, I heard. <br /> <br /> And then there is the hair. Soap dish was made in the late eighties BIG hair so funny DOOS, as a great character in itself. They become more and more stupid, just like your take effect. Yes, we got the photos. <br /> <br /> dish soap is better than I thought it would be better that I wanted it to be. I'm tired of films that tell me that I have to take care of small, self-center, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie. TV Soap Actors. Soap dish seems happy just to get me to laugh them. Thank you.
