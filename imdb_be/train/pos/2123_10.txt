Of the three remakes of this story, I love them all, I have all three on VHS and annex a copy of this one on DVD. There is simply change the script to make all three of entertainment and re-watchable. In addition any other film has been remade three times with these all star casts in each? Of course, the main stars in these bikes, but too great supporting actors. I especially like how William Tracy Pepi. He was such a scene stealer that I was looking to find other movies it. He has appeared in many, but most of them are not available. Like other comments, I also say - buy this.
