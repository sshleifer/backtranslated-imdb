"Once in the Life" is a very good film. However, this is not good for everyone, due to the extensive use of profanity and violence of certain situations. The film manages to present in anecdotal, believable way, "life" in the New York City areas, where drug problems are important. This image, in turn, are used as decor for the most thoughtful and disturbing drama backed by powerful dialogues (though I had a hard time to understand some of them, because English is not my native language. In the video, it is normal). There is a bit overplayed at times, but I think it fits into the overall orientation Fishburne made a film that gives matter to display more than just a good style of exercise, especially in the time / action control. Symbols, though not simple, easy to apply, and the actors do a good job in their embodiment. By the way, I enjoyed the soundtrack (B. MARSALIS). If you're not a prude, you must love to see this movie once, twice, three times. I appreciated the film 9/10.
