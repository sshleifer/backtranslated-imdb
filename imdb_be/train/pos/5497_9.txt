Great part of the documentary film, giving a vivid picture of a country deeply divided in itself (for further proof, check out some of the comments on the IMDb ...!). It compares extremely favorably Oliver Stone "Commander" (which is basically an examination in depth nostril hairs Fidel). I do not know Chavez is whether all that he represents himself, is another in a long line of Latin American populist "caudillos". And I do not know if he will be able to make good on the great expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is hardly reasonable to expect a film like this, to be able to answer such questions - but of course, I now have a fairly clear idea of ​​what is at stake, and what it feels like to be caught in the middle of a coup. Someone says that the film "We are making history," and that is exactly what the film feels like it's grip. The outstanding material.
