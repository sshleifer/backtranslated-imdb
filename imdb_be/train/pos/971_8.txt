This film is a bit like a German film, The Neverending Story, because the baby magically transported to a strange land to be a hero. However, because of modern technology is far superior, doll and CGI is used to make amazingly realistic world. - one that will blow your socks off because of its realism and scope <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this film, but boy was it a chore at first! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this film is one you can opt out very quickly, or reject it, because everything in the film, it seems so strange. However, give it a chance. Do not think, or try to understand everything that you see - just let the story unfold, and you are likely to enjoy the movie <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is the advice that I would. given to adults who look haunted Miyazaki the AWAY, because it is very similar and has tons of Yokai (Japanese mythological spirits). The big difference between the two is that more Yokai WAR is a live-action and taken much more child-friendly. Although I think more Yokai WAR was intended primarily as a children's film, in the United States, most parents would not want to show it to young children, because it is such a strong, terrible and show some adult behavior. So who is the audience in the West? Well, older children and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-western theme and composition. It's a pretty narrow audience, really! <br /> <br /> While you watch, look at all the strange little touches. In fact, you can watch the movie dozens of times and notice different things each time tiny. A few fun links that I loved was a comment about Gamera, a scene that came with the comment Â«KIDS: Do not try this at home", as well as the use of beer Kirin to allow a person to actually see the Yokai (hmm ... maybe that scene must also contained a warning)! <br /> <br /> By the way, the director Takashi Miike is a difficult one to press stylistically, except to say that none of his stories that I saw did not seem "normal." Some of his films are pretty disgusting and disturbing, and I hated them (especially Audition and Ichi the Killer), and some of them are magical and one of the best films I've ever seen (KATAKURIS happiness). One thing for sure, it's hard to watch one of his films and do not have a strong reaction one way or the other.
