Romantic comedies can really go either way, you know? You will see the one that really juicy, and you'll think you want something a little more realistic. Then, you will see that which is real, but it may be too dim to keep you interested. Or, maybe you'll see something that makes it right, but just can not make you smile. Romantic comedy films tough. You go to have a lot of expectations, and, as a rule, whether you like it's just a question of whether filmmakes anticipate your expectations, or those at the guy or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you have a girl next to you, and you're a guy like me, it probably does not matter all that there is any good movie a lot, you have other things on his mind. To you, I say: "Go with it, the tiger" for the rest of us, I say, "Look _A Guy Thing_.» This is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Since _A Guy Thing_ knows that you are going into this movie with expectations, so he does not claim that his "Guy about to marry meets the woman of his dreams, and this is not his wife ! "The story is going to make everyone happy. Of course, maybe you like it, but maybe it does not ring true, or do you think it's cruel. _A Guy Thing_ covers it. What _A Guy Thing_ makes the whole screen with a better supporting cast, which I have seen in a long time, so if you are not the main story line, you still have something to make you smile. <br /> <br /> If we are talking about seasoned veterans big and small screen, Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hezherti (Airplane!), kokner (Saturday Night Live and Conan OBrayno regularly, Dirty work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (State and Viva Variety), or a new face as Shawn Hatosy (mekhmat) or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), we're talking about a bunch of very talented and experienced actors who know how to use inhaled feature film, steal the show from time to time, and is still a piece of the frame with energy and joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days. <br /> <br /> and it does not detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars, which carry it with you, because it is very sweet and terrib LY well. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) touches as a young professional whose life may be spinning out of control, and Selma Blair reveals an understated brilliance in painting striving secular and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry, except for the guy who really is. <br /> <br /> a lot of success of the film, though, falls at Julia Stiles, right woman in the right place and at the wrong time, and she wears it well. Not so, hell, I do not know when I have not seen the actress in romantic comedies that made her fall in love so easily. Of course, all of this in close-ups, voice, felt a smile, but it's magic, and this is one of the main reasons why we go to the movies in the first place. <br /> <br /> But Julia Stiles's a little unusual grace would be lost if not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly handy in its classic simplicity. This is a film that draws a broken world irreconcilable types of shares, making them fed on each other, to make you laugh, and then comes through with a big heart. <br /> <br /> A Guy Thing is a movie you definitely have seen before, and the filmmakers knew clearly that if they settle down to do it. We have not seen any new romantic comedy from Shakespeare's time; the relative success of this one or that one is completely dependent on the performance of the classic story of boy meets girl. Guy Thing does accept that something like metacinematic edge, often taking the stage in the absurd, to give the audience the opportunity to recognize the powerful emotions and ancient plot device in the game. <br /> <br /> For the record, but even manages to poke fun at a rather traditional structural concepts of sex and gender, forms the center of every romantic comedy, so that even feminists there can get pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> and the guys, I think we can all agree that we want our friends as cool as friends Jason Lee in this film. I will not spoil it for you, but if you are trying to explain to his girlfriend why a pharmacist and a clothing store clerk among the tough guys in the movies, I suggest you simply say, "This Guy Thing» and leave it at that.
