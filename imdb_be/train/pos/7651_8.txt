Interesting TV movie based on the present case, faithful description of one of the leading characters of the prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has a delicate mission of deciding if he will go to court for the death of his brother. But if he goes to him and is Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with acting ability Koteas. It looks like a version of the prisoner's proletarian roots according to «G.Q.» magazine, the language too difficult for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me once again to meet an old friend whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, he spent a few Panamanian prison. The young man, whom I knew had gone, not just because he's older, but because of its impact for a long time in the penal system. There is a prison is a prison, it must be said, but this one is enclosed in a "shot in the heart," is definitely out of this world.
