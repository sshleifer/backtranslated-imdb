I saw this movie when Mystery Science Theater ran in 1993. This is the worst that I have ever seen. So bad, in fact, that by pure freakiness, this movie should get ten ranking, because it has to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Who wrote this script with the children in the form must be beaten. I mean, really, the devil against Santa? Vision of hell? Horrible laugh wind-deer? Forced child labor, racial stereotypes? This is not Sesame Street, is sure.As Crow cries during the show MST3K, «it is a good Alla 'fashioned fuel nightmare! »<br /> <br /> There are a lot of amazing hints and tighten theology. Merlin (presumably Arthurian Merlin) hanging out with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds (ie Heaven). Santa says baby Jesus and sends the letter "g Stork" for kids who are asking brothers and sisters. There are symbols around the castle, which looks like a pentagram or star RAF. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I watch it every year since 1993, and we put who we can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us.
