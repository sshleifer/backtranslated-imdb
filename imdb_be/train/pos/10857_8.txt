Johny to make here is one of his best exercises in style that makes a strong movie with a good story in the yakuza. Election of the new Yakuza boss is the beginning of the war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my view, the violence is wisely used in a context that makes a very strong film gang. I especially love the way he tells the story, moving around all the roles within the yakuza family, and doing what we can see violence as the only way they have to solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> Talking on the technical aspects, the film is a good example suspended, rhythmic and planified way of filming. One of Hong Kong films of the year. It is like Infernal Affairs, but without the light scenes of action violence and intricate plot. It is highly recommended to all fans of Asian films. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my english, it is better to do in the Spanish lol)
