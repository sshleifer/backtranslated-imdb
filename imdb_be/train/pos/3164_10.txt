I can not believe that we do not have that show the 70's anymore. I have all 8 seasons of 70-show !! I totally love it !! I lay in bed every night and watch a few episodes before I go to sleep. At the end of a long busy day, nice to lean back and have a great laugh before you go to bed. I was so bored, they took the show off the air ... at least we still have the reruns !! I hope and pray they come back, at least, the reunion ... How can it be, when Donna finishes college, and we finally get to see her and Eric to get married !!!! Would not it be strange !!! It would be even better if they keep it in a few years !!
