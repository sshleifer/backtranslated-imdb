I first saw this movie on TV a few years ago and truly loved it. Charles Dance makes one of the most feared villains anyone can imagine. His sophistication of such stark contrast with rough good hero. I've never been much a fan of Eddie Murphy, but find it annoying image is a winner: a little Â«Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass." Charlotte Lewis, to use a hackneyed phrase, but only one applicable, radiantly beautiful. Some scenes are strangely created: a dream sequence, a bird, silly fight scenes and climactic confrontation. Through it all Murphy modern man suddenly fell to the eastern myth, dazed and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy romp. As this film we have James Hong, an incomparable actor, scene, however short, to improve the quality even Derek. Since 1955, Hong Kong has defined a fine actor, "a class act" of his profession. "The Golden Child" is silly; it is not perfect; but it has so many life-saving functions, which is a pleasant and amusing fantasy, worth a look. Four years later, I saw a "golden child" again; I enjoyed it even more! It really is great fun.
