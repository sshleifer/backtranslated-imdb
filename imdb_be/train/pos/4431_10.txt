This movie rates as one of my favorite top 10 films. Many people see it for the first time and knowing little about the many themes in the film probably will not understand why I find it so exciting, so I'll try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The film is very rich in historical and cultural ideas in detail, and while it does have a few minor anachronism, they are quite forgivable. Story retelling of the famous duel between the Bank and the Rev. young prince Yoshitsune on Gojo Bridge. During combat, according to the legend of Yoshitsune records Bank and the monk becomes a loyal prince approached. This film is a revision of the story, however, and includes war, dark prophecies, and political maneuvering. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes in the «Mappo» film, which is Buddha's prophecy that after 1000 years of his teaching will fail, and the world would fall into chaos. It was believed in Heian Japan, after the eruption of Mount Fuji and the civil war between the Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji), the world will fall into anarchy, and everything collapses. This time, the demons. <br /> <br /> Next you the way in which the film addresses the issue of training Yoshitsune ball in by Tenku (Raven Goblins) from Karuma. Defeated clans often fled into the mountains and were dressed as demons to scare off the locals. It is said that this is where historically started ninja clans. Yoshitsune image in Gojo nicely fits all. <br /> <br /> Then there's the Bank, and various strains of Buddhism are represented, including many of the Shingon sect of esoteric Buddhism. They are all represented fairly accurately, and simply add a little more, the film manages to convey the power of meditation and Qi energy in a way that makes it an integral part of history, that is, it uses magical realism to add an extra dimension to the film, but does so in a way to make it tactical and threatening. <br /> <br /> all-in-all this is filled with fascinating tidbits and rings surprisingly faithful to the life of this period. Sets and costumes fully and not to be missed very authentic. The soundtrack is excellent, very brooding and ominous. I also thought that the real acting performances were surprisingly good. Bank is a great brooding anti-hero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is depicted as a young man, experiencing its borders and increasingly drunk on his own power, and blowing Tetsukichi ball blacksmith and makes an interesting image of the "common man" and his less than flattering opinion of murderers who think themselves his social Betters. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, in order to understand why this is so good, I really suggest you dig up an old book about Japanese history and see how this retelling of an almost carefree Robin Hood against Little John the story of a bloody tale of intrigue, violence and infernal feed.
