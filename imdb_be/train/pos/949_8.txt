"Telefilm" tend to fall under the trap of low budget and snap shooting schedule, so this film always has a tendency to reverse the trend. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott embodies Scrooge perfectly, completely covering all its cool trends, and still makes it simpathetic character. The volume of production of this film was exceptional, never rely on special effects or Boffo SoundStage adjustment, but based on the depth and clarity of filming on location and strong backgrounds. The film, which, of course, stands alone.
