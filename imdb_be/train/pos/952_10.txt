So that it is made for television movie evaluation only 7.6 on this site? Bah! Nonsense! Without a doubt, this 1984 version of the classic Dickens tale is the best ever made. And so, the dog saw the 1951 version of which was also good, but not good enough. The absence of color is perhaps the biggest drawback of this version, although the effect was great. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott is incredible, like Scrooge. We all know the story of the miserly businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his deceased partner, then three other spirits that evening. Scott right rough, like Scrooge. Unbearable because for some critics, who argue that he is not able to project a newfound joy, he awakens the Christmas morning after the spirits to give him a valuable lesson. But hey, it's George C. Scott. He will never go dancing down the street, in a fit of joy. He has too much dignity, and his Scrooge projects his emotions in a realistic manner. <br /> <br /> The supporting performances are uniformly excellent, as well as costumes, music and scenery. 19th century London comes to life in a visionary style of Clive Donner. The film even borders on scary in a few scenes involving ghosts. Important story about morality shines through in every frame, however. <br /> <br /> You will not often find this version broadcast on TV anymore, and it's frustrating. Version of A Christmas Carol in 1984 should be a mandatory part of every household holiday celebration. If decorations out of the basement, the film should find its way into a DVD-player, at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dogs.
