Realistic portrayal of young love college recruitment, but also attractive to the viewer like me. It has ups and downs, twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two. We rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to the elderly who are not black audiences and show a real life image of young black adults. <br /> <br /> This film takes place on a college campus and the city, where two people meet and fall in love. In the background, various friends and acquaintances situations that affect them better or worse. A typical plot some might say, but it really was a surprise. <br /> <br /> I found myself rooting for the survival of the couple's relationship, seeing my own past in its history. Moments of deep thought and discovery flowed from the performances of the actors. <br /> <br /> This is a bright film that I would like to support those who are young at heart and in love or have ever been in love. Great movie. I will look up to add to my collection of movies.
