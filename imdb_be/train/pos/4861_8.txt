Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot that is in it, of the British woman (Fontaine) in love with an American who is mistaken for Aster, a musical comedy star. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some excellent Gershwin's music, including "Nice work if you can get it" and "Foggy Day". The best scene is «Stiff Upper Lip» number, which takes place in a fun house. <br /> <br /> Astaire singing voice sounds more reliable in this film than it does in others, and he has some great dance numbers. Burns plays it over the top and publicist Allen Secretary Burns. She's fun. The problem, as noted earlier, is Fontaine, who must dance with Astaire in the film's end. Stevens could easily use a double, because it shows dance in a long shot, and it ranks among the trees. I would have thought that it was a double in addition to dance was so bad. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look, despite its shortcomings.
