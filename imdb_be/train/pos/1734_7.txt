I just saw this movie for the first time ever, and I liked it. Her dancing was very entertaining. I read somewhere that she got the role in this film, because she knows how to dance. The scenery was great too. Yvonne is so talented and beautiful woman. We laughed at the silly kissing scenes, but that's what's great about the old movies! I grew up with her on the Munsters and I enjoy watching her in her early films. They can not all be the best out there, but still worth a look to see her act and sing. I am slowly buying all her movies and watch them as I get them. I have a large collection of her memorabilia.
