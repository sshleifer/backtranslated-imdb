Sneaky, ugly, reverse retro-thriller about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!) Killer girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Directed by Scott has no desire to apologize for its essence of immorality for the dramatic structure of the film. Scott either does not know or does not care for 30 years of social achievements. I really do not think we'll see a stronger film in the near future, so you'd better go and see it while you can. Despite the relentless gloom, I think the film is a vivid example of the cinema in its most sinister, operational and effective. Scott has a tough thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. Extraordinary technical aspects of the film are too effective to ignore me. Scott's directorial choice is amazing, and he draws a great performance with Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls should stay away from this, but I recommend it to those viewers who are looking for a great, action-packed film.
