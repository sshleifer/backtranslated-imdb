If you have any heart and compassion for people, it's a tough movie to watch, at least in the second half of this. <br /> <br /> This is a segment where we see a nice little kid get shot down, and then slows down (mentally- challenge) person drunk after he witnesses this hard act against a child. It is not nice stuff. <br /> <br /> However, it is a good movie and the acting is good too. History will sit with you for a while. <br /> <br /> «Dominic" is a mentally handicapped guy and played by Tom Hals. I think this may be the best role Hulce ever. He cared for med students, "Eugene" plays Ray Liotta, who became a star in the next year with Kevin Costner in «Field Of Dreams». <br /> <br /> Dominique is the kind of garbage man reading "Hulk» comic books and likes to fight. He is the type of "slow" the guy who you can not help but root for love and live a happy life. If he worry is a few good reasons, and ... well, to see the film of all time. it's worth your time, but also be ready to go on a real emotional roller coaster, and it may be very upset at some of the things that you see.
