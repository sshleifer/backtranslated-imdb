Well, I overplayed it just a little to compensate for at least one of these grumpy inspections. But I enjoy it. I do not laugh, but he held my interest, and pulled me along without dropping me at any time. History is built. Yes, you know that it will have a happy ending - the genre forever. Meanwhile, it was quirky with gegami you might have missed, so pay attention when you are looking at. Stiller and Black comes professionally again. Good team. They should work together more. I do not know that it would be a cult, but it was certainly a fun ride. Not as good as the Bob and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, but what? It's still worth going out of your way a bit to get and watch this movie.
