Firstly, it should not be brilliant and thought-provoking film, as well as many other reviewers seem to compare. the first review says something along the lines of those who love it does not know anything about horror movies seems to have it the other way around. If you could look back after the movie he really was not designed to be convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But actually, that's all that was aiming, he was supposed to blow the audience out of the net worth of the shock (and all the disadvantages that its visuals were much less noticeable even in the original version VHS). <br /> <br /> I gave this one a high score because he has reached his goal, even if it was not completely awful (in a sense entirely shock), it makes me a little sick and thoroughly paranoid / pessimistic (I'm Waiting " t trust anyone in a week, because I do not want to wake up tense and tortured)
