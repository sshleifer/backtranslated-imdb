Europa Lars von Trier is a worthy echo of the Third Person of the American comes to post-World War II Europe and finds himself embroiled in a dangerous secret. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the US Army during the war, arriving in Frankfurt, as soon as the war is over, to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on Zentropa rail. What he does not know that the war is still going on secretly to an underground terrorist group called the werewolves, who are appointed by US allies. Leopold is strongly opposed to taking any sides, but is pulled and seduced Katharina Hartmann (Zukova), a femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company. Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but pardoned by the American Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine), because it can help to get the German transport system and continue the game. Colonel soon enlists, or power, to be a spy Leopold (without giving him a choice, or a chance to think about it), and see if the Werewolves can carry out an attack on a train. <br /> <br /> Soon Leopold stuck in an adventure, being associated with both sides of the conflict in the mysterious and noir-ish road, where anything and everything is not as it seems. Its amazing to watch the naive deal Leopold with all (his lover, terrorists, Colonel, that annoy passengers, his angry uncle, even officials of the railway company, who come to explore his work ethic), before it finally breaks and humorous and forcibly takes control. The film is infinitely unpredictable. <br /> <br /> film stylishly shot, it always happens at night during the winter with plenty of snow. His shot in black and white with color frames randomly appear everywhere. In addition, the background screen display images that counteract the action from the front images. Add a hypnotic narrative Max von Sydow, and Europe is a magical place that is out of this world. <br /> <br /> Now it's my favorite film.
