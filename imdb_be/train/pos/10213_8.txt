This quirky film had the misfortune to be released at the same time a very popular "Amelie", as having excellent Audrey Tautou plays a central role. Laurent Ferodo, a talented director has made one of the most enjoyable films released in France in recent years. <br /> <br /> The film deals with chance, as its English name indicates. French name makes reference to the way the butterfly wings can create havoc over the Atlantic, as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, I can not believe, just looking at these beautiful insects. From the beginning, the director weaves all the characters one sees in the film, and each of them has a connection with the other, that it is difficult to imagine, but in the context of the film, seems to work well. <br /> <br /> a chance encounter on the subway sets the tone of the film. Irene, that will work, I ask the woman sitting across from her, to tell her that her Zodiac sign, and continues to read from her paper. Irene seems, will cross paths and find her soul mate on the same day. After Irene leaves the train, a quiet young man sitting next to a woman tells her that he has the same birthday as Irene. It seems that they meant to each other from the beginning, but, unfortunately, they will not re-up to the last frame of the film. <br /> <br /> beautiful Audrey Tautou as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, a little to do until the end, but it shows that it has a presence and a well-played a role. The talented young cast is making a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We look forward to the future Laurent Ferodo movies, because he seems to be a director with his heart in the right place and the ear on the way people are connected.
