My children have recently begun to watch reruns of the show - as early episodes by N, and later on ABC Family - and they love it. (I did not know that the show even lasted past the first or second season) I wonder what made all the changes of cast - I have seen them described as "advertised", and another half hour search effort did not find anything on the Internet, but endless comments how early episodes were much better than in the later episodes. (Personally, I do not see the whole big difference - scripts and themes are basically the same in all - but they lose some great people along the way) My daughter has put DVD-ROM, your wish list, so you may land themselves, and comments will shed light all this. I also wish they would do some self-referential humor about the changes - as «Boy Meets World», where they fall sister for the entire season or so, and if another actor later shows, playing with her, they ask her where she was, and she says that "at the top", or if at the beginning of a series of freak marker "Minkus' show up for graduation from high school, they asked him where he was, and he said that" there ", pointing out that part of the audience Sun shows a camera, before you say, "Hey, Mr. Turner, you wait!" and ran the screen (g turner be another a character who left) Oh well - maybe there will be E True Hollywood Story on it or something? I was just glad to see Aunt Hilda show on the final - it's always been one of my favorites - it's too bad it could not be more Embracing the cast reunion. (Zelda Candle just does not cut it for me)
