Pride's father was the best new show of television hits as Family Guy. It was another masterpiece from the talented people at Dreamworks Animation. Like The Simpsons, centers of excellence around the nuclear family (white lions, in this case). It also contains many memorable supporting characters, including Roger surly orangutan, Vincent Italian-American flamingos, white tigers eccentric Blake and Victoria, fake muzzle patriotic brothers and chutney elephant. The rest of the stars of the show are Sigfreid i Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grand way, making the most ordinary events entertainment. The combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialogue and controversial issues (drugs, prejudice, etc.) is the source of the program shine. <br /> <br /> blame for the failure of this show lies on NBC. They decided to broadcast the episodes in any order (perhaps under the influence of which guest stars they can help) rather than a more logical order production. Several times, the show was preempted for an additional half hour of this dreck, like The Biggest Loser (like 60 minutes, which was not enough)! It really is a bad omen for the future of television as an art, if the original and bold show how it fails, and Fear Factor and American Idol dominated. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the complete series was released on DVD and the show now has an opportunity to gain a greater following. 10/10
