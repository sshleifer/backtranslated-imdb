Time paradoxes devil trap drain completely. They are fun to consider "what if?" Kind of way Film producers and writers had to deal with this again and again in many films and television, including. Â«Star Trek: First Contact", "Back to the Future" trilogy, "Bill and Incredible adventures of Ted "," Groundhog Day ", and Stargate SG1 tribute," a window of opportunity. "Heinlein" all you zombies "was written several decades ago, and yet it will still pull people read that short story for the first time. <br /> <br /> in the case of a great film by Terry Gilliam, '12 Monkeys', it is difficult to establish what can s to be continuity in the plot against the elements intended to force us to rethink our understanding of the film. Repeated views will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, seeing the film for the first time, will be regarded Cole, played by Bruce Willis, schizophrenia.

Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time can not be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport intercepted by scientists after it was sent back in 1996, in his personal timeline. <, Br /> <br /> Even that could be interpreted as an event that should have happened in the same timeline of the universe, in order to ensure that the timeline does not change ...

It boggles the mind to dwell on this kind of thing too much. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events, which are then sent to the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the aircraft at the end of the movie, it means that in the future can be changed by manipulating the events of the past ... or does it? The film is likely to lead to a large number of drunken fights in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians
