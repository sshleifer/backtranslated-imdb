I was not sure that in the first case, I was watching a documentary propaganda film or a dramatic presentation. I think, considering the time of production it was a combination of all three. <br /> <br /> However, the dramatic story was somewhat predictable. But you have a feeling that there will be some interesting scenes as the film went on. We were able to observe a seemingly realistic training schemes and equipment. <br /> <br /> When this movie came along it was closer to the end for me. The scenes were realistic (at least as I perceived it), that I do not often come across before. You can put yourself in action and imagine the thought of young fighters. This was mixed with the usual problems of drawing impenetrable Japanese soldiers at a time when you would think real Japanese actors will be somewhat poor. <br /> <br /> The film perfectly as a source of state of American thinking in 1943, as the war with Japan. In addition, interest has been to dig in Japanese on the assistance the US gave Japan in recent years.
