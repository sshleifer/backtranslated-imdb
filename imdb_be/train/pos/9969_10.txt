Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good films. Great film. But nothing, and I do not mean nothing lives to the greatest Christmas movie of all, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The film is so large and has so many messages, I cried watching it. Seriously, this is one of those movies that you want to watch 10 times. If we see, the Pitch get told that he will have an ice cream, we can see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel a deep sadness, and then we wonder ... what's so bad about that ice cream? Whether this means that we, as people treat ice cream as well as all this does is make us evil? Think of the movie makes you think. <br /> <br /> This film has the best performance of Santa Claus ever. Unlike other Santa, he was a normal person. We see him imprisoning children and spy kids dream, and we wonder; Sant is we believe in is actually good? In addition, the Santa actually mentions Christ, the whole point of Christmas. <br /> <br /> You should make yourself watch this cinematic masterpiece. We should just stop making movies and personal air, but this epic 24/7. Whether it is Christmas or not, this film gets 500/10. Anyone who says that this film is a poor ignorant fool.
