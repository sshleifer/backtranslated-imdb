I usually do not have to write a review of the film, but only a comment for this film is still at a rather unfair, so I consider it necessary to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> «Krisana» (or as it was heading to the theater, I saw him, «Fallen») should be Matisse, lonely Latvian archivist, as he tries to find out about the woman he was trying to stop jumping from the bridge, as well as its reasons for doing so. It's the story in a nutshell, but this film has nothing to do with the history of how much this drawing guilty man who is unable to act. As a detective who is investigating the incident said to him, we usually do not bother to take care of the anonymous faces we do not go through every day until after they die. <br /> <br /> The comparisons Michaelango Antonioni and "Blowup" will be most likely to abound in every review you read about «Krisana.» The influence of philosophical and severe Antonioni's style and history of the "bloated" understandable and, in fact, the writer / director Fred Kelemen make explicit reference to this film in the scenes in which Matisse tries to know the woman who jumped from a bridge, or at least one who thinks that he has done. <br /> <br /> The only person to share their views on the film detracts in the "college film class" look and sound of the movie. He or she neglects to consider budget constraints, existentialist Latvian film is likely to face, but atmospheric black-and-white cinematography and surround sound is a success on the artistic level, to reflect the loneliness of Matisse. Background sound wind and street noise gives a sinister aura and reminds one of the Fellini film, not that it was the intention to Kelemen. The filmmakers, of course, had little money, but this restriction is applied to the benefit of the film. <br /> <br /> «Krisana» is a success as a character study with a sufficient amount of humor thrown in to keep it from themselves too seriously. He could have easily hit the attributes of the mysterious stories, but he avoids it and becomes intelligent film about loneliness and guilt. If you are more concerned about the plot, the film and its end might upset you. Otherwise, take the time to deal with it. It is well worth looking for.
