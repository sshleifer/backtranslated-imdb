I saw this movie and I heard, as a writer-director Juan by Gerard, speaking at the Santa Barbara Film Festival Int. <br /> <br /> All that I knew about it, it was the story of 8-year-old boy godu- during the Cuban revolution in 1958, and how it affects his family and home. <br /> <br /> its opening scene will bring to mind the «Cinema Paradiso». In fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: The roulette wheel (Casablanca), "clucking hen" (Rebel without a cause), references to Buñuel, "Touch of Evil"; you will find more. Homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to the Cuban folklore, which often uses a black man as a type of Greek chorus. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is a dream come true. Gerard desire to honor his family and entourage movie that he loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is a true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real, as the events depicted. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and a passionate lover of cinema), but his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became the "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it. Keitel keeps screen powerful as mysterious and secretive grandfather "Che." Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Yale (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (And your mother too) offer strong support for key roles. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the first half of the film suffers from tight delivery lines, and some overracting, but to stay with him. The latter half is much better, as the events of the revolution to unite for a bitter and fair menopause. This is the first attempt to Juan Gerard, but it's really how it is, and his passion and heart really come later, in the genuine first attempt. I would definitely see it again, and I hope that he continues his career in the cinema. <br /> <br />
