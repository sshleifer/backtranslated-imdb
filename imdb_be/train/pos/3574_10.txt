It's hard to tell sometimes why the film is so effective. From the moment I first came across «The Stone Boy», something told me that this would be a great film. Despite the fact that it seemed very unlikely that I'd ever be able to really see it for yourself. Then, one day, looking through the online catalog of my local library, I saw that they recently purchased DVD release of this film. I am very happy because cinema stunning depth and quality of that old VHS copy could never be repeated. <br /> <br /> And if we talk about the film, I have to select it as far and above the most amazing aspect of this film. As a photographer who pursues almost exact visual style painted in «The Stone Boy», I am firmly convinced that the great cinematographer can almost single-handedly carry the film. Here, he has a lot of help from the extremely talented cast and a director who understands that history needs. But to Juan Ruiz Anchiya rear camera makes virtually every scene something beautiful. And you can almost never spoke. Most of the films have not even never expected such a thing from you. Scene after scene captures some of the details, some a bit of visual magic, breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Directed by Christopher Kane, has a long and interesting career. As I understand it, this movie is not very representative of this. But, sometimes, to catch the director began to close his career, before all the big budgets and loss of attention, there is a real subtle magic find. Cain is a step back in this film makes things happen with his own life, and then farther and farther. Just as earlier films by John Sayles, give space characters to breathe, time to talk. Side stories happen because they do, and that's how life is. Cain shows a great, raw, even outright painful understanding of human nature in this movie. <br /> <br /> acting due a big part of the story together. When people say, when they are in this film, they do it like real people, and not constrained by the fact that they are playing the characters. Scenario Gina Berriolt allows extremely talented and respected actors like Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederic Forrest to spend time simply exist. It is what they have to say, are minor or deeper meaning, it all comes down to the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> When you look at the actors who are involved, or a great soundtrack by James Horner, it seems strange that such a film would be almost forgotten. Perhaps much of what makes «The Stone Boy», that it was a period of time, it was made in. There's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me of my own childhood deep. People talk about the '80s in terms of modern styles and music, but it's not the 80 years I lived remember. View images of humiliation and dark knowledge of the quality of the action, and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near the time of this era in North America. I see myself in it. I can see how I saw the world. . And a film like "The Stone Boy" to see the world for what it really is <br /> <br /> For more of this feeling, see: <br /> <br /> The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry by Wolf (1983), Tender mercy (1983), Will (1983), in the heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993) the secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
