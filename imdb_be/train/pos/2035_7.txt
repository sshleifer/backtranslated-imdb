Well, I'm going to go against the grain on this film, so it seems. Being a self-confessed fan of horror, I sat down on it not quite knowing what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes, I actually turned out to be terrible (very rare). The film obviously has a small budget and is set around Charing Cross station, but movies do not have enough money does not distract from the story. Yes, the story a little far-fetched and does not explain myself very well, but the creep of a class act and goes to hell and share everything that comes their way. NOW FOR LADIES !!! There are certain parts of the movie you have to close your eyes, AO, or at least cross your legs !! You'll understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all a good movie and it makes a change to see a good slasher film that really scares
