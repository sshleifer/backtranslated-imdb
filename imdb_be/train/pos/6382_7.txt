Definitely a good idea, the script was just OK.Could were better Positive is that it does not bore you, if you are a lover of adventure, a new idea of ​​Atlantis.Negatives lost world that I personally believe that this the idea was so much more potential than this.They had to end up with more than adventure this.It was not bad, but it would be much better with some more runtime.Enjoyed it a lot, though, Cant say it is was sad whether good..A a good one for those who have not been adventurous animation as Sinbad, the road to al Dorado.This film also It recommended for those who are looking for a nice little adventure with a very good happy ending.
