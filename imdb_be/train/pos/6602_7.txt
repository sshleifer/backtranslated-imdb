Many just like Frank Miller and his comic Sin City uses black and white to express himself (and his film noir influence), so does the Christian Volkman with the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> It is 2054, in Paris, in the tradition of science fiction, the future is bright, brilliant multi-ladder gem. This jewel in the situation of poverty, inequality and darkness; bright and beautiful at the top with a dark underbelly below. One of these "light" people at the top, a research scientist with a very large and influential international companies (Avalon), stolen. A well-known and effective, Captain Karas (voiced by himself the new James Bond - Daniel Craig), will be tasked to find it <br /> <br /> The plot and the location is not too original .. It is strongly influenced by film noir, Neuromancer Gibson and others detectives, as well as films like Blade Runner, Sin City, Metropolis by Fritz Lang and Special opinion. There is a main plot, surrounded by other possible sub-sections, all of which are connected at the end. It is not difficult to understand all this. <br /> <br /> The strength and originality of the film in an intensive visual presentation. Paris complex array of levels and sublevels. At its base is a more primitive production infrastructure. As cities grow, so does its architectural complexity and luminescence. However, in this structure, the upper sun altitude equates with human ideals and behavior. Paris was intricately animated and display in brilliant black and white. The film is closer in spirit to the Sin City (comics), then Sin City film was the starting material. It is becoming increasingly easy, because it is still relatively the same environment; animation. Many just like haze pushing the visual aspects of the story, because it does. Light and dark, black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as a visual ambiguity. Right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning, at the same time it is right in front of us. The film shows how the black and white can be ambiguous and obvious at the same time. <br /> <br /> In accordance with the spirit of the film, I can be as a critic and fan. I can love and do not like in this light. This is definitely an experience that I recommend to lovers of fine art. So pour another black and tan, enter the void and enjoy the ride.
