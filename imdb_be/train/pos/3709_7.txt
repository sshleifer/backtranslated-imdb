Any add John Grisham deserves major Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman directed the past, I would go to for mainstream take on anything. But this southern fried pot boiler is pretty good. Although it is not included among the better Altmann is, of course, it does not refer to the number of films he has made, that will leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking. <br /> <br /> Altman has dropped hat mysterious noir thriller with overtones to this, he had 1973 film "The Long Goodbye". "The Gingerbread Man" is not as good as the movie, but it keeps quite well by themselves. Kenneth Branagh is cocky lawyer who manifests himself accused of murder after he was linked with the client (Davidtz), who enlisted his help in protecting it from the cuckoo's father (Robert Duvall). The film is in Savannah, Georgia during the coming tropical storm, which gives the film an oppressive atmosphere, which I really liked. Twists and turns to the end of the film are clunkier and clunkier, and Altman proves itself not all that adept at staging bullet, but in general the film is not a bad addition to the canon. <br /> <br /> Altman also starring. Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen <br /> <br /> class: B
