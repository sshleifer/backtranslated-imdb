A serious comedy. Ross Hunter production of the film adaptation of a French play Â«Les Joies de la Famille" (later Americanized as "very rich woman") is a plush and molded, sometimes funny ... and, unfortunately, out of time. California wealthy widow who seem to spend their money, it is railroaded his two older, greedy daughter, both of whom are afraid of Mom Rosie carelessly spending his inheritance. The whole issue is vital - but the age - a woman goes to a holiday home against her will, and then to prove himself sane in the hearing, techy stuff for comedy (and to his credit, directed by David Lowell Rich not to overload the picture with stupid jokes or explicit sense). Some of the humor a bit wide and do not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the seriousness inherent in the script and never get into a false note. Sandra Dee as well as granddaughter of Rosalind, and James Farentino very nice, as a young lawyer. The film has so much to say about the importance of our seniors, as well as ways in which they choose to spend the remaining time that the seriousness of the "Paradise!" On the topic is almost lost in the rush of a happy end. The picture leaves you smiling - and at the same time, I wonder how many old ladies there who were never so fortunate. *** from ****
