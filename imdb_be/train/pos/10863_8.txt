Firstly, I must say that I made the mistake of watching the elections movies from a sequence. I say unfortunately, because after seeing the first two elections, Elections, it seems a bit of disappointment. Both films gangster epics, which are similar in shape. And while the election is an enjoyable piece of film ... it's just not as good as it continued <br /> <br /> In the first election the party, we have shown the two rivals for the chairman. Big D and Locke. After several scenes discussions among the "Uncle" who shall have the title of Chairman, they (almost unanimously) agreed that the Lok (Simon Yam) is driving the Triad. Suffice it to say that it does not go very well with the rival Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai), and in an attempt to affect the absorption, Big D steals two uncles to sway the election board in his direction. This has disastrous consequences and is headed by a triad in all out war. Locke intends to become chairman, but will not become official until it is able to restore the Â«Dragon Head wand" material presentation of the Chairman of Energy. The current chairman, Whistle (Chung Wang) hid the wand somewhere in mainland China, and a race to see who can restore it first. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is devoted to the restoration of Baton, How to search for the two leaders to claim that they have to evade the police and the opposite side, which leads to one of the salient scenes in the elections, which includes a bipod under the name Jet (Nick Cheung), a machete, and a lot of bad guys. The presence of Nick Cheung is to capture attention, to say the least ... I wonder when this influence is directed to Johhnie anyway, making re-election, since he deliver more Jet nature in the future. <br /> <br /> while Nick Cheung gives a scene-stealing performance, I should not do justice to the rest of the cast of the film. Election has a large ensemble cast with well-thought-out ideas that are both subtle and affecting. Simon Yam it is usually very nice and the film also benefits from heavyweights HK actors like Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai, and underestimate Suet Lam. There really are no weak links in the action, and can be easy to believe that they are watching real gangsters. <br /> <br /> While the big speech, one of the most impressive things about the elections is Johnnie tos eye for the camera. There are some really bright images in the movie, and it goes without saying that, of course, knows how to frame his shots as a spectator was treated to a series of innovative and absolutely brilliant camera placement and angles. All that makes the choice, first of all, a great looking film. <br /> <br /> My problem arises with the film mainly because the number of characters shift, participating in the elections. It becomes a little difficult to follow, because the film is so full of characters that are not part of the plot. While it prefers to focus on the continuation of the two candidates, the first election offers the electoral process as a whole with tons uncles subordinates, and police officers, crowding into the storyline. Perhaps the film would have worked better if it was a little bit more with more time devoted to the inner workings of the triad, or if the director Johnnie To be sent down the necessary elements and laid on them anymore. <br /> <br /> The bottom LINE- general, it is strange hard film with a great cast, excellent direction and leisurely pacing that packs a punch. It's just a little harder than necessary.
