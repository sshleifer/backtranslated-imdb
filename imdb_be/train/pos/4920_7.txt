No, not really, but it's a very good film indeed, and, unfortunately, forgotten stone. Black-and-white costumes of the film. <br /> <br /> Straight ahead formula that guy had an ulcer, and the government must find everyone he came into contact with before they die. <br /> <br /> Very well directed, and the effect is great. Widmark as a male role well, but completely over shadowed in the current rates of Paul Douglas as a police captain, and Jack Palance (never better than this) and Mostel as the villains. Unfortunately Palance continued to play like characters in some really sophomore gang or war movies.
