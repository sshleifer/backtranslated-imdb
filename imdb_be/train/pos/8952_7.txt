Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) witch. Secretly, it attracts quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). It captivates at Shep, that makes him lose his bride and drop it. Things are going along pretty well until Gillian Sun discovers that she really cares for that mortal man. She decides to tell him his secret. But Shep will react when he finds out that he was "tricked" into falling in love with Jillian? <br /> <br /> As far as comedies go carefree 1950s, Bell Book and Candle good, but nothing special. This is a fairly pleasant hours and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with him. Just not in the movie, expecting the greatest thing since sliced ​​bread. The film is cute, funny sometimes, and touching in the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart are doing their best, and there's a real chemistry. Novak (as already mentioned) looks absolutely incredible in a restrained kind of way. The supporting cast Jack Lemmon, Zhingoldom and Elsa Lanchester often laugh out loud funny and steals a lot of attention from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem that I see that Bell Book and Candle can not quite decide which movie he wants to be. Is this eccentric comedy? It is a romantic comedy? Whether it is a supernatural comedy? If directed by Richard Quinn stuck to only one approach, the movie might be even better and more memorable.
