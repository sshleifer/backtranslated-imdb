This film is good for television. I like it because I'm a big fan of disaster movies, even if it's a family film. Accuracy on the film from the book half-and-half they got the names of the characters directly, but in the book there was no storm chaser, the car scenes with Hatch family fleeing from the tornado was not in the book, but not its part, Dan Hatch and his friend went with a coworker police on the way to the police station for safety. and in the book of Dan and his friend, both 12 years old. That's all I can think of. All in all it was a good movie, although it may be a bit more precise in the book. Did you know that the book was based on the true story of a series of tornadoes devastated a small town in Nebraska in 1980?
