I watch a romantic comedy with some hesitation, for romantic comedies have an age old clich√©, that make a movie uninteresting. As a rule, in the romantic comedy, a girl and a guy, both fall in love, that is the problem, and then defeat the trouble to get married or whatever. But, this movie is a different story, it's really very different from the romantic comedies I've seen in recent times. <br /> <br /> There is a widowed man (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie at a bookstore and talk for a while, after Marie had to go. Dan is developing something for it, and if something begins to unfold the meaning, we get a turn. Marie friend of his brother. Unseen circumstances, flirts with Dan and Marie realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love is not possible. As it became possible to form the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell works well, Juliette Binoche well as Marie. And all the other things are done well. It's a good movie, watch it.
