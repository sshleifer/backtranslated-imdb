TACHIGUI: strange Lives fast food Grifters Japanese title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii Number: Toshi Suzuki, Mako Hayodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Kazu Terada told by Koichi Yamadera - ----- --------------------------------- <br /> <br /> in 1995, Mamoru Oshii has unleashed his dazzling feature animation Ghost in The Shell, which has helped to strengthen the international recognition of anime - and dug themselves into the overall concept of Andy and Larry Wachowski for The Matrix <br /> <br /> sequel film, Innocence (2004), was the inaugural Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and he left the head spinning, as much for his style and innovative effects, how often incomprehensible plot for her. <br /> <br /> Always legislator, Asia is now presented to us Tachigui: The Amazing Lives of the Fast-Food Grifters ?? which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, or Japanese anime on this issue <br /> <br /> greet the creation of «superlivemation» Oshii in :. not quite animation or live action accurately. Rather than cast borne somewhere in the region of 30,000 images, which were processed in digital form and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cut out of style, which is reminiscent of a Balinese puppet. The movement is unusual style stop-motion, which repeats the sequence of pilot Teego Shinya Tsukamoto in :. Iron Man (1988) <br /> <br /> «I could not think of any method, but this," said Hosea, in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project is not suitable for traditional animation.» <br /> <br /> The choice of the cast is equally mysterious. Kenji Kawai - who also wrote the beautiful soundtrack - looks like a ravenous burger fanatic, a well-known producer Studio Ghibli, Toshio Suzuki spends his screen time to be killed by a bizarre way. Others include Kazu Terada, who dabbled with Hosea on Blood :. The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi - special effects whiz who worked on Godzilla movies <br /> <br /> The story of Koichi Yamadera sounds like a dry material NHK documentary ?? which is contrary to the comic subtext here, as well as a broad career in Yamadera expressing stoic anime characters like Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the story itself bizarre reinterpretation after the Second World War, Japan in the context of a variety of fast food on the processes - from soba ramen shops gyūdon stand-up bars; American dogs in heat to the convenience store trays McDonalds- inspired restaurant chain burgers. "Food is the primordial root of desire," claimed Hosea, by way of interpretation. <br /> <br /> mixed on the new generation of consumers: fast food Grifters the name suggests, people who do not like to pay for them Tucker and constantly fine-tune their complex scams to win free Munchies. <br /> <br /> Hosea said that it was not itself a tribute to the "art" there is food on the street ?? it is still considered a bit of a taboo in this country, and that goes some way to explaining the use of «tachigui» in the title. <br /> <br /> The director of live-action films (Avalon, stray dogs) as well as animation, Asia, often blurred the definition between the two environments. Celluloid result here settles somewhere in the gray area between the two formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a visual experiment is as exciting as it can cause irritation. Just do not ask what it's actually supposed to mean; Hosea movies in equal parts of the brain and innovative, often not particularly clear, the story-wise. Where Hosea successfully implemented with the help of a liberal dose of black humor ?? here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, death from hula-hoop, the fastest in the world of the samurai burger chef ?? and in the very nature of the film surrealism. <br /> <br /> This is the man who will be shifted to the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and may need as Andrei Tarkovsky, as he makes David Lynch. So it should come as no surprise that at one stage of the B-52 bomber makes fly- through in the viewing Yoshinoya franchise so. 54-year-old writer and director, seemed to think that it is natural. "Japan, I reflected in the film may not necessarily be true to reality," he said. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> According to the Andrez Bergen
