This is a really cool movie! I remember when I first saw it when I was very young, I used to watch it all the time, just a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really funny, and it's really cool how they train animals to do all these things. Part of the film in sorrow, though (for example, if Sassy, ​​a cat falls waterfall, and when a shadow falls into the hole at the end.) I saw the second Homeward Bound, but I must say that it is not as good as the first. The shadow of a reasonable one, Sassy, ​​well, Sassy, ​​and probability is a funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, or that tell the animal. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!
