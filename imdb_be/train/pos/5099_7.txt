The only reason I came to this film, it's on LITTLE MISS overall DVD, and I recommend watching it, though you do not like it, as well as more well-known film. <br /> <br /> We are Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a swindler and his companion. The film starts quite easy, but it is becoming more dramatic as the first Coop plans to use her daughter to extort a large sum of money from his brother-in-law, but at a meeting with the girls and seeing the discipline she would be subject to his brother -in is the law decides to keep it. Nevertheless, he has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path, and therefore the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper Lombard good and Shirley still she manages to steal the scene. There's little music in it, and Shirley has only one song. However, it is entertaining and worth watching with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
