This film is very undervalued. This is a very creative, creative and intelligent. It's just fun, and, in my opinion, this film is headed first. But the film was forgotten when it first came out, and became even more passes over the years. "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombed at the box office, while the first one was quite good kick and is very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem may be that this movie was just released a couple of years too late. In 1991, Bill and Ted have seemed "so 80s." Despite the fact that the 80 were only a couple of years ago, at the time, the landscape of music and style for children has changed so radically from gangsta rap, hip -Enough, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and sound in Seattle. Bill and Ted are Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N "Roses music along with their" style of the 80s, it seemed so out of place and very dated in 91 and I think that's one big reason, the film bombed at the box office. No one except the surfers were still saying things like "cool!" And "fake!" In 1991 "Gremlins 2", which also came out in the early 90's suffered the same fate to be a good movie that bombed at the box office, because he was too associated with the 80-ies. The transition from the 80s to the 90s was much faster to change now with the 90's and 00's. 1991 was nothing like one thousand nine hundred eighty-eight or 1989, while as of now, 2002 and last year, 2001 still looks / looked like a 1995 or +1996 <br /> <br /> If only «Excellent Adventure», which was made in 1988, was released in the same year, instead of 1989, and «Bogus Journey» was done quickly and was released in 1989, it would also be probably the same as the wildly received as the first.
