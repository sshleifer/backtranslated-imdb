Like the Arabian Nights, this film tells the story plays with the conventions in order to make us feel that there is a plot, a plot and a story: it opens with what seems to be a blind frame unit told the story of his life, and then immersed in flashback that takes us up to the present the blind, where we find that about half of the story is yet to come. (It should be recognized that the second half does not reach the promised first.) As one night as it tries to cram the Middle East folk motiffs as possible in one operation. Released the genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea travel, crowded market, the evil Vizier, precious stones ... I do not know why it works, but it does. All this is just so beautiful. Sets beautifully. June Duprez beautiful. Rozsa score is particularly beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he managed to convince us that he is a Hungarian in the Persian fashion.
