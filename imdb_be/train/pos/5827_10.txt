This three puppet film is in a tie with my other beloved Flicka "violation of the court." This is the noise of laughter for any fan of the Three Stooges, to enjoy. <br /> <br /> The guys wipers at a recording studio, when they hear, lovely Christine MacIntyre sings a great version of "Voices of Spring". It will be offered a recording contract, but it scarred to be honest with my father about his choice of career and prove himself as a true singer. If she and others leave the studio, the helpers decided to have some fun and play her record and Curly dress up as Christine. Contract lady who can make a career of Christina, see the curly and his mistakes and Christine invites Curly sing for his party. Of course, there are people that are upset, it's at a party, and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd, so that he will find a way to get back to them. <br /> <br /> What a great puppet Flick, it should not be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
