In 1948, it was my favorite movie. costumes Grable was so charming that I wanted to grow up to be her and dress like this. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible, as the dashing Hungarian officer. Silly and fluffy, like this film may seem at first sight, when I was eight years old, it seemed to me to say something important about the relationship between men and women. I saw him again the next day; I was surprised to find that it still.
