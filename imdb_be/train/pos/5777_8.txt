Meteor crashes into the crater lake, heat from exposure causes prehistoric eggs hatch. <br /> <br /> Okay, so that the plot is just rubbish. But despite the obvious low budget, it is perceived as one of the most exciting and entertaining monster-on-friable films in existence. There are also a few nice moments of humor. In an era filled with so-called "monsters" that are not a ridiculous man-in-rubber suit to create or lizards dressed in frills and forced to break one another to pieces (cheap exploitation-style), it is refreshing to discover that plesiosaur in this little gem is a great Harryhausen style flipping creature. <br /> <br /> It is rather difficult to find a movie, but it's worth finding.
