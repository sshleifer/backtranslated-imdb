This film is not deep; Most aspects of the story is quite predictable and "true and", but it was well acted and did some interesting things that we might regret (our "mistake", as the film call them) as we look back on our lives. I have not read the book, so do not know much more than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories for a long time, it really is not shared with anyone. Fortunately, they got a first-class cast Meryl .... <br /> <br /> daughter Strip, MAMI Homer plays a young Lila and then Meryl appears at the end of the film, as the old Lila ... annexed to the striking similarity (duh!) younger actress did a great job (perhaps not quite to the caliber of her mother, but who is?), everyone else in the film were all right, though I wish there were more Glen Close and thought that character Buddy Alittle was too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for girls than for boys, but good to see your mother, or your daughter, and maybe start some dialogue going. How hard is it to know exactly how the father of the "face"!
