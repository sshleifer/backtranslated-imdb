Well, the truth is that I saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself, what the manufacturer thinks? Hutton, Jolie and spirituality? How I could monotoned actor may have to compete with the natural power of Angelina Jolie on the screen? But surprisingly, the two had a kind of chemistry that has shown intensive care without a kiss. Even the humor of David coincided with the spark and fire Jolie. As for Hatton, he played very well crazy, contrasts with the calm David delivery of life-threatening situations. Overall, I was very impressed with the development of written language and character. I gave it 8 stars.
