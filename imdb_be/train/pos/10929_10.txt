One of the most enjoyable aspects of Asian cinema (or, in fact, most everything is done outside of the holier-than-thou, USA) are permutations that arise. In the post-World War II Japanese manga (comics), for example, this infinite variety of subjects, many of which are processed in a unique shaped fashion to be found. The same thing happens in the film genre as well; although, again, I mean movies made outside the U. $. (Where are we simply too "sophisticated" in our close minded to appreciate all that is not on or the US). Whether the American company, for example, has not one, but a whole series of films featuring masked professional wrestler (El Santo) or werewolf (Paul Naschy) or in real life martial arts (Bruce Lee) ...? As for television: forget. Although I still love the series Kung Fu, which starred the late David Carradine, I always felt that the Americanized version of the Asian martial arts was-, placing it kindly- bit lacking. On this day, I have not been channel pay-per-view to show the Asian martial arts play Asian martial arts in Asia. (There are plenty of soft core porn disguised as entertainment shows, but the so-called action channel, for example, still have to import or produce true teleseries martial arts.) Before Brother Cadfile investigating the murder on the BBC, there was, all things, at least , a kung fu film that showed a group of martial arts are more or less involved in the murder mystery: 5 Deadly poisons. In its own right as fascinating as any other genre-based detective novel (west, police shows, etc.), is a martial art masterpiece stands out as a really great piece of work. It is now available Dynasty Dragon and print beautifully and DVD comment Bey Logan exactly the kind of intelligent, thoughtful analysis of these stones really deserve. If you do martial arts movie fan, enjoy one of the biggest genres of movies of all time (in particular, the martial art of the cinema of the 1970s and early 1980s) is long overdue a second life (and appreciated the second opinion) on DVD.
