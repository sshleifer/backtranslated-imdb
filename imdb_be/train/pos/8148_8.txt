I have zero interest in rap and ghetto culture, I'm white, and like classic rock, but it does not prevent me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. It is largely a continuation of This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it is the same movie, but instead of rap or rock. Nevertheless, it's fun. There are a lot of funny jokes, but not without a few jokes that just served flat. The characters are all very funny and believable. I only watched because it made me laugh at 3am, and any movie that can be done, which requires at least a test screening. One of the reasons why this movie was so funny, he makes fun of rap from others. Rap today relate to the wrong things and get away from the noise and a small studio talent. This film comes from a time when rappers deserve more credit. Overall, this is a funny movie with a lot of jokes about racism, gender and musical culture among the most obvious humor. It is highly recommended for any fan is Spinal Tap. They are, in fact, the same movie, just about different worlds, and let the same jokes work in both films.
