I loved the good times with the rest of the lot of you. I love to read intelligence and insightful commentary. Authors on the show were fantastic and the actors of the talented. To answer Strawberry22 (neat comment to another superior and positive comments) ... What happened that James was killed in an accident (I guess I remember that it was a load accident or a traffic accident) and it was the most boring episode (when it first went on the air, and I was a little thing ... it was so sad to me ..). <br /> <br /> Florida and the kids actually get out of the projects, and even become neighbors Willona (Wilnona) and it is the latest show ended. <br /> <br /> All the children achieved their dreams and found the opportunity in each of his dreams. It was a perfect ending, and I cried because I was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that I actually believe in their fate. I hope that come the end of this ring exactly in reality for many. <br /> <br /> A great show and a great many other shows followed including Benson and Jefferson. It was a strange time for African-American television and the best writers are strange at the time. TV LAND is awesome for the memories, and I just love it because I can not stand the garbage that we see now. OR ... to return the 1970s and 1980s quickly ... your smart viewers are dying here and we need better material. <br /> <br /> Love, TV-LAND original sitcoms addict from the 70s and 80s (as they sing in "All in the Family" ... those were the days ......
