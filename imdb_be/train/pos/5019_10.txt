Hello <br /> <br /> My name is Jessica, I'm Italian <br /> <br /> Some time ago I saw this movie, "The very first time", with Corin Nemec Corky. It was a story about Micheal and Mary Margaret. I need to know the name of the most important songs of the love scene in the bedroom in Michael. <br /> <br /> In Italy, the film has not been programmed over the years, and I do not know how to find a song, Thanks a lot for someone who can help me! I love this movie! Very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollak! Jessica
