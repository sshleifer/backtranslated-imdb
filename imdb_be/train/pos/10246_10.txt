This film has to be my favorite of all time. It must not have a plot, because its creators want people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to believe it was a real Snuff. It was an exercise in visual effects, and not cut down, when the action is just like any other film making. Movies these days are now all the sound effects, leaving the visual effects, which will be done with the aid of computers call it easier to deal with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can not get the fake blood to look like the real thing. There's no rape scene, because that is not the point of the film. You've seen the mountains have eyes 2? rape scene was funny, but not shocking. Although I'm sure there are some Gonzo porn filmmakers who tried to marry porn horror. But since they are likely to suck to make films, they probably will not be able to pull it off. "Fuck me," The film has a disturbing rape scene, because in fact the actress porn star, and they show all, despite the fact that the film as a whole sucks. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that the film can not be made without thinking of the money aspect of it, especially if it is a joint-stock company or an NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make it hostel film series a lot better, but he's too tame it down to get a rating of R ... or at least I hope, that his films is sucked out Due to these limitations. <br /> <br /> See next death or a broken Pumpkins, if you do not want, no frills real footage (accident and crime scenes / shots). Do not forget that this film was made in 1985. The fact that this film can still be made against most of crap these days has much to say about this film. It would be like someone talking about 8bit Super Mario Brothers sucks, because the PS3 has better graphics.
