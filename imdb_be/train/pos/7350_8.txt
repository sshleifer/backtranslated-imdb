I was a teenager, when I saw that movie..the songs were a huge hit, but the elite class missed Govinda movies then watch sogu Govinda Karishma (aka Karizma) films were not in the thing for this "class", but in any case, a lot of people liked it, as a series of films shocked 90-through out, and most of them were successful..today I watched it again after a long time, and I remembered there was a long que of people and revolt, they created when a- aa x Io Io song came on the screen .... dress Govinda Karishma were complementary to each other (worst dressing duo of Thu c) good Karisma in the late '90s transformed, but Govinda is still very true to its designer, his sense of dress remains the same ... but then it all mixes it was all good ..everything worked slowly and elite class realized that it was a pleasure not to be missed, and then ..... there was no looking back for this Jodie, he went on to claim on entering the Indian Kerry series ..hated few but loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time with nothing to make it to rent or watch it on TV, I do not think you'll regret it ... but remember, its worst in the best .. <br /> <br /> I also watch these movies, when I get the time because I can not stop laughing ... so I say go ahead and have a good time, because there are times when we all love stupidity, especially if it made kings of his time it is certainly watchable ... I recommend it to all lovers of cinema ...
