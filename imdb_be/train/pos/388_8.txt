... and I love it. Lots of special effects, and a film that is not made on a mega budget, this film does a great job of creating a masterpiece of fantasy. I am one of those who do not understand the story at all, but it was still a great movie to watch. This, of course, there are the standards that exceed sad rings, and along with movies like Harry Potter. Which says a lot for a movie again, made at a fraction of the budget of international hits. <br /> <br /> One thing I really love about this film is that it is so extends the envelope of the film adventure come from Hong Kong. Subject exotic and original. Product quality is unlike anything seen exiting HK for fantasy action movie, and the actor is great. <br /> <br /> One of the best films to come out of Hong Kong, this infernal case Hong Kong fantasy film, and I hope that they will continue to work in this area, as long as they do not exceed the Hollywood adventure films. <br /> <br /> Just fantastic.
