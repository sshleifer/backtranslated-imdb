Running from movies to rent, I took Freebird. I struggled through the first third of the film wondering if everything else is a waste to see. Fortunately, it really warmed up and I liked the movie quite a bit. The second half of the film had me grinning and laughing all the time. Fortunately, although there were CGI bits are included, they are not exaggerated or spread <br /> <br /> I would like to say, though -. Actors all have heavy European accents, so be careful if you have trouble understanding those voices or cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really loved this film, and will order a copy for my collection.
