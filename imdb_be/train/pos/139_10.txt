First of all, Riget fine. Good comedy thriller and a mystery at the same time. Good combination of strange "dogma" style to tell the story, along with good music and a great actor. But, unfortunately, there is no "end". As it is unacceptable for me. I thought ... how it would be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have some ideas. I think that Lars should do RIGET III a little differently. I believe that the third part without Helmer is not the same. So here is my suggestion. Mayble little silly, maybe not. I know that Lars likes to experiment. So why not do a little experiment with Riget3? I think that the only solution is to create a controlled puppet animation (such as "Team America" ​​by Trey Parker) or even 3D-computer animation. I know that this is not the same as real actors, but in principle, I believe that it can work ... the only way that you can do the actors alive. For Riget supporters it must not be so great a difference - when the animation is done in a good way average "observer" will consider it normal only after the first few frames of the film. The most important thing now is history. It is quite clear that it is not possible to create Riget 3 with the actors at the moment. So why not play with the animation? And ... look for the opportunities it gives you! Even marketing is one! Great director completes his trilogy after 10 years of using puppet animation. Just a dream? <br /> <br /> I hope that I will see 3 Riget ever ... or even just to see the script. I wonder how the story ends ... and I Expect- all doing here <br /> <br /> welcome, slaj <br /> <br /> PS :. I'm not talking about the "kingdom Hospital" Stephen King ;-)
