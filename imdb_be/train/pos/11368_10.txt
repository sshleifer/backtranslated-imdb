Surprisingly sophisticated and well-researched study of «The First» serial killer in the Soviet Union. Set in the days of perestroika this intense part is brought to the full life with performances by Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> This study Cicatillo killer well rounded and hinting at some of his behavior while upright, showing there is another subtlety that is compelling, without being explicitly graphic. Not for the faint of heart, however, is the subject of often disturbing, but it is necessary to complete the development of the main participants of this fact-based story. <br /> <br /> HBO gave us a great movie in an unusual way, congratulations to the director and editor in chief of this great piece. This is in my Top 10 must see list.
