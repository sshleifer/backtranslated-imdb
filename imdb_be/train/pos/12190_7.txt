It is very difficult to say what happens to the "Lady from Shanghai", and that the film would be without studio interference primary interest of Orson Welles in the film at this point was to raise money for his theater;. Indeed, funding for their projects, it is which forced him to seek effective jobs. He made a "Lady from Shanghai" for his soon to be ex-wife, Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn fearing for image burning and holding back the release of the film in a single year. <br /> <br /> As for the plot Irish sailor Michael O'Hara, who falls in love with Else (Hayworth, stunning with short blond hair). Her husband is a well-known criminal lawyer Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), who is crippled inside as he goes. He hires O'Hara work on his yacht, and is drawn ever deeper O'Hara and deeper into a web of murder and deceit. <br /> <br /> Â«the Lady from Shanghai" is moving at a snail's pace, although I agree with one of the posters that movies today criticized for taking the time to draw a graph. Nevertheless, the film delights. The scene in the house of mirth is fantastic - Wells wanted it without the music, though, and I think that the studio cut it down. It's a shame. Photographing for a stunning, atmospheric, bold, and very stylish. <br /> <br /> Wells was a wonderful actor, handsome in his youth, charismatic and has a beautiful voice and technique, but also in many movies, it's almost as if he did not trust himself or not to spend time on sign design. Instead, it relies on the externals, such as accents and fake noses. One of the few times he did not do it, "Tomorrow Forever", where the director gets a great, deep sense of performance out of it. Contrast that with "coercion", where he shows that he is a master of a purely technical action, he calls in his performance. Here Wells does quadruple duty - as a director, star, co-writer and narrator. Sports entirely unnecessary emphasis and looking intensive was the quickest route to the characterization. Nevertheless, it is always convincing. <br /> <br /> The supporting players are excellent, including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth, a beautiful and soft voice (her singing again voiced by Anita Ellis), as usual, full of the goddess and one of the great screen presence. That boring life so vivid beauty. <br /> <br /> Any film that is directed by Orson Welles is worth a look, and "The Lady from Shanghai" is no exception. But this one leaves the viewer frustrated, as does "The Magnificent Ambersons" - as does any work that Wells did in the studio system. He was a great artist who had to be given freer reign; he was not. It was amazing dichotomy - it needs more freedom, but, as evidenced by some of his later work, he needed structure studio. Unfortunately, he could not have both.
