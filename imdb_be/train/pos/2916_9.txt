Of all the films I have ever seen, and that's most of them, this is definitely the best friend did, that it is primarily about the US naval airships (blimps) During WW-II. Yes, there are other good LTA-related movies, but most use the special effects more than any real-time shots. Navy This man is much more real-time frame airships, etc. True, a lot of boilerplate dialogue, but that's what makes it more interesting Hollywood movies, even today. PS I've spent 10 years (20) and have more than 5,000 hours in the Navy airships of all types, from 1949 to 1959 a proud member of the Navy airship associations, etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]
