The film "comedy" at the moment, as a rule, 100 minutes, toilet humor, profanity, and foot odor. Modern comedy to appeal to the lowest common denominator, the lowly and slow brain. Of course, the occasional good comedy will come, but they are becoming more rare all the time. <br /> <br /> «Mr. Blandings you his Dream House» shows that the 1940s Hollywood was capable of, and it's just incredibly funny, Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decided to build a house in the suburbs of Connecticut . The film is his story, starting with the house hunting, violent home construction, all the way to the finished house - with its «zuzz-zuzz water softening» <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are ideal for. their role, of course (Grant is especially funny, as he looks at home stands in a reduction control). However, the film was stolen wise counsel Blandings', played to perfection Melvyn Douglas. Managing to steal every scene he is in, Douglas understatedly hilarious when he observes Blandings lurch from one crisis to another. Reginald Denny, like a hunted architect Blandings' and Harry Shannon as an old artesian well drilling crust is also excellent. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie many times, and it always makes me laugh. I think this is a good movie to see if you need a lift, whether you are building a house or not.
