I saw this movie at the time, when I timidly played with the idea of ​​moving into my own apartment and start life on their own. Maybe this is the reason why I took it so seriously. I fully believe in the psychological degradation of the poor character in Paris perpetual construction site dust, poverty, selfishness, rudeness, anger and decay. I give all the credit artistry Polanski at his side, his game and his imminent scenario, but I fainted during a terrible final scene and had to be rebuilt brandy in the cabinet director of the theater. Luckily for me, my life alone will not work as disastrous as it (yet), but I always had great respect for the artist who can perform such illusions, and so immerse yourself in (fake) reality he is trying to convey. Simply put, the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. This film is the sum of many, many cases, a large acting and a great cast. As some presentations were given in English (scenes from Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas, among others) and the other in French (with the majority of other characters) and Polanski made his dubbing in English and French, I heartily recommend if you happen be bilingual in order to switch the sound from French into English and vice versa, during the respective scenes, watching the excellent transfer on Paramount DVD. This film is part of the so-called Polanski's "house" trilogy, which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby." Unfortunately, "Repulsion" still has not made it a decent DVD transfer in the region 1. Needless to say, three films will make the perfect box set.
