Reese Witherspoon's first appearance on the big screen was a memorable one. It is like a fresh face washed "twin" small and stringy, but, of course, Reese. <br /> <br /> I have always loved her, as an actor, and had no idea that she began it with her young career, go figure it out. I actually got some respect for Reese, to find out who it is so early. I say this because every time I watched her performance, the characters are still, in each figure, it also seemed to be his own person, who lived with the character, quite well in fact. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first experience with the vestments of the film was a parody of Little Red Riding Hood Riza did with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I thought that was her first time up "at bat" Not so well done Reese
