Every child has the film, he claps VHS, if it has nothing to do, or if you have a nanny around. It was that film for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the whole story really, I had to see it 100 times, at least, and I can say that it is good for children / family film. <, Br /> <br /> I still have the tape, I watched it for 5 years, but maybe I bypass it this week, and to be a child during the day. <br /> <br /> You just love the bear care, as well as their messege. <br /> <br />
