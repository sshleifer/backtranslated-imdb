I admit, I thought that this film will not be any good, but I soon changed my mind. The film was to keep you guessing how it goes in any direction. Pierce Broson strange in his role as a hit man who suddenly becomes burned out and asks the man he met in the Mexican aid bar. Greg Kinnear is awesome straight man as its role as a mild-mannered man from Denver, who begins an innocent conversation with Pierce in the Mexican Bar. The movie will have you laughing like Pierce delivers hilarious one liners (mostly about sex). <br /> <br /> Imaginary in this film is very well done, especially in the bullfighting scene, and when Pierce sees himself, trying to complete his last work.
