Writer-director Brian De Palma is best known for his series of films that have been called, somewhat unfair, "Hitchcock imitation." Contrary to popular belief, De Palma is not plagiarism Hitchcock; it borrows plot or iconic elements, which can be seen in Hitchcock and then extends to their stronger, modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma known for mixing a blood soaked death with a horrible sense of humor. <br /> <br /> «Dressed To Kill», made in 1980, is perhaps the most well-known Hitchcock film De Palma, and is probably his best as well. History includes cross-dressing serial killer preys on as a burnt-out housekeeper (played by Angie Dickinson), and street-wise prostitute (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, it will remind you well with "Psycho", but the film De Palma just technically brilliant and mysterious artistic. The sequence of the museum particularly good notch and edited; Lift stab scene is also one of the most unique shot kills ever put on film. "Dressed to Kill" can not be a complete original, but I would say that it is definitely worth your time. Rated R. 105 minutes. 9 of 10.
