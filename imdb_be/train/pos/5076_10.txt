It has been almost five years since the release of this stylish action flick.I already watched this movie about 10 times, and it's a great effort on Gautham.From my point of view, I feel that this film is almost perfect. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan-Niya doubt..classy.Jyothika played a role as Maya very well.The character suits her very well.The character that caught the attention moviegoer was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia well.Brutal and very formidable. Jeevan deservedly won best villain in ITFA 2004.The supporting cast Daniel Balazs, Devadharshini and others performed well. <br /> <br /> racy screenplay, dialogues perfectly timely and brilliant narrative soundtrack Gautham.The Harris Jeyaraj all wrestlers charts while the background music for the film is very well.Cinematography RD Razhaseharom is rich.Peter Hein choreographer well.Anthony editing tricks is precise.Above all Kaakha Kaakha perfect cop movie is filled with the right dose of action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even a Hollywood film can not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
