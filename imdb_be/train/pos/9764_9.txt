I saw this movie in theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years. I loved it then, and was recently have VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year old kids love this film and ask again and again to see it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching this and again. Although I must admit that it is not as good on the small TV. <br /> <br /> I do not older children, so I do not know what they will think about it. <br /> <br /> songs are very nice. My daughter continues to sing them again and again. <br /> <br /> I hope this helps.
