This is obviously one of the first panty Shemp puppets. (This avoids it much earlier vaudeville years with the team). But time comedy trio is on his honed better here. Besides intensive slapstick scenes, there are other, more subtle, but just as funny. Look, Larry, Shemp when asking him to look at the camera for a shot. Or playing a real object, which offers ejaculation can, "Oh ... well-polished mahogany!Â» <br /> <br /> Emil Sitko is confused goofiest it. And redneck might look scary, but it is somehow funny. He seems upset and embarrassed with the Stooges, as well as "normal" people in other shorts. <br /> <br /> For those who like Shemp, it should have an episode. It will not disappoint.
