I think if you ask most JW waiting for the miracle drugs they because of their faith, you will find that they do not. I know that I have not. What you will find instead is that they believe that the promise of the resurrection of Christ. . Thus, even even if the worst happens, and we die, keeping our integrity, the Lord can and fix it <br /> <br /> It really gets down to a simple question: is there a God is real for you, or is it all just make believe? If it is real, and you trust him, you follow his instructions, no matter what the result may be in the short term. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words "no blood" in capital letters on my card. I talked with her, if I was in a state that only a blood transfusion to save my life, it would be a good time to anger the only one can bring me back to life, when the time came? She did not get it - God is just not enough real to her. Too bad. I wish she could have the comfort of a strong faith gives.
