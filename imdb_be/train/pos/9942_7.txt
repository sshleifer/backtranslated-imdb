Good Korean film to not only taekwondo, but what it needs to be good, both thugs way to deal can not be beat taekwondo guy in his sport, because there are rules in the same way as it is in life and in school, and this film is the subtext of this concept. <br /> <br /> martial arts is not so good in the movie, but is passable and enjoyable. Friends who go to achieve what they used to mock will become stronger through the mind and the heart. This film is not taken too seriously, as it has a farce, but also carries a message. <br /> <br /> a good movie over from Korea.
