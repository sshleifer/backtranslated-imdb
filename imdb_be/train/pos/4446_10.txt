Yes, I call it a perfect movie. Not one sad second, a fantastic cast of mostly little-known actors and actresses, a large array of characters, all of which are well defined and that all have a clear motive, I could sympathize, perfect lighting, crisp black-and-white photograph, a suitable soundtrack, clever and harmonious set of design and a story that draws up and running. This is one of those simple-quality photos, which all honor Hollywood has to relax, sign everyone should strive to achieve. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing, this actress could not do, and it has always been easy on the melodramatic side. A lot of hysterical attacks with this lady - I always thought that she was a better actress than the goddess of the screen, as Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this film confirmed my opinion. Always as tough as nails, and at the same time transported true feelings. It is fair to add that it has also received a lot of good parts in the course of his long career, and this one is much less interesting. <br /> <br /> title fits the film very well. It is the desire, human desires, I think everyone can understand. In fact, no one seems to be intriguing in this film all the characters act impulsively, everyone wants to be happy, without hurting anyone else. Sad but true, it usually does not lead to complications makes for dramatic content, which I will not go here. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that this film has to say about youth, about the maturation and the need to compromise. The film reminds me most of all this, there is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of Doubt, it creates such an atmosphere, and idealized at the same time comical Small Town America. The story has some similarities with the much harsher Clash of the film by Fritz Lang night, I made one year before, where Stanywck stars in a similar part. I can also recommend it.
