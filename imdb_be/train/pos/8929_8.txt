First of all, I really liked the idea of ​​a central location in the "" "" intruders, others gentle I am, at all levels - mostly unconscious, but sometimes more allegorical. Actually fraudsters omnipresent throughout the film: in the Swiss-French border, where pretagonist leads a secluded life; he repeated dreams and nightmares; inside his ailing body after heart transplantation .... In the last half of the film, he becomes himself the offender returning to the ancient French colony in the hope of redeeming the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone of bitter, rather than pathetic, full of regrets and guilts, a sense of failure, more or less dominant. It's a pretty bleak picture of old age, as an independent, but hopelessly lonely emptiness inside. Directer of drawings convey a fleeting feeling of anxiety and desire than any obvious meaning. Some of them are fascinating, not without humor, though, like absurdist play only a lunatic could visualize.
