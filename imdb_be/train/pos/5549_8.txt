Silent Film Honor Clan starring Mary Pickford was supposed to be set in a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the exterior shots were filmed in Marblehead Massachusett on Marblehead Neck near several rocky marine geographic areas, including the Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the location of Marblehead film in my hometown and, 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as an understudy for Mary Pickford during the filming of several scenes, including "Rock scene". Both women were small (5 ') in height and my father and grandmother related to the fact that she has a backup with it back to the camera for scene break as part of a set of shooting Chiefton. I just wanted to tell this story for future historians and movie buffs. The film (my DVD copy number of the poor) is very well done with lots of action and expressive activities, including several scenes where Miss Pickford reflects the characteristics of a strong woman. I enjoyed it and would like to get a copy, although I'm not sure if there is one, as I have seen in different sites movies that other copies are dark due to wear. Very good movie dumb genre with lots of action!
