breathtaking, it is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made. I first saw the castle in the sky at the end of the 80s, as a child, and it left a lasting impression. Years passed, and I forgot the name of the film, and only casually browsing the web I found this masterpiece again. after reading other reviews and analysis of the peoples I am not surprised that there is such acclaim and touched so much, because it will leave an impression. Currently, fantasy adventure, a must see for all children and adults. it is better not to give the story so far, I'd say, watch this movie will be a clear and open mind. If you have kids, treat them with this, I promise you, they will love it. there is not much to say about this work of art, but if you have not seen his watch and enjoy.
