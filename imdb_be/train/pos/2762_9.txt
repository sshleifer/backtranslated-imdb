This film is close to my favorite piece of celluloid. There really is not much I need or want to say here. Except, maybe, "See this movie" and "Enjoy the excellent work of Daniel and Pascal," that carries you through these neat, funny and heartbreaking stories about "spending your eighth day" - your own day! <br /> <br /> Seeing this film made me think seriously about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It turns out that some of us have to spend valuable time doing what we think, what we should do. Or, if it is pleasing career or simply consuming TV shows and ballgames. What we tend to miss it a pleasure to be something for the other person - to make a difference. Adoption of the room and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (On the eighth day) ... At least, that was what I got from the "Eighth Day".
