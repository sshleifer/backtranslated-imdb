I saw him in a luxury cinema, where viewers tend to be white, educated and urban. Showing I attended was a sprinkling of African-Americans, and that made the difference in audience reactions between the two groups of different social commentary on the state of race relations in this country. In general, white people were afraid to laugh or nervously laughed at the funny bits th there are a lot! - because they would be "in Blacks laugh," while Blacks have also remained quite silent, because many can not laugh at yourself in front of white. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, being Asian (and, thus, which belongs to a group of no), had a great time watching this satire rap culture and his ego / attributes / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophy. The cast of talented and doing a lot of work, becoming the characters painted. Songs too ridiculous to be believed. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries come together, including "strong wind"
