The case of the tail of a scorpion is a very stylish Giallo directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be the master Giallo second only to Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernest Gastaldi wrote this fabulous one-dunnit, rather complicated, but ultimately, it is very pleasant and entertaining murder mystery. It also makes sense, after all, is a big plus, because it's not always the case for those Giallo, as they have a tendency to stretch credibility with their endless red-herring and final decisions. Here, the less you know about the story, the better. <br /> <br /> Net Giallo trade mark, which is present here beautiful cinematography, catchy score, gorgeous woman (Anita Strindberg goddess), brutal murder, the killer black gloves and explicit sex scenes, to name a few. <br /> <br /> In most regions it is well acted, Goerge Hilton it is usually helpful myself and others to do quite well. Martino directs with a sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some spectacular set-piece. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan Giallo, it must be seen. If you want a well-written and thrillers in general anxiety, it is highly recommended.
