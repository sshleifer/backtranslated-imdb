Back in 1955, the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and shiny Kay Kendall. On this day, he stands as one of the best examples of British comedy, and more specifically, how the television comedies have become so popular. It was, and is, a great example of a movie as self-referencing. <br /> <br /> As Much foam, a film, which I had never heard of until a few days ago, when I caught him at the end of the TV. I was a bit dubious at first, simply because the comedy is so difficult to do so, as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised and pleased to see a very clever satire on American television daily. In fact, it's been a while since I laughed so sincerely. So, if you like satire, I recommend that you look at. <br /> <br /> The main actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty ?? simply do an excellent job of pointing out only as bitchy and shallow business of acting is. As I watched, I kept thinking to myself, how shitty it is transferred into real life? That is, if the actors ever have a real life? As you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, was known for hiding his true persona of a variety of characters, so that in fact no one knows the real person. So, as I was watching Sally Field plays Celeste Talbot plays Maggie, I thought again of that earlier British film with Kay Kendall plays Laure plays a character in the TV sitcom opposite Peter Finch ... <br /> <br /> Or worth wondering what some of the actors have a nervous breakdown? And this feeling is crystallized when Celeste finally confronts her daughter (Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue), and, in an emotional moment, repeating imaginary line she used at the preliminary level of the episode of her daytime soap, if front of her fictional daughter what a show! Are you confused? Well, it's not all true, but the dialogue is stunning originality, comedy, bitchy, anger, corruption, duplicity, and even ... love. <br /> <br /> history? Well, there are many stories in this film, everything is intertwined, and that all came together at the end (of course ?? but did not like the film, Robert Altman, well!), And not all of them will be solved completely. Life is not like this in any case, is not it? The tempo is almost obsessed, and you really have to look and listen carefully to catch all the gags and subtle jokes. Spend 97 minutes of your life and watch it; You will not regret the time of use. <br /> <br /> All the other actors work well, although I never took a lot of Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps a funny exchange between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty, and, for my money, the latter steals so many scenes from the others, it gets my vote as a great player. I'm not kidding, it gives a whole new member of the bitch's face ...
