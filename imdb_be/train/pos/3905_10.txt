witty. funny. smart. strange. I was looking through the channels late one night years ago. I stumbled upon it and the fire started. I was up late every night and taping it for all I know. several. like 3 people with almost 100 people I did not watch it thinking that it was strange that I did. others laugh so hard they cried and thanked me at the same time. Please, do yourself a favor. run do not walk. Watch it and enjoy. intelligence and humor. it's a win-win situation. I would like to have afternoon tea with him and meet a truly rare comic that we as a society need more .... sanechaos.
