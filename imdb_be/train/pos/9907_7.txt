«Slaughter High», perhaps the most underrated slasher film of the 1980s. This is one of the few films in the genre, which is interesting everywhere. At the same time, it also largely depends on the standard formula shredder: Group of young men and women do not kill one by one until the final brutal battle <br /> <br /> The reasons why the «Slaughter High» is above all. movies in its genre, it is more over-top. Marty, killer, has good reason to hold a grudge against their former classmates. They electrocution him when he stood naked in the girls locker room shower, stuck on his crotch with a dart, and, to top it off, rigged his experiment science lab, so it might spoil it. <br /> <br /> So, the victim in this film about how unsympathetic as you get. If they are reunited years later - in a high school reunion put himself Marty - you know what they did not manage all that much. They are a bunch of psychopaths. <br /> <br /> It's overwhelming, why do not they wonder why they were the only ones to show for reunification, which, incidentally, is held at the school that has since fallen into disrepair. And who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in an abandoned building, in a room that happens to have their old lockers - just like Marty - on the display? There are many leaps of faith viewer must take to enjoy this film. The ending makes little or no sense. And the writers have a strange idea of ​​how to work Fool's Day :. The film does not claim that pranks are no longer allowed after noon <br /> <br /> In general, the film is one of the best examples of the chopper genre, despite all its shortcomings. It is difficult to understand why it still has not found its way to DVD, when so many other mediocre Tesakov clicks are adorned with special editions.
