Just watched it after my mother brought him from America for, I was afraid to watch it after all the negative comments here, but I have to say yes cheesy acting, some effects are ludicrous. <br /> <br /> But you must remember, it must have been one thousand eight hundred ninety-eight Sun in 2005, and for such a low budget, I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed this version is much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I read the book so many times, and found that there is a "Aaah yes here in the book," almost all the time, with a different version is hardly anything in this book existed. <br /> <br /> So well done, at least, trying to make the current version.
