The storyline was very interesting, but the characters were pretty flat and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts / behavior. More extreme than necessary. In addition, I think that something has gone wrong in the casting. John Turtorro really does not suit me to play a half-autistic chess player, not to mention the Italian player. The motives were not presented anything. <br /> <br />
