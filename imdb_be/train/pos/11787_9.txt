This is a short film by David Lynch with just 8 minutes, but he got all Â«Lynchian ingredients!" This mysterious, dark, unconvincingly, terrible and strange; and before the blonde begins to speak, it's even a little scary! The soundtrack is exclusive to create this wonderful atmosphere, because it is also a sinister and mysterious ?? <br /> <br /> About setting, it is not a "traditional" red curtains, but that collect purple painted walls, which gives it the same effect of horror. <br /> <br /> the story of a girl who is locked in a dark room, and she asks for help; Then another girl comes in, which begins to talk to her mysteriously, saying that she was there just because of the error ?? We do not know what happened and what will happen next ?? it ended unsolved and mysterious, like a good Lynch has to end! <br /> <br /> This is a great short, despite some amateur action. The girls are professional actresses, but I think that their actions could be better in this short.
