I think Alan Jacobs review is very accurate with respect to the film, but I was able to rent a DVD from Blockbuster with a comment from the Curator at BYU, Motion Picture Archives James D'Arc. Then LDS prophet Heber J. Grant has approved the film understanding deviations from the historical content for clarity and telescopic events. For example, the film showed Joseph Smith in court. despite the great oratory of Brigham Young in defense of Joseph Smith, he was found guilty anyway. Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith was never convicted of anything. Brigham Young in Boston, when Joseph Smith was arrested for that particular court. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, where they killed before the trial took place.
