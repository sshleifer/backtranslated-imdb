After the loss of Amy for her performance as Mama Rose in Gypsy TV version, Betty won an Emmy the following year for Bette Midler: DIVA LAS VEGAS, live concert special for HBO filmed in Las Vegas. Midler, who performed on stage with the 1970s, proves that it is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business. From her entrance amount, its classic "Friends" where she comes down with the wings on the top of a beautiful propeller cloud Betty teams to the scene with style and charisma with the rap-style room called «I Look Good» she later proved that she has a way as a joke, as a few other performers in the business, how it flows your way through a variety of musical compositions. Part of the show, where she pays burlesque goes on a bit too long, but it still manages to turn her old Sophie Tucker jokes are a good advantage (even if it actually forgets a joke in the middle of talking, but her impromptu until she remembers that is hysterical). Betty also provides us «Turn Roses" from Gypsy and the title tune from the smash movie it rose, as well as a shameless plug for her hit film The First Wives Club. It brings the house down near the end with «Stay With Me, Baby» of roses and its only # 1 hit, «Wind Beneath My Wings» to the beach. This dazzling evening of musical comedy and entertainment for fans of Midler, it is necessary.
