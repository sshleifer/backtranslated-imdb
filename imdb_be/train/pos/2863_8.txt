Despite the fact that this show was to air in 1973, after watching the DVD I borrowed a set in our library, I was forced to say a little about it. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was the only color shows on television in the 1960s, and sometimes it would be a little "Sunday Night Party» with friends to watch it on NBC at one of several color TVs. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the stories are not so much for the names and dates, but how it affects us today, and how well could be so deep, on the basis of the inconsistent actions of the time. Case in point: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world due to silver, derives its name from a character named "Old Virginny», which in the early days of the city, stumbled out of the cabin, fell and broke a bottle of whiskey. <br /> <br /> Old Virginny not want to spend an occasion as the precious liquid seeps into the mud, he decided to christen city «Virginia Town». The area became known as the Lod Komstki because another character, Henry Comstock, had a reputation for trying to jump over every claim and the area became known as Komstki Lod. <br /> <br /> I just watched an early episode, which is applied to these two subjects. Other episodes deal with the rise of Mark Twain's literary while the reporter Territorial Enterprise ... <br /> <br /> It was a useful (and often educational) fun for the whole family. As someone remarked, each episode will indeed consider the film in its own right - rich scenarios and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing he twisted the truth about was the proximity to the Virginia City and the Ponderosa. In fact, to go to Ponderosa (all from North Lake Tahoe), could ride a horse around 3000 feet (1000 m) down at the highest level to the high desert Spooner (3000-4000 feet) from Carson Valley, the other 30 -40 miles in Virginia city. <br /> <br /> Needless to say that the Cartwrights would be some sore rear ends of doing it on a regular basis. But every writer should have some freedom with the truth. <br /> <br /> How I miss this show, even today.
