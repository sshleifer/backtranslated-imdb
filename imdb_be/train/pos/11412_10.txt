Beautifully and intelligently played by two young girls, Mischa Barton, Frankie and Ingrid Uribe like Hazel, although the plot is quite a stretch. Young Hazel runs for mayor seems ridiculous, to be honest. <br /> <br /> While the action is well done all concerned movie, as a rule, do not have enough of this atmosphere of drama. Perhaps we have grown to wait gritty reality to the movies, but as a comparison of Pollyanna to How Green Was My Valley! Never mind, every one of them is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright, even if its role is somewhat subdued here. Middle of the road of entertainment suitable for young audiences, and it's nice from time to time be exposed to fine classical music, which is almost a rarity! <br /> <br /> I think this film is to be welcomed change, as it reflects the quiet, thoughtful values ​​for the younger years, and no violence thank God. Warm family film to enjoy.
