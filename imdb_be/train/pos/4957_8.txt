10 ITEMS OR LESS was done for two weeks on a shoestring budget writer / director Brad Silberling, only a small film shot in Carson, California, which feels like the whole story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling had the good fortune to mate veteran actor Morgan Freeman, among its major projects with the Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different drawbacks; which can improve the life of another. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself - another part of the comedy in the fact that he is depicted as an actor, who has been out of work for four years, scouting locations for a little "filler film" to return to the flow of things, His "role" is to be the market manager, and he landed on a rundown market in Carson, where he encounters, among other things, one Scarlet, girl on argumentative 10 Items or less the line of control. Not only is the Scarlet are tired of it static work, it is also generally dissatisfied with her spouse Flirt (Kannaval), now sleeping with Scarlett lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and its lack of opportunities for decent work elsewhere. Two couples after a few common problems and from them goes on a "road trip" that leads to each of the characters that grow from the presence and the life stories of others. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story, simply told, but because of the delicate relationship between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those short films about human relations, where the future vulnerable to changes in the exchange and is a message. It is well worth seeing, and this DVD, which has the short films that are touching, informative and comical - a pleasure to view. grady Harp
