"The Brak Show" well .Probably not on the same level than the "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but, of course, he has a lot of bright moments .Basically follows Zorak life and marriage, having a normal life and go to school , lives in the district on the style of '50s sitcoms. Humor and animation of this show, it's a lot like "Aqua Teen HungerÂ» (in one episode, you can see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and amazing characters, but it's good, it's funny parts. Some of the songs are great, others not so, but I like this show. Funny character is the father of a marriage. (That is, a person, no one knows why)
