Well, I finally caught up with «Rock" N "Roll High School," almost 30 years after he first became North sensational film in 1979 (which was late, I'm, I'm probably the first to see the new documentary this summer "Patti Smith: Dream of life" somewhere around 2040), and no, the film does not feel one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait !. This is a very high energy comedy that shows loads of great music and some unexpected moments. She talks about Riff Randell, magically plays P.J. Sole, and the battle that she and her classmates at Vince Lombardi High wages with their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Pirya, in his book "cult films" very accurately describes the work of Mary Raven as "unclean Eve Arden».) Typical teenagers against the story line of Creation man up here with some absurd humor (that undermine myshe that giant mouse, Hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some really rousing melodies. Riff is, of course, the # 1 fan of this original punk band The Ramones, and that a group of dishes from baker's dozen of his greatest songs in the film, including five at the concert, which is a total blast. Indeed, the view Riff furiously dancing «Teenage Lobotomy» in this release may be the funniest moment of the picture. And the original look, Joe, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky have Ramonesmobile, and then sneaks down the street singing «I Just Wanna Have something to do," is quite exciting. The film ends with an explosive confrontation, that is, I would imagine, wet dream of every high school kid. Fun things really. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands I ever saw in concert, so I was very surprised to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How aging punks there found the subtitles should be, I wonder ....
