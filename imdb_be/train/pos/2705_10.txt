This is a scenario that Ed Wood worked for 10 years trying to get done. Aris Iliopulos finally audacity to film a script that Wood had saved from the burning of his house at the expense of other, more transient values. <br /> <br /> This is a dialogue-free film that some may foolishly described as silence, in fact, it is quite noisy movie without stupid chatter of most clicks. In the hands of these filmmakers, music and sound effects provide a rich sound experience that works better than almost any grit from the script of Hollywood mill, in particular, that stupid boat movie Billy Zane last one was in ( "Look out!", "Oh, no! -. J. Cameron .... ick ...) I will take great communicative monosyllabic grunts Zane in this movie on an empty dialogue on any day <br /> <br /> Billy Zane leads a team of players who obviously really wanted be in this movie. Richie shines, as always, and the gods are shining, you can put Sandra Bernhard, the name of Rick (c) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy in the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design of the perfect pyramid set exquisite and Ron Perlman dog's performance just fine. Overall, it's chaotic, visceral masterpiece lovingly created by supporters of Ed Wood Jr., filmmaker and cinenephile. A must see for anyone who really loves movies so that the first course Iliopulos and his cast clearly do. the film is to make you wish you did it yourself.
