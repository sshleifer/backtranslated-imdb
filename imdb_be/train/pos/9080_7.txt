maybe I should be considered my head, but I thought it was pretty good hCG screening of the film is not too bad.i seen worse.the kinds of beings (and beings I mean good and bad snakes) was pretty cool scene. the actions involving the snake was really good, I thought.there some lapses in logic, sometimes, and the story does not always function sense.but beings, there are many worse.a many other creatures seemed lifted from other movies, so that it's not quite original.i thinks that the essence of this story is original though.there little resemblance to Godzilla th (big-budget American version), which is like lot.i no longer as this film, like a lot, but I still say that it was pretty good.I also liked music.all in all, I think Dragon Wars is about 7/10
