This film is much better than the original push. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a brisk humor. We have included almost as many lines from this movie in our daily speech, as we have with Monty Python. <br /> <br /> card game with bums, and then to Mr. Suicide. The scene at the dinner table, and his aversion to the turtle soup. The original shock was too choreographer ans set. While I like Steve Martin, it seemed that he was trying hard. The push is also a parody and will use anyone. Push too suitable for families, as opposed to the original The Jerk.
