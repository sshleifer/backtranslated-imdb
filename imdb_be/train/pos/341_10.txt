I really enjoyed this thriller! I would like to see him again as soon as it was completed. The cast was very rich, the story was suspenseful and entertaining, and it was just general nice movie! I would rate this as one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! Girls there were very nice and especially Denise Richards. She was very angry throughout the film and gave it the character of some Oomph!
