Henry Fool best film. But this is the perfect way to keep track of a film like "Henry Fool." To Henry very seriously, his "lie" and its mysterious aura. Even the opening shot of "Henry Fool", as Simon puts his ear to the ground, as Henry comes walking up the hill more fully manifested through "Fay Grim. The over-the-top jokes, which are more or less meta-jokes (about writing the film themselves jokes) are good, but the opening of the film a bit saturated with them. also, the use of Hartley Dutch angles throughout the film dissonance, yes, it is the intention, but it feels forced and over-exploitation, it goes beyond the dissonance in what I like to call annoying. It's flawed film, but you need achyts any Hartley or "Henry Fool" fan. <br /> <br /> And do not listen to silly reviews, do not look at it, if you have not seen the first film. The intrigue, satire and wit of this film is completely lost if you have not seen Henry Fool. This is a continuation. It's just silly.
