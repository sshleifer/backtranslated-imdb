I remember stumbling on this special channel while surfing in 1965. I had never heard about Barbra before. When the show was over, I thought, "This is probably the best thing on TV I have ever in my life." 42 years later, he spent correctly. There's still nothing so strange, so honestly amazing how talent which portrayed here. You can talk about all the super-stars, which you want, is the most beautiful of them all! <br /> <br /> you call it, it can do so. Comedy, pathos, hot seduction ballad Barbra really narrator. Its ability to pull off anything she tries legendary. But this special has been done at the very beginning, and helped create the legend that it quickly became. Despite the growth so far in such a short time, it has fulfilled the promise, showing more of her talents as she went along. But they are all here from the beginning. You will not be disappointed in watching it.
