Finally thriller immersing car chases, explosions and other eye-catching effects. The film combines the simple plot (assasination of the French President) with a beautiful background. He watches the behavior of the Man with the authorities, and explains why we obeyed almost every order (even murder), which will be given to us. <br /> <br /> In addition, it shows us how the Secret Service can manipulate the mileage history, and it is unlikely that they can be controlled.
