Documentary without loss for words ... someday ... <br /> <br /> Let's say that the story of more than a parody, let's assume that this is a comment on Japanese society. And this movie is fast paced absurdist documentary as they come, a constant game of words, it goes so fast, and just as bad as it is-- transferred in its current version barrier festival, as seen today in Copenhagen Cinematek-- It was still very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and only a truly tolerant and open, I say to you Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses, I think this is the movie for you. It's a smart movie, if you will allow me, to win you over. <br /> <br /> It is very beautiful, and very kitsch, and all Japanese subculture. And quite experimental. Static 2D to 3D world. In general, entertainment for those who want to see the Japanese film that replaces the Japanese food culture. And well, if you're in the mood for something completely different.
