I have to pass it to the creative team behind the films "American Pie." «Direct to DVD» is usually synonymous with cheap, incompetent filmmaking. However, last year, I was pleasantly surprised when I found that fully enjoy DVD sequel «The Naked Mile». The filmmakers took the opportunity to deliver a bawdy, but a funny movie. This year they are offering up Followup «dorm». This is very true, "Beta House" makes the first few films "American Pie" look like "The Little Mermaid." <br /> <br /> it's no holds barred, tasteless, laugh out loud fun. Of course, the story is a little thin, but that's the beauty of it all. During the first 10 minutes we were introduced to all the main character, new recurring characters, get a few unscrupulous fun, there are villains, and establish a common story line. With all that out of the way, the movie becomes prohibited for the restrictions do not go. The gags are many, and they are not constrained by this. I say a man's sperm, urine, dildos, chicks with dicks, sex with sheep, female orgazim sprays, and many more. Not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobs or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> After returning from «The Naked Mile» is John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley, and Eugene Levy (in a similar supporting role, as in the recent movie). The entire cast does an excellent job. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has great energy and screen presence. I predict good things for him. The film is also loaded with large reference film for those who keep their eyes open. Until now, the biggest laugh of the film for me was «Deerhunter» parody. Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you're a fan of the series, you'll feel right at home with the "Beta House". It really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but in the end it's damn funny.
