I'm only 11 years old, but I found the full, when I was five and watched it all the time, until I was seven. Then I got older and realized he could expect a Full House, and that I had "more important" things. Plus it was the fact that my younger brother, who was watching this really with me in these two years began to love it thinking it was too "girly." <br /> <br /> Then I realized every day at five o'clock, and I was 23 again become addicted to it. Full house made me laugh and cry. It made me realize how it would be nice if our world was like the world of Full House plus mom. I've heard people say, Full House and incredibly cheesy. But look at the big picture: the three girls, whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. Sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. Three men living with the girls can get into Bickers at times. What is more real than that? <br /> <br /> If something shows lifted me up when I'm down and brought me even more when I thought that at the time of complete happiness. I howled like a hyena at the exhibition and received a massive obsession of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff is now occupied this place, but they were just nice kids I've ever seen. They are great actresses and seem to be very good people.)
