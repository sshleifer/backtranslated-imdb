The point is in the right place at the right time. Which is an exciting movie. It is easy to understand why Chavez is so popular with his people. He gets things done. It is available. And it is also easy to understand why the West hates him so much. He has control over the resources of the country and gives profits back to the people. The mostly poor. And it's easy to see how television stations can display misleading images to put there business. Just as the war in Iraq or the war on terror. Or missing ZMZ's. Or how about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get a different perspective. Stop Neo against the ruling of the world. Go watch this movie with an open mind. And make your own mind. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo: America: Freedom to Fascism. This is not the American people, who are the problem. This government.
