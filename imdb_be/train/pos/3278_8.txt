This beautifully written and well-acted psychological drama. This is not really a horror movie, so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and fine attention to detail in the plot and the efforts to be internally consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble and New Age revisionism. Instead of advancing the agenda, the filmmakers simply told the story, said it well, and let the viewer to think about it. Rare Dreamscapes reminded Wyeth paintings and surprisingly effective. <br /> <br /> excellent example of how to make a good movie on a small budget, without major studios, stellar cast, a famous film director (it was much better than many of Hitchcock's films), special effects or "clever" plot twists .
