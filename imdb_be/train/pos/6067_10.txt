While I tend to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen the film, I'm embarrassed to say that I like the most. Not often is a huge pile of 80s dads to be found outside of Wham! video, so it's definitely worth viewing (£ 0.79 per night in my local shop!). Watch out for the mentally ill obvious seams and zip on a monster suit, the fact that the "hero" looks very much like a whale Chegvin and classic lines such as: Evil Magician-Type Bloke: «At last we met Kor ..." Kor "exciting, it is not" <br /> <br /> it's amazing !! I also like the fact that, although the video window looks very exciting with the image of the castle surrounded by the raging seas and dangerous falcon- like a bird carrying? handsome hero to security (among other such "interesting and attractive" offers what is happening in the film, none of them really the right not to come in. No, I'm not kidding ... there is not really a raging sea or the fierce bird, it's just trying to make you interested in ... classic, in my opinion. This movie gets 10 for pure entertainment value !!
