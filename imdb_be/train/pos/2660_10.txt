When I first went to see The Shining I was expecting a decent movie from what I've heard about it, and I do a lot of other work of Stanley Kubrick liked, but when I started playing it was a lot better than I thought it would be. sometimes I seriously felt ridiculously easy, and I could not take my eyes off the screen there is still something very disturbing about everything in the film. Now, some people do not like shiny version of Kubrick, because it does not fully follow Stephen King books, but in my opinion, as a version of Kubrick's, mini-series and the book are all great.Jack Nicholson gives an amazing performance.If you looking for a good original film which will keep you thinking even once in the movie over and then watch The Shining.
