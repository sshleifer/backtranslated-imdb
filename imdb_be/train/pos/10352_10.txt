Religious fanaticism flourishes everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. <br /> <br /> Dingo grabbed the child and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having "killed" her own child. I do not want to spoil the story for you, but you should know the basics before getting to his knees that caused this woman to find herself in prison. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent the movie and find out how deeply rooted human hatred towards those who are different continues to flourish around the world. <br /> <br /> This is a very touching picture motion with a spectacular cast of actors. <br /> <br /> And Meryl Streep (with its famous Australian accent) and Sam Neill, whose focus his descendants pronunciation, are outstanding. Those supporting roles are also very good. <br /> <br /> Do you remember this film for many years. <br /> <br /> Look!
