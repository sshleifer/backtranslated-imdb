Almost the entire film takes place in a public bath in China. There's no fancy sets, explosion or glamorous people -. Only in the manner of writing, acting and direction (! Hollywood, note) <br /> <br /> estranged son returns home, he finds that his father is dying. He was surprised to see that the Pope looks good, and it is the launch of a family business as usual. In fact, he says that his father and his retarded brother really established close and caring attitude, and it soon becomes clear that he was out of the loop! Dad is very traditional, and the visit by the son of a big city and do not really see the value of an old bath. How their relationship changes and where the story goes from there extraordinary and believable. <br /> <br /> I was glad to see that not everyone is a Chinese film is a picture of the action (eg, starring Jet Li and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), because I do not really care about these feverish films . Shower as well as Springtime in a small town, there are two great examples of good Chinese films about people!
