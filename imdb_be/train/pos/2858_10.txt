Bonanza was a great cast of outstanding actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Guy Williams (as a cousin, who was brought in for a few episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he came out of a series). The cast was chemistry, and it seemed that they really love each other. This has led many of them weak stories work better than they should have. He also made many of his best stories in the big Western drama. <br /> <br /> As with any show that shot more than thirty episodes each season, there should be some kind of weak. However, most of the time, each episode had an interesting history, a conflict, and resolution, as a rule, does not include violence. While Western Bonanza was then gunfighting has never been listed as a major attraction. While I support the arrow and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; These shows usually ended with a shootout. Shootings were many westerns resolve all conflicts, and Bonanza are very different, trying to seek peaceful solutions and harmony, not to kill. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Bonanza, there are some interesting episodes that do come with a lot of shootings. These episodes are in contrast to the rest of the series, but they are pretty good in and of themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show, Guy Williams was brought in to replace him. Williams plays the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay one more year, and thus, Williams was discharged from the series when he stepped to marry an old friend of Adam. If Williams was on Bonanza time, one can only wonder how much better the series would be in the years after 1965, when Pernell Whitaker left the show. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt, when Pernell Whitaker left the series, the story focused more on comedy and jokes country. Whitaker is often played hard in many episodes, and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe has always wanted to play a good kid, and Hess had always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben was a good and wise family patriarch, that did not leave too much space for any shootings. <br /> <br /> At some point they hired a ranch named Candy (David Canary), which became their fourth member of the cast, but kendo has never been shown in any shooting, and he was a little more than the old version Little Joe. For a year or two, they also had to take Ben at some other lost cousin (Jamie plays forgotten Mitch Vogel), who was a teenager, which is usually obtained in some kind of trouble with someone. <br /> <br /> Obviously, adding a teenager, studio was looking to attract young audiences. He also gave the writers the opportunity to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, crime, etc. Those sorts of instructive episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction to the movement of the media establishment counterculture. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order of the TV, even though Hawaii 5-0, The Federation of British Industries and many other shows have also tried to jump on the bandwagon, making a TV show that showed irresponsible teenagers causing mischief, Mayhem and crime. <br /> <br /> Adding a teen to throw gave the Cartwrights more likely to show up and solve problems, but these episodes feel very flimsy and not very good overall. After Dan Blocker died, a series of limp along for another year or so before it was canceled. Last season was very bad, because it seemed a little Joe to track down the killers of his wife, and most of the episodes were a few upsets, because Little Joe, as a rule, drink or otherwise, remembering how he loves his wife, and how it is unfair that she was killed. <br /> <br /> I do not think I ever saw the last episode of the series, and I'm wondering if they ever officially wrapped him in some way. Until last year, there was only Ben (Lorne Greene) actually lives on Ponderosa, Adam walked (and never returned, even once as a guest) and Hess died and Little Joe is survived by his wife (in the series) were killed drifters . <br /> <br /> a whole era from 1959-1965 is the best of the series. After Adam left, he gradually fell. Most of the show until 1970 quite well. By 1970, the series tries to hard to be hip and local, and it has lost much of its western flavor. Adding candy and child-adolescent also diluted the overall quality of the show, and death Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the final nail. Bonanza, probably the best Western series ever made, and with 465 episodes that were made, at least a hundred of these beautiful Western drama! This is a pretty good record. Even worse Bonanza better than many other television shows.
