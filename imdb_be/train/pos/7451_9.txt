This is one the whole family will enjoy ... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall outdid yourself with this unique, creative take on almost all of the popular fairy tales of childhood. Scenarios offer new twist on the age-old fables we grew up, and they have several stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to the standard Duval and, in my opinion, this is one of the five best in the series, dedicated Jennifer Beals (remember her from "Flashdance" - and it still does today in Hollywood movies here and there) in the title role, Jean Stapleton as a fairy with a southern accent, and Eve Arden as the embodiment of evil stepmotherhood. Makklorg ( "Ferris Buellera day") and Jane Alden make cheerful duo, as well as half-sisters. Matthew Broderick is a friendly Prince Henry. You will all keep coming back for it!
