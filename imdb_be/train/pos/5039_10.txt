Excellent. Absolutely stunning. This is a movie about two children who's father suddenly appears vision. He claims that an angel visited him, and tells him that they must kill "demons." He receives instructions later and they start rounding demons, which to the naked eye, ordinary people. They kill these so-called demon with an ax in his head, and grind them, burying them in the rose garden. Their father says that he can see his sins when he touches them. The film continues with a twist at the end. <br /> <br /> The thing that I love about this film is that it perfectly reflects the fragility of the human perception. Is their father mad? Or is he telling the truth? Viewers were left to decide. Go make a decision for yourself, and see the movie. Now.
