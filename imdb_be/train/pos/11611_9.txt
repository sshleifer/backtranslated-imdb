This film is based on real events between 1907 and 1920, when thousands of Asian women were married to men in America, where they only knew their image. It is not very well known painting is well written and acted. Location is breathtaking. This film also has Toshiro Mifune in his last screen appearance as bensi (narrator of silent films). This film gives a glimpse of Japanese culture here and across the ocean. You must see!
