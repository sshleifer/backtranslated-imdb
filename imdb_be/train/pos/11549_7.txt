There's nothing really like «The Odd Couple», and it is no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a very winning comedy team. But there is something so underdeveloped adaptation of Neil Simon's hit him in the game, to make it seem more like a parody of the sketch comedy show than full-bodied film. I have not seen the game, but it is believed that the film adaptation is quite accurate, as Simon wrote, so that defects can not be accused of staging-to-screen. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two recently divorced men who go directly to the traditional roles of marriage, when they become roommates, because no one knows differently - that Simon never fully elaborates. However, there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours.
