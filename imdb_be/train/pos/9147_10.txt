The big time fan Prince last three or four years, I really can not believe what I just went around to watching "Purple rain". New 2-Disc Special Edition anniversary led me to buy it. Wow, I'm really looking forward to watching it, but I was not prepared to simply as the electric is actually. Prince musical performances throughout the film nothing but stunning - it really is moving in this. I am very familiar (from repeated plays) with a classic album «Purple Rain» and all his songs, but also see them in the context of the film completely changes your perception of melodies and lyrics - as computer blue, affectionate alone when doves CRY and PURPLE RAIN itself . There is something incredibly hypnotising of the scenes where the Prince and the Revolution to perform. The closing song I small stars, and I was ready to die for the U to show how much energy and a talent for the prince was full in his mid-20s (it is crowded!), He blew me away. He even makes Michael Jackson seems lifeless, even in his best years <br /> <br /> The Prince shows how to win the girl of his dreams. - take her into the lake, make her jump, then drive away - absolutely hilarious things thoughtlessly. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally oars, but it adds to the overall charm of the film. Day Morris is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious), and if his team Runtime Birds you get to see Morris Day and Jerome Benton illuminate the stage of Minneapolis funk style - I love them dancing in the little and as Benton provides Maurice with mirror in the middle of work. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see it again, I really can not! Additionally wonderful - especially seeing the young Eddie Murphy Beverly Hills Cop to admit that he is the "Prince fan."
