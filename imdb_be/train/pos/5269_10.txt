I love bad films. Not only because they are often as entertaining as "really," "good" films (as Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood pathos), but they are often far better than those movies. And this is the reason why I love to rip off the Italian cinema in the 1970s and 1980s. And this is the reason why I am particularly fond of this film, the Barbarians and the company. <br /> <br /> Director Deodato made a few really good films like House at the edge of the park, as well as its Atlantis interceptors and live as a Cop, Die, like a man pleasing fighters. But it's really bad. Barbara is so stupid movie. Peter and David Paul, as the Barbarian Brothers Kutchek Gore and very funny, because due to lack of charisma and acting skills. But if they can not work, they scream and shout every time they do something important. In one scene, people are trying to hang barbaric Brothers, and they leave a very unusual way. <br /> <br /> bad acting, bad special effects, very silly story, bad direction, really bad in this film. I can not describe how much I laughed when I saw it the first time. Barbara & Company is a camp classic everyone should see once. If you thought that the Plan 9 from Outer Space fun camp, it will be a real killer.
