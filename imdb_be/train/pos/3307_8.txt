I'll start with the fact that this film in the English title "The Power of Kangwon Province" is an absolute misnomer.It, because in Hong Kong, Sang his films, there is no real shots of wars, misery, and the idea of ​​a force conflicts.So province is not neither suitable nor present in the context of this film.If we were to judge this film by its name of the Korean language, "he Kangwon Ui" will look like a cryptic statement about the emotional upheaval of their young heroes whose minds are not rest.Hong Sang Soo also sent very prolific visual document of promiscuity you bars, made by people in their lives.The people have a few young girls in question, who are constantly in the process of reflection of their moods, whims and fancies. If you make a movie out of nothing can be claimed as a commendable power producer films were then Hong Sang Soo should be saluted as a courageous filmmaker, whose films speak of universal insignificance of human relationships, feelings and lives.Whether one likes or not this is the only fair conclusion that can be withdraw from that particular movie.
