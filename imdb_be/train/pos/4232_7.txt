In all my 60 years, I have learned that when we watch a film there are identification (whether we like it or not) with the specific nature of the implicit. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, because the character performs a particular gesture, sometimes because a character says the existing word or sentence ?? what we use and what we would like to use ?? in a determined situation. <br /> <br /> The film in question should be viewed with this perspective. Who will now find a parking space ?? at the mall, in the city center or on the street - to take the car, the driver who can not remember to think that he is not the only driver in the world <br /> <br /> Who does not urge to "?? rubber with" ill bred spat <br /> <br /> Haven said that, I ask: - Have you identified with DELLA (played by Basinger) If your answer is YES, Try to find the absurd details ?? compared with the reality of life in the movie ??! because you will surely find the movie funny <br /> <br /> Abstraction done, you will see that the film has moments of surprise, such as :. 1 in the sequence, which captures Della toolbox in the boot (does this field contains a gun, and she makes the wealthy have the guts to use it?); 2- The sequence in which Terry dies in the fall; 3 in the order in which Della gets attracts "call mermaid" Chucky in. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the movie, or if you want to see, keep in mind that there is a "realistic" films, "fiction" film, "political" films, and films in which you can "wash its soul "?? As an example of the latter, we can quote :. "Tropa de Elite» <br /> <br /> According to the newspaper, there was unanimous applause when officials BOPE take a certain relationship. (As I saw this movie in the DVD, I could not find out the reaction of the audience) ?? <br /> <br /> As for the direction of the (Susan Monford), interpretation (Basinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Sheffer, etc .. Edition (William M. Anderson ?? «Dead Poets Society," "Green Card" ?? exclusive edition, "Robocop 2", etc. it is well situated in the context of. on a scale of 1 (very bad) to 10 (Master Piece), I estimate, "If it was not" 7 (Regular).
