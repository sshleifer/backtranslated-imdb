I just read the comments TomReynolds2004 and I feel that I have to jump here. I understand that he does not like the film, but its cause is not obvious. My feelings about this film is that he is not afraid to travel the dark roads of loneliness, failure, frustration and sadness. Each of these two people, as portrayed, there are many reasons to be bitter and angry, but find tenderness and comfort in each other. Just a lot of action can make this work without becoming emotional quagmire of sentimental and sappy. I'm really interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity, which is given to them such strong performances. I have every reason not to like Jane Fonda for his actions in Vietnam era, but personal feelings of each other, it is incredible in that role. Robert De Niro as the perfect man who has intelligence and kindness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first I've seen De Niro ~ d, using a soft, rather than sell the steepness of the character and I really like. This film was a big surprise when I first reviewed it, and I'm looking forward to seeing him again.
