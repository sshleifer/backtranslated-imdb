I remember watching it its original airing in 1962 as five or six years, and really enjoyed it. I recently had the opportunity to watch it again, for the first time since it was featured on "Walt Disney Presents" on the Disney Channel. I forgot most of them, and some of them were aimed at children, but it was still nice. I can not wait to show his nieces and nephews.
