<br /> <br /> I do not agree with the comments of other reviewers for the simple reason that it is a mystery FILM, rather than a supernatural one! This is not the only film to have a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ( "Vampire"), but is very mundance one. <br /> <br /> Other films that come to mind, Edgar Wallace "Before the Dawn" and (more commonly known) "Mark of the Vampire". <br /> <br /> The film does an admirable job in creating a very "spooky atmosphere "seems to Dracula when Renfield meets Count on the stairs of his castle, or MARC Vampire, when two people look through the ruins of a castle window and see the" corpse "plays the organ, while the moon goes down, using the wings! Very surreal! < br /> <br /> If one loves these (often silent) atmospheric touches, this film is a must! <br /> <br /> Orme Vogel
