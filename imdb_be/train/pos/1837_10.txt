Just a great movie, no doubt about it. Great story and great performances, whether it is Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Bohm or Razhpali. Hindi film industry will be shameless with Mallika & Co., the film is completely free vulgarity and therefore doomed to failure in the vulgarity interested in our Indian society. But the message and concept carries this film is absolutely gorgeous. Perhaps Malik (boring copy-cat) can be avoided, and Ismail Darbar Himmesh Reshmmiya or could be used as a musician. I think that Vipul Shah had to give a little touch guzharatskogo especially in music, too. Perhaps Malik worst musician around, and he considers himself Popstar, but this is not the movie where this presence is required, it looks good only with songs Govinda style. I felt some good serious music with a couple of good gazelles or sad songs could make this movie more memorable.
