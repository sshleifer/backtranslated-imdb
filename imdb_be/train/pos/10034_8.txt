I had a few problems with this film, and I've heard a lot of critics say that it is a long and overrated. However, for a long time, for three hours, but I was struck by the fact that it goes so fast. I do not think he's overrated at all, I think that pretty well IMDb rating. The film looks magnificent, with gorgeous costumes and beautiful effects, and the direction of James Cameron rarely escapes the attention. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack and Kate Winslet as beautiful as a rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he is in. The history is very rich in detail, and hot on the development of the character, obviously, with a love story, very moving when you need it, although in the first hit film is a bit slow. Last hour extraordinarily riveting, and I confess that I was on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank. I will also say that for the last five minutes were really touching. The cost of the music of James Horner was beautiful, although I've never been a big fan of My Heart Will Go On song. In 1996 miniseries was good, but suffers from underdeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox.
