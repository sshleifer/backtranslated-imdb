Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the show «South Park», come back with something completely different.They create a new sport that combines baseball and the sport is known as basketball.This baseketball.It like basketball, except that baseball rules are involved and there is another letter to the address as you play title.Here: you just throw the ball while these two guys are trying to distract you from the fact, shot.Sounds simple.In, I might try it out day.After game hits the streets, it soon becomes a huge success.Who would have known that two immature friends could come up amb a sport that has become so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> «BASEketball" is very rude and stupid hoax filled with plenty of slapstick violence, but it actually delivers some laughs and a lot of specific recommendations entertainment.A for those who love slapstick and crude humor.
