China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia star in the United States. These products Golden Harvet helmets was directed by veteran Robert Klaus. Unfortunately, it was either taken away with the Dragon, or he had lost touch, because it is not so great with the director. The only reason to watch this movie to see the fighting skills of Ms. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this film was directed by Corey Yuen Ha Maine or it could be the influence of the classic cheese instead of directly on the video action flick. <br /> <br /> China OBrayno returns home to help her father. It arose problems with the local mafia, and he needs her help. Thus, she returns home and restores the order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they be enough to overturn Mr Big and his evil minions? <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Cynthia, this film is met you. I just enjoyed the action scenes, the rest of the garbage. Why not Raymond Chow to shell out a few shekels and hired top action director of the expression? <br /> <br /> recommended.
