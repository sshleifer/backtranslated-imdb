I loved this movie when it came out in the 80s and still! I still quote the classic lines like "tell it again" and "did you say that to rip my balls with Pan." Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it has been underestimated and dropped MAD, I must say that this little gem will always be my treasure, and a movie that I would have to me if sent to a desert island! I just want someone to release a DVD, because my VHS tape of the worn-out! If you like cheesed of comedy, this is definitely for you, and should be considered a cult! This is a military humor at it's best and worse! Rent, if you can not have it!
