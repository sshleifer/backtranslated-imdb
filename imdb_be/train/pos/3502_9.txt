Wow! I loved this movie and love Judy Marte !! This girl is not just an amazingly beautiful person, she is funny and really talented !! She made me laugh many times over just by being very natural rough with Victor, who was desperately hitting on her! We'll see it a lot in the coming years ... and probably also by director Peter Sollett and co-stars Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Youth Victor Vargas is one of the best films I've seen in a long time! Very refreshing! It is true, beautiful, funny, good shot, he got it all: good story, good actors, good direction <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow pace, in real life, urban films as possible Jersey! Girl from Kevin Smith, you will love Victor Vargas! Better!
