I can not understand why so many users IMDb did not like this movie. Why do they think it's sooooo bad, etc. It's no worse than anything else out there. . Personally, I think the "Soldier" is a great film, much better than most of the other movies in this genre <br /> <br /> The reasons why I loved the "Soldier": Kurt Russell, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, screenplay (David Webb peoples), great visual effects, and directing (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I even think it's the best work I've seen from director Paul WS Anderson, who previously directed the entertainment «Mortal Kombat» and not as entertaining «Event Horizon».
