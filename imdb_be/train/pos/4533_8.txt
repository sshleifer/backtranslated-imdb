First time to see the first feature film Buster Keaton, and I must admit that it is very pleasant, and it is a pity that I came across it years ago. Abstract Rohauer at the beginning warns that three centuries of a nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954, just at the time of combustion, and many shots that seemed to be glued hopelessly divided. Thus, it is a rocky view in places, but I have seen and experienced much worse. <br /> <br /> It would be fine as 3 short films, but take on intolerance is inventive and funny from start to finish: In the Stone Age to the villain Wallace Beery riding an elephant riding and Buster goodie Brontosaurus pet; In Roman times, Buster riding a chariot with wheel locks, and adapted for the sled, Sun The parking signs in Latin; In this technological Era speed Need and greed of his car beautiful falls to pieces at the first bump. And he appears after Beery Girl for centuries, endless fights. Any bit: How cave he gets knocked back on the edge of the cliff, but still blowing a kiss to the camera - awesome second or two <br /> <br /> Great stuff, confirming his love silent comedy !.
