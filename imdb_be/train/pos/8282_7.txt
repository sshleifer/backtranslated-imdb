Possible ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Most of the film, which does not work IS Wendigo and if your title character fails, your movie is usually not far behind. interpretation filmmakers Wendy form of interest, and can be properly menacing when shot properly - if you flee thither to see Wendy in a flash in his rearview mirror, for example - and the tree-form was actually very good. However, as the monsters he never really comes to life. We do not get a lot of explanations for his behavior, and the fact that we see this does not fit with any story told in the film, or any Wendigo knowledge I have ever read. <br /> <br /> I think that one of the main reasons that the monster fails that is not given enough to do in the movie. If you boil this movie down to his bones, that you have is a thriller with a bit of the supernatural element, instead of a film about monsters. <br /> <br /> cinema is good, although a bit cheesy; the filmmakers used the scenery, lighting, and time of day to capture the atmosphere and mood as well. Otis character comes across as a really dangerous and unpredictable, making it a real monster in the film. It might be more effective to explain his behavior, his obsession with the spirit of hungry Wendigo, which would also be a clear understanding of the real legends. <br /> <br /> I've heard unconfirmed reports (from the news groups) that the reason the Wendigo not do that if the monster suit was built, he wound up so hard and uncomfortable, and (in order to simulate the position of his standing on the cloven hooves, artist had to walk on tiptoe), it was almost impossible to run, walk, or otherwise perform in it. Thus, many flash beings are in place, and obviously sped up footage of him running. I emphasize that these reports Uncomfirmed.
