*** possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Recently, I watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places, and was delighted with the action sequences. Ron Ely just as Doc. Cool, calm, almost always under control (and with a rare twinkle in his eye). What more could you ask? I've never read the book Doc Savage, so I do not know if it is true to the source, but I enjoyed the bright tone and recklessness. Many compare this film with Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not think that's fair. The difference in the budget strange (Raiders should have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have an extensive location work, the Raiders have. Special effects as well as a minimum, but come on people, the history of a lot of fun and humor is just right. Sousa music is catchy (I like this theme song- Every time I watch a movie, I end up humming the theme for a few days) .the best way to approach this film to just relax and enjoy. Highlights include spectacular opening sequence, where the fabulous five docking Chase Indian sniper on all the roofs of New York and very funny fight sequence between the Dock and the captain of the seas. Not so well, the villain, who is sleeping in a giant bed (really!). Overall, a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I give it a 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage Doc Savage ... thank you lord, he immediately!
