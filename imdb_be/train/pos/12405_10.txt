Caught this film in 1990 n on the video by accident and not knowing what I was in for. Many horror fans may have missed it thinking it was a typical prison film and those who get it do not like it, as it was not what they wanted to see. The above factors are likely, due to its low rating, but just ignore it and give it a whirl if you're a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> It has strong suits in all parts of the scenario and atmosphere to the current and most prison. <br /> <br /> The absolute diamond film I'm still in video and to this day. Check it out.
