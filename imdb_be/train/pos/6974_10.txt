I recently watched again Caprica and thought I might as well come in and write a review! The first time I saw it right after I saw the series finale of Battlestar Galactica (Being a big fan boys drooling show left me clinging to all that I could show universes), so I do not know what to expect ... but I came with a smile, even though I have to admit ... <br /> <br /> story begins abruptly on the planet Caprica, and we are introduced to a variety of interesting characters ... I will not give too much away, but there is a dramatic event, which dictates the course stories, but I suggest you watch this. <br /> <br /> I must say, ... Esai Morales from each actor, he pulled the young Joseph Adam. .. (Admiral father in Battlestar Galactica), I found the place, acting, and I could believe that he is the father of William Adams with BSG ... <br /> <br /> In addition, Eric Stoltz within its role exactly. ..! Special note it was good to see the outside Polly Walker Rome! Do not sit back and watch Caprica with the expectation of both Battlestar Galactica, because the plot is fairly straight forward, and anyone can watch it..without to have seen BSG!. <br /> <br /> This show is well written drama for those who like it a drama with a bit of a science-fiction shock!
