Matador witty dark humor and disturbing melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very interesting and sincere performances from Pierce Brosnan, who had never been better than here, and always reliable Greg Kinnear, who has his best role since play a gay neighbor Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets. A big plus is in writing, as well. Intelligent and sometimes very unpleasant dialogue is delivered with gusto by Brosnan and slow building of friendship between these two different people completely convincing all the way. The story takes some unexpected turns and keeps the audience constantly guessing where he was going to go on. <br /> <br /> Good artistic touches by the director, such as the use of good music, smart editing and a few non-traditional movie sometimes set a good tone for the film, and you do not quite know for a long period of time, how to label the film. But it is also thanks to a very well-written script that keeps the audience (me anyway) on the edge of his seat.
