Photos of the product-budget rate is surprisingly bad. The colors brown and muddy and photo has a very 80ish look at him. The direction and editing are often quite uninspired and TV-like film, too. * * And on the first film, it seems, just want to torture their audience with gloomy images of sex and violence. Hans Zimmer score also, as a rule, simple and fresh work of this oversized, talentless composer. <br /> <br /> But if you're ready to watch movies more you are rewarded with a very moving story of a family, a native version of the European family of Edna Ferber in the epic Giant. While at first you wonder why Clara was married to this idiotic man, even his character gets more depth and more background, you can judge it by. Clara provides spiritual lesson of the film, a large and moving statement set against the terrible events in his country. Her daughter, whose young lover Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understand that lesson and ultimately trying to live by it. The way the site was built with the end of the beginning of the mirror was great. The actors all do a great job, too. I asked: "Who is the actress playing Blank?" All the time, but of course, it was really a young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> In general, this movie really made me want to read the book.
