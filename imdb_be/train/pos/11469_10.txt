Everyone is aware of the case, it «» Zero Day "». What I think that this movie did that elephant is not that they made us see how these guys. They have shown their lives during the year. Throughout the film we see how they are, laugh with them, even if we are fully aware that they are going to do. And it gives me the shivers. Because I felt guilty to be cheered their comments, and I just thought that Cal was a nice guy. Even though I knew what would happen, you know? Even at the end of the film, when they were going to commit suicide, and just to decide if they would do it at the expense of 3 or 4, I thought it was funny, but still, I was horrified to see their heads blown off. Of course I was. I loved them. They were angry, maybe, but I felt that they were really normal guys, they really do not understand this. But I knew what they were. <br /> <br /> This is, IMO, the main strength of this film. It makes us realize that our friends or relatives, or anyone, could be something crazy plan, and that we do not even notice. This film, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can not go to sleep right now. There still is a little feeling in your stomach. Butterflies.
