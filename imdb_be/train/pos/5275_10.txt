This movie is great! This movie is great! And finally, the film reflects the Muslims as a people, no stereotypes here. This film is set in motion stories, which act primarily as its theme, that cultural affirmation and discovery. They may seem like a clich√©, but they are not, at least not in this movie. The prospect of the Grand Mosque of Mecca is absolutely huge and the audience got a glimpse of the side of the Muslim world, which rarely ever shown in the West. Here, people are restless, support, devout, tolerant and loyal to each other. What is desired and delayed by departing from the conventional negative images Arab. An outstanding film.
