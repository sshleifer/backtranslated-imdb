I enjoyed watching the movie on that and look very young William Powell (Phil Vance) plays a detective in the same way as he did with the Peace lym in «Thin Man Series». Back in 1930 William Powell played Philo Vance Series and in this picture, the famous veteran actress Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in the murder / suicide, where a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barro) found dead and Archer was in the room, which was locked from the inside. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Damage / Archer Secretary) gave a great supporting role and was the brother of Frank Morgan, who appeared "The Wizard of Oz" in 1939 Eugene Palette, (Detective Sergeant Heath) appeared very little of any of Philo Vance films, and also gave performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember that the least likely actor could well be the killer. Enjoy a classic from the past.
