I waited and waited for the movie to come out, the trailers seemed for many years, it is worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over again, but I can not wait for this to happen for everyone to buy! Not a big fan of Jim, but it is great to him, there was so much to see and "feel good factor" rolls, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron has done an amazing job turning it into a movie if you have not seen it, do it, if you have to watch it again, I know what you want!
