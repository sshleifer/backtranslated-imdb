Personally, I think that the movie was done very professionally, I loved the choreography and action. The plot also Exciting and mysterious. The film is very emotional, and what I liked about it most is that it makes you think after. Antonio Gades quite lived his role until the end, and I must say that this is one of my favorite photos and Saur great director.
