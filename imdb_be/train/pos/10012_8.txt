Night Listener, is probably not one of the best roles of William, but it makes a very interesting character in several countries, but a completely different film. I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of film before. Some people may not be as slow walks this film, but I think it's a big plus movie. This is definitely one of the best films released in 2006 It is an intriguing idea in the cinema with great content, dramatic feelings. This is not the Americanized film. Neither is it predictable film. You just feel that this is a film that has the secrets that you have a hard time to determine what may be the result of this. This is not a perfect film, which has all but hell, it's damn good and very original.
