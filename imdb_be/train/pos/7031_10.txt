This is a great movie, I made the game a while ago. It was an additional zing-- him. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosie and Jason Alexander has a good voice. It was great. Installation is also very good. In addition, it is 2 o'clock and 50 minutes, making it quite a long time. Overall, I give it 8.5 stars. They also added a few pieces, but it was still cool.
