Distortion is a film that kind of caught me off guard .. What a multilayered drama that focuses on a man to write a play about his life experience that comes with it right at this moment. To be shorter, he feels that his wife is cheating on him, so he hires a private detective to Snoop on it. His wife has no idea that this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this game and have a few whoopdedoodles sleeve for fooling around with each other and with, say, unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. All of this culminates in the theater with all the actors present and predictable (but not quite) occurs. <br /> <br /> Director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the ensemble characters and edits the path that makes you pay attention, it's a fun film in fact, one that I do not mind watching and would recommend people to check out.
