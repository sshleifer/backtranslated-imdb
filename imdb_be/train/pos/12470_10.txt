I just saw this movie on TV .. <br /> <br /> I lost my father when I was young, and this film is, of course, touch me .. <br /> <br /> I can feel it, lost that little girl felt Desi .. <br /> <br /> feeling of wanting to see her father again .. <br /> <br /> wants to talk to him .. <br /> <br /> or at least, a chance to say goodbye .. <br /> <br /> and I'm so touched by the letter that was written to it .. <br /> <br /> I say that her father read her letter and sent it back to someone to answer her and buy her a gift, because it does not store in the sky .. <b r /> <br /> it just makes me feel that miracles do exist ..
