Much like a comedy duo from its name, «The Sunshine Boys» became a forgotten classic 30 years later. It is hardly mentioned along with other great movie comedies of the 1970s. It makes no sense, given the singular critical of this film, perhaps the best Neil Simon ever wrote. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays Willie Clark, when half of the legendary stand-up comedy known as Lewis and Clark, is now a bitter 73-year-old solo act, who can not get a job in the commercial chips. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is confident that he can get the job done, if Willie would only agree to reunite with his former partner Al Lewis (George Burns) for ABC-TV show business celebration nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia that "The Sunshine Boys" going for it in spades, from the beginning, when a series of 1920 films clips demonstrating various artists from long ago flashed in front of us to the accompaniment of Cole Porter «Be A Clown». Then there's the setting in Manhattan, where expanding pants and wide polyester film ties abound today. Periods face in glorious mess Willie out of the apartment in Manhattan, where framed pictures and cartoons of long-dead celebrities stare from the walls in a dark tabloid headlines and empty grocery bags Zabara. If you were alive in the 1970s, like me, you may even feel like you were in the apartment. <br /> <br /> Willy apparently lives there too long. He is sleeping in front of TV, when the kettle boils in another room. Willie wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> «Hello, who is it?" Pause. "Nothing, it's tea.» <br /> <br /> The old living alone can be boring material about someone else's hands, but a quick mind Simon and unerring sense of character makes this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit the comedy gold. Strange thing about «The Sunshine Boys» as he rubs their noses in an almost existential condition Willy, not turning you at all. "89 years old and just like that, it dies out of nothing", "Willie says an old friend of songs before you decide, the man probably died of writing lyrics that rhymed" lady "with" child. "<br /> <br /> Burns won an Oscar for his understated performance as a mild, but steel Lewis, but it Matthau, who brings this one home, make-up and proud, but uneven bearing really sells you on the idea that he was already 73 when he made it. Willie unpleasant in the extreme case, it is a decent description of Ben's "crazy Freakin 'old', but the root of it everywhere, get mlivayuchy enjoy its small victories, even if they come at the expense of other people's patience. His line to kill you, too, especially when he is trying to kill Lewis, for whom TV Reunion is a bad idea. <br /> <br /> « you cut off! "Willie Lewis said at one point." I continue to be in demand. I'm still hot! »<br /> <br />« If the room was on fire will not be hot, "Lewis responds. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross removes all in a very relaxed and quietly, with low lighting and the average shot distance, even in the emotional moments so as to leave room for comedy and a whole Zen message film about the grace of quiet acceptance. You never get the feeling that you are watching a movie, one of «The Sunshine Boys» many charms, and the direction of Russia, as well as actions of three directors, goes a long way towards achieving this goal. <br /> <br /> comedy is difficult, especially if the test persons watching life pass them by, but «The Sunshine Boys» makes it all seem fun, because we have to look for it.
