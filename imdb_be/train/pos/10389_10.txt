I saw this film when I was a kid. He blew me away. This was before the days of television, so the film of this magnitude, can send a young goat in orbit. It so impressed me that I went to see this film in twelve days. Special effects used at the time were far ahead of their time. Sabu was a real delight as Rex Ingram as the Genie. I found myself singing, "I want to be a sailor," within a few months after the film came out of the city. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was, as the criminal nature of how you want to meet. In addition, June Duprez was never more beautiful than it was in this picture. The color was excellent. Give this film AAA!
