This is a wonderful film visually. Images of the Mexican desert, the ancient building, the characters in their picturesque costumes ... all amount to a work of art. <br /> <br /> the story seems a little loose, but that's because it's not meant to be realistic. It is taken from a book entitled One Hundred Years of Solitude, and it should be a suggestion of an isolated, otherworldly atmosphere of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States." The huge debt that Erendira owes his grandmother is a symbol of the international debt burden in Latin America, although there are many layers of meaning. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate the slow-moving, richly textured movie, this one is for you.
