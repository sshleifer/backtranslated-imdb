I, like many die-hard Trekkers (or Trekkies, I do not care!) Survived seven seasons «Star Trek Voyager», dreaming of a better show when it was all over, mourning the end of «Deep Space Nine» in 1999. prayers answered. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh look radically different characters, gorgeous new visuals pop song for the intro. (I was shocked!) I can not think of anything I did not like. sign me up for the 10 seasons of the show. "Star Trek" back - «Voyager» nobody misses! Continue Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
