This show was Fabulous. It was a complex and well-written, and all the characters, where the cute from the outside to be awfully nice. Even Jonathan cake debauchery guy was cute. As our airwaves filled with crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see the drama, which was not too soap opera like. It has always been intriguing to see how each character will be connected to the following circumstances. It's really annoying that we have finally a show that makes you think a little, and it is thrown because of a mysterious quantity that most of us do not even pay attention. Some of us are not sheep. This show is not to be missed, may not be a lot of people, but some pretty dedicated fans.
