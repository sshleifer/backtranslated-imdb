It was only on my second viewing, years later, I realized two things about this movie: 1) I enjoyed it very much, and 2) that, as its performance is clearly sharper than the actual order placement. I laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to recover their initial protests - ValleySpeak and loogies and airheadedness (even * good * -natured airheadedness) just do not inherently funny, especially when stretched along the length of the signs. But although the momentum of the film really starts to crack towards the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon youngest in the memorable scene) display such a wonderful sense of comic timing for that is even more clumsy-scripted jokes (eg, Ted fail to recognize specific resident hell) operate easily as those, Witter (e.g., a call). And Teaming Winter and Reeves clicks so well that Teaming Bill and Ted (who spend only one scene separated throughout the film, disaster, if they are not well-chosen) is completely relaxed. <br /> <br /> (Side note :. I have found that the first film is only sporadically entertaining - a nice variety of comic feelings there seems to be) <br /> <br /> I give it 7.75. Surprisingly good fun.
