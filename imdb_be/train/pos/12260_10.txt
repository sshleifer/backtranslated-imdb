This is a great start for the film career of Mickey Rooney. His talents here shows that a long career ahead of him. Car and truck exciting chase for the 1937 period. This is the beginning of a series of Andy Hardy is an American treasure in my book. Bayinton performance is excellent, as usual. Please, Mr. Rooney or owners of the rights to movies, play it safe and get it done on the DVD. I think it will be a winner.
