Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories, and I did not know it. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda." But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Nolte course was great, but it was a story. It has been relatively little political intrigue, and much more attention to moral issues: reading his anti-Semitic radio comments with hidden secret messages of Americans, it actually helped the general attitude of Germans (and, as it turns out, the Americans) to the Jews and Hitler. Which has more weight, his service to his country, or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more pronounced, because the words never said, not even as a story. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a man who has learned to hide their feelings so well that it does not open, even in his memoirs. The internal conflict of this nature is almost impossible to describe - but with the help of wonderful acting and photos, this film manages. <br /> <br /> There are other points to it, such as humor or ironic use of romantic clich√©s (for example, the song White Christmas), which make it a real different from the average American films. I recommend it to all who are bored with spyware Hollywood films.
