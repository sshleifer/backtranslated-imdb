As Westerners, observing the view of another culture and traditions marriag, I found Just Married mesmerizing and beautiful. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger through the relative position of the parents is difficult, especially in the modern era. Nevertheless, it is in this film in Hindi. This was reported with humor, and with fresh eyes, we learn Abhay and Ritika, who had met only once, and now on their traditional five-day honeymoon. As already mentioned, it is difficult to believe in this mobile phone is rich age that such archaic practices as arranged marriages still occur. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feel like they are coming together on their first night, and they are trying to communicate, even if they do not know each other. We see different types of marriage and the obligations provided other couples on vacation, from a pair of forty years married to another is still not sure to make a family commitment. In the same song, witty dialogue, critical moments, mixing, and comparison of new ways and traditions. Watching a movie with subtitles defined loses some veracity of this story, but it is still playing pleasure. Of course, some of the plot a bit banal and the bus incident a little drawn out and contrived; Overall, however, the movie is worth watching.
