Holes strange film. I love it a lot, and this is one of my favorite movies. This is one of the few production-clicking Disney, which is not cheesy. The holes are usually very cool movie. I would like to make Disney more shots as he did. Holes really rare Disney flicker breed shows, it's cool. Do not get the wrong idea, I do not mean bad Disney's mouth, but most of this material is directed to the child and that's fine. Children deserve to have their fun too. But Disney was guilty of an attempt to appeal to the teenage audience, and they usually fail. But with holes. This type of film people of all ages can watch and enjoy, not once thinking that it is banal. In fact, this is a film that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy, as there are characters in it that they can affect. <br /> <br /> Hole does a good job is a mixture of good family fun, but not very cheesy and live a little on the edge. I hope that Disney has more risks and make more sharp click, like this.
