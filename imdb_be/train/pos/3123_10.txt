This is the first 10 out of 10 that I gave any movie. What made this film so well for me? Constant action - there is no slow parts, a lot of action, clever writing. I also liked the style of shooting, where sweating and different angles just made it feel like you are part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that does not try to please all sectors of society (ie there is no enforcement of the novel). <br /> <br /> I like the first two Bourne films, but I loved it. <br /> <br /> Warning - after watching this film, you will be full of adrenaline, and you can calm down a bit before driving!
