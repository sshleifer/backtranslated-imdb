Also known as the "Stairway to Heaven" in the United States. During the Second World War (David Niven) Peter Carter of the British plane shot down in combat, but he survives. He meets and falls in love with an excellent June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that a mistake was made in Heaven - he had to die! French spirit comes to get him, but he refuses. He quickly plead her case before the Heavenly Tribunal, which should be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> It sounds funny, but it's really an incredible film. The script is good with actors playing the role perfectly straight face, and it's beautifully directed - the scene in the world at breakneck Technicolor (I have never seen such a beautiful blue sky) and sky scene in black and white! Niven little stiff, but sometimes Hunter just fine (and very nice) and Roger Livesey perfect as a doctor trying to help Niven. Imagery within countries (especially the stairs and in the final test sequence), and the special effects are really great (considering the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence if Niven works in a completely naked young boy herding sheep! It is absolutely beautiful, thoughtful film - highly recommended. It is unknown in the United States, which is a shame.
