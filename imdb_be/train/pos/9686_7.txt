Sentimental story with sentimental soundtrack. We are talking about a little girl (with a voice impediment), who appreciates her green parrot Pl. Parrot thinks and speaks as a man, and renders assistance and advice to his constant companion. <br /> <br /> parrot is definitely the star of the film. From time to time naughty and sometimes in fits of depression bird captures the mood of the most beautiful and clear manner. Simultaneous voice is also very well done, and for a minute or two, you can believe that this intelligent bird there. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, her father gives the bird and the moneylender subsequent scenes tell the story of constant struggle Sings for many years to be reunited with his mistress. One of the many memorable scenes, when he gets into bad company and it is recommended to monitor the people using ATMs. Paulie, it seems, has a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> ending is predictable, but who would want it otherwise. Kids will love this film and everyone who keeps the bird as a pet will delight in the antics of Poly.
