Castle in the sky, no doubt, is a film by Hayao Miyazaki. After watching it for the first time, I am happy to say that it does not disappoint. On the contrary, you get are worth your time, which means (as to what Miyazaki films are caring) that is no less than great! <br /> <br /> Made in the beginning of his cinematographic career, Castle in the Sky is waiting for a lot of brands in the later films, with strong (but young) female characters who are forced to grow because of external circumstances, helped out some very interesting (and several times attractive) support the characters. And, of course, the usual battle of nature versus civilization, aircraft (a lot of it !!), beautiful scenery painted ?? but, unfortunately, entirely pigs (at least that I've noticed since I've not only seen it once). However, Miyazaki sun has got his stage debut two years ago, with Nausicaa, who was a dress rehearsal for the Princess Mononoke, his opus. The lock bit is set in the sky portion of the two, with a mild action packed first 30 minutes, reminiscent of its series Conan, and directed episodes Meitantei Holmes. Here we are introduced Sieve, a girl who literally falls from the sky, can be found only on the groove, the young boy who works in a small mountain countryside town. Which interested her amnesia and suspected a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Groove installed to help her know where she came from, while fleeing from the army and gang of hijackers. In the course of the film, the plot becomes more difficult and much more entertaining, opening Myiazaki at its best. <br /> <br /> The sound track is very reminiscent of Gone (or vice versa, as a castle in the sky made the first), and as well as its director, Joe Hisaishi _The composer_ begins with very easy account that is becoming increasingly complex and beautifully fitting, as the story goes forward! <br /> <br /> note in the English dub, with a good interpretation of the two lead stars, although Sieve Anna Paquin have a very strong accent (which the actress was still at this point in her career), and headed for how Hamill muska, making for a pleasing yet diabolical villain! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one people!
