This film is about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with his family just fine! <br /> <br /> This is not an idealistic film, I would say, it shows life as it is, or was in the 60s and 70s, when the main story takes place. The characters are very good, but there are also some "dark" side, what makes you believe that these are real people. A great movie with great actors, to show that life is not funny all the time, but you can find happiness with "fire and passion" as the protagonist Giga would say.
