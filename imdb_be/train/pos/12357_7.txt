I really liked this movie, and went back to see him twice a week. <br /> <br /> Ms. Detmers productivity gains - it was like a hungry cat on the hunt, playing with her prey. She lashes out in rage and lust, taking "too young" lover, and the roar of hundreds of pieces of her mother terrorist groom in fine china on the floor. <br /> <br /> The film is full of beautiful touches. Maserati, a great wardrobe, flower boxes along the roof. I especially enjoyed the ancient Greek class and recitation of "Antigone» <br /> <br /> It was a feeling of "Story of O" -.. That is, where people indulge in unrestrained means sexual adventures as she walks around naked in a fantastic apartment, she ease - and why not, to restrain "Devil in the flesh» <br /> <br /> the entire film is a real treat ?!
