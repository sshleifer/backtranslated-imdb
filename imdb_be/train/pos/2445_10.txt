I really like this show. That's why I was disappointed to learn that recently George Lopez is a racist, and he shot Masiel Luz from the show, simply because he found that it was not Latino emigrant, but came from Albania. I learned about it from the people on the show. It was truly one of the best parts of the show, and thus to learn that even among those who would have you would have thought to be sensitive to racism, that they too can hate someone just because of the country where they born, really disappointing.
