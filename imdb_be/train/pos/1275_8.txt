I found this film to be charming. I thought that the characters were developed, as I looked, I found that the care of these people. It's a period piece, which I believe was the case during the depression. A single mother, which is known as a city recluse (it has to be a base), contains a newspaper advertisement for "man". Christopher Reeve plays ex-prisoner who comes to the city in search of work. He sees an ad, and he goes to see her. She hires him. I really had some giggles as their relationship progresses, because I found it easy to put myself in their place. Everything was going well, in fact. He needs work, so he does not want to upset her. And she needs his help, but do not want to gain the upper hand. They dance around the fact that they start really need each other. Things start heating up ...... big inflated. I will not spoil it by telling you what's going on. But the essence of the resolution is absolutely wonderful. I found that the story is very plausible for the time it takes place. I think this is one of the best "relationship" stories out there. Maybe the younger generation will not "get it", but if you are older than 40 years, I think you'll like. And if you like Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time" you'll love it there, too.
