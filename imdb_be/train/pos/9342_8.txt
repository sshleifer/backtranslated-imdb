Powerful great movie. Stay in a death grip, as soon as you allow yourself to be carried away with the story. A successful dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), throw in a life crisis of his career, balancing with his family. He says his former college roommate, Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to reconcile. He believes that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the 9-11 attacks on America, is no longer in touch with reality ... the choice to draw his mind with his favorite music from the past and video games. Former neighbors to revive their friendship and strengthen their former relationship. Johnson has his friend Angel Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try to bring Charlie out of his misery ... but it's Alana performing in getting his friend to get out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays the wife of Johnson. Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie attorney / guardian. Also starring Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Edel Modell and Robert Klein. Outstanding soundtrack featuring likes of Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders <br /> <br />. Note: I have never been a supporter of Sandler; but I found it outstanding in this role. In some scenes, I thought out loud ... why he has never been approached to play the singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in biopic.
