The name just says it all. I watched this movie with my father, when he came out, and having served in Korea, he was a man admired. Disappointing thing about this film, which is to focus only on the short period of life - interestingly enough, all human life would make such an epic bio pass that stuns present production costs <br />. <br /> Some posters escape to incorrect performance of the person cheap shots. The theme of the movie "Duty, Honor, Country" are not just words blathered from the mouth of a high-ranking officer brassed. - is a profound declaration of complete devotion to one person in the country <br /> <br /> Strangely enough Peck to be a liberal, he's got a better understanding of the person. He does a great job showing the fearless General tempered with the humane side of man.
