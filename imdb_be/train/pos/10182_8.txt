a good film, good music, good background and a suitable plot. but most importantly, just his films, usually a person is the best actor in IDIA and can turn dust into gold. Nana Patekar. this may be his second best result after parinda (others may disagree). although other films are not far behind. one person who will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> a good movie, but I think Shahrukh was a luxury, this film could have done without. you can see in his films, others are trying very hard to reach their heights and act with their skins. but this man is really something elase. <br /> <br /> cool movie, music and a great story line a bit thin, but the screen play and dialogue once again very good. You should look.
