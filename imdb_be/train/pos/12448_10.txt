Firstly; I am a loyal fan of modesty, and reading comic books since I was a kid, and I found the earlier films of our heroine is not satisfactory, but where they fail, this one ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Well, here we go: Ms Blaise working for the casino, the gang of robbers comes and it starts gambling for his friends lived. If the robber wins one round, she would have to tell him about herself. If she wins twice in a row, one of the staff comes to freedom. (Sounds silly, yes, well, I'm not so good at explaining how to ..)) <br /> <br /> She tells him about growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends about her helping an old man in the camp refugees and how they run, living by their own rules of nature. They hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and to fight. As they approach the civilization they get caught up in the war, and how they are taken to the riots, they shoot and die an old man who leaves her to meet the city on your own. <br /> <br /> Then she meets a man who is now the casino it operates, and the story ends. <br /> <br /> What should follow that there is a huge fight, and the lines are absolutely great. Alexander is a great step Modesty Blaise! Just as the humble and strong, smart and intelligent as a comic one. <br /> <br /> Feels awkward, though still hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent, but it does not matter, since the comic book- Blaze can not speak loudly, but it certainly should have several existing accent. (Not to mention the fact that it's weird, all this speaks in English in the Balkan ..) <br /> <br /> To act is really good, even a child who embodies the young Blaise should applaud! <br /> <br /> My favorite part has to be there, where she tore her dress kick ass stupid robber! Absolutely amazing! : D I can not wait for the real adventure begins in the next movie / s <br /> <br /> Be careful, you will not be disappointed!
