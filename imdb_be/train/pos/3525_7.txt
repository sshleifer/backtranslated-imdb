Man, it's hard to DVD, to come. I could only find it in the area 2, the Spanish imports, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> It was worth it? Well, yes. Not so much because it is a masterpiece of filmmaking, although the director Siodmak (credits on IMDb.com read "Robert", but also a DVD list Curt credits), or because he has a few familiar figures from the other murder mysteries - Elisha Cook Jr. Thomas Gomez - but because my ten years of curiosity about the film finally was granted <br /> <br /> in fact, my dear, but self-sufficient engineer (Alan Curtis) was standing. his ex-wife and finds himself in a bar in New York City with two show tickets in your pocket. A woman with an amazing hat on a chair next to him, and he politely invites her to join him in a music review. It takes a bit gloomy. Mopey bartender gives them both in the eye when they leave. <br /> <br /> On the show, stormy Star notes that the lady in the audience wearing the same hat and breaks the scenes with anger. Drummer in the band, Cook, Leers a quiet lady, but gets no response. Curtis takes a woman to her home and asked her name, but she will not, and she did not want to know him. If she had been a devotee of Longfellow, she would have said something about the ships that pass in the night. <br /> <br /> Well, Curtis comes home to find his wife was killed in his absence. Police chiefs, Gomez, turns it to the DA. His only alibi that he was a phantom lady that no one seems to remember ,, - not a bartender, not Latina star, not a taxi driver ( "Al-Alpes"), rather than the drummer - and since the very lady disappeared, it is impossible to dig it. <br /> <br /> Curtis convicted and sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez thought things and decided it probably innocent, because no one with a brain will not have such a stupid story. He joins a loving Secretary Curtis, Ella Raines, in a re-investigation into the case informally. <br /> <br /> They revisit imaginary witness. Sinister bartender move the car, perhaps by accident, so it from the picture. Spitfire Latina left because the show ended, and she uncooperative and ignorant hat sources anyway. Elisha Cook Jr., strangled the real killer, but not before he is shown in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face assumes an expression that does not provide intense focus, but rather monstrous, orgasmic insanity. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth gaping, its impact becomes insane. I laughed out loud. Performance <br /> <br /> No one else outstanding, but they are all quite professional. Thomas Gomez always reliable. The best performance, though, probably, Franchot tons. He is the real killer, and he is faking his alibi. He is reserved and artistic. Even if he loses consciousness, he respectfully. I do not know how to correct it, but the tone seems to think the same way as just acting a part. Alan Curtis as an innocent engineer close to zero on the Kelvin scale and relies in the film B. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it is regarded as a classic. It's really your main murder mystery by Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But the direction of Siodmak significantly. Man gets runs and wind hat in a ditch with water running around it. His use of shadows quietly effective. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I got it.
