I saw it on the cable back in the early 90's and loved it. I never saw him again until he appeared on the cable again recently. Nevertheless, I believe this is a great Vietnam movie. I do not know why it is not higher than the rating. I found everything about this film compelling. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought both Harris and Robert De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is more bitter now with our situation in Iraq. I wish it would have been offered to the cables for most people to see. Human sacrifices of our soldiers left on the battlefield. They brought him home for the rest of there life. And this film is one of many that bring this house in a very difficult way. Great movie.
