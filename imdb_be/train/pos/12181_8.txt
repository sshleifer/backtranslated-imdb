"The Lady from Shanghai" is well known as one of the most problematic of Hollywood productions. Wells's original cut was taken manufacturers and cut into strips. This made the already complicated story mystery even more difficult to track. They post duplicate a good amount of his dialogue because of the density of the Irish accent, and dubbing are all too obvious and badly done. The most devastating of all, Wells and his on-screen and in real life leading lady Rita Hayworth fell apart in their relationship, and their tempestuous chemistry comes through on the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this is overcome only as the direction of Orson Welles has fantastic. He makes the film an incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene just seems to breathe the back of the screen. In addition, characters and scenes are so amazing that they border on fairy and unreal. This feeling of strangeness to build a scene that is common in these films, such as the sequence in the middle of the court. I usually find COURTROOM Drama hole, but the direction and brisk Wells risks make them as exciting as anything else. The end of the carnival reminds one of David Lynch almost. <br /> <br /> The action here is also very good. Despite the faulty attitude, Wells and Hayworth both give worthy performances - their interaction, but just a bit lacking. Everything else is great and wonderful to watch, though, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The Lady from Shanghai" obviously has its problems, but it is worth watching just to see one of the masters of cinema at its best. (8/10)
