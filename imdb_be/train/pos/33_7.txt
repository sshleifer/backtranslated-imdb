This is an interesting Giallo enhances typical, but still a fascinating story and a truly sadistic killer, who apparently likes to hunt down his victim before killing them bloody ways. <br /> <br /> The director Emilio P. Miraglia who one year earlier, is also very interesting «La Notte Che Evelyn USCI della Tomba" (see also my comment on that one), the movie starts a little slow, but overall, no time is wasted on unnecessary sub-regions or sequences. <, Br /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but he was released in Germany on the video version only trimmed a 15-minute story called stupid "house of horrors". At least, the murder scene, that will satisfy all gorehound, completely intact, and the viewer will still receive at the end of a killer tune. But the Italian version, containing all the footage is still one to look, of course. <br /> <br /> convincing Giallo mandatory twists and red herrings, «La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte» strongly recommended Giallo fans and a little above the above mentioned Miraglia another thriller.
