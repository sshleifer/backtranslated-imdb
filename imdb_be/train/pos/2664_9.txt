While Shining is more than a quarter of a century ago, I defy anyone not to get shocked by descent into madness Jack Nicholson. This is a rare example of what is so unique that no one has been able to break it; instead it was a reference time and again in popular culture. Twins, blood elevator, Redrum, crazy nonsense "write" ... it must be seen, if nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is both frightening, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has a classic Hitchcock's mystery and horror of the modern thriller. And it has some horror movies usually do not have: a great script.
