classic novel by Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers was tinkered with in recent years throughout the film by Paul Verhoeven in 1997 in the television series, in a number of games. But none of them, so to speak, not really captured the spirit of his novel. Games tend to be linked, the series was a separation, and talk less about Verhoeven's film, the better. Small and most are aware, however, that in Japan, the animated adaptation has been done, it released a year Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite the differences, this 6-part animated series is, story-wise, the most faithful adaptation of the classic. <br /> <br /> Heinlein's most obvious advantage to this series is the presence of powered armor exoskeletons that we were deprived of in the upper film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, although we see a sufficient amount of each of them. While the events are different than in the book, the feeling of the book there is a plot. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it is only a little more than touched upon in the book. Although some may believe, the dialogue and character interaction to be slightly inferior to the book (it becomes a bit of treatment anime, but what do you expect?), But it is much better film. Heinlein's political views are simply cut, unlike film, where they swapped. Big win series, however, the climatic battle of Klendathu between soldiers and errors / aliens, having the form of actions on power armor we would have like to see in the film. <, Br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this series, because I would like to see a vision closer to Heinlein. And I think they're very good at it. If you can find the series, give it a look.
