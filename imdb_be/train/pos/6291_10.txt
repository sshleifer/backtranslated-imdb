Well, this is certainly unexpected episode. In this anthology science fiction series, with all these aliens, emergency occurrences and many brushes with the future life, this episode will surely appreciate how unusual. His seemingly minor adjustments, apparently without giving any moral at the end of the story. Or is it? Starting with the dumb film form, entirely written dialogue, but with musical accompaniment. In this case, on an audio track, without using the playback controls or the piano at an observation musician. This part of the episode, along with the end of the division, and the liberal use of the name of the card, as well as "Cinema Old Time.» While these names are a bit overblown and exaggerated, they did so deliberately and with a love for, and not any lack of respect for The Silent Film. <br /> <br /> Veteran Comedy Film director Norman Z. McLeod was a man in the department for this half-hour party. He was the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time, with the participation of people like the Marx Brothers,, W.C. Fields, Harold Lloyd and Danny Kaye. He was no stranger to television, as he did a lot of work on the television series. <br /> <br /> It does not seem that he and Mr. Keaton never worked together (as I can not find evidence of this), "but, judging by the result of the film, they have succeeded in this with flying colors! Anyone who directed Keaton was aware that Buster was also a great comedy director, as well as Comedy Player. He was just as comfortable behind the camera, he was in front of him.

For example, the gag put a pair of pants with (the help of Stanley Adams Rollo was made Keaton and Roscoe "Thick» Arbuckle Arbuckle in one of the 2 machines for reeling, garage (1919). It was a prime example of his case in a nutshell. <br /> < br /> Buster knew that we remove our world with the camera, making it a two-dimensional image. This is a fact, at the bottom of so many jokes. This is the main rule for his film solutions. <br /> <br /> starring were small and again simply overwhelmed veteran talent. Stanley Adams was Rollo and served as direct people Mr. Keaton. J. B White, old «Maytag repair men", ran to fix it shop, which recorded «Time HJelmet». Gil Lamb, calm veteran series CSC Short Comedy, was the 1890 Cop. James Flavin, George E.Stone, Harry Fleer, Warren Parker, Milton Parsons and all round this mostly silent cast. <br /> <br /> Without spilling the beans, let's just say that yes, there is probably a lesson here. If you do not have one already mentioned, "The grass always seems greener on the other side of the fence! "while the" Be careful what you ask for because you just might get it! "
