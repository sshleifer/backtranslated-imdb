Summer was so full of blockbuster movies and returns, not to mention some of the frustrations of those returns, I mount to find a film that I could just sit down and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to continue to read down the page (no spoilers), I summarize it here: This is more mature than the Enchanted Al (there are some questionable violent part of, plenty of death, and several scenes with a small amount of blood, but not for small children), but does not try to be too banal or overstep their boundaries. Think of it as a little more serious, bitten a charming princess bride, and you'll be next. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I may not be as monstrous movie goer as other ... maybe once or twice in month, when I feel active. I'm also a big fan of Sci-Fi / Fantasy. I get tired of repeating recycled storylines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is a diamond in the rough. <br /> <br /> By the end here (August), I was pretty tired fracture expectations of big hits that I avoided seeing Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. Reaching my expectations completely muddied transformers for my addiction fiction, the previews Stardust seemed attractive, but I certainly wary. <br /> <br /> Like many others here, I was totally impressed. I went in thinking, to see another generic fantasy film clich√©d here for breakfast. Do not be fooled, this is definitely a fairy tale, and it really has wizards, magic and does require the suspension of disbelief ... But the most refreshing I've found that it is not based on anything I 've seen or read in the past 15 years, and it's actually a very good film. <br /> <br /> ((unlike 90% of other films that seem to be constantly re-emerge as a thorn in the side, perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? I could read a book this year and two years later the film will be like the other "epic fantasy tale, love LotR and the rest of" NYT says so and so, and so there is no doubt.)) <br /> <br /> Stardust had not screwed me to my place of killed for actions at every step, and I was not sweating bullets because of the hook portion of the hook portion after threatening to break the drama of one another and echo throughout the theater a loud boom. He did not even use the huge explosions of sound to capture my attention to what is happening on the screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). He was not trying to show the latest technology CGI, and not insult my intelligence with the narrow-minded dialogue and storylines that are simple enough, I could have understood them in the 3rd class (boy, I hate those). <br /> <br /> I just ... looking. Watched and enjoyed the refreshing CREATIVE plot unfolds before my eyes. Of course, I could know what will occur for most of the movie, but it makes you forget. He even made my heart is shot in some parts, but the most important aspect that I noticed that I left the theater feeling better than when I went in. <br /> <br /> This is really a gem. After so much slush this summer so many remakes and films that did not meet my expectations, it was like a cold sweet tea cup cap all the hard work I did, sitting across the other trying to get out of them. should be <br /> <br /> This is my money, probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you love fantasy films that have stood the test of time alone (Princess Bride, black cauldron, Dark Crystal, etc.), then you should really see this film. This small diamond finds its way into my DVD collection at a time, it will hit the stores, you can trust me on this. <br /> <br /> Just wonderful.
