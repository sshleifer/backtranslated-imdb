Most people, especially young people, can not understand this movie. This is similar to the loss of history if it is in fact a story about alone. Some people can never feel lonely at this level. <br /> <br /> Cheadles character Johnson displayed the total opposite of the character Sandlers Fineman. Where Johnson felt trapped in his blessings, Fineman tries to forget his life in the same point of view. Judd is an excellent additive to Sandler throwing and pulling tear. Cheadle was a comic role, and was a big fan of Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see Oscar in here somewhere. A very thin film. If you've ever lost and lonely, this film will assure you that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
