This brilliant sci-fi film, which is very strange, as men and women, like watching the same movie. I talked with many people about the film, and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant - while most of the women thought that it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only film I know that there are polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for the disgusting and depressing subjects - but whatever the reason, I've always found fascinating the difference <br /> <br /> The film opens with the murder and subsequent investigation led by Charlton Heston. , It is established in the near future, and the head of a huge international corporation Soylent was killed. Unfold the movie, you'll quickly realize that this is terrible and very uneven future American society. The rich live in luxury apartments with security and all the joys of money can buy (including "furniture" - a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment). At the same time, the mass of dirt poor, unemployed, and in many cases are living in abandoned cars or residential corridor. Overpopulation and could have taken heavy losses, and the future looks awful really! <br /> <br /> Why do the rich man died and terrible truth that he could not live with, I really do not need to discuss - this can spoil the movie for you. However, the film has a great story and acting and super-fun to watch. In addition, it has Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as crisp sidekick to Heston. Although it is not easy for depression or squeamish, it's a big sci-fi film, which is allegorical and deep.
