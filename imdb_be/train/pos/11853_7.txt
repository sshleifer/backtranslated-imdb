Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and do not try too hard to analyze. Acting rather amateurish at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. The storyline is pretty stock, but with an interesting twist. Computer run amok, but not quite the computer up and running is very clear when the truth is revealed. Nevertheless, the film has its moments and completely watchable. For me, at least, part of the charm of the film's leading role Kristine DeBell. It may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former Playmate of the Month, it is quite cute. Pod in all life is very similar to other low budget Sci-Fi films of the 1980s and to some extent predictable. <br /> <br /> White Star Lines bit cute when completely inaccurate. The last of the shares of White Star Lines Company was acquired by Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the flag of White Star was the Britannic (Titanic sister did not), which was sold for scrap in 1960.
