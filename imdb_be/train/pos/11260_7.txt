Well the story a bit hard to follow at first, but it's only because of all the bare chest 70s painted up a vampire / witch dance on the bongos. This, of course, interrupted by a few vampiric orgy. And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them. And for a girl on girl action, vampire or no ... this film simply rocks !!!
