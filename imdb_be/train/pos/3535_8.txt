** Warning - contains spoilers! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this game. I got it for Christmas after two months hinted to my parents. I am glad that I did it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that one player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game when you are at a party in London, and some evil guys ruin his daughter's kidnapping of the Prime Minister. Of course, you have to save her, and it's quite a big level, but should probably take you at least five minutes. The best part, and I also think it's funny when you're in a jet-pack and people rappelling down Big Ben. Just equip the most reliable rocket launcher to blow up a jet-pack and watch face and the enemy down. Pure pleasure! <br /> <br /> other levels are very good, but quite short. There are four mini-levels can be unlocked, and is one of the LET downs, because only the first two of them are really fun, and the last two to unlock only "killed 25 enemy targets, I mean, with a" W! We got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> I do not multi-player, I and some of my friends, you see, is very good and interesting, even if there are bots. Halo there were no boots, but it is still some excellent multi-player games! you can be a load of bad guys, and you are going against each other, and you can also set the trap that is the best way of killing people, not going by their nature <br /> <br /> Gameplay -. 8.5 / 10 (levels can be very repetitive and bonus mission could be improved) graphics -. 9/10 (there is an odd bad graphics, but it's not very often) Multiplayer -. 10/10 (needs no comment, just great, you get to drive a jet pack and vehicles) . Sound - 8/10 replay value - 7/10 (only level I go back to this level and Loondon Istanbul Part 1) <br /> <br /> I give this game :. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> It may be a bit of improvement, but it's still good.
