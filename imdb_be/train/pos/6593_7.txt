I watched this movie twice now and think it's pretty good for a limited equipment used to create this film. (Withdrawn 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explained his theory on the migration of the South American Pre-Colubian Indians of the islands of Polynesia BY raft of big trees fallen balm. This documentary tells Dr. Heyerdahl and a crew as they choose balsa wood in Equidor and float them down the river to the Pacific to build in Peru. They jumpings sea adventure on the 101 days of testing on the strength of their primitive raft to survive only with the help available for the natives of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
