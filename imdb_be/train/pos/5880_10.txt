contrary to the person specified above me, I felt that this film was very funny, especially in the scenes there were a lot of confused. I do not want to give the plot and story off to people who have not watched yet, but I will say that Paresh Rawa has a major role, such as the latest Priyadarshan movies, such as Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawa makes strange part in a small role assigned to it, John Abraham does not do equally well, Akshay Kumar has proved that it is no less in this film, as it was from Waqt and almost all his films after Andaaz. Even if all three heroins in this film was the debut they've done a very good job acting especially Nargis, which looks very good and hot. I would say that if you like Hungama or Hera Pheri this film should look.
