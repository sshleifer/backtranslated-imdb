Bush is my live action project undertaken by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.The show was canceled after one season, but not because of bad reviews (he actually received good reviews), but because it was very expensive. that my bush is pretty funny parody of the average network television as a political sitcom.It satire.Now, this is not as good as South Park, but it is very funny sitcom parody, and also very good political satire.The guy who plays that my bush is very similar to it! If you can find the show, check it out.There have a lot of laughs! <br /> <br /> 9/10
