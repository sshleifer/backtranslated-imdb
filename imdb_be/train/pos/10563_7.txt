Wow ... what ... a whirlwind. In the 30s decade with a large number of any type of film I can imagine, especially in the early stages of radios. There were films that painfully static and dull, like "Dracula" with Bela Lugosi, and there were those who just do not give him no rest, sometimes in a good sense, and sometimes not. This is one of the movies, do not stop for a minute, and it is strange, and it is a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed «42nd Street», was the king of musicals Depression era, and it was probably excited by the sound possibilities have brought into the world of cinema, because it fills the picture with him. There should not be a minute or two without music or someone talking. This is absolutely crazy! I thought that the film deserves a 5 (or 6, top), because the pacemaker was very poor, as it was insanely fast, and I just do not know what is happening and what to think. The symbols seemed to just running the place, talking about things not interest me, and probably no one else. I thought that I just want to be rewarded with a small headache. I noticed Lloyd Bacon also cast the female lead in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler and «42nd Street» was the film whose end was the best part of it. And you know what? It happened the same thing with the "Parade" flooded with light rail! The ending is absolutely incredible! It has become, hands down, the most impressive musical I have ever seen. The final part introduces us to some of the musical numbers, and they believe, what makes seeing the rest of the other film is worth. Quantities are flawless! There are three big bits, and most impressive, of course, the second one. Suddenly, the screen was filled with a great and inventive camera work, beautiful people and just entertainment, which made me forget my little headache.
