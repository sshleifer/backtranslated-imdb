I have not read the book by Kurt Vonnegut is adapted, but I am familiar with some of his other works, and it was interesting to see how it will be translated to the screen. Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. We are talking about the history of American life in Germany, which recruited as a spy for the United States. His job is to extract a high ranking Nazi and send secret messages to the American using his weekly radio show. But when the war is over, he is condemned as a war criminal, but runs away to New York, where a variety of odd plot twists await. <br /> <br /> If Mother Darkness is a problem is that it tends to get too sentimental at times. But for most of the movie schmaltz minimized and very strange land through with skill and aplomb. And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right-wing Christian fundamentalist and a very high rank in the Nazi prison cell. Highly recommended.
