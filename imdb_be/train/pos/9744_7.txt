"Yes, Giorgio" is a carefree and enjoyable movie / comedy that contains a beautiful setting and beautiful music. This is not my favorite film, but this film, I liked to see more than once. Some commentators have suggested, when one wants to enjoy Pavarotti, they probably would have been better, picking opera DVD. Although full of opera may be the best representation of the opera talents Pavarotti, often requires opera costumes and has storylines that completely hide the appearance and character of the person. "Yes, Giorgio" allows you to use your voice Pavarotti speaker and show individuality and character in a relationship opera would not be <br /> <br /> Many reviewers seem to find the story unbelievable. I do not agree. Extremely talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from one another often get an idea of ​​themselves and grow in a positive way to communicate with people who keep them or take them in directions that they could not choose their own. Both Giorgio and Pamela have become more open to unexplored parts of ourselves in relationship with others. <br /> <br /> Relax and let yourself go in a visually and aurally useful film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. The ending scene of Turandot by Puccini alone are worth the time to get there.
