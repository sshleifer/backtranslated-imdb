Hidden Frontier has been talked about and reported on several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best stories Star Trek and give an example of unity that was the mission of Gene Roddenberry. Their attention to homosexuality, depression, war, and the adoption of different races on the same level or higher than those of the other series and Trek movies. production value began as little choppy, but for 7 seasons of production improved acting, stories are more complex, and visual graphics got smoother and more impressive. In the season 6 episode 1, countermeasures, there is one of the largest space battles in Trek history. Ships are well rendered and space battles is impressive and exciting. The real draw of Frontier Sun ships or backgrounds, but the people and the growth and interaction of the characters. There is also another series of Trek nodding and movies with places and characters, we all know. I recommend any fan of Trek, to check the countermeasures and you'll be hooked!
