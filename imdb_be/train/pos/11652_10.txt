I stumbled on this film by chance, listing all the movies I wanted to see my sister, while I was on vacation, and I'm so glad to write to me that I have included this one. It deals with the problems that the majority of directors evade, my only problem with this film, it was made for television, so I could not buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> This is a touching story about how people with eating disorders are not necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have to diet buddies. He pointed out to me that, though bulimia can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has a serious impact on their health, that many people do not know.
