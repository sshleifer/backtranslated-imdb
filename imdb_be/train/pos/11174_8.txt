Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King yet. Not surprisingly, as the King himself wrote the screenplay. The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine home. One of the other residents is Judd, a nice old man who knows something about the area. One is the highway that runs right through their frontyard. Another path that leads to the Pet Sematary, where children were buried animals slaughtered highway for decades. Quickly enough, the cat Ellie Creed, the Church, is found dead. Fortunately, this is happening at a time as a family, with the exception of Louis (parents), is away on Thanksgiving Day. Jude takes Louis another cemetery, cemetery for pets, where the Church should be buried. Later, Louis meets (not so politely) Church. He came back, being chewed its way out of the bag he was buried in. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. More can not say anything without destroying the history. <br /> <br /> Of the King, I saw this regulation would be the most terrible. The characters are real and the situation is normal. Mary Lambert does a great job, directing affairs. Spectacular held fairly high throughout the film, partly because of the development of the plot. The scene in which Gage killed will stick in your memory forever. Then, of course, we have a conclusion. It is easy to determine that this will happen, but Lambert pulls out some really scary, and sometimes disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie and a good adaptation. If you like to be scared and do not mind being pursued, some occasionally disturbing images, the "Pet Sematary" just what you are looking for. Non-horror fans will want to avoid this.
