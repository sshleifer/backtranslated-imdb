After watching you have a post office and a sense of frustration, I decided to watch the original film that inspired it, The Shop Around the Corner. I was struck by this film. This is a true gem, and from that moment, one of my favorite movies of all time. Actions so perfect, the story is so beautiful that if you have not seen, I want to encourage you to see it today. I do not mind re-brands, and sometimes I like the new version better than the original, but this time we have to admit that you've got mail is a bad adaptation of this classic. Do not miss it, go to the video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!
