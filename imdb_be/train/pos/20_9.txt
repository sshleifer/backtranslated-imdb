"Stanley and Iris" show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it is a struggle to become literate and to realize their potential. For Iris, is to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance, Robert De Niro and Jane Fonda do together, start and stop, prior to each have the skills and the courage to completely trust each other and move on. In this sense, it is very well gives us a good idea of ​​how life is often so accurate. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the characters, each appears to be consistent for the whole picture. The supporting cast is also carefully chosen, and they add a depth of character that the main characters are the added value of the support characteristics. Overall, a great movie. The best thing that I take him hope.
