characteristic of the North of stuttering, a mild-mannered book Morgan Sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt Scotch whiskeys and under the spell of the presence of Lucy Liu brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch. It offered her a cigarette at the bar an old habit to do without thinking or even ask, and he lost in her face, neck and lips. Regardless of brainwashing, love has a way of persevering. Love, too, can not be "brainwashed in" with one of his two wives false. In gradual stages, he begins to do without glasses, walk and talk differently, and even his face looks different, as the film progresses. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexual and accordingly control at times. Extensive use of black and white and gray tones makes it almost science fiction "film noir" in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would like to see more of a vulnerability in the image of Lucy Liu, whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states, the man she loves, and for which it carries out a mission on the basis of blind faith, some restrained vulnerability and this sympathetic outbreak and concerns would make it less one-dimensional representation of its parts. It just does not come up for Northam talents, but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I will enjoy knowing about other scripts written by the same author.
