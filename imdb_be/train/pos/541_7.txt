as a continuation, it's not bad movie.i actually liked it better than the first one.i found more entertaining.it thought that a documentary was filmed style.at first it bothered me, so I thought it just looked too low budget.but it grew on me, and it made the movie seem more authentic.this film has a dry liners than the original, which is a good thing, thinks they sometimes went to my opinion.i bit over some of the characters.it stage and becomes almost parody of themselves, which can be point.this film at least has Nek oruyu intrigue, which the first one was not, in my view.it have some of the same great music from the original, which was acting great.the again pretty decent for the most part, though, as I said, some of them, it seemed, over top.i also I felt that the film loses a lot of momentum to the end, and there are a few moments that seem to be very slow and just do not seem to flow as well as the rest of the movie.overall, although I thought it was quite a sequel .m in the ranking for "Return to the Cabin on the lake" is 7/10 *
