It would be so much fun to see in the theater, in 1996. There is a guilty pleasure of the corner of my film taste, which really appreciates is really well done movie Shocker. <br /> <br /> «Dentist» panoramic time, probably because people usually have strong feelings more dental issues. Maybe, the ADA launched a campaign against him, as dentists reported that they have to apologize for this film and «The Marathon Man» (which has only one scene, comparable to many in the "Dentist"). <br /> <br /> strange to note that according to the details page of the film was shot in 21 days. Of course, after the production may take longer than shooting movies sometimes for editing "Dentist" is picture perfect. Quick cuts increase tension so strong that in the scene where the dentist "courting" his wife have just two quick cuts, which show what is happening. The rest remains our very imaginative! Burns was a good choice for the role, as it has a lot of experience playing psychologically "excluded" symbols, and it is completely sold obsessive-compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me Shagan film it was just right. The filmmakers show the mischief of his wife in just the right way. All the characters in the dental office look like they are actually the people who work in the real office. There's a lot of tension while they are dealing with impatient people who are waiting for the arrival of the dentist. At the same time the dentist removed on the verge of a huge psychotic break! Unlike many films of this genre, the script is very, very tight. All of the victims fall into the trap of a dentist in a very computational methods. Two types of law enforcement officials even got involved in a small story that ends with the creation of a shocker showdown near the end. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the faint of heart or dental-phobic, but the ride is a real hill and highly recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.
