Entertainment and the main film, Non-Stop drew deserve comparison with the «Run Lola Run». The film has developed rapidly in the chase sequence, during which viewers will learn about the three main characters through retrospection and Daydream sequence. The pursuit is not as rapid development of menopause, but also as a path that is a big part of the film. During the "start", we see the characters grow, and for a moment forget about their grieving life, "macho" role they have bought in and end up forgetting about why they started working in the first place. As well as the fighting to provide "clarity" for the characters in "Fight Club" provides running characters of this film with the help move away from the false values ​​that we allow society to create for us. Their run is a way to really know the life from the point of view cloudless, and all three find some level of clarity and joy in the process. <br /> <br /> My rating and enjoyment only fluctuated slightly in the final film, where instead learn from their experiences, the characters seem to go back to acting out these false masculine role, I thought that they fled their way through . <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the only real problem with this film that he was not available outside of Japan earlier.
