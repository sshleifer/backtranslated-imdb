Clark Gable plays the swindler, the busts in the life of a hard-boiled lady Jean Harlow. He's trying to trick her, while she cleans it with her tight relationship Gal. Despite the cynicism and minuses they fall in love. If Gable accidentally kills a man while he is running a sting, leaving loyal Harlow Women's Prison, where she discovers that she is pregnant. Writing Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers is great for many well-designed and strange characters (including Jewish socialist female inmate and a black female prisoners and her preacher father played with hardly followed the stereotype). Gable and Harlow show your character, adding the actors articulate the nuances and subtleties of their characters that is sent to them beyond the typical Gable and Harlow roles. And the direction is much better than one would expect from Sam Wood. One shot Harlow be put in jail, and then taken out in a surprisingly snowy yard as the camera tracks after it. This is one of the top two "criminals in love" and "Women's Prison" genre and has some of the best hard-boiled dialogue ever written.
