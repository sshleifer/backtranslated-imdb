All have bills to pay, including Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discover that the war was over, and goes back home, when they noticed a bunch of prisoners, including the Christopher Walken. After Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and short shrift later. Walken and some Colombian guy to share a bill promising something or other. <br /> <br /> Cut to the present time (1991), and a Colombian man leads a revolution against El Presidente. He was successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush the people with the tank, he was forced to give up and shot in the head in the air. This is shown in full gory detail as the news flash on American telly, resulting Walken collect old team (even if it was not part of this team, to start with), in order to break into Colombia and the gun thousand. <br /> <br /> McBain is a monumentally stupid movie, but for all that it is also a good laugh, and action, too. This is one of those movies where the logic is given a wide berth - how else can you shoot Walken as a fighter pilot in the head with the other plane, without suffering from decompression, or even broken a window? In addition, it seems that these guys can gun down dozens of drug dealers in New York, without bothering the police. <br /> <br /> There are many B-movie madness chew here, from the diabolical actions of Michael Ironside in Vietnam sequence heroic, but utterly senseless death of one of the characters on the side of the splitting of confrontation between Walken and El presidente, and let's not forget a fiery speech sister of the rebel leader, who watched on television in America (almost brown eyes tear my pitch, that bit). <br /> <br /> It's there for the pound sterling. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you may find the set, too.
