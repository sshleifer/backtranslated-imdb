Scots excel in history. The traditional variety. Many years after this event, I can still see in my mind an old lady, my friend's mother, a retelling of the Battle of Culloden. It makes the characters come alive. Her passion is that witness. One to the events on the soaked heather mile or so from where she lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was many years before she was born, but you would not guess how she says it. The same story is told in the bars the length and breadth of Scotland. As I have discussed this with one one night in Mallaig, cutaway to give his version. Discussion continued closing time. <br /> <br /> Stories are passed as it was part of our beings. Who does not remember the stories our parents told us when we were kids? They become invisible to our world. And, as we grow older, they may still serve as inspiration or as an emotional tank. Fact and fiction are combined with models of commitment, role. Warning history. Archetypes. Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> Â«My name is Aonghas, my grandfather and his grandfather before him." Our hero presents itself to us. As well as introducing the history, which extends back through the generations. It produces stories within stories. Stories that are surprising impenetrable Scotland, its rugged mountains shrouded in mist. Material legends. But Seach'd rooted in reality. This is what gives it a special charm. It has a rough beauty and authenticity, tempered with some of the best Gaelic song you'll ever hear. <br /> <br /> Aonghas (Angus) visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death. It burns with frustration. Part of it yearns to be in the twenty-first century, to hang out in Glasgow. But it rises on the western shores of Gaelic among Russian-speaking community. <br /> <br /> However, there is a deeper conflict within him. He wants to know the truth. The truth of ancient stories of his grandfather. Where fiction ends? And he wants to know the truth about the death of their parents. <br /> <br /> He pulled out to make one last fateful trip to the top of one of the most inaccessible mountains of Scotland. Maybe this is true? Or is it all in the story? <br /> <br /> The story about history, we again bloody battles, poisoned lovers, folklore, old and sometimes more crafty folk to accept the truth. At the same time, each of us connect to Angus, the story of how he lives his own life <br /> <br /> Seachd :. unavailable Pinnacle, probably the most honest, unpretentious and truly beautiful film of Scotland ever made. As Angus, I am a bit annoyed with the pretext to hang stories more stories. But, like Angus, I'm just this time I saw the "big picture." Forget about cash styling Braveheart and its like. You can even give up the fairly well-known staging wicker man. In order to see the film, which is true in Scotland, this one is probably unique. If you might meditate on it deep enough, you can even re-evaluate the strength of the narrator, and the age-old question of whether there are some truths that can not speak, but only experienced.
