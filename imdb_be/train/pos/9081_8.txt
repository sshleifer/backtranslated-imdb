If you like Sci-Fi, Monster and ancient legends, then you will love this film !! <br /> <br /> The special effects are by far the best that I've seen with Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the action may have been a little less than we would like, the storyline and the effects of adequate compensation for it. <br /> <br /> I wish now I had seen it in a movie theater on the screen instead of our 42-inch large-screen TV. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, bizarre visual effects and taste of myth and knowledge .... you have to see this movie !!
