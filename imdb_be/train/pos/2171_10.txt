A true classic, ten out of ten! Each actor is a perfect scenario is obsessive-sequence voltage stage. The scene in the car and the scene in the mountains is breathtaking. Interestingly, this film has been released in DVD, because it should be viewed in the widescreen version. Seen this movie in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and have never since forgotten it.I remember that it was one of the first to the Warner, as cinemas control functions, a process called Warnerscope, who gave a very neat cinematography . Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserves an Oscar for performances.The only thing I would criticize is not being directed by someone like, say, Nicholas Ray, to increase my rhythm and stress.
