If a hard turn to the pneumonic plague (bubonic plague option), the US Public Health Service official Dr. Clinton Reed (Widmark) immediately isolates everyone he knows that it was next to the body. Unfortunately, the tough got thus being killed, and there is a good chance that the killer begins to spread of the plague, which led to an epidemic. Enter the police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who enlisted to find the killer as soon as possible and to prevent a possible national catastrophe. <br /> <br /> While the panic on the streets is the quality of the film, it suffers from being a little bit too scattered and sprawling (have reason bringing the score to eight). He travels the genre of gangster noirish medical accident, police procedural thriller and even romantic. <br /> <br /> This is not the director Elia Kazan a better job, but says that it is a bit disingenuous. Kazan is responsible Helmer masterpieces such as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), on the waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), in the end. This film before, but Kazan said that he was "untethered" from the studio. Taking that freedom too far may partly explain sprawl. The film is in New Orleans, the city where Kazan "is used to wander ... Day and night, so I knew that it was good." He wanted to use the environment. "It's so amazing and colorful, I like boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints -. All of New Orleans »<br /> <br /> Kazan handles every genre Panic on the streets, but they may be related. better. The film would have won, remaining with only one or two of his moods. Sprawl in the installation plan would still work. Part of the dilemma may be due to the fact that the panic on the streets was an attempt to combine the two story writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and «Some Like« Em Cold ». <br /> <br /> Gangster material that ends up firmly in the territory of a thriller with an extended chase scene near the end of the film is likely to be a highlight. Not surprisingly, that Kazan has stated that he believes that the thieves "more colorful - I've never had a great devotion to the good guys do not care I do not like the Puritans.". Close second is the only material that comes close to "panic" title - the discovery of the plague, and attempts to find a naked, planted them and keep the disease. While there is a lot of uncertainty for these two "moods", a large part of the film is also quite simply a drama, a pace more typical of this genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue around the beautiful. The stylistic contrast to many of today's films can hardly be more pronounced. She is intelligent, shipped fast and well-formulated each character. The conflict does not create a "foolish" decision, but smart moves; events and actions of the characters is more like a game of chess. If unusual Stances are taken, such as Reed failure plague of the newspapers, he gives a relatively lengthy justification of their decisions, which other characters are arguing. <br /> <br /> In this light, it is interesting that Kazan believed that "decency, religion, ethics, and the middle class is killing us." This idea works its way into the film through changes in the rules or benefit from it, made the protagonist. For example, the head of the black gangster (Jack Palance in his first film role) proposed a "get out of jail Free» card if he would cooperate with the fight against the plague. <br /> <br /> technical aspects of the film is good, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons are watching the performance, intriguing script, and well-written dialogue.
