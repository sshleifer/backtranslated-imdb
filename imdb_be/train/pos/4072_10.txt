Hayao Miyazaki's name became visible with Spitied Away, however, that is often overlooked early efforts directed film. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel and directed by George Lucas THX 1138? I remember fragments of the film - almost certainly the last 45 minutes at the end of the 80s, and that stuck with me was the visual splendor of the design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well known store for Â£ 9 I could not resist but to buy it. What is surprising is that the last 45 minutes of the film does not tally with my memory of it (the memory's funny that way). <br /> <br /> View this movie now all this knowledge portfolios of artists like very similar to Jean "Moebius" Giraud some of the artwork. I can only assume some influence here <br /> <br /> If a slot catch the falling girl (Sita) his adventure really begins -. The search for Laputa - a reference to miss part of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels with. When healthy references to Jules Verne is a basic good vs. bad chase movie with a final portion having the characters end up in Laputa <br /> <br /> This is the part that is the most powerful in my memory. - "Pastorale" environmental aspect Laputa returned to nature - to the set of robots, covered with moss under a giant tree. This, in my opinion, the highlight of the film - the surface of the opinion Laputa, unlike mechanized underground <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this split of the film -. To show that even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot, which aims to garden and animal. The ending of the film Silent Running almost exactly the same <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly stylish, I would not say, "spot". - very beautiful and organic and a lot of detail in buildings, airships and design and look of just about everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is the real master of this kind of Japnanese anima. Buy this film and appreciate it.
