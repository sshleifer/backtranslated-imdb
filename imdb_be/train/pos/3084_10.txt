About the people, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about this so-called theory that we are all connected by someone. If you focus on the lives of a group of people, and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this show, it did not attract my attention at all. It seemed too ordinary, actually. Then I saw a few episodes ... and loved it! First of all, characters. All of them are well-written and differ from each other. There is alcohol addicts, a woman whose fianc√©e read on it, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on ... In contrast to what we are accustomed to, most of the characters interact with each other in damages, as well as in our daily routine. Excellent! My favorite is May, Carlos and Witney. <br /> <br /> Then, cast. They're all fine. Jay Hernandez, from "Hostel", here shows his acting habilities in a 3d character than his previous work as a Paxton. Others of them give great performances and specially Campbell Scott, who plays Stephen and Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> Well, when I came to the IMDb, after watching some of the episodes, I could not believe that it was canceled. Seriously, I can not understand the low ratings. <br /> <br /> It's too bad it's not more than one season. It will be a really good show to follow!
