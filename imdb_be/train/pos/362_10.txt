In 1985 (my birth year) Steven Spielberg directed emotionally powerful and unforgettable story of a young African American girl Celie (debut role for Whoopi Goldberg), whose life passes through tough times. The story begins in 1909, when only 14 years old Celia. She gave birth to two children, for her father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie, with which it is inseparable. Widow lays eyes on a net, but their father gives him Celie. This is the beginning of the era of horrible abuse and constant controlling. Women are worse than men, and especially being African-American women, their rights is less than zero. History Celie is a true survival story. <br /> <br /> «The Color Purple» is a master piece and underestimated the Spielberg film. He should do more dramas that «The Color Purple» and "Schindler's List" good concept. <br /> <br /> Cast strange. Whoopi Goldberg is known better as ravingly funny comedy, but presenting role as Celie beautiful word that it can actually lead to serious drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly reverse "Mister." I've never seen him in such an evil role. Talk show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed Sofia. <br /> <br /> Warning Prepare to have a number of tissues with you while watching this film. You can really connect to the story of a strong sisterhood. Especially if you have as close a relationship with the brothers and sisters, as I am with my sister. <br /> <br /> Large applauds Mr. Spielberg!
