In the aftermath of Watergate, a number of conspiracy films appeared, such as this, written by the late Adam Kennedy (based on his novel). <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays a former Vietnam veteran, "Roy Tucker" loser who went to prison. It visits Marvin Tagge (Widmark), which claims that is an entity adapted to assist erroneously convicted. They offer him his freedom, and, in spite of the trusting Tagge it takes. But it brings with it the related cell fellow named Spiventa (Mickey Rooney). That is why it is difficult to see, as Spiventa this annoying little man who leads Tucker wisely constant conversations about sex, and not what you want to hear when you're in jail. <br /> <br /> benefactors Tagge kill Spiventa before Tucker surprised eyes. Reunion with his wife Eli (Candice Bergen), and given a new identity (Oddly enough, he does not try to change his appearance shave that mustache cheese would start.), He calms down, but there is a catch - Tagge do not want to Tucker less than to kill the president of the United States. He refuses, so Tagge Ellie has stolen ... <br /> <br /> I'll leave the synopsis here, but I'm sure you can guess the rest for yourself. The script has enough plot holes to make you want to read a book (a neat trick that!). Tagge people is never found. Mention of the murder J.F.K. They are unmistakable. Despite the findings of the Warren Commission, doubts about whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone persists to this day. <br /> <br /> It was the first film by Stanley Kramer in years, and while not a turkey, it lacks grip say Frankenheimer «The Manchurian Candidate" or Alan J.Pakula «The Parallax View». Being left plot of the film, he has a tendency to skirt around its subject rather than get to grips with it. I prefer the right ones, themselves - they are funny! «Domino» has the look and feel made for T.V. cinema, and has what must be the easiest jailbreak in the history of cinema, not to mention ending spiky by Michael Caine classic «Get Carter». <br /> <br /> What makes it watchable are Gene Hackman and Widmark. The latter, unfortunately, died earlier this year, as beautiful as mysterious Tagge, which initially appears to be behind the operation until he, too, will be ruthlessly eliminated from Death chain designed to remove all traces of evidence, as one by one the perpetrators of this evil conspiracy fall - just like dominoes. As Tucker, an innocent pawn Hekmno amazing. You have to wonder, though, why he decided to hide in such an obvious place. In his place, I would run to the other side of the world, anywhere to get away from these fanatics. Hackman love scenes from Bergen to slow down the plot, and it is almost a relief when it gets pulled. Presumably the producers thought so too, which explains why it opens with the installation of a bizarre prologue to the entire premise of the film - is voiced by British actor Patrick Allen - warns viewers that "they" out there, and that "they" to get to us. Comedian Les Dawson later forge this discovery in his B.B.C. show «The Dawson Watch». <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney previously worked with Kramer on "His mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world." His "death" scene is reminiscent of how Outtake from this picture, the actor, looking as if he had been bitten by a wasp, not a shot. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy movies used to be made only on the left, but now gets right in on the act too. In the last year, was "Liberty," an absurd fabrication of lies and half-truths about the government of Tony Blair, to be the UK response to the "reefer madness." At least, «Domino» Candice Bergen was beautiful. Best Film Chris Atkins may offer Anne Widdecombe has been! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the "domino principle" has been made by Sir Leigh Grady, the legendary British television magnate behind "The Saint", "Jesus of Nazareth" and 'The Muppet Show'. He again worked with Adam Kennedy in 1980 on «Raise The Titanic», whose failure was so great that sank Grade ambitions in being a new Louis B.Meyer. Being somewhat open, I would not rule out the possibility of conspiracy.
