Maybe I've seen an episode or two, when the show originally aired, but when I watched one episode on Netflix, I was hooked. I watched the whole series in 2 days. :) I really liked the character of Gary Cole. Firstly, it is thoroughly reprehensible then you start loving character ( "These things have thousands of applications")! His folksy Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson meets great Satan. Charming, charismatic, suave, and uh kind of dangerous and "look" I mean "really". I want to be like him when I grow up. Lucas Black is too large. Accents are too large. Anyway, I thought it was one of the best TV shows ever, and you owe it to yourself to see it.
