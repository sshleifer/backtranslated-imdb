What class a little British film! It's about time. And the splitting comedy side to boot! <br /> <br /> Anyone searching to relive a bit of freedom from their misspent youth this way the film will prove a ticket. <br /> <br /> It's a mixture between «Withnail and I" and «Easy Rider». The film works hard pace and does not allow to drift too long ... Sometimes there are reflective moments, but I think they are well founded and add to the character actors drawing. I was a little concerned with Phil Daniels character in the beginning, but, fortunately, was won over half way to the end in what was one of the funniest scenes of the film! In fact, I found myself belly laughing through the film is likely to annoy some people around me. Oh well. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. This will be the cult British comedy. Well worth a visit.
