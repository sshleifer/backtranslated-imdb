Not for people without a quick mind and without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you do not have any of them, you can not understand. And if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think Picasso car name derived from Citroen, perhaps, when you see a Picasso you'll just walk on it, thinking it was trash-work of a street artist. :) So do not judge before you try to understand :) In the end, I think it is a must for everyone with open minds. However, my N1 remains Shawshank Redemption! And remember that not all things can be placed in the frame. Because there are things in this world that every frame is simply not appropriate.
