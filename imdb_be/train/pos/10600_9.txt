This is a very funny comedy about the community of Ealing in central London, which, thanks to an unusual combination of circumstances, finds that they are not in English, but the extension of the French province of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> Features film comedian Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady), as well as many other classic comedians period. <br /> <br /> stories, apparently based on the news item at a time when the Government of Canada "officially" were given a room at the hotel for visiting the European royal family member. The idea actually reminded me of a real life when the province of Hutt River in Western Australia, where the landowner "separated" from the Australian government for the dispute wool quota. . (He had never been recognized in Western Australia or the Australian Government) <br /> <br /> This is a great script that plays with great political and economic issues, as well as the TV show "Yes Minister"; as well as a great little eccentric part of the character, as well.
