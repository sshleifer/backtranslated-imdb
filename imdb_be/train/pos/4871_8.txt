It takes a Serb or, at least, the Balkan love, to understand and to use many of the situations, characters and jokes many other «Zavet» films, as well as Kusturica. See, for example, the initial stage, with remote villages in the Serbian mountain, with a low-tech devices which protect the integrity and life of residents, nostalgia for the good times of communist rule, and the awakening of a young brother, watching his naked teacher at the Soviet anthem. Kusturica is not just trying to get away from the tragic history of Serbia, described in his previous films, but also creates a world of themselves in the process. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film or not an explicit political film every occasion. This is an interesting film, first and foremost. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. Music plays an active role in this film, as well as in all his films. His style is direct and grotesque, we are now, what he thought of his heroes, and we know that he wants us to feel the same. The space he develops floated true, stories and magic, and the colors seem to Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie. The main drawback is the length of some editing and cut would be useful, since at some point the director seems to have run out of ideas, and replays show. This is another of the catching, funny, moving films I've seen lately.
