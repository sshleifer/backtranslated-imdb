This second film is as interesting as the previous one, except that there is no voltage. We know that he is going to do, and what will happen before he even hinted at on the screen. Then the only satisfaction comes from being different stunts and sequences occur. We know that there will be dynamite in the car, he lost a wheel, the car will have an accident, just talking about the car. And this is what happens. Now details and information are for you to discover them in the film. The fact that it can be a lure with the help of some stupid women is obvious and to come, but we know that he had seen through it, and he knows that drag into the trap. Now, he's going to get out of it? This is what you have to find yourself. And do not worry, he will receive the grand merchant men, but as it is a different story. Boat speed can not be compared with our busy beaver on a river. We also know when it will hit. They did not know that the vests were in those days. It's true, it has recently been discovered that some of the soldiers do not have this kind of equipment in Iraq. But what's the point of this movie? This insistence on the hunt for traffickers and it is blindness, he did not see that the ban, which is a problem. But the film is constant and perfect illustration of the fact that no matter what so ever that may stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these products so that they can be properly implemented and supervised? If something is not illegal or forced out in the way it is less fun to use them to make them. It is prohibited or restricted, that is attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Universit√© Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and the University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
