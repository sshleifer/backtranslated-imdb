Miracle. One of the best musicals of all time. Three of Busby Berkeley, which ends the film spectacular, but what makes this film so wonderful is incredible Nonae-stop patter and natural acting with Cagney and Blondel. (Keeler is also fine, even if it can not be a great actress). There's a freshness in the movie that you do not see in movies today, much less in the 30's films usually unnatural, even if the plot, providing for the establishment of input, rather outdated films.
