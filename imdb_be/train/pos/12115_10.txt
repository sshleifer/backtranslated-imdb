Another comment about this film did it sound lousy. Given that say the paintings were so new - I think that the script and the acting was good. Davis was so young and fresh. She has not yet found his own style, which we have grown to wait. Nevertheless, it's great to see her this way. - is still learning the craft <br /> <br /> So many clich√©s come out of this movie, and it seems like this movie blazed a few trails for the next 70 years. My vote is to see and remember, as a young, this was the type of film. Keep and open mind, and you may be shocked as thoughtful characters were in this film, because in 1934, and, as we see the early part of the last century, as a worried .. I love it and hope that you make up your own mind about it does not affect other negative and one for comments.
