This is a very well-made film. Action script and cameras are all top-notch. The music is good, too, although it is mainly at the beginning of the film, when still relatively brisk. There really is no superstars in the cast, although a few people are familiar with. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script. <br /> <br /> But it's hard to watch because there is no good end in a situation similar to the one shown. It is fashionable to blame the British for the establishment of Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then ruthlessly dividing them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it is also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region, tortured each other, as they did during the time of separation. It seems more likely that the British had just seen tensions between religions and were smart enough to use them for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> As a result of the fact that there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity of the situation, and it is very unpleasant to remember, and to see on the screen. But he never painted in black-and-white case. There is meanness and generosity on both sides, as well as hope for the younger generation change. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of redemption in the end, if Puro must make a difficult choice between a man who ruined her life, but truly loved her, and her family, who refused it, and then come to her. But until it does not have an option that without severe pain for her. <br /> <br /> This film carries a message about how Muslims and Hindus have their serious shortcomings, and that both can be decent and caring people, under Reality makes this implementation all the more painful as can never be a real reconciliation through the India / Pakistan border. In this sense, it is similar to «Mr & Mrs Iyer». <br /> <br /> In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, although the resolution was heartbreaking. If the United Kingdom and the United States can deal with their own stories of racism with such frankness, they would, of course, better.
