This film, and is a continuation of Barry McKenzie holds its own, are two of the greatest comedies ever produced. The big story of a young Australian guy goes to England to claim his inheritance, and meets up with his friends who are just as loveable and innocent as he is. <br /> <br /> It is chock a block full of great, sayings, where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that it is so dry as a dead dingo Donger? great characters, top action, and he has a great Sheilas and more consumption then brings up any other three films combined. TOP expression. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you will ever hear, and it is full of great celebrities. Defined by two of my favorite films of all time, I look at them at least once in two weeks.
