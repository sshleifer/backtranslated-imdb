William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) dwarfs like The Grim Reaper <br /> <br /> DVD has a nice anamorphic widescreen. (1.85: 1) transfer and fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the theatrical trailer and fun for the short film scene. It was the continuation of Box Office hits, like the original, but it is also (believe it or not), one of the best sequels ever (depending on your point of view). George Carlin reprises his role from the original brief. Grier also appears in the role of bits. This is a nice fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
