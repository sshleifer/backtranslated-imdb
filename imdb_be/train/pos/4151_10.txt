Service time prisoner goes forward to give information to a single Co Ca about the murder of police committed several years ago. Murder of Sean Cooper, a good cop, was never solved. Naturally, the investigators believe that the new data will help them collect all the pieces of the puzzle, which disrupted their colleague. <br /> <br /> In retrospect we made to child baptism James Bruno. Sean and Jimmy were partners. There is tension, Sean, who is the godfather, disheveled and comes too late for the ceremony. Eileen Bruno does not appear to be happy to be there. The real mystery is revealed it. She caught Shawn, who was drinking with Jimmy in the yard, kissing her husband, and more shocking still, Jimmy answering willingly. <br /> <br /> Once at the station Partners become the center of gossip. Sean has not endeared himself to his boss, because he found the attitude of the offender in his field, who controlled the drug trade. Shawn realizes that this man is in a drug-strong man, because he always makes an excuse to make the scum bags Sean and Jimmy tow to the station all the time. Too much pressure on Jimmy. Sean comfortable in his homosexuality and wanted to be honest about it. Cooper's father nothing to do with the eccentric son does not want to. Even his boss wants him McCree of jurisdiction, but the matter is complicated by the fact that Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men who served in the police force. Sean was killed because of his homosexual condition, and knowing too much on the part of their peers in making dirty money. <br /> <br /> Tom Petit wrote this a fair representation of the life of a police officer in the cabinet and his secret love with another fellow cop. We thought that it was a sincere story about a serious issue no one spoke in those days. Sometimes people who are involved in the show, for fear of retaliation by the sponsors or networks do not dare to imagine the real situation. Jeanne Schwartz, shows significant approach to this complex issue, which seems to be without sensational case could have been shown with another team. <br /> <br /> There is a rare kind of Chad Everett as senior Jimmy Bruno. It is taken straight to the goal with a touch of sentimentality that does not get out of hand. Shane Johnson makes an outstanding contribution to the show, Sean Cooper. The cast is amazing and includes a good all around performance from all under the leadership of g-Szwarc in. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Nick Vera, is getting closer to its neighbor, the mother of a basketball player detective took his ball away. Nick rolls affair with a woman!
