At first I was weirded out that the protagonist of the TV show could return the dead to life, but then I thought I'd give it a shot. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisy" and is looking forward to Wednesday night just to watch it, and then within the next week I watch it a few more times on my DVR. Colorful characters, witty banter, dialogue is developing rapidly, and new unique situations attract me and delight from start to finish. Relationship Ned and Chuck Charles interesting to see how they operate their romance around the fact that they can not have physical contact. Even the character of detective Emerson Cod continues to grow in complexity. And Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! It cracks me up! the narrator's voice and listen to interesting cinema gives me the feeling that I was watching a movie instead of a TV show. I recommend my family and friends to turn «Pushing Daisies», and they are accustomed too !!! The show is well worth the wait for a week for a new episode, and if you have not seen «P.D.», I highly recommend watching it!
