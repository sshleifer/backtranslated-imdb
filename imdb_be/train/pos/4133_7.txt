Incredibly small English film for many reasons. Firstly, it is rare to watch Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. Despite the fact that his performance is not up to standard, it will be the last set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, it is completely plausible as to deceive the barrister. Historically, this film is of great interest because of both when and where it was to shoot. Being English he did not have a big budget Hollywood films of the same era, and it often shows, but more interesting is the fact that this film was made shortly before the war and England shows that will soon disappear. As we see today, we believe that from the standpoint of contemporary morality and view of the fact that this movie and its nearest American counter part `It Happened One Night" was in his time as risky as `Fatal Instinct" was in our time. but after seeing and enjoy this film for the first time, I can not help but feel sad when I look at it today. With half of the film shoot before 1950 had gone, keeping the rest of the films is a difficult choice, and, Unfortunately films like this often transmitted through stored movies, which we consider important. Color sweep of, contrast, absence, and generally poor print quality is most frequently seen heartbreaking. This film, along with `It Happened One NightÂ» ideal for curl up with a love for one under a blanket on a cool chill and watch, or better yet, why not double feature .
