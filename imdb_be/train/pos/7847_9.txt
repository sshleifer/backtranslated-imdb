Believe it or not, for 12 minutes, this film (for 1912) is a full-length film. Very, very few films have been longer, then, but it's definitely not what sets this amazing little film apart from the rest! No, that's different, that all the actors (except one frog) are errors ... so a mistake! This simple little domestic comedy would look the same as in the title role of setting up such Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, or Max Linder, but instead Russia production uses error (or, I think, a model that looked just like an error). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were not yet open and I believe that Linder was busy, so maybe that's why they used the mistakes! Using stop-motion, the error moved and danced and fought surprisingly well - and a heck of a lot more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Mr. Zhuk sneaks off to have a good time. He goes to the offensive club, and his wife allegedly waiting at home. Unfortunately for r Beetle, it is caught on camera film local naked. In addition, he does not know, but Mrs. Beetle also leads to the horse with the bohemian artist. Of course there is much more to this domestic comedy than this, but the plot is old and very interesting for adults and children alike. <br /> <br /> It's amazing, but also very strange and watchable.
