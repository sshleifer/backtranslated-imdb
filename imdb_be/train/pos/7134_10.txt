John Thaw is an excellent actor. I must admit that I was impressed by its range as a crusty old curmudgeon, who reluctantly agrees to take in evacuees from the streets of London (the era of the Second World War). <br /> <br /> That being said, the film is too great. Very touching story with a pleasant finish. Some of the characters a little underdeveloped (a school teacher, in particular), but none of them are essential to the plot. Basically, the story of the old and the boy, and the film should be a little different.
