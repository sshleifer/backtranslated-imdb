Punch at a time, but is now better classified as Australian cult film. Humor broad, unsubtle, and in the final scene, where the studio BBC fire extinguished urinates on it, oil. It contains almost all the clichés of Australian traditional pilgrimage to the "old country", and each of those clichés, predatory, paused, whinging, the British Tories. It would be acceptable to the British because of its strong cast well-known actors, and to Australians of this generation that can "get" the humor. Americans - forget it. Language and jokes in the Australian dialect of the English language, and as such will not understand.
