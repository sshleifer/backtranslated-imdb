It boiled Warner Brothers movie starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck. Finished master drawing Machiavelli cool, tech, she perfected eleven years later, Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity", Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, daughter of a well-worn strong liquor owner suffocating steel city. She was given the cynical and numb the year to be born in a sexual favor for the clients of her father. After her father dies in the distillery explosion, she hops a freight train to New York and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder banks. <br /> <br /> This is a ridiculous impression, if no flaming Stanwyck at work here. With its dead-eyed stare and immoral methods of seduction, it is easy to understand why people become addicted to its aggressive lust. One of the young men she seduces the path is the new face of John Wayne as all things, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. Horror gets oppressive to the last third of the film with a murder-suicide, secrecy work in Paris to keep Lily quietly and new president of the bank, who is so addicted to Lily that he assigns the funds of the company, to keep her in luxury. Tack-made somewhat disappointing, but not before whispering Stanwyck screen. The film has an interesting touches like Lily ties of friendship with the African-American woman named Chico and a German immigrant who teaches Lily of Nietzsche's philosophy of the need to avoid sentimentality.
