I personally thought the film was very good, very good acting by Tadanobu Asano with Ichi glory killer. I really can not tell the story, but there were parts that confused me a little too much, and in general, I thought that the film was too long. Beyond that, however, the film contained a great cast and a great fight many places was beautifully shot, great effects, and a lot of the game ball. Another solid effort Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well, I just can not say more about the movie, but if you just look at the Asian Film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers, I would suggest you try to remove it, but if you are die- hard fan Asian cinema I would say it should be a very good Japanese film in your collection.
