This is one of the most unusual cases in which the film and the novel on which it is based are both large. Maybe it's because Gorris' takes the original idea of ​​Nabokov and gives them a different interpretation. The end result is a point of view on the puddle, which elevates him more than one. <br /> <br /> The only thing to Nabokov, the film, which I do not like this effect on the fate of Valentine's Puddle. I can not imagine Nabokov made man like Valentine and gives him such a great influence on the novel argument.
