I absolutely loved this soap. It was one of my favorites. I would really recommend :) ... I just like the Brazilian soap, they are dealing with real life events. I'm really sad that the soap ran out, but I'm sure I can find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please view it. I loved the characters, the story and how it worked out in the end, for the villains. The only thing I would have changed the end for Xica and her long love life. I can not wait to see it again and highly recommend it. Xica was far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget about everything else :) GO Xica .. Hope you all like it as well.
