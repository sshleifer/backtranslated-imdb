Planning episodes were a bit sad, but when they reached the desert it was quite amusing to watch. The reason why I call this the most realistic reality show, because, to my surprise, Charlie dropped out of the race relatively early. When his hands hurt, I was expecting a normal stress, and then a miracle remedy, but instead it is actually out of the race. The most disturbing moments of the show, must have been when Max got stuck in the desert with almost no food and water! The ending was great and I was very glad to see at least one of the team to do it. On the whole, not as great as the Long Way Round, but it is certainly interesting times when one gets a glimpse into the most difficult race in the world.
