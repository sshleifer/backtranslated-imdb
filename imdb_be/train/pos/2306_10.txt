I never heard of a man on the moon, yet to see his last night on this HDTV channel. Look, my taste, like any other, eclectic. My favorite escape from Blue Velvet Dr. Streynzhlav Ghost and Mrs. Muir via the Wizard of Oz and The Loved One, Eraserhead, repo man, and Spy Within. <br /> <br /> Man on the Moon perfectly done, tender heart, joyful and tragic film, beautifully shot, in which the actors are really living in the moment, rather than act. This sweet fairy tale will soon be in our private library. This is a beautiful story about life in a much more subtle era in rural Louisiana literally takes you into its pastoral setting. <br /> <br /> It's hard to remain stoic in the last moments of the film, especially if the young girl the extent of its older sister's heart burning pain and a private forgives all. <br /> <br /> Rather than spoil the fun or to bore you with my weeping boring prose, will end today with this suggestion from someone who loves movies that speak from the heart to ours. <br /> <br /> If you have not purchased any other movie, please purchase the Man in the Moon. This touching story is one you will enjoy again and again experiencing. It is a joy and a gem, the film is too small in this world, the heart hardened. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues manifested in a man on the moon has a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> 5 April 2009
