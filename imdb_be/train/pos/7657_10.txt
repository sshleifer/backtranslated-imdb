It is very dark, hard hitting, even tough film about the death of a line break, which goes awry. This black-and-white photograph keeps it from seen. Mickey Rooney is excellent as twisted, but surprisingly nice lead. One of the first films to portray the psychological devastation of suicide. It is also quite serious.
