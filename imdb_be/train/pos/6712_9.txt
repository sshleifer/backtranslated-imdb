I love Sabrina! Its one of my Fave shows !! My favorite episodes; one where it turns to Libby freak out the first episode, this episode of love and most of the rest of the first series. I think the college scenes were not as good as high school, but the ones that they were better than in the last episode, which was terrible. Valerie was a good character, because it was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some sparkling episodes. Hilda and Zelda were strange, and it seemed there was no explanation of where they went! Libby was a good character, too. I never liked Morgan or the Roxy, they just were not as good as her friends.
