Despite the fact that it is not without its flaws, this drama was a fitting one will be shown during Easter. It reminded us of our spiritual self, and showed that for our facade, we often hide deep suffering and distress. There was so much to enjoy in the drama, not least rapping teenagers, provide the best musical accompaniment to the drama than a poor sound score in the background. The acting was great and Timothy Spall was once again superb. The culmination was very nice, if simplistic. Timothy Spall in the "release" the suicide of his long-dead wife was fine i mirror a good sense of despair that were present in teenage girls who are themselves damaged. Resolution between graffiti and Muslim boy was nice, but less plausible. Great drama that left me and my husband cutting down that evening were spent. Congratulations!
