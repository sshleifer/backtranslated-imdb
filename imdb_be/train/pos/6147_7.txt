Well, this film is about Bedknobs and Broomsticks, is one of the most amazing, wonderful movies you'll ever see, as a child. It is an unforgettable film about two adults and two children on a stick adventure for pleasure. It may be a bit controversial, to look at, but try it, I'm not my mother I do not think it's bad, I was very enthusiastic with the film and animation, they were all very good. <br /> <br /> it is perfectly wonderful comedy for the whole family to enjoy; even children. Age 7 years, and to enjoy this beautiful, musical comedy with you and your family especially animation. Movement animations and layouts are really good and deserve a big thumbs up. It's awful good musical for the whole family, so what are you waiting? Go to the video store and rent a knob and a broom NOW.
