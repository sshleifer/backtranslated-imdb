It's just the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Bad game, bad script, bad decor, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughter. <br /> <br /> So it's not going to win an Oscar, but if you 've got a beer and friends round, you can not go wrong.
