After becoming completely dependent on Six Feet Under, I do not think it will ever be another show that would come close to as good as the show. Well, I was wrong! Loss mesmerizing !! I love this show and I can not turn it off. The abundance of characters, tangled plot, excellent all countries. I fully hooked. I do not know, as the creators do it, but each character really hurts me. I feel their joy, their pain, all the way down to my core !!! I do not have cable, so I rented a series on Netflix. When I put it on me to watch all the episodes at once and miss when it ends. I can not wait for the next disc to come to my house. This is probably the best TV shows I've never seen !!!
