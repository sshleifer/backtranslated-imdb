My husband and I enjoy DoodleBops as much as our 8-month-old baby is doing. We bought his DVD, and CD just so we can watch and listen to them yourself. They are fun, energetic and very interesting. They encourage children to actively share and care. They always have a positive message, along with fun entertainment. Every time our son hears a song, he quickly turns his head toward the television and starts bouncing up and down in excitement. And is a great singer, she has a beautiful voice. She is a great dancer. I would recommend DoodleBops for those with children. Our favorite song of The Bird Song. You just can not help but smile and feel like dancing when you hear it.
