I love this movie, I saw it again last week after 3 years or so. This film is perfect, great acting, great story, great directing / work / music camera. It is a gift to show it to someone you love. too bad van Dormal, Jacques did not make more films after that. Top 5 job. Really !! <br /> <br /> Today, it is 3 years and 3 days, the comment above. He never answered, because it was no more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw 'l Huitieme Jour »again yesterday. This is without a doubt in my top 3. The film, along with «Cinema Paradiso», which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also very good. I'm really curious about the new film "Jacques von dormael in." I hope that he will complete his film top 3. If you see the movie, rent it. Or even better. buy it. Because you'll want to see it again.
