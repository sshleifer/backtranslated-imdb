This is a very interesting film, given the budget and its length. The storyline is hardly ever touched on in the world of cinema, because it brought a sense of novelty. The acting was great (P'z to the Dom) and cinematography was also very well done. I recommend this movie to anyone in the thriller, he will not disappoint you!
