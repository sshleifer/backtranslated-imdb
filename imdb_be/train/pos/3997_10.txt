That touching film. I have a close friend who is in her sixties, and over the past 15 years, told me that people do not see her anymore, and she longs for communion. Being in my late 40s, I begin to see that she was complaining. You are no longer young, beautiful or felt. When May said: "... this piece of the body ..." wow. As our bodies change, and we were not told that it is not beautiful. I love it when it starts to change, it is a colorful scarf ... ... no longer the ugly wife. <br /> <br /> It's a sad and beautiful picture at the same time. Garden in May this betrays the trust of his daughter ... excellent in the fact that it finds itself through the difficulty of the case, and chooses to move on and, finally, to have a life of its own. I love the boldness of character even initiate novel. <br /> <br /> In general, I love this movie, because in the end this is a picture showing the complex nature of the relationship, whether it's family or not. We see the vulnerability of Paula, but she will have what she wants at any price ... (if she tells her mother that she would have a child for Darren, whether he wants one or not after her mother asks Darren even want child). The film gets to the point on how relationships can change and still shows that it was there all along, in a state of rest. May strangled her own creativity to create a family. The family in which she really did not want to, but "what you just did when she was young." I love the scene where Darren calls her old pie, and she smiles and says, "I've never been called that to." It was truly a gem of a film. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. Well, I just love it. I was pleasantly surprised. He is not only pleasant to the eye, he is a real talent. Which is a neat role. It is much more than any 007 that closely and I look forward to seeing him in multiple roles of this kind. The scene in which he blessed and my appearance, he gives her his native look of surprise that he has such control over the woman, and one of the fun to be able to give it to her. He truly enjoys giving her pleasure. Great scene. Contrast love scene with Bruce. Bruce is completely absorbed in the pleasure ... two completely different people. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately ... I wonder where my Darren?
