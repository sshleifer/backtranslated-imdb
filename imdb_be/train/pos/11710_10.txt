Long before Tim Lahai and Jerry B. Jenkins would shake the world of the Christian subculture (and making millions in the process) on the left side of the book, MARK IV picture film distribution company Christian Evangelical Association of Billy Graham, gave us a masterpiece. What I love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail, sitting in the living room. Instead, we dramatic scenes of this "post-charm" sadness, we sit in the living room when he heard about it in the news, because the filmmakers can not afford to show it. The premise of the film is based on the Pre-millennial, pre Sadness eschatalogy, believing that Christ comes once for taking secret of the true church, and then comes to the end of the seven years of hell on earth. What used to scare me in junior high at the moment makes me laugh. Intriguing adventure Patty and her journey across the tribulation (and two of the three sequels of the film) tells his amazing story of infidelity and eventually curse. I hate to admit it, but I still thoroughly enjoy watching it. He even has the same estimate of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to make this observation.
