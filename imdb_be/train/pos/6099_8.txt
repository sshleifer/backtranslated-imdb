I still grainy, late at night, no cable, cheap VHS Dubs this show with waaaaaayyyy ago when, late night movies and all, if I did not want to stay up any odd hour they will slam this show - just I could attach it <br /> <br /> the show was not really about Freddy Krueger. - only the first few episodes are actually engaged in it as you want, but Rod Serling-Esquire speaker. Instead, each episode was a wonderful nightmare, using traditional themes of horror monstrous childhood, love, cannibalism, love, money, death, love, and ... hmm ... acquaintance. <br /> <br /> On the episode, when a teenager accidentally says "I will love you forever" to the wrong girl, and stuck with it (in the literal sense, at least for now, they are growing together ... ), to where the young stewardess goes home with a wonderful man, only to find himself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room full of other flight attendants, and one I only vaguely remember that compared to the blind date in hockey (and injury and penalties that go with it) - acquaintance was certainly the most terrible, that in the series. <br /> <br /> One episode was Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) as motivated pizza merchant with a delicious new secret ingredient. Nya original, but still awfully fun .... <br /> <br /> However, some episodes were great. My personal favorite was "It's a miserable life", where a young man trapped in a job in the parent burger joint, if he wants to go to college. Pieces talking to himself, and to do a little puppet show with old cheeseburgers - one late night, when a strange guy comes through the drive through and suddenly his life is not the same. No, Freddie, just a thug with a gun - is the entire episode just stunning - the last thoughts that pass through your baby's head with a bullet ... <br /> <br />. the second half of the same scene (many of Freddy's Nightmares episodes were in fact two dimly connected stories) followed his girlfriend, who was also wounded, but not killed in driving past, and who take "the hospital of the devil" - they cram in all the most terrible nightmares hospital dies, and then some - by chance to have your mouth sewn - or waking up during surgery -. to have a dead guy to try to lure you to the morgue for a little cuddle <br /> <br /> Again, this was my favorite . <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes were significantly dur it, like almost all of those that are available in the VIDEO. They put the lousy ones, as a representative of the series, and then no one likes to think the show smelly, and they do not put more on the video. It's pathetic life is available a PAL DVD in England - but I'm still going to buy.
