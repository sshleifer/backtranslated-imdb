I love Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale looks strangely immature in their roles. The film is spoiled only because it seems that two of the accused, it seems, in some monastery, the monks working in the grass and under strict almost martial arts-like discipline. Acting and cinematography and the amazing colors that are supposed to be Thailand is attractive, but the Danes steals the whole movie, and suddenly deep learning harsh lessons of life itself to the very end, in the act of unselfishness strange unheard of and completely unexpected in real world. Deficiencies in a minute, and I recommend a film that seems to have buried forever unfortunately rare television shows. For example, I want the movie to my collection collection- only "10" rated movies. Careful, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
