I saw a new overdubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it. Then I went home and watched it with subtitles, and I loved it. I'm ready to watch it again. <br /> <br /> I'm a sucker for a soft mannered secret identity and that may be more lenient than mannered pacifist librarian? The scene where he reveals his superpowers to your friends or absentmindedly forgets to be meek is favortites. <br /> <br /> Of course, martial arts are stunning. There is really not much I can say about them, if you are familiar with the HK style. However, if you do not ... we paused playback for a short time, and Walker, Texas Ranger was included. We noticed that after each stroke was cut. Not in a black mask. <br /> <br />
