I first saw this movie at the local station on Sunday afternoon horror show back around 1969 or 1970. Uncut. I was just a little kid at the time, but I loved it and was not really that scared them. I thought it was so cool and very original story. Remembering, I'm still surprised that it was revealed during the day to cut in TV those years. I was looking for this film so far, I have seen it again and again, and always loved it. You might think that John Waters would have adored this movie. It should be not only a terrible film, but one of the sleaziest, trashiest movie ever made at that time. And surprisingly, you do not hear about this one, as my cult of the movie, such as "Blood feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" have acquired over the years. He has a cult, but it has really become a cult classic, in my opinion. As far as I know, it came out just before the feast of blood came out, making it probably one of the first true "gore" movie. In fact, this film has elements of Herschel Gordon Lewis and Russ Meyer bit thrown in for good measure. <br /> <br /> In any case, I recommend it for anyone who loves the bad, raunchy, black-and-white horror movies since the early '60s (I think that the date of the end of his reading of 1960).
