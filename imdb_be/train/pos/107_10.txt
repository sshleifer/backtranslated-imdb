Lars Von Europa is triers very good film. How is that? Von Trier has a very stylized way to tell a story, at least, he was with Europe. For me, the whole film was similar to the experience, even if I see it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most comprehensive, REAL, and moving parts of a movie, the most films on the top 250 list. I also think that this is perhaps the most terrible, the most gothic and full movie around. Well, there are other good, too, but this one is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most heartbreaking scenes ever.
