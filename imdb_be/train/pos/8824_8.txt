Woman, Mujar (Marta Belengur) is included in the restaurant one morning & 35 recognizes that terrorists kidnapped a man in this restaurant and makes them play a musical number in this amazing yet fascinating short film that I've ever seen on the find it on DVD director / writer as exciting "time loop". It was a pretty catchy song and it has something to bring a smile to my face, despite the gloomy overall story short. I'm glad I came across it (did not know that it will be further when I rented the DVD) and did not hesitate at all to recommend it to all my friends. <br /> <br /> My rating: A-
