Okay, let's face it. a god-awful movie. Plot (such as it is) awful acting worse. But the film was made for one reason and one reason only, like all those horrible movies Mario Lanza ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case, Pavarotti in his prime. Okay, so maybe Lanza movies were also an occasion for him to hit on women, but this film is about hearing Luciano. That in itself is worth watching the movie. Most opera star stayed on facing your fears, it is humility and love along the way, and belts of many hit numbers, too. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I'm biased on several levels, I'm Italian. I'm a big fan of Pavarotti (is there anything that is not great Pavarotti, including his supporters?). And when I first saw this movie, I was going on my own, seeing the height and depth of opportunities in life and in love for the first time. As bad as this movie, a beautiful voice and memories enough to get me to breathe deeply of life and love again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's corny and awful. But the voice is immortal and eternal, and the voice, it's all about. So I give this movie a high ranking in the hope that someone who has never heard Pavarotti before you will listen and watch and enjoy the new level of music and love, the more that it currently does not. Like Italian food you've never tried before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised, as a fan of Luciano Pavarotti or potential squeak.
