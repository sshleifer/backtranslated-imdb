when I first heard about this movie I thought it would be, as the Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria, I knew it was not easy to be a solid film. Almost everything in this movie is great, really strange costumes and settings are also beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really let me down are the performances. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film, leaving Victoria to life, and with this film, she shows that she is a great actress, and perhaps selecting first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost fresh, as Prince Albert, but he's got great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany as hard as Lord Melbourne, but I expected more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles, but forgettable. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie feels incomplete. It may be that the writers have changed too many things in the script, I do not know, but that's how I feel about this movie. <br /> <br /> But on the whole this is a great film about the early years of Victoria with a great performance of Emily Blunt.
