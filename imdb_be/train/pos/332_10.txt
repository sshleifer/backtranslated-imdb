Although I have not seen this mini-series in more than twenty years, I still remember, as a balance between the nature of the plot and the story about the wonderful adventures turned out. Using special effects makes it more restrained poetic rather than literal telling stories. Two versions that I've seen have been duplicated (English and French), but the actors are speaking in their own language, not only Italian, so that the problem of synchronization. It does not spoil the story. Among the actors Irene Papas as Penelope is best known in North America. Recommended ever go back to all the followers of Odysseus.
