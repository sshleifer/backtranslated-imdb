What can be said, in fact ... "resident" is a first class thriller wrought with an equal amount of uncertainty and full of paranoia. This bizarre graphic film - every detail seems to be included for a reason - even if the plot rarely makes sense and many of them have never even seen in an objective manner. So we are left with a more unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski) - gentle to the Poles, to get an apartment because the previous tenant's suicide - to lead us through the world of escalating fear and uncertainty. After an apartment warming party thrown by a group of unpleasant colleagues, Trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable criticism from fellow passengers in his house; the rest of the film chronicles his deteriorating mental state and gives us a full mindfu * up to par with the more recent efforts of David Lynch. "Lessee", however, is more thoughtful and sinister, imbued with an unexpected comic, wonderful performances, and really achieve through. This film, which is better than the experienced described, so jump to it.
