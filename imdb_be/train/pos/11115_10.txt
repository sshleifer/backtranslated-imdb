I believe that The Sopranos is an awesome show of all the secondary characters in it. I bought all the video still and wait for the other to be released. All 42 episodes so far, the best defined episode # 3, denial, anger, acceptance. This episode deals with my favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for stealing the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was strange, because he was actually one of the few characters that actually confronted Tony and his gang. In the end, he ended up getting shot through the eye, taking a bath, and it's my favorite scene ever in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. And my # 2 favorite character ever was a Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after trying to murder Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney park after they are caught and tortured him. My # 3 favorite character Sean Gismonte, who was killed immediately after shooting Christopher. And finally, my # 4 favorite character Chucky Signore, one of the assistants of Uncle Junior. He was killed on a boat Tony. All the strange characters are dead. This is the only bad thing about The Sopranos. All the cool kids are always killed. You know, that would be great to change to Soprano? They should have a whole episode where they show all the dead minor characters in hell, and they are all trying to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie, because they need to get their revenge. Brendan Filone should strike back !!!!!!!!! 1
