Despite the lack of logic in the present storyline, Slaughter shot a very enjoyable film. Through which a moving performance of Kasper van Dno brilliantly reflects the emotional gap between rich hardworking father and his son are misinformed. Every member of the cast resin support with a solid performance, highlighted in bright cast of young Asian man, whose name I can not remember. It is woefully tragic ending might upset some young viewers, but in general Slaughter shot really delivers a fatal blow.
