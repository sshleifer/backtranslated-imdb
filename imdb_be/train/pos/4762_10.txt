I thought, "shower River" was a very good movie Babylon 5, with some exceptional performances with Martin Sheen, Scoggins and McShane. If it was an episode of the series (without the humor), it would be probably one of my favorite series of stand-alone stories. <br /> <br /> Personally, I've always preferred Scoggins Christian, although available JMS did not write it, as well as for most of the series, and it has to withstand the plot Byron / telepath. If you remove the rude humor of a brothel, and "poor" actors in these scenes, this film is a solid material. Probably my third favorite of the four films, but in no means all bad.
