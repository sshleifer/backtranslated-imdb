This is one of the top five animated Disney movie, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the feature-length animated film (as opposed to compile 40s films), and the depth of the road through some flat camera returns to the film in any other way. Although Disney adapts the story somewhat loosely, you gather the idea era through dress and styling --- set a clear period of time, the story takes place. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than the Snow White and the multidimensional nature. In fact, all the characters more well-developed, with the exception of Prince - left most flat - we know that he has a sense of humor and a big smile, but that's all. Like Snow White, Disney has a permanent impact on the history of popular culture --- in most versions of Cinderella, the stepsisters are attractive, just not as good as Cinderella, and the nature of them takes them otherwise pleasant appearance. <, Br /> <br /> Disney Any additions: Mice! In addition, he praised the continuity - always Cinderella loses her shoe throughout the film. Adding a dressing gown, and the next attack by the stepsisters always been terrible as a child - I remember Master View shows it with a black background and a big red light on it! Broken shoes shows the reluctance of evil Lady Tremaine abandon its authority over Cinderella and admit defeat Audley --- will continue to characterize the most evil of all the bad Disney satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.
