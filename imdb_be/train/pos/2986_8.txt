I am surprised that we see even one Nay-Sayer criticizing the old film. We usually do not get a good opera films, but the real big opera color. It is clear that visual effects are not great. It is dated. But as the opera could not be faulted; and I am a lover of opera. I can not even find a lip sync; if we do not know what was in the sound Tebaldi nothing to convince me that it is not Sophia Loren. She does everything with flair! Her dark makeup perfectly; and it has brought a great role in the life! The rest of the cast is pretty, like that amazing ballet company. Most of the cast is excellent; Lauren really cool. Her rival Amneris is also amazing. Anyone who did not like the job one thousand nine hundred fifty-three shamefully remiss. I would have liked Verdi! Naturally, Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
