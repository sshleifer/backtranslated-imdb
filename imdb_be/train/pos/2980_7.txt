This film is simply ridiculous. pointless, but funny. to enjoy this film completely, you can not have an idea of ​​how the film as it is, and just enjoy all the jokes and fun side, if involved with the film. I still find a bit ridiculous in the beginning, when he says that "wants a beer ........ cock." funny stuff. but what makes the film a decent is the fact that he is not trying hard to create a serious back on tape, too many comedies are trying to have serious issues that you simply will not believe. But it is quite another, and just focuses on the ridiculous. I must say, though, Yasmine Bleeth terrible in the film and does not add anything other than the 3 main guys, coop, Roemer and squeak is a very funny look and make the movie look great
