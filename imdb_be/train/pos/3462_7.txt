It was the first television series Columbo episode (though it was filmed after "Death to lend a hand"), and it marked one of the most successful series in the history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy (who played the killer in a series of three times) is interested complacency, arrogance and self-confidence in equal measure here, Ken Franklin, one half of the mystery writing team hatches a complex plot to kill his partner, Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to stop their professional relationship, resulting in Franklin undergoes only a good writer, but not a prolific writer. <br /> <br /> Initially setting is fantastic and the murder Cassidy performance facilitates grounded honor that he was the best killer in the series Columbo. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk beautifully understated as Columbia and innate traits and eccentricities of the character, which will emphasize the apparent slowness and scattering contrast especially well with extreme complacency Cassidy character, one of the early scenes together where Ken Franklin produces motive for killing over a nonexistent Jim Ferris expo see the identification of hit men working underground illustrates this very well. Franklin hints at Columbo this potential motive and Columbo (knowingly or unknowingly) not catch, causing Franklin to express his disappointment in a noticeably condescending and compare it unfavorable to the detective in books, Mrs. Melville. <br /> <br /> In addition, it should be noted the early directorial contribution of 24-year-old Steven Spielberg. Nevertheless, some basic switching camera shading actors and actresses, he adds some stylish and complex risks to support the overall professionalism of the episode. One particularly striking image of a dead Jim Feriss body lying on the couch, almost dark in the foreground, as Ken Franklin raises his glass to him in the background after he finishes answering a telephone call to the distraught wife Ferris. I have no doubt that the work of the restrictive schedule of 10-14 days, Spieberg effort should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this event second killing demanded from intimidation circuit which is constructed Franklin each female (and ironically referred to as "sloppy" on Columbia in its climatic summing up) receives the vapor from all. The front edge of the site is under threat, and screen time between Falk and Cassidy inexcusably reduced at this point, may help screenwriter (Stephen bot) of heavy angle, since it alone can not develop the story without the other murders. <br /> <br /> menopause is the most frustrating aspect of this episode. The initial banter and exchange of words between Falk and Cassidy strongly and efficiently run, but that just advertises the fact that it was going to happen even in the episode. Main Aggravation is O key (if it can be called a key): Cassidy character still complacency and arrogance strangely driven clue that actually does little imply his guilt; and when it was said that he surrendered in a rather unspectacular and uncharacteristic fashion. <br /> <br /> In general, a bold opening to the series, which inevitably promotes and predicted everything that is good about Columbo, and vice versa ,, the problems associated with such ingenuity, that is, maintain high standards, and in particular, to provide a reliable and properly intelligent end.
