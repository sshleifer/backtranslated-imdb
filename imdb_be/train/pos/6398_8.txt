"Inspired by" the tale of "the triumph of the human spirit" is usually a big turn offs for me. The most amazing thing about MEN honorary how I liked it, in spite of themselves. The film as predictable and formulaic as it gets, but it works. Much of the credit concern performances of both terminals. This is an ideal role for Cuba Gooding Jr., who perfectly restrained here. We've come to expect a lot from De Niro, and he did not disappoint. It creates a dark funny portrait. Directed by George Tillman, Jr. wanted to make a film in the old style and comes with a winner.
