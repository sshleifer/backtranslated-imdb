First of all, when people hear "Guy Ritchie," they immediately think of the snatch. So the jackpot was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie's Snatch. They did not expect him to explore new frontiers. This film REVOLVER different jerk; it is much darker and very difficult. So I gave an estimate of 10, because I had to watch the gun 3 times to understand everything. So this movie toy with his head. It is very reasonable written. <br /> <br /> This film differs from Snatch. This was done amazing cinematography is beautiful, and you can find the personal touch of Guy Ritchie (style of direction) in it. <br /> <br /> What won me over was the complexity of the main character, and we are left with more questions than answers.
