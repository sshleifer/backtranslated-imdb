I will start by relating my first meeting with Prince music. It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and the girl danced bare-chested on "1999", playing on the speakers. I asked the man, who is this singer? I was told that it was Prince. It was so good that it distracted me from beautiful topless dancers. Later, I began to hear other songs of Prince and really "dig" them. If Purple Rain came out I still knew very little about this guy Minnesotan. The movie blew me away. I immediately became a princely generation number 1 fan «War Baby». Later, I learned that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she got me and my nephew in the high-ranking official Prince concert, where we sat next to his mother ... how cool! Returning to our subject, I agree with Siskel and Ebert, who called Purple rain classics. I saw him more than 17 times and I love it. I thought that the prince was good action, Apollonius struggled a bit, but in general, which operates in order. John Gielgud was not available to play in «The Kid», so the Prince took over the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliantly paced (it will never be slow), and badly directed. I rank it among the best film musicals of all time. The last time I watched it was about a gap in the 7 years, and he still comes. I'm so proud of fellow Minnesotan Prince Rogers Nelson and wanted to tell him in person. He walked in front of me at the time of the above-mentioned concert and said "Hello" to my nephew, but I do not. He was talking to his mother. I was a little depressed, but it is still number 1 with me.
