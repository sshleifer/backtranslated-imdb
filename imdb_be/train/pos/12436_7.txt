Now I read modesty Blaze for a few years, collecting the band room. After the fiasco of a film made many years ago on the basis of the first book "Modesty Blaise" I was surprised by the result obtained is good. <br /> <br /> What I got was a movie not based on an action or violence. Director focused on the history and psychology. How was Modesty is based on his own stories and what parts of her life has been affected by it non-childhood. I think it thougths give a better understanding to the next (I hope) the film. I just loved the movie an old-fashioned style. <br /> <br /> However, all was not so good, gambling was not so good. almost boring and unrealistic. Actions could be improved as well. I do not think the bad guy in this film feel real, the only reason he was so Modesty could have someone to tell your story to. In addition, they could expand this film, showing more of when it builds a "network", but I think, for the next Thats a movie. <br /> <br /> And please forgive me for my bad english
