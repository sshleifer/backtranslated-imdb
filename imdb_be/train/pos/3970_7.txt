This film, which on the surface seems to be all about giving yourself J.Edgar Hoover aa big pat on the back to deal with Klansmen, going after Indian killers, hunting the famous gangsters of the 1930s, the fight against the Nazis in the United States and South America during world war 2 and the commies in New York in the early 1950s. Of course, in 1959 we did not know about the obsession of Mr. Hoover to store sensitive files on honest Americans bugging people like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., but worst of all, his secret love, with its deputy director Clyde Tolson (If you want to learn more about this topic, I suggest to watch the movie Citizen Cohn). Hoover aside, this story is about the life of the FBI, in the words of Jimmy Stewart makes for a decent, but the movie. Vera Miles as his devoted wife also good. But Jimmy movie. As much as Hoover controlled the production and always made sure that the FBI was seen without fault, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human hand, is quite an achievement considering the Hoover always looking over his shoulder. The background score is also nice. I read the latest articles on the Internet, which provides that it is a forgotten film. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time, and none of it should not be forgotten films. TCM was the last network to show a long time ago, and I hope they show it again.
