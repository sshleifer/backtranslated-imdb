I read an article about the Olympic and personal journey of Dan Jansen before watching this film. I am always intrigued by the story of hope and overcoming life that change events, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> background characters provided gives a sense of family closeness and how they positively affected each other's lives. I can not speak to the accuracy of specific details in this film, made to take some creative license in the organization scenario. Nevertheless, the spirit of Dan and his family, that matters here. <br /> <br /> It should be a film about the stories that must be told. I felt sympathy for the characters and greeted the end.
