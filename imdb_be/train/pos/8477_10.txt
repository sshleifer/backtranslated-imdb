in the not so usual sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This film was one of my favorites as a small child, and I have only recently remembered and thought to look for it. Although not many details are no longer clear, in my view, a general feeling that the film gave me stuck with me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents believe that their children can cope with constant and sometimes tough topics, then I highly recommend this film. He taught me a lot about life and death, and brought a lot of emotion in me. To this day it remains one of my favorite movies.
