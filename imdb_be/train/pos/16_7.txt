I found it so-so romance / drama, which has a nice finish and overall good feeling to it. This is not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame family film type with a sleeping-besides marriage is considered "normal" behavior, but given that the stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would expect a much rougher film, at least, language-wise. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the movie is a depiction of how difficult it must be to learn to read and write, if you are a grown man. This is a big theme of the film, and it includes some touching scenes, but to be honest, the film is not so memorable. <br /> <br /> it's still pretty mild, a good story, I'd be happy to recommend,
