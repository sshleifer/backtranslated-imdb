This, of course, to a large extent under the influence of flower power culture of the time, and in some ways very progressive. The track is different, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers on how to be, does not work with the package and cherish it to myself, that's different. This could be the anthem of the gay community must have a great track. <br /> <br /> March Raya, Cass Elliot and Billy Hayes all the great witch, and live the island to cast to give it their all at the border of their character costumes (including Billy Barty, Felix Forces and other well-known names). There is much more effective in this film - there's really nothing subtle, and if the little Jack Wild must replay their concern for the life of the island inhabitants stolen it's really little more than shout. It is a drama and comedy puts on the spatula.

Moreover, at the present time on the CD tasteful people in El-Records, in London. See here for more details: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
