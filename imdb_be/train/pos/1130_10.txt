"Iphigenia" is a great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis. This workshop game skillfully adapted for the screen and brought to life a wonderful actor. Cacoyannis achieve the impossible. He was able to remove the Greek tragedy to the screen, without losing its effectiveness and relevance. Greek star cast helps him in this. Newcomer Tatiana Papamoshit very impressive as Iphigenia. Equally impressive is Irene Papas, who despite the fact that it sometimes seems over the top, it is very realistic. Excellent Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with a wonderful music score Mikis Theodorakis, who is perfect in every scene. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumors say that the film lost the best foreign language film Oscar only one vote !!!
