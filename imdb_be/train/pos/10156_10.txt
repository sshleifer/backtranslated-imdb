This is a great film not to get it registered a higher rating than 5! Why not! This is a great image of the life of Christ without the relentless sensationalism Passion Christ.Johnny Cash did great things for God, which is surprisingly avoided and neglected in areas where they have the most important, as our churches.The film itself took less than a month to shoot Johnny felt a strong presence of God, guiding him through it.Great credit everyone involved in the vast majority of sincere movie that will always be cherished by his fans.At least crusade, Billy Graham praised it highly enough to use it as the main sources of formation of the new Christians.Thanks Fox for production line Walking it.As proved that it was bizarre that the man survived one more production of such undervalued masterpiece.Movies Sun canonized by popular vote, as is the production of shows! Overall I think that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries like this straightforward, truthful and reflects a great witness of the Christian faith!
