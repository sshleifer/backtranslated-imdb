Comparable Fight Club, The Matrix, ai, The Sixth Sense, among others. This film is close to the psyche in a way never done before. The first 30 minutes is building an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise Cruz. The rest of the film, well, confusing, you will choose more and more every time you see it (I went to the cinema to see it 3 times now)
