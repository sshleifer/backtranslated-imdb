Sabrina, the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite shows T.V life: D I used to watch back to back episodes every day, when I got home from school. So far, I think I've watched every episode at least once, and a number 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays a perfect teenage girl / witch with normal teenage problems, which we can all relate. She's funny, smart, outgoing, witty, and much more. Caroline ReA and Beth Broderick both fit part is very good as Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, a smart scientist, and Hilda crazy, crazy to make a perfect balance in the life of Sabrina. Although I have to agree that the student, not as good as her high school years, but this does not mean that they were still good. I think that was the end of the country, although it was not what I hoped it would make sense, and I loved it anyway. :)
