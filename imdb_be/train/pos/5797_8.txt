And I do not say this in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in a movie theater when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousins ​​it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time, when we left the theater, Michael was our best another, even if we know that he did not have any idea about it. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've seen this movie in the air a few times, but I always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds would restore that feeling of magic and warmed my heart. And I liked it that way. <br /> <br /> So I just saw this movie once, and I think it was a good decision not to watch it again. If I saw him today, I know that I could not criticize the actions of Manchester United, the plot (if there is one), and this and that. For me it is the memory of childhood, so my feelings for her have a child 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see my adult self will intervene in my rankings and gives him 8 for the memories and great music. For this young child, who was watching him in fear 20 years ago, although it is certainly worthy of 10.
