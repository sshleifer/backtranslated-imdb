This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly the need to create movies in general. Generally speaking, I'm a fan of films based on real events, worthy. And it's one more! In addition to performing Meryl, who gained a lot of recognition and praise, the greatest asset of the film story is based on. Riveting story about a couple who suffers from social and legal torture, after being subjected the great emotional pain in an unexpected and violent death of their baby is really a cautionary fable that exposes the inhuman side counterparts and bares the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society. It is interesting to see how people who regard themselves as a kind and intelligent people (emotional ladies of the jury in a movie, for example) is really nothing more than selfish suckers who would, in their dogmatic beliefs and superstitions, closed their minds to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all the facts, which show very clearly against their own reasons. Other officials from the so-called "civilized" societies, which exposes the film to the apathy of near pain (needless to say, it is very common, even if this particular story takes place in Australia), which goes to both the formation of this cruelty. Should you are ready to take something serious and maybe thought-provoking.
