I've seen this movie a long time ago, but found it strange, and to this day he has never stopped amazing me. <br /> <br /> A great film that describes the value of the group of Australian commandos who tried to sink some Japanese ships in Singapore harbor in the midst 2. <br /> <br /> This commando was in civilian, and they are spies Japanese invaders. But something happens that has not been studied much in any Hollywood movie WW2, what I saw. <br /> <br /> The close and friendly adhesion develops between captors and captives. They begin to respect each other, while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers became best friends with a senior Japanese jailer. This is the most beautiful part of the whole movie and it really pulls your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, one day, like two friends talking, captain of Aussie learns that some other prisoners will be tried and punished for the sinking of JAP ships in Singapore Harbor. <br /> <br /> He says that this is his team, and not just any one who sank the ship to his Japanese friend, and heard a Japanese guard tells him to keep quiet, because it can lead to a whole group of his getting punished. But the captain remained adamant admitting that the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities to sentence them to death in the most respectful manner, in accordance with their rules. It is a great honor to captured warriors in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most amazing part of the film, where Australian troops are waiting for their inevitable death and tense indecision friendly Japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why his Aussie friend was found guilty. <br /> <br /> I will not give the ending here. But it's more bitter than you can imagine, and can be easily moved from one to tears. <br /> <br /> In general, a great underrated film that may not have received the recognition that he deserves at the international level. Get a copy today and be mesmerized.
