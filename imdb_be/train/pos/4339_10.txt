This is one of the best films I've ever seen. I feel very touched by the theme of the film is going to pass. One suggestion that keeps coming to my mind, is that "history repeats itself". Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents, their wives; People have every justification entirely sharing precious time with their children, it is too late; people always have to work hard to support the whole family, but only to neglect the subtle sense of responsibility of its partners; People are always changing their views on the different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for his favorite; nothing is more important than the ratio of the blood of people share in this world, and one is never too late to talk to your people about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves, so that when life is going to end one day, people should not have compassion or bored, as they kept their word, and there is always hope --- a new life. Actors and actresses are fantastic. They understood perfectly the intention of the director. The charm of the film is, for me, the effect of which the skilful and beautiful alloy audience cheers and tears.
