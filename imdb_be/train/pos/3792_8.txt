I've seen this movie before now, and I was amazed at how accurately the dialogue for the main characters. He did not feel like a movie - it felt more documentary (part I liked best). Leading home in this film seemed real to me as any fifteen year old girls I know. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very enjoyable film for those who love independent films.
