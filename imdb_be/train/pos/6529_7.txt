I had to see it because a) I have a 11 year old girl, and b) we showed her films Bonita Granville Nacy Drew since the 1930s, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Personally, I do not think it was as humorous as the 1930s movie, but on the other hand, it was not a sickly part of intelligence insulting down I feared it would be. It was harmless, mildly entertaining film. Although I am glad that they did not try to "update" Nancy 21st century "hipness" (Veronica Mars is named as the modern Nancy Drew), I think they have made it a little too soft, that they are useless "t do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the film could be called "Jane Doe, the girl detective." I have to blame the scenario: I think every actor has done a good job with what they had to work. I like Emma Roberts in the role, but they gave her made for TV, not the theatrical release, the script ...
