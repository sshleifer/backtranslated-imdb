As I thought for many years that this wandering comedy service was a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the potential customers. It certainly has the same rough house humor that Ford laces of his movies. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I found out that it was George Stevens, who actually directed it. However, I refuse to believe that this film was not proposed by John Ford, but he was probably the monument valley makes Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., playing three sergeants in the Indian Army, who have a good friend / buddy / buddy camaraderie going. But the old gang is falling apart because Fairbanks is engaged to marry Joan Fontaine. No, if his two friends could help him, aided and abetted by the regimental Beastie Gunga Din, as played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> Kipling poem served as inspiration for this RKO film about life in the barracks of the British Raj, Comic-playing conclusions so well that it overshadows incredibly racist message of the film. Not that producers were racists, but it has been speculated Brits there at the time, including our potential customers and Gunga Din reveals that it is most effective. <br /> <br /> British India took steps, making suggestions here and there with local leaders under weak Mogul emperor who had committed suicide in the middle of the 19th century. They ran very little of India directly, it would be impossible. Their rule depended on the native troops, which you can see here. Please note that the soldiers could not rise above the rank of corporal and Gunga Din is much lower status than that. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the rebels really Indian, entirely Muslim. There are so many strains of the religion as there are Christian sects, and it pushes the cult was very real. Of course, for those who are suppressed, they may not have the same view of them as liberators. But while India is not organized independence movement before the Congress party did not came into being, these people were the voice of a free India. <br /> <br /> but still cool, inhibit a person is not a good thing to do, and the British had their own point here too. When I look Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and therefore the prime directive came into being. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant to play their true Cockney myself here instead of polite Cary, we are used to seeing, Fairbanks McLaglen and doing very well with the roles completely suited to their personality. <br /> <br /> The best actor in the film, but Edward Ciannelli guru, cult leader strangler. Pay attention to the fire and passion in his performance, he blows everyone else off the screen when it is on. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in Gunga Din is Ciannelli exhorting his troops in their mountain temple. Notice how Stevens gradually darkens the background around Ciannelli, until all that you do not see your eyes and teeth like a disgusting halloween mask. Ghosts, scary and very effective. <br /> <br /> It was immediately after the action of the film at the end of the nineteenth century, that more and more of the British public began to question the basic assumptions justifying Raja. But this is the subject of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a great film, interesting and funny. It must be specified as a passage to India and Gandhi, and you can schedule as the Indian independence movement evolved.
