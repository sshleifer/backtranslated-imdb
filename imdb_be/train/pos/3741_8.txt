War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971, follows the pile of recruits through basic training, and then Tigerland - the exact image of Vietnam on American soil, before they are shipped over. It focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, make friends and deal with corwardly squadron commander (Clifton Collins Jr.) and borderline crazy (Shea Wingham) <. br /> <br /> strange non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. It uses a handheld camera for most of the film, and uses digital video to the action scenes. It works very well - the film looks rough (as it should be) and uncomfortably realistic <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully conceals his Irish accent and takes quite a convincing southern accent .. His performance just fine - he is a very talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, not so good. He is a tall, muscular, very beautiful - and very soft. The rest of the cast, but it's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> This film was thrown his studio. He did not star in it, and familiar history and has been recognized as "just another war movie." He played only a week in Boston! It is well worth catching on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> In addition, Farrell and Davis have a long scene of naked.
