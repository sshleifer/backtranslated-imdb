I've seen a lot of movies and Sauro always found surprising as it collects music, dance, drama and great movies in his films. Iberia shows even better Saur when dealing with multimedia concepts and more modern concept of dance and music. Another thing that drew my attention to the fact that in this film, dancers and musicians, dance and music are equally important: The camera shows the different aspects of musical interpretation, considering not only technical issues, but also the emotional experience of the game. Sauro interest on a bridge between the classical and modern music and dance is another ingredient in the transformation of this film may be the most aesthetically spectacular among his other works. That's why I recommend it highly for anyone who loves a good movie, good music, good dance, great art.
