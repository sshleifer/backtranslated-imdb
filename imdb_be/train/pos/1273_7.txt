Simple film in the beginning, a simple movie, after all. He has that non-ending and making the kind of clich√©, but most TV movies have that any means. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job as an ex-con / tramp. The marriage between her and the woman he works, I feel a little strange, but I think, for a period of time, it is set in, it is no less true. <br /> <br /> At the moment I saw the version to edit the "TV", even the film was made and pointed to the "TV", I think it a bit strange, as well. But I feel, when I saw the fullness of the piece, I would have given it more-in-probably the same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but still .... good job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
