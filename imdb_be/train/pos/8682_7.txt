I am sad to say that I disagree with the other people in this episode of Columbo. Death lend a hand open view of the Columbia sad to me. After a few times, I'm bored, and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was weak in this episode than others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for the character Ray Milland in. He hires him to investigate his young beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, to see if she was having an affair. In turn, the nature of Culp's blackmailing Cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme of her husband ruining his career. With anger, Culp kills her, striking her in the face and to set up a body in another place. I do not know. Maybe I just do not care for it at all. Of course, Columbo gets it in the end. It's just a question of how.
