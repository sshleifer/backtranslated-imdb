I love this movie because it showed that they do not kill for pleasure, but to save the ones they love! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job, which shows Ned and Joe. It has a few quick inappropriate scenes, but that's all right, except this one. Language is very soft, and sometimes do not even know it's there. This film shows that just because they are outside of the law does not mean that they are evil murderers! I hope that people will see this movie and learn about the importance of time in history like this one. There is one thing that fascinates me about this film is that they got their inspiration for their armor from the book of Ned looked at! In addition, it is how people will remember them from their armor. I hope that people will see this movie and wondered how I was.
