In my case, I liked this movie because when I saw him, I found more than I expected. I mean, it's one of the few animated films that made me think about their subjects even a long time after I had finished. It speaks about the death, vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets to you, like a punch in the face, even reaching to suffer with the dream sequence at the midpoint of the film. This is what makes this film so good: the ability, unique in Don Bluth (Director), to play with people's feelings and make them love or hate the character as soon as possible. This, and the fact that it has so many good characters like Charlie and Anne-Marie, which is sad, but a happy ending, you should say: "I have something in my eye" to hide others that you cry. All I said was just some of the good points of this movie. As for the rest, you have to see them for yourself in the film is very honest. Don Bluth, thank you.
