I think that many viewers missed completely the fact that this is obviously a parody of western movies <br /> <br /> This is not a bad film. - this is a clever ironic take on westerns. I do not believe that this film takes itself seriously at the moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this film even more unique is the fact that is centered around 4 strong, beautiful women, two of whom are black, one. Asian, Mexican / Hispanic character <br /> <br /> This is not your ordinary Western women - they're tough. - they can be done quickly and accurately shoot <br /> <br /> They're so tough, even the bartender shakes when he pours them whiskey <br /> <br /> plot that moves the story on the typical Westerns. - in the spirit of "You killed my brother - so I m gonna get you! "Only in this western, sister of the woman was removed, and she was out for revenge on the gang who did this. <br /> <br /> So she goes and rounds up his old pals from her bank robbing days. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, is not really all that interested in avenging sister Rachel, but she has motived the gold and jewels hidden in the town, where they are headed. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that do not quite make sense, not that they interfere that much, they can be ignored, but I wondered why they were there. Thus, the film could use a little puff, but for all of this well made film that failed to find an audience, which recognizes that it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment is that the only lesbian in the movie villain - with "heroin", one obviously right, other sexual orientation is revealed <br /> <br /> 7 stars.
