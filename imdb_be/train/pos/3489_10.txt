I love this movie. It was one of my favorite movies. The action never stops. The entire film was done very well. The ending is very good. Ontop with and action filled, they surprised even put in there for you. When I saw that film was about the Internet, I was kind of not sure if I would like to see this movie, but the point I'm such a big fan of Luke Perry, I decided to give it a chance. I am glad that I did give him a chance, because it was very good, although the film. It was very original. Who came up with this film gets applause from me. Action was fine. Luke Perry did a great job again. I give this film the highest rating.
