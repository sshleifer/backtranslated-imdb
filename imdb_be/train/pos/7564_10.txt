In my work, I sometimes receive contact independent filmmakers who are trying to promote his film. If I can, I look at these low-budget films, and they often make me think that the future of Hollywood is going to the dogs. After a while, though, there is a film that is born out of pure passion and desire as if created to remind the movie industry that good movies are still possible. Broken short film, directed by Alex Ferrari is a real surprise and worth a second look. <br /> <br /> Since the work in poor 20 minutes, which broke trying to tell a compelling (but surreal) story with almost no backstory. Spectators plopped down in the middle of the action, without a clue as to what's going on. A young woman (Samantha Jayne floor) wakes from sleep to hear the shot, and then abducted from her home. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs who look like they are at home in the comic. These nasty guys and girls are bigger than life. They have all the guns and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> The kicker is that, despite the low film he plays the budget as one. From the beginning, the feeling that in R A K E H was filmed, edited and produced by professionals. It looks like something Quentin Tarantino could have done in his day, when he shuts the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and cold, he looks good and feels like something big. <br /> <br /> action much better than I usually see in these small films. Floors and Paul Gordon (who plays the main killer, Duncan) were well matched. In two of the few media roles in the film, it's for them to carry the film. No special effects, no matter how good, do not have saved this movie with bad acting. Fortunately, the floor is possible to convey the true fear and Gordon manage to come off as a real psycho. Some of the more limited roles, seems filled with less talent, but it hardly shows. <br /> <br /> disadvantage B R O K E N is the fact that it takes just 20 minutes. The story ends with a twist Twilight Zone, which seems a bit far-fetched and unlikely to thin. Watching this, I felt that I had to have some enlightenment, but there was just a feeling that it was much more mundane than I hoped it would be. The film tries hard every effort to be one of those puzzles that leave the audience talking hours at a local cafe, but it comes off as unsatisfactory. I keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes long film <br /> <br /> My rating :. 8 of 10.
