I feel that I have some uber-rare disease that nobody has heard of, and I finally stumbled upon a support group in the network! I finally found the name, asking for a response to the "experts" website. I also saw this film when I was young and I was amazed atmosphere and especially the ending. I will never forget him and never seen him since. None of my friends have not seen the movie, and I almost gave up some time to find a name. Unfortunately, even knowing the name, I will not, probably never see the movie again, because it is impossible to find on sale. Small steps ... <br /> <br /> G
