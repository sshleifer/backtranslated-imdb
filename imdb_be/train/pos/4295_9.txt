Alain Chabat argues that film, as his original idea, but the topic reluctant lovers who finally get it together as old, if not older than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Shabana is a "vieux garcon", happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disrupt his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mum - G7 - who will decide that he should be married. Enter beautiful, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. Charlotte to pose as a friend of Shabana, and then just not be on the wedding day. No more talk of marriage with the G7. Of course, the best-laid plans have a habit of uncontrolled. <br /> <br /> There is a very strong supporting roles from Lafon both mother and Ostermann as a tight-fisted brother Gainsbourg. <br /> <br /> there are some fantastic scenes, like the first Charlotte charm, then be a family. French farce with the English language.
