Early to mid-90s were the high point, in my opinion, for a historical drama. Last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all painted a distinctive passion and intensity of the respective periods of time <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing flavor of time and place are rarely represented by movie .. It really has it all - an interesting story , great action, great dialogue, and breathtaking scenery. I was particularly impressed seen this dialogue. I can imagine what it's like in the early 18th century, people spoke and behaved. <br /> <br /> Something else that surprised me, vulgarity expressed signs. I found it to be more repellent and shocking, although often more subtle than most found in films set in the present. The film was very colorful and sexually charged edge to it that was unique and, most likely, very realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> pace was very tight, with little dull moment. There was a lot of intrigue and political podagovorov that complicated things a bit, but it does not detract from the storyline. <br /> <br /> The event was also very well done and exciting. What I always find great that during the validity of the allocation in the film soundtrack at all. This makes for a very tense, thrilling sequence, as we have no musical cues as to the direction and decision stage. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always be high on my list of favorite movies. I would recommend it to everyone.
