«Cut» is a full-tilt parody of slasher genre and mostly it achieves what it intends to do. Most standard slasher clichés there; old spooky house, forest, anonymous indestructible serial killer, buckets of gore, and, of course, the couple broke the murderer, when they have sex (it's hardly a spoiler). <br /> <br /> The set -up is simplicity itself: a film-school botany intended to complete the unfinished chopper "masterpiece", unfinished due to the killing of several actors. It's also neat - well, messy - disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel. They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by Ringwald, who completely steals the film, because it gets all the best lines. The rest of the actors fit their roles well, especially the beautiful Jessica Napier, who plays it straight while the chaos and blood erupting around her. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of red herrings and fake tense moment, and there is very little time to try to figure out who the killer is, because the film moves at such a fast pace. He also has a corresponding low budget look, including some clumsy editing, which is probably intentional. A good soundtrack, too. If there are difficulties with this film it determines whether it is a promise, or a tribute to slasher genre. Perhaps a little of both.
