DIG! funny, fun, funny, interesting, stylish, and very well done. Knowing that it was done at such a budget over 7 years, it is surprising that such a story can be told, especially with the style and substance. If you are a music lover or a fan documentary is a must see. <br /> <br /> focusing on Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols for many years is a great way to show the contrast between the decent team responsible with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and megalomaniacal genius vocalist backed by various characters that are sabotaging your own success through drugs, alcohol, and madness. If I did not know that this is footage of real people, I would have sworn it was incredibly well written script and creative pieces. The story is compelling, concise, and simply amazing.
