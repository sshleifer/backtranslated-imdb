I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend, and wow! I've already seen the first two films, and I loved them, but Ultimatum, I loved. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, and suffering from amnesia CIA agent on the run, trying to figure out who he is. <, Br /> <br /> As I said, I loved this film from beginning to end, not the plot holes, slow scenes, all did not go just right and good fit in other films, but it was in every sense a lot better. <br /> <br /> The best stunts, car chases, the actors, and the effects I've seen in the blockbuster summer, (surprisingly because of the Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) But I WASN »t only action in this movie, Jason did not just kill and escape. He has the soul, and the audience feels for him, so that the drama is on. But it does not slow it down. <br /> <br /> Of all «threequels», which came out last summer, it was the best.
