Worse still, the nature of Theresa Russell - face experience that nothing in her conscious rationalistic explanation is as reluctant to have to deal with the experience to another level - the spiritual. You know, the realm of the ignorant and superstitious, the kind of thing that the art-house film fans should be higher. Oh, the horror ...

But, unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems spiky critical criticized as much for even asking the question as to the possible answers this film is.
