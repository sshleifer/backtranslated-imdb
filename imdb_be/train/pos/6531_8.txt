I really liked this movie ... it was nice. I enjoyed it, but if you did not, it's your fault. Emma Roberts Nancy Drew played well, despite the fact that she is not just like in the books. Old fashion costumes are amazing when you see them today, but it looks good to them. For me, the rich girl was not clothes that make them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale, and just decided to put it all together. All the outfits were sticky, especially if they were fine loafers have regular meetings. I do not want to make the film look bad, because it certainly was not! Just go to the theater and watch !!! You will enjoy it!
