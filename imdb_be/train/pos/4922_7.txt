It is interesting that the audience thought of the day when first laying eyes on Walter Jack Palance (Black). Of course, it looks like no other since then that the brain, like the face, flat nose, and elongated body-- even now he remains a disturbing presence. What may be more suitable than its appearance from those dark slum New Orleans, which are smolder as plague Black squander the city. I'm just sorry that he has no more scenes. <br /> <br /> The film artfully assembled ?? black humor morgue, the Widmark- Douglas interaction UN touristy places, fights among officials ?? all woven into a tense thriller with a realistic threat, unlike others of the time. Even domestic scene WIDMARK, which would put a woman (Bel Geddes) on the control tent, not to be too disruptive. Director of Kazan, certainly testifies to its ability to entirely helming the studio (Fox) of the product, no matter how he may feel about the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark makes solid restrained work as a public health officer. But my money is on the one and only Mostel. It was there ever sweatier performer who can scream louder or get pushed around a bulky guy fall (for example, an enforcer, 1950). This scene of Mostel, where Palance argues with a quarrelsome wife in Mostel (Liswood), is a gem of frenzied adulation as Mostel trying to reassure each somehow obsessed pinball. It is a pity that he lost so many years, to the blacklist. (I wonder if he was talkative Kazan, who called it). <br /> <br /> But it's not only professionals who add color. Locals like to add character and authenticity, especially the two guys Asian interviewees cops. This whole scene of improvised air, like Kazan recognized its potential and fashioned a beautiful little scene on the spot. Then, also, that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands pure inspiration. And what about those Chubar cafes that I ran to the nearest. <br /> <br /> Danny Anyway, the film is still well placed, riveting thriller with apocalyptic air, strangely foreshadows many modern Meg -hits.
