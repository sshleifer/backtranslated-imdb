EA showed us that they can do the classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60 world. The graphics are outstanding, and the voice recording is very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (two years after the issue), and I am still impressed by the gameplay. It's a shame that EA will no longer make 007 games. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 to levels that it contains, especially the "consular" level. I would recommend this game to anyone under the age of 13 years and older. The only thing I do not like the game is the Russian level of the boat, it was too much pressure. In general, I like the game a lot !!
