This is a great movie with a stellar cast and excellent acting. I never get tired of watching it. I especially love the scene where the hero Danny Glover and Kevin Kline character in particular and Simon Mack brunch together. Kevin Kline is such a natural and, it seems, his manner easy and one you would encounter frequently. Thus, it is very "real" movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful scenes in the film, however, is at the very beginning of the film, when Simon arrived on the scene, where the car disintegrated Mac. The film also has a strong message, and in contrast to the stereotypical message carrying the film, where there is one person preaching his guts in front of the audience. Instead of emotions and situations the actors take the collision posts, making better without the use of words. Finally, Mary McDonnell is brilliant, as always.
