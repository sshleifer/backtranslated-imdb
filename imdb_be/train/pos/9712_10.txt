Another review compared the company of a cross between Monty Python and the Twin Peaks, also aptly. Another review of the teaching about the difference between comedy we enjoy uncritically and black comedy, also should be considered. <br /> <br /> See it all, all three series. In the end, all the characters are connected and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place as well as a novel by Douglas Adams. Details and subtleties are stunning. Thoroughly postmodern. Outrageously funny and surprisingly tragically. Not for children. Not for those with thin skin or which lack objectivity. Food for thought. Immediately literal, figurative and surreal in disturbing ways. Black comedy I can remember. <br /> <br /> It is very possibly the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
