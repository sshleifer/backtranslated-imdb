BEWARE spoilers. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were two of the best in this. Okay, so goofie foreign guy who (spoiler HERE) trades with a biker on his clothes was funny. Boss This guy was good, too. But the film really belonged Hawn and Sarandon. These two should have a lot more time on the screen together. They chemistry was great. In the bathroom room scenes WOW! Romantic, sweet, tasty. <br /> <br /> Hone is blunt cocktail waitress who makes a foreigner in Whitehouse and ends in the middle portion of the greed politicians. To talk about Sarandon would give a lot away. SPOILERS It's pretty atypical romantic / political comedy, and it satisfies several political parties as a whole is much more than romantic. This applies to political issues, and just slips on the romantic areas. <br /> <br />
