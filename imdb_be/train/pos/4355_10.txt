I also viewed the film at the film festival in Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was a wonderful film about family relationships of adults. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was funny, warm, sharp and moving, as well as entertainment. The film, as it would be very good with the word of mouth reviews. I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this movie. Let us only hope that they will have a chance. I would rate this film as one of the best films I've seen in a year. It does not contain any kind of violence, scenes, murder, sex, so, apparently, distributors, the question of whether or not to pick it up. Believe me, there are people who would like to go to a movie like this, what matters, softening instead of many, we are usually given the typical big box-office blockbusters.
