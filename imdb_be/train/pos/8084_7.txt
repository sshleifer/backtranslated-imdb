<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time that night. I was a supporter of the work of Tolkien for 4 years, ever since I got out of high school. I did not grow up in this movie ... Perhaps, my mother kept me away from her. It's definitely not for children. Not that it's bad in a graphical sense, but that the topic will go directly to the majority of 10-year goals. In general, the animation was excellent considering it was done in 1978/1979. I thought that the story was followed by the book well enough in the broad sense. But I'm confused that Baska not just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the return of the king. It would have done so in the end the film. I'm worried about his abrupt end, and then, when I heard the sucking Return of the King, I am even more tired. It is a pity that this is not a big animated film. It may have gotten a higher my voice. I give it a 7. I can only hope, Peter Jackson will make the book justice with a new live-action LOTR.
