Stupid, stupid, stupid. I think Angelina Jolie is probably one of the most talented actresses today, but the film, it is not only worth her time. She deserves better, and so does everyone else in the film. Talent is just wasted. Sorry, but I do not feel like writing a review for it. <br /> <br /> I do not give a single star with *****.
