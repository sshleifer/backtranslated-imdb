I just love this movie. This is an excellent example of a well-rounded amazing stories that come out of Asian cinema. It was recently the Hollywood remake of the film with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez just terrible. Please do not confuse the two films. The original Japanese film touches, subtle and beautifully acted. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was stunned when I first saw the trailer for the US Version altered and that was starring in it. This is a typical Hollywood unoriginal dumb commercialism at it worst. Remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The only reason the original film did not become more widely considered disgust US audience on subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why this movie would never work in the US is significant that the reserved, ultra socially conservative nature of Japanese public person is at issue in this film. Of course, the main character wakes up to a fuller understanding to live a busy life through dance, but half of the film's tension comes from stereotypes and jokes ballroom dancers facing in Japan. <br /> <br /> Please try to watch the film in its original form, but not terrible full screen. And please skip the US remake .... this spoof of small compared to the original Japanese film. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the "original" film is much older, and it's just the Japanese. take on the story, but only two people are likely to see in the near future in this one, and a new US remake <br /> <br /> Speaking about foreign films, I make some quick advice: 1. Monsoon Wedding-I list this first due to an outstanding film! 2.Johnny Stechino-very funny Italian misidentification Flick! 3.Shiri-Korean action movie, which mixes both Asian flare & Style US plot 4.Run Lola Run-German film, which integrates it through the genius <br /> <br /> Well, just a quick list of all the same: . -)
