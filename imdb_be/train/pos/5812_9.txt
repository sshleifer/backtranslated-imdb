Lunokhod probably not the movie to see if you are not a fan of Michael Jackson. I'm a big fan and I use most of the movie, the ending was not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes or so were. - if you are a fan of <br /> <br /> I personally believe that the first 50 minutes of re-watchable over and over again. Dancing in every video captures the spirit, music and listen to fantastic entertainment dialog. <br /> <br /> It includes many of his best videos from the Bad and the fragments of his earlier videos. It also includes some concert scene. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Michael Jackson, it is a must if you're not a fan of / do not like Michael Jackson, stay away. <br /> <br /> 9/10
