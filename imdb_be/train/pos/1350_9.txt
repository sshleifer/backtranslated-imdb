In the "Anne of Green Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), brothers and sisters of middle age, who live together at Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, we decided to take the boy from a distant orphanage to help on the farm. But an orphan sent to them is a premature girl 14 years called Shirley Ann (Dawn Evelyn Paris-veteran of the series of Disney short "Alice", who later would take the name of your character). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 in the original novel by Lucy Maud Montgomery, but the same could not believable actress go from 11 up to college age throughout history. The film suffers somewhat from this concession, since many reactions Anna, and much of what she says, what is more interesting, which comes from the eleven years that a teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please, but dissatisfied with the title, her build, her freckles, her long red hair. As a child's imagination, however, Anne takes much joy in life, and quickly adapts to his new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne is the original "Teenage Drama Queen" and the screenwriter of the film chosen to focus on this aspect of her character. Turned the main genre with moderately amusing family drama to comedy. Changes to please the audience and continues to frustrate the reader purists. <br /> <br /> As a comedy very much in the spirit of the story Montgomery, I do not see any reason to take issue with the changes, but let this be fair warning to those who are waiting are absolutely correct adaptation. Element of comedy is a film strength, as it is one of the earliest self-reflexive parody of Hollywood conventions. Actress Anne Shirley was one of the beauties of Hollywood All-time, and the film in black and white. So much fun in seeing endless Crying title character of her appearance and hair color contrary to what appears on the screen. Anne regularly treats her no-nonsense rural companions of melodramatic lines do not like, "If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me." Perhaps the funniest moment, when she corrects the spelling of his name on the blackboard. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown is doing a good job as the love interest of Anne Gilbert Blythe and Sarah Hayden steals all the scenes in which she appears as a pompous neighbor Cuthbert. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
