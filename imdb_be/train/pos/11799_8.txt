Good cast summary of real events! Well, actually, I was not there, but I think this is how it can be like. I think there are two typical American point of view are obvious in the movie: «communistophobia» Adolf Hitler and parallels. They should be obvious to most independent observers. Anyway, Boothe does a great job, and so did many other famous actors. The last twenty minutes of the film unbearable - and I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after normal. (That's why it's so scary - it all happened, and it probably looked just like this). But, really really going on, so that the last scene at the airport?
