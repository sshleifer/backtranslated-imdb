I found it very touching, Spike and Heaton stay together all the way through the film can not be said that this is not a few changes along the way. I thought that the pursuit delayed relationship between them were to the fore, I think. I have realized that there was so intent on the part of homosexual Heaton. My favorite scene was supposed to be a little bit where Spike and Heaton are stuck in a bog and Spike runs away, I do think that Spike did not return. I must say that if it was not for our teacher of film studies leads us to look at it, I probably would have never seen it. Overall, I thought this movie was very good, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a supporter of the British film production.
