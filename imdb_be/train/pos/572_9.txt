In response to the person who made a comment about how the film drags and who believed there was no purpose in the role of a brother Jesse here is my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of Jesse's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in history. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the fullest, despite brother Jess did. There are various cases in which Brad Pitt and his life work in parallel, for example, when a brother takes Jess Craig Sheffer in rambling bar, and then he finds Brad Pitt a few days later. Dramatic irony was there so the nature of Craig Sheffer will be of great emotional turmoil in his brother's death, knowing that he could have done more to prevent it, and then creates a compelling mood of the film.
