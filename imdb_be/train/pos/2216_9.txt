Historical drama and coming of age story with the free people of color in the pre-Civil War New Orleans. It starts slowly, but gaining momentum as soon as you know about the main characters and the real action can begin. It is not just the story of the exploitation of black women, because they were free men. They may not have all the rights of white, but of course they have more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors. Young men and women in this story one has to make their own choices about how to live your life, whether to give a vicious system or live with optimism and to contribute to their community. I enjoyed all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bell and Marcel.
