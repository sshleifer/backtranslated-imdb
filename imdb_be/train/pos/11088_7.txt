Willian in this film one high sob, and he seems to like what he's doing, that's what I guess that makes it so meanly. I do not think that most men love this movie, especially if they ever cheated on his wife. This is one of those films that largely remains quite mean to the end. But then, you have a candy bar ending that makes me look back and say, Â«Hokie as hell." It's a good movie to finish. End is the end we would like to see, but not the end of the beginning of the medium. And then there are the consequences of what happened. I think you can make up your own mind about the true ending. I left feeling that only one character had survived in the end.
