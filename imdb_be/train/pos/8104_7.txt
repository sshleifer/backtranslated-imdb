This is an amazing film from 1936. While the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), a stylish vision of 2036, which comes afterword makes up for it. However, I do not plan to be able to understand all the dialogue - quality sound and accents (an American - but "1930» American) burden <br /> <br /> Basically, the story quickly. 100 years to look at the fictional American town called «Everytown». It covers since 1936, when the war was on the horizon until 2036, when technology leaps forward, and creates its own problems <br /> <br /> The first one o'clock a little slow. - although it is difficult to say that the audience would have thought then. Events, uncertainty and visuals rather restrained in modern conditions. However, when he finds himself in the future, it's just fun to watch. Large sets and retro sci-fi look all hard to beat. <br /> <br /> If you have a large opportunity of listening, the film is difficult to listen to. I think I understand, only 80% of the dialogue. He could have used closed captions. <br /> <br /> If you are a science fiction fan, this is one of the classics of the genre and is a must see (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until the closed caption version, and then see if you're familiar with the films of this period of time.
