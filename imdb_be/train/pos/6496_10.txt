An example of how to be made World War 2 documentary, using first hand from real military and civilians who took part in this terrible conflict, and archived footage gathered from around the time .I caught it on repeat on the History Channel about the year back-solid, not knowing in fact the second world war at the time, but it came over me, and now I find myself 2 world war II buff, watch and read any and everything I could find about it, but nothing close to this landmark document cial, definitely worth buying boxed set ............. <br /> <br /> It's pretty simple documentary production to the highest level.
