Cinderella was one of the first movies I have ever seen, and I'm forever. This is a great looking movie, with beautiful animation. My favorite scene is animated dress scene- I just love those mice. The song is also good, not as good as Snow White, but they enjoy singing, and Tchaikovsky resemble. Sleep is a desire, and so is love? honors. Symbols and pleasure. Cinderella idealistic and strong, and mice provided great comic. The stepsisters were also well done, as well as Lucifer. But I loved the best stepmother that she was in fact evil, in comparison with lots of character in the name of Fairy Godmother. It's true, the film drags a bit, with the antics of the mouse, but they were really funny, so I do not care. I do not think it's overrated, underrated you have in mind? She rarely plays on TV, but really bad sequel makes to Cinemagic on a regular basis. if you want a great adaptation of Cinderella, try the excellent Ever After, or generous Rabbits and Rosa, which is not so good. But whatever you do, avoid the continuation of which I have an error of ownership because you'll thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
