What could be more schlocky, than the idea of ​​private detectives involved with women, they should be spied on? And a big part of the dialogue, as it is written entirely banal. <br /> <br /> But the actors turn dialogue into something that makes sense. You can see the real man behind the unreal lines. And directing is excellent. Each scene is doing only what he must and ends without dragging too long. <br /> <br /> I showed it to some friends in the mid-80s, because I could not understand how such bad stuff can be done in such a good movie. Friends liked it, too.
