Freddy Krueger dream stalker from Elm Street comes back, great character actor Robert Englund is back in this sequel Nightmare 5, dream child.i hope I got correctly.there room was so much and it is one of the best, especially for Cameo Ryazanov Barr (then by Arnold) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (who made the very first nightmare 84) Alice Cooper (singer), you will see Freddy as a tortured child, a teenager who loves pain, and as a family man (creeping) effects very funny and creative, the cast also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) Breckin Meyer (road n haul) Japhet Cotto (foreigner, Live and Let Die) and Amanda Donahoe (father knows best) I was one of the people 3who saw it in 3d, well ending.i love 3d movies.i missed the first 3D-wave in 1953 (I was not yet born), the second wave was 1983.i, like all movies Freddy. this one stands out as one of the best of them, except the first, which was absolutely brilliant, Freddy has become the new monster from the 80s and 90s, as well as Jason Voorhees, Chucky, Micheal Myers & Leather face.can you imagine Me movie with all of them? I recommend this to anyone Freddy fans and horror fans alike.that Freddy up.8 such a reduction of 10.
