I did not set very high expectations for this film that left me pleasantly surprised. History is sometimes a bit strange, but overall I think it is an acceptable reliability. Scene quite nicely, and the accompanying music is used to cause a bit of patriotic feelings common to American films. This may not be the best movie ever, but it is unusual for Sweden, and I hope that I will see more of these in the future.
