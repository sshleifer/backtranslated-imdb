I watched this film by Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin '), one night back to www.afrovideo.org, and I do not see race (I'm not stupid), I recognize that the character designs are a bit crude and unaccpectable today, but I think it's satire and very, very urban retelling of the old uncle Remus stories that the black American culture, created before the main characters and the voice of a nod to "Tara Baby» and «wild rose Patch«. this is not the fanatical stories note, but cultural icons created by black Americans, and I, as a white woman, and loves to read these history. And I found it kind of interesting time capsule on black culture in Harlem, New York in the 70s <br /> <br /> Well, to get to the last of the film :. This film Live- action / animated film which begins in the direct action of a man named Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordon) rush to help his friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but stopped at the checkpoint and the wind in a shootout with police. While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to a small runaway dads (Scatman Crothers), as he begins to tell the story of his brother Randy animated rabbit, the young newcomer to the big city, which quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of Harlem; You know, for me, rabbit, bear and fox are animals versions Randy, Sampson and Preacherman. Abstract stylized juxtaposition of animation and live-action shots, the film is a satire graphics and condemns the stereotypes prevalent in the 70th years ?? racial, ethnic and otherwise <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is another good movie Bakshi. and we need to embrace films like this under the rug? do not pretend that they never exist? Hmmm ... I think I would be ashamed; I think we need to watch these movies entacted, and learn about what is going on then, how far we have come since then.
