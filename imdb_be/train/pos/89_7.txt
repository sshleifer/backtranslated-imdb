Honestly, I had no idea what this movie was about when I started. Here's how I look at movies, if possible. Many of conception. I thought it would be a film about the Stoners in the woods or something. I was wrong, sort of. <br /> <br /> Loaded was kind of boring at first, but as soon as he started to get going it really hooked me. I know that feeling of being sucked into something dangerous, where you feel helpless, but to do what you do not want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how this film was silly and implausible, but I beg to differ, These things happen. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in an imaginary world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situation "implausible." Really sorry, but the reality of the world is that they happen. The creator of the film, as well as the actors did a great job drawing, how things can just go bad, and how people can make a very bad choice. Sometimes things are good, sometimes they turn out to be bad, and this kind of life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film.
