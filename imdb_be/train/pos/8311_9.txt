I really liked this movie, it was good, and the actors were great! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many other classical singers, very good at his job, if you see it in the musical film, you know that it will be good! I would suggest that people watch this heart warming, sad, and a special film if they want to learn more about Richard! Excellent! Fresh!
