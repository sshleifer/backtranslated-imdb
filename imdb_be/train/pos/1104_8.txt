The film begins with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) told the story of how his best friend - to make this client - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are densely packed in a small New York apartment, with not enough closet space too small bathrooms. If Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, Advertising Exec Jim falls in love with (or falls on!) Ad for the house. After he bought the house, bills and frustration perched incessantly, like everything that can go wrong with the building "dream home" Jim goes wrong. <br /> <br /> One of the three co-operation between Grant and Loy, this is a great comedy - not too heavy, with no real big message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. Laughter there from the beginning, when the alarm goes off, and Jim tries to close it, only to be thwarted at every step Muriel. Timing and delivery of comedy lines and situations can be given only a couple of experienced professionals, and that's exactly what Grant and L allow us: polished presentation, simple chemistry, and lots of fun. Myrna Loy in a rather thankless role (it is obvious that the character of Jim Grant gets the lion's share of lines and actions, and Grant, as always, pull both off with a perfect aplomb), but it gives Muriel color, life and bite that only Myrna Loy It can give a character. Melvyn Douglas plays a crooked game to perfection, and never hitting a false note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes is to be determined, if the Bill becomes locked in the "pantry", and Jim goes to "save" him ... only to all trapped inside! Every little problem that pops up for the project of reconstruction of Blandings - in the number of petty jealousy and advertising campaign for "booze" - seems to bring together all that * could * go wrong with building a new home, but makes it believable and enjoyable hours, 8 / 10
