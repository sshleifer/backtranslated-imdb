Leslie Charteris series of novels about the adventures of a little shaded Simon Templar ( "The Saint") was delivered to the screen at the end of 1930 and the next George Sanders as Templar. It was a zealous choice - Sanders usually will play the villain with occasional "good rolesÂ» (ffoliott foreign UNDER, the title character in the country of Uncle Harry, framed "best friend" Robert Montgomery RAGE IN HEAVEN) is his willingness to bend the rules and break the law. briefly up to his "heavy person", while his good looks and friendly demeanor made Templar seizures shadow hero as Chester Morris "Boston Black", and (to some extent), Peter Laurie in "Mr. Moto". <br /> <br /> The films are not better than a series of detective films series - but they are serviceable. As Holmes Rathbone series or series in Oland Chan shows the actors were often repeated the role or play a new (anti-heroine in the film is played by Wendy Barry, who will appear in the second film in the series). That, and a little familiar to movie sets make a series of user-friendly experience for viewers who hear the hum of dialogue (always shows braininess Sanders in preserving one step ahead of the bad guys), not noticing the obvious shortcomings of the plot. All these secrets are defective due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can not avoid repeating the same ideas over and over again. <br /> <br /> That's the moment when it happened, when one of the actors admitted his love for Barry, which she has long been known. Soon after, he is trying to protect her from the police. But as the movie, it was a question of the identity of a criminal mastermind, it became clear that this man was made a little generous to merit being a mysterious mastermind (ie scenario, disguised him as the least likely suspect). <br /> <br /> Barry after evidence that her father (who died in prison) was framing the real culprit in the robbery gang. She has several people who help her - mugs, William Gargan - and she gets advice from confused mastermind planning robberies, which can not be pinned on it. DA who got her father convicted (Jerome Cowan) is going to get Barry and her gang. The only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case, Jonathan Hale, who shading Sanders, but are reluctant to work with him. <br /> <br /> In the cast there are some interesting moments in the script - Haley (now on a special diet) tempted to eat the rich lobster dinner made for Sanders Willie Best. He gets severe indigestion, as a result, allowing Sanders Barry Sanders flee the apartment. The best is to remind him (if he feels better) to go to the place, Sanders told him to go at a certain time. <br /> <br /> There is also an interesting role Gilbert Emery. Usually play decent people (eg, eyebrows beat her husband in between two worlds), he plays a prominent social wimp here -., Whose death recalls that of the character in the film Bogart <br /> <br /> In general, a well-made film in the second half billing movie house in 1939 will amuse you even if he does not remain in your memories.
