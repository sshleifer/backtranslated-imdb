I got this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I waited for him heavily when he arrived. My worst fears that he will be a lot of thinking, and ... well, you know, that all the screaming fan girls talking about? GACKTnHYDE = HAWT yaoi love? This kind of thing? Fearing it. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly watchable, even if filming and music makes it feel like someone is going to break out a pair of nun-chucks every two scenes, i act was pretty good on the part of Gackt. Hyde, being, um, Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic nature of each member / gangs that anyone who saw him on the stage, can hardly be surprised. He's one of my two main BIF with the film itself. But the rest of the cast (including children-actors in the first scene) were very good at doing what they DID, which is basically a bullet in and yelled at. But my second problem was very small when dealing with goriness. It seemed too suspense-horror me- how each scene where someone is shot they either and a sharp decline, sincerely dead or lying bubbling for quite a long time. But Sho ... just take shots, several times, keels over, bubbles LEE while he says, and makes the Hyde Creek. In general, if you're a fan of any of the actors, or just a fan J-film, it is definitely worth a look.
