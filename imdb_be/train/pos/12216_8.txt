The film only enter into a movie in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after it's official release, and after many illegal DVD, found its way to the public. Apparently, the popularity of illegal DVD drive lead to the production of the theater, with the audience still comes to watch. <br /> <br /> The film is a great epic, bringing Japanese culture to your home in a way that goes. At the time, the humorist, the story is told about the theater writer who writes history for his theater as a regular Kabuki plays something he finds sad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the audience may be a little confused about which stories we are going, but if the story unfolds, we see that love between a man and a human female demon leads to a great story for the new Kabuki theater n ' play. <br /> <br /> viewers left in the dark if it is a story that is supposed to actually happen in the Japanese traditions and mythology, but that does not matter. <br /> <br /> By the way the story is told with love for the theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy, making this a great ride on a roller coaster of Japanese cinema, and theater. <br /> <br /> Let yourself go all the way, when you see this film, try to see it. in the movie, and not on the TV screen at home <br /> <br /> One of the critical point, though: the soundtrack is sometimes a bit annoying. While most of these great music, there are several points in the film, which I think they should have selected some of the more dramatic music. But, perhaps, the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose to light moments of music.
