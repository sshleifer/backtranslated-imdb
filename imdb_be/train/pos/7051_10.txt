Let me start by saying that «War, Inc» not everybody's cup of tea. It is, however, a very pleasant (and gets you thinking - "Oh, shit"). The comedy film involved is not clear at all -. It is quite thin (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning, etc.), and it changes with twists and turns the plot <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm the only one, but I will not compare it with the «Grosse Point Blank», because, otherwise John Cusack -. I would not say that it was "strange "or" brilliant "- but he was a good on the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible in its line supplier and comedic timing -. despite the fact that it is hardly in the film (I would say the same thing about Ben Kingsley) <br /> <br />. Marisa Tomei plays a convincing reporter, and was able to pull it out. Hilary Duff is very flattering for her role as the Central Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. Development Duffy as an actress in the film very much, and it does a very good job (although her accent a little unrealistic). <br /> <br /> as a whole, the film, which I would call "interesting", it has no particular storyline, and it's quite silly at times, but it has a subtle message. I'd say it's worth a look.
