I took a 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew for the weekend and found myself completely entertained. Firstly, it was clean, and I mean by my standards. Most of the movies nowadays children Full crude toilet humor and crude jokes, with find a cheap laugh from the pre-teen crowd. Nancy Drew is smarter than, however, and the humor is subtle and clever. <br /> <br /> The main role is played with a refreshing vivaciousness Emma Roberts, who perky and polite, never becomes irritable. In contrast, The Brady Bunch Movie, where anachronistic character mocked and ridiculed, the style of Nancy will be treated with respect and dignity. This is a great moment when the "style-conscious» LA girls have Paris Hilton Streetwalker outfit dismissed owned boutiques, while Nancy, her fine loafers and home Butterick pattern dress embrace. The film side, we-need-to-enlighten-this-girl-Hals useful so many Hollywood movies to take. Nancy remains true to itself and its values ​​everywhere. <br /> <br /> The mystery just busy enough at times to be interesting. There were a few tense moments where my daughter nervously grabbed my hand, but there was no gratuitous scenes of shock. All this is based on the tension and mood and a lot of fun. The supporting cast is good, especially Marshall Bell as awful watchman. There are some great cameos Eddie Jemison, Chris Cattani and Bruce Willis and many of the points that will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a higher valuation than some of them gave him. Not only that, I am glad that not to be dragged into another computer animated feature film, where talking animals burp and pass gas all over the place, but I was also very entertaining. If I was there without a child, I would still I enjoyed the movie. This is one DVD, which will be my daughter's name on it under the Christmas tree.
