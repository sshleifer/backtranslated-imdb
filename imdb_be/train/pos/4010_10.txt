In my view, this is still one of the best image of Superman on television, as well as one of the most loyal to a specific period of comics. <br /> <br /> This series just like in the films Superman of '70s /' 80s and 'Superman comic book series "reset" one thousand nine hundred eighty-six forward ( "Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "the Action Comics" "The Adventures of Superman," etc.). The cost of opening and titles were stirring on the basis of scores of John Williams from the movies, action series is updated on Saturday morning. Wolfman, one of the main contributions to the comics reboot (the author of "Adventures of Superman") was the perfect choice to take part in this animated series. In general, the series was a more mature feel, while continuing to be very beneficial for the child. <br /> <br /> Superman was presented as a credible, strong and emblematic. His recurring nemesis Lex Luthor was in his megalomania / CEO incarnation. Symbols Daily Planet Lois, Jimmy and Perry portrayed well. One of my favorite performances was on Wonder Woman, and the story revolves around her home island of Themyscira ( «Paradise Island»). And its design and that her mother Hippolyta were in line with the similar series rebooted Wonder Woman comic book era, and it seemed as equally well done animated series could have been developed for it, when treated the same. <, Br /> <br /> The only thing that's hard to believe that it has not been released on DVD / Blu-Ray! He deserves to be.
