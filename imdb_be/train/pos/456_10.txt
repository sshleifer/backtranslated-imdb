This is a wonderful, spirit-restoring films. By using the actual house that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write a novel in the 1920's in the inspired casting, every choice was absolutely right! The quiet joy of this film is not stale after repeated views. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright, seems to have been born to play this part! I would really like to see Enchanted April released on DVD in widescreen format.
