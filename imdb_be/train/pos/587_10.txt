One of the things about the film, which has a string of summer heart that dry fly fishing was a big part of the scene. Sometimes spend their times of dry fly fishing, tying their own flies, and accompanied by my brother and my father, we spend a day on one river or the other tries to seduce ever elusive trout to rise up and take a fly that was offered to them. <br /> <br /> When we were instances, as any differences between us are gone, and all of the pressures of the world faded glory come to replace in their activities and surroundings is where we were. <br /> <br /> This is one of the amazing things that are reflected in my film, as a minister, and his two sons, Norman and Pauly who conducted the ritual. Because there is something ritualistic about fly-fishing, as there is something of a ritual many games. You can not just start casting your line and hope for the best. You have to tune in to a place where you are, you have to scan the surface of the water, taking into account, as it flows, and where the best point can be to make a fly and, depending on your skill level, you can even get your fly to land there long enough for the fish to take note of it and strike. "The art of fly fishing" was directed and presented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists. <br /> <br /> name for the film can be more accurately selected, the river actually perform over the life of the father and two sons. This film, however, distributed wider than the family and community in the state of Montana, on the Blackfoot River, where the film is played. It has the ability to attract you to enthrall you to grab you, like family history, community and time unfolds. The story told not only to heredity, but the history of life. That can be classified as the "River of Life"
