It is a rounded character of the title role of the film, that of the police ripped his past and on the path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique for its time, 1950. <br /> <br /> However, pursuing music and good written story, the film is a prime example of film noir at its best. Close-up of eyes Dana reveals anguish inside, Karl Malden stands out as his boss, who does not tolerate anything extra, but also has compassion for those under his command in the polling station. <br /> <br /> Preminger made this type of film is only about his own. If there is any fault, it would be with the breath taking beauty of Gene Tierney, who seems strangely absurd hardened cop. Their scene in the cafe, but wonderful and rings true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in a cameo in her father's ideal Gary Merrill as the hood. Excellent lighting and mood setting. The building in which the affairs of mortals take place high in the atmosphere, I love the old woman in a basement. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10.
