When I watched this movie for the first time, he was stuck a copy, and the name was / is Caged Terror. I still own band, and I confess that I watched it several times from beginning to end! The film is very low budget and dialogue are often unintentionally funny! I got some of my friends to watch it and we had some great laughs from a terrible script. The film belongs to the couple, (remember that this is the beginning of the '70s, so they are just too hip people!) Who go to a weekend trip to the fact that I think was supposed to be in upstate New York. They have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating fish, and the girl is mourning the death of fish and they eat it! The guy comes back with something stupid about how they ate fish, and now it was part of them, and he goes; "And it's a wonderful man!" The heavy man, very hard! LOL! Anyway, along came a couple of Vietnam vets, one of which plays the flute, I think. (In any case, they are musical rock!) The guys obviously attracted to the girl and, if the couple prove unfriendly, they eventually terrorized them during the night. CAGED guy ends up in the henhouse, and had to watch as his girlfriend being raped by two guys. In fact, by the end of the night, it seems to be pretty into it, and when morning comes, guys leave and the girl and the guy can go free. Supposedly the guy got a lesson on how to treat people, and the girl's smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh! He could never, in any case, to entertain me! If I could find it on DVD and replace old tape copy, I actually buy it again, this is a classic camp! You have to love this stuff!
