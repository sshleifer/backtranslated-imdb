Pecker's funny funny yet twisted film about a small town in Baltimore, whose daily, humdrum routine disrupted Packer, a young photographer who takes pictures of "real things." Not so good-looking models, not great men, just hard to live. This remarkable film ridicules plasticness urban art circuit. There is one particular scene where a homeless woman, shopping in a thrift store PECKER mom buys the exact same coat as one of the artistic Whitney addicts only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. It just goes to show you that no matter how much money you have, you might not always have a taste. Once again John Waters sends you into the endless spiral of laughter and crude reality. You can have your mainstream Hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities, but give me "Pecker" or (another great John Waters film) "hairspray" over the "Titanic" or Anyday "Godzilla" !!
