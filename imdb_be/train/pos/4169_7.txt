Yes, it was a bit low budget, but this film shows the love! The only bad thing about it was that you can say, the budget for this film will not compare with the «Waterworld», and although the plot was good, the film is never tapped into its full potential! Strong performances from all the uncertainty and makes it worth a look on a rainy night.
