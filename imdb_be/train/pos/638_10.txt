For those who might think this show is not for them, please give it a try. Television network has degenerated into a show that clones or clones based reality show with the participation of some people are often unrealistic. This show is a return to family-oriented TV, where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons, learning what real friends and family are, and maybe even learn a little about our national pastime. Sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in the entertainment business today, and it is perfectly cast as the young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictional New York Empires (great name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, and Uinningey Kirstny Brown completed the main cast, and all of them are exceptional. It deserves a chance to catch the show and be seen. I hope that it will stick around for a few seasons, and we can watch Pete Young (Sumpter in character) to learn and grow.
