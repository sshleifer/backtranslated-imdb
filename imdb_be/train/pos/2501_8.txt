I'm a fan of both the actors / singers, especially Gackt and when I first discovered this film and watch the trailer, I just think it's stupid one.After the long waiting, I watched it last, and here is my comment ... <br /> <br /> I think everyone knows the story and not to think about it, instead of my first applause go to action, as a rule, Japanese movies did not get shiny and acting.Yet in MoonChild around the cast is just perfectly and hit him, especially Gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes are pretty good, I, like many of his scenes as the drama and humor them, as well as for HYDE part of his acting is good, but he deliberately left in the background, as an actor, respectively, as does his character, for movie.I not like some kinematic Count particularly light and some of the colors, but because of the small budget, it still has brilliant moments, but the real gem of the film story.It has some moments of cheese, but that's normal for me, and the friendship theme of the film is very well developed and touching at the time history on the other hand indicates the cruel world in which there is no life and are not guaranteed with some memorable scenes of death, she reflects on this topic visuals.An Interestingly aside, this movie has some similarities with a beautiful vampire with a vampire movie Interwiew as also plays the most beautiful (not beautiful, beautiful) actors of American cinema, in fact, Moon Child somehow you can see how the brother and Interwiew, but the source of this problem own.Only MoonChild is it's a little slow sometimes, I'm Japanese fan film, and I'm used to it, but it does not change MoonChild has some unnecessary scenes or characters.But all in all, this movie is really good and is a very emotional time for the actors / singers duet I hope to see their other films in the future, and I recommend it to anyone who likes vampire action, scientific and papules rnyya and romance movies 8/10
