I know of only one other film that could compete with the Discovery Night and it Bergman; s Persons. Both films are simply amazing, they have a wealth of ideas difficult to understand at first glance. We have a profound reflection on the relationship of art and life as an actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), manifests itself more in connection with the character she plays on stage than she'd like. Accidental death of one of his admirers, a young girl who declares his love to Myrtle, and she was then hit by a car, leaving a deep imprint on the actress. She begins to ask himself the question, related to its aging, it begins to influence her until the only solution is often to alcohol. But it does not help much and Myrtle is one step from complete madness. The scene where she kills the imaginary (or not), the spirit of the dead is one of the most exciting scenes that I found in Cassavets film. The film ends showing genius on behalf of the director as he films the theater scene, where he and Gene Rowlands improvise the scene as Myrtle comes too drunk to premiere clearly fulfill its role. This scene was filmed spontaneously, with a live audience, the laughter is real, and the chemistry between Casavates Rowlands absolutely strange. If you like Persona or are interested in a film that offers essential ideas along with great entertainment this film fit just fine.
