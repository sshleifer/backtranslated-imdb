Angry boy who tragically lost their parents take care of his grandfather. Together they find a common language in the Gaelic folk tales that have been passed orally from one generation to the islanders. Although tragic episodes such as the Highland Clearances, a feature in the history, there is a surprising amount of humor and fun in them. It's all filmed in Skye, so a double dose of beauty. Mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it's a rare chance to hear Gaelic spoken. I in English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic, however fine. We play only what you would expect from a carefully selected nonprofessional actors - in other words, you are looking at the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. Gaelic community, especially on the Isle of Skye, there are numerous small miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk stories, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism and social justice should go and see this movie.
