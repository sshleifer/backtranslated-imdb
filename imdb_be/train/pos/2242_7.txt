Partly because of the perceived need one feels to turn an ordinary love story in the story to make the film more popular until the 1950 film publicity. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some outrageously funny characterization of high-end officials working in the Ministry of Foreign affairs --- English pillory that only the British can pillory themselves. But after that, the film loses its way in the usual farcical plot. Terry-Thomas watchable, as always, but a lot of talent in the cast (Peter Sellers, etc.) mostly wasted. <br /> <br /> deflected, but not a great film.
