As far as I know, the real guy that plays the main actor saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal, I agree with him. This is a fantastic film about a gifted boy / man with a particular part of the body, helping him. Oscar and BAFTA winning and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis plays Christy Browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor in a wheelchair and a portable his family. He has a special left foot, though, he can write to him, to draw him and keep things from him. He learns to speak later in the film, it's very good for a person like him. Also starring: Home Alone 2 Oscar winning and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs Brown and BAFTA winning Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director for Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, screenplay based on material from another medium and the best film, he was nominated for BAFTAs for best film, best makeup and best adapted screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on the 100 greatest movie stars, he was number 20 on the 50-'s Greatest British actors, he was number 9 on the best British actors, and he was number 15 on the greatest actor in the world, and the film was number 28 on the 50 the biggest British films. Excellent!
