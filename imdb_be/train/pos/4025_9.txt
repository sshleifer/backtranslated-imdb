Superb. At first I thought that, given the propensity of Amrita Pritam communist and nationalist tendencies in the film Dr. Dwivedi will be more open than the novel, but when I read the novel, I was surprised to find that it was the other way around. <br /> <br /> Prestigiousness Marit Pritam for entirely pseudo-c and Dr Dwivedi be objective. This film touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way. The victim of any war women were told some poet, and this film embodies it. It is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche, because they can not resist their captors girls or Hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his cat. On the other hand, it also shows the economic angle, lying in the wall or in fact, why the girls were kidnapped in the first place. I think that the kidnappers believed that the abduction of girls, they become the legal owners of the houses and, thus, a new government. not be able to ask them to return home. That apart one must salute the courage of the heroes of Puro and her Bhabhi are two simple village girls inconsiderate of the world and everytihng risk trying to return after disgraced. Because there are many documented cases where such women were not accepted by their families in India. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that it takes a woman to understand the pain of other women.
