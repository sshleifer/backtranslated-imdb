If it was possible to drive away the heart and soul of the sport - no, clean lifestyle - surfing in its ideal form, this film did it. This documentary shows the life of not only the waves, but it is more about the people, the pioneers, and modern avant-garde, which push the envelope a large wave further than ever. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - virtual legend in my early 80s skateboarding days as a teenager SoCal - edited bales shares amazing interviews and shots up to its essence and created something that is not just a documentary, a masterpiece of the genre. When his heart and soul in the object - it is clear that here - his genius is rich in pure vision, not to exaggerate, confusion, or sentimental its subject. He appreciates surfers and surfing / beach lifestyle, but do not whitewash it either. There is a sandy reality of sports as well. <br /> <br /> There is so much that can be said about this documentary, about the surfer, the early history of the sport, and wild big wave surfer profiles is, Greg Noll, the first big wave of people who perhaps for the first time in the sport ; Jeff Carter, a strange guy who was driving almost single-handedly for 15 years on an extremely dangerous surf Maverick's big Northern California; ., And the central part of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, big wave surfing to date Messiah <br /> <br /> There is a huge heart and warmth among all these guys - and a few girls that are shown on camera - and deep and strong love for surfing and the ocean, which comes through every word. I found the story of how the adoptive father met him and Hamilton Hamilton like a small 4- or 5-year-old boy almost forced him to be his father was especially touching (and, again, stripped of sentimentality thick). <br /> <br /> If you like surfing - or even if you do not - it's a great documentary that you need to watch, if only because you are a student form or someone who just appreciates the incredibly well-done work of art.
