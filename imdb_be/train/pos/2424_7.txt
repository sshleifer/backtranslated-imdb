Three thugs get them only after the desert to spend your life in greed, drugs, egos and bad relationships. An interesting and well done; this style of movie always makes me wonder where the reality ends and the view takes. Despite the fact that these people were the dregs of the earth, I still found myself feeling sorry for them. They never stood much of a chance.
