After all the crap that Hollywood (and the Indies) have churned, we finally get a movie that delivers some strange moments. There are some clich√©d moments, but I'm not sure that this is possible in our time to make a completely original film. There's not much new here ... it's just well done. <br /> <br /> Be sure and notice how "thin" scares come quickly and often. This is not a movie to watch while you eat pizza. <br /> <br /> There's a very well written such a maneuver in this film, and, unfortunately, a very bad casting roles. Cheri Christian just do not make effective Julie (wife / mother). On the one hand, it is entirely unsympathetic. I know, I know ... she's just been through a traumatic experience. But the audience will never know how it is "normal" is, and the relationship between her and her husband pretty disappointing (involuntary way). I think that the director had in mind for us to have some sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> And finally, thumbs up to an ending that is both disturbing and satisfying. It would be easy to reduce the cost of a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits, but the director wisely resisted. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece any means, but it's good old-fashioned horror movie ... that is quite rare nowadays.
