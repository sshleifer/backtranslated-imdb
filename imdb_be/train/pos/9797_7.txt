Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman is the latest animated chat video / DVD film will be released. (Minor spoilers ahead) The plot revolves around a new crimefighter, in Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for any reason, to stop a large shipment of weapons. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is quite interesting, it's not as good as "The Mask of Phantasm,» «Sub-Zero," or "Return of the Joker. The main reason is that the thing does not produce the emotional appeal of the other films did. at the end of the film, we do not really feel sorry for those who, as we have done in other, especially, «Sub-Zero. There's a real tragedy, which made the other animated movies specially for us. Even Batwoman is in fact, not "tragic" character (as Mr. Freeze or Phantom were). not only that, but the alter ego Batwoman seems incredibly "cruel hell "and dull, that the audience does not really care what happened to her that made her wear a mask or what happens to it at the end, and this is the main reason we do not get this special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I found the film enjoyable it does have its moments, such as when the viewer finds out who really Batwoman and see the old villain returns, which was last seen in the original «Batman:. the Animated Series ». The action is also very nice with some very tense moment. <br /> <br /> If the background Batwoman was more interesting, this movie would have been better than "The Return of the Joker" in my book, but as of now, it is 4 (out of 4). <br /> <br / > regards animation, it's just like the cartoon the New Batman adventures mid to late 1990s. the price is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated films Batman, but it's still good, though. <br / > <br /> I recommend buying this DVD, because, despite its shortcomings, it's nice. But just remember, it's not as good as other Batman animated films. <br /> <br /> 7 / 10
