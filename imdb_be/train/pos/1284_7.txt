I watched the nurse as part of BCI Eclipse "Drive-In Cult Classics (with the image of the Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think it's a very good film. <br /> <br /> This film packs a lot of history in a very short period of time. Do you have a hippie, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexy absurd, blackmail and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> leading actors makes reliable operation. And I found fantastically woven story to be believable and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the supporting cast, especially bikers, supplies stilted performance, especially when asked to put a line with more than just a few words, they may have used the real biker, not an actor. Several characters, in particular, were extremely plausible. <br /> <br /> The score absolutely correct, for a time, pace, and to move the story forward. I found the music a real pleasure. I noticed in the opening credits of the film showed the music of Â«The Food," I Google them; but could not find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey, who wrote, produced and starred in the film liked the idea so much (with wayward married brought to maturity through trials and tribulations, as well as a bit of help - of course) that he wrote, produced and starred in "weekend with a babysitter."
