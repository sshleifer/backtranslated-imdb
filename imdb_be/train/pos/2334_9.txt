Pushing Daisies is indeed a landmark in television as an art form. Everyone seems to give credit to Amelie and Tim Burton, but that, in a world where fresh ideas clearly rare, this show will ensure that you do not care about fresh or him or not. It's just brilliant. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated from the beginning, clever written form, directing to the background and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece as The Shield and the wire (normally not very good comparison, but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that he has no comparisons on TV). <br /> <br /> Really addictive and absolute pleasure. Perhaps, as one of the tarts Piemakers, receiving specified in such painful ways.
