"Hollywood North" is a euphemism with the film industry, as they went to Canada to make a movie because of tax incentives and cheaper in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case, and later in Vancouver. Peter OBrayno, the director must have seen many invaders from California, this movie seems to be the right way to deal with individuals trying to come to benefit from the economy that Canada had submitted. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "The moon lantern", a successful novel written by Canadian authors are transformed into "The flight to Bogota," which has nothing to do with the original film. Large been selfish, were Michael Baytes, who will receive what is happening in Iran, offered the lead part, which is a disaster. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be saying that too many cooks spoil the broth, which seems to be the case with the final product, which saved his producer, Bobby Myers. With Sandy Ryan, who has been around the creation of a documentary filmed in Toronto, the film turn into a cohesive film finally. <br /> <br /> filming oars, and acting, in general, is good.
