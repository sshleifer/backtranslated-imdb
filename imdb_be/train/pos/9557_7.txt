I love this anime! I laughed my head off all the jokes and violence (mostly reluctant, but quick-tempered "bride" Ranma ruler) as farce but Ranma is really worthy of him, but he tried his best to make amends ... sloppy. The protagonist of Ranma goes to China to teach only get in the damn Jusenkkyo spring and turns into a girl when splashed with cold water. Since then, it's pure chaos one after the other. Among the stand outs are deranged brother and sister duo Kuhn and Kodachi, sexy shampoo pervert Happosai just causing trouble for our hero / heroine. However, this is a selfish father Ranma Genma that end being guilty clutter much of the time. If someone wants to anime, this is ridiculous, this is one. It is nicer and better duplicate the Japanese.
