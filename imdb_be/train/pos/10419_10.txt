I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza, s was the best voice of God had to offer, if only he could find the courage to go for broke on vacation Hollywood and head of the opera, he might be the American Caruso everyone says that it could be, but either way, he is a fantastic introduction to the art form not bones about it, and if the path it is going to be the way it is. watch a movie, you'll see why Mr. Lanza still come in the discussion even in my house. Someone says that I say Pavarotti MARIO LANZA.As for the film itself, if it is on DVD, they should be able to recover it and VHS is not good enough, but it should be only Lanza movie put on DVD the other down right bad and sad.
