For the film, which was a bit of advertising, and few people have heard about, it was pretty good. This is another one of those modern British crime movies, brisk ( «Snatch», «Sexy Beast", etc.). This is not the wild as «Snatch», but it is interesting and it has some rough characters <br /> <br /> He also has a few trite and predictable ending, but at the beginning of the show. - not later - have some neat twists that make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. Basically, it is a low-key British man who sends the ball to the Russian "Brides", which was, with the help of two Russian male friends to provide some big surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and very well, like Vincent Cassel and Mathieu Kassovitz as the Russian Kidman cohort. It's a different kind of film and worked well. Kidman once again proves that it is much more than just a pretty face.
