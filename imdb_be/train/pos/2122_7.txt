Back in the day of the big studio system, it was made darndest foundry solutions. Olden all American James Stewart appears in Hungarian in the shop around the corner. If I were casting the film, part of the Kralik would be ideal for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would be nothing. Stewart's part of the same problem in Mortal Storm also Sallavano. <br /> <br /> Sallavan his most frequent leading lady on screen, he made four films with her. But this one, where any one of them dies. Sullavan and her husband, Leland Hayward Stewart knew back in the day when he fights a player in New York. In fact Sullavan husband was a good friend Stewart Henry Fonda then. <br /> <br /> I think that only Clark Gable was able to pull to be an American in the cast nya-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart Death Storm was German, but all the other players were American, and so nothing stood out. <br /> <br /> But if you can take Stewart, than you will see a thin film with Ernesto Lubitsch. The plot is quite simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest Sun arrange personally. But it seems that they have corresponded with some anonymous supporters rendered to each other. Also, an employer suspects Frank Morgan Stewart kanoodling wrong with his wife. <br /> <br /> While the findings wonderful and Frank Morgan departs from his usual self Puzzled, the two players who come off best are Felix and Bressart Shildkraet. Bressart has their favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very little. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, which is always good, just wonderful as officious worm, which is constantly kissing to Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I know too much like Schildkraut in real life, who are in the office, politics 24 hours a day. Sadly, it pays a good deal of time.
