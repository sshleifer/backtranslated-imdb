All those who voted at least 5, obviously, not lovers of pure, insincere humor. Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his works. This is not a blockbuster, more than the life of a business. This campy, slapstick humor played some of the best (and very diverse) actors in Hollywood. Piscopo equally at around an upper dogs wannabee, once. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a funny attempt did not actually swears never filmed, you have to see Dimitri do your part as a Morone. <, Br /> <br /> I gave it a 7.
