I finally saw this movie tonight after renting it at Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that it is wildly original. So, perhaps, the characters have not been fully implemented, but it is not one of those movies. Most likely, we were treated to the director's eyes, his vision of what the story is about. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I do not want it to. I believe that Sabu was supposed to have an impact on the director's "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "the Run, Lola, RunÂ». But I absolutely loved how the three wires to see a beautiful woman on the street, to distract them for a moment. I really need to see the other works of this director, because this movie really intrigued me. If you want to understand the culture, Sturm und Drang, go somewhere else. If you want a laugh, camera movement and criminal fun here.
