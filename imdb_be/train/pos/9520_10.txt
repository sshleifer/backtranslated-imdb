This is a beautiful film. A true story about the relationship between father and son. This, of course, Tom Hanks at its best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this film. He usually has a good role of Man. But in this film, it comes off in this movie as a little rough, but still does not come out smelling like a rose, even until the very last scene, the murder of his character. Acting this film was well together. I also love the part when there is complete silence when Tom Hanks' character shoots and kills all the men in the group, Mr. Rooney. There is something terrible, and yet there is no sound of the deep in this scene, just emotion. I love the look on John Rooney, the face of the character Paul Newman, when he realizes, even before seeing it, that Tom Hanks' character to take revenge, and he knows that his destiny has come. The first time I saw this film, I was blown away and knew that I had to go out and get a video, and I have since adding it to your collection of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this film has a special place in me.
