This show is so far away. At first, all in the cast of Eric to Fez, they were all the new actors, new faces, and just to see what they have done. They are stuck in the show, and it was a success. Its one of the best shows ever made, and it's probably the funniest sitcom I have ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it end, but when they finish the show, I pray to God that the series finale comes with one of the biggest bangs that every season finale ever had. I do not care if the entire season sucks, because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Go down swinging, obtain the latest blow in. The show deserves, the fans deserve it, when they go, let everyone know it's going to end up like one, and let be a huge finale. I say get Donna and Eric got married, I say, there is Hyde and Kelso again to fight and become friends, I say, there is something interesting happens between Fez and Jackie because Fez trying for so long, but, of course, it will not work for him. Close JUST SERIES BIG TIME GUYS! <br /> <br /> That 70s Show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I want you guys as friends. You're the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
