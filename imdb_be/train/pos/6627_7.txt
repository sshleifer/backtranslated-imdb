A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow ?? If you are a fan of any of them, then it will be well worth checking out. <br /> <br /> French animated project "Renaissance" took seven years to do on a shoestring budget, and today I finally see it for a private showing for the International Film Festival in Stockholm. May spontaneous reaction of awe; further my reflection "so neat" and more in-depth analysis, unfortunately, it receives a resounding "meh." This is a wonderful science fiction triumph on the surface but scratch or poke him a little bit and it too complicated plot becomes blatantly obvious as flat characters. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that people in Onyx films do something exciting with the aforementioned surface. Visually stunning. They used live motion capture activities inserted in the key frame of the animation, with stunning jet-black and bright white contrasts and heavily shaded rotoscoped background. For those of you who are not down with the "technical jargon", the film looks like a fully animated Sin City. Smooth, clear, dark and stylized pattern complemented by large ominous lightning. That vision. However, much credit is also associated with a crunchy sound effects that take the form of futuristic weapons singing, music, wake-heavy drops of rain, and shards of glass are broken. It's wet dream of every Tech-nerd ... <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a terribly lit, bleak, futurescape Paris, where a large corporation under the name of «Avalon» started to weave in the lives of citizens with the observation (I think, for liquids transparent screens of minority report) and genetic engineering. This leads to the mysterious abduction of a young researcher Ilona (voiced great Romola Garai). Cut to our hard-boiled cop-on-suspension and Karas hero (Daniel Craig) ?? the person who takes the law into his own hands ?? which is assigned the case of travel and extraction Ilona. At the same time, he currently contributes to Illona sister with whom he begins an affair. Very incomplete love, so to speak. <br /> <br /> World Renaissance fine. Director Christian Volkman takes a fair stab at melting noir theme and the result of the urban jungle filled with cads, rats, Fatal Beauty and lonely detective who hide in the shadows of the shabby slums. The problem lies in the fact that the creators, of course, felt the need to have a very clear and in old archetypes in history, or the film would be "very surreal" to a wider audience, thanks to its ominous animation format. From this it follows that we have a lot of clichéd characters such as evil villains laughing, unkempt and criminal Butch tough chicks that blow smoke every chance they get. He puts noir in our faces, and it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> What's worse is that the dialogue is a little unnatural. It seems that there is every line for the sole reason that the projectile plot. This is nothing fatal, because the plot is so difficult when he gets going, it needs some precise direction. Daniel Craig helps here, bringing a no-nonsense attitude to his uncompromising nature of the police. At some point in the Renaissance, he saw bright car-chase, which is undoubtedly one of the most adrenaline and higher expression of the film sequences. Unfortunately, the novelty of the science fiction visual already worn off post this car in pursuit and «Renassaince» can benefit from a little shorter. In general, it is very interesting, but flawed experience futuristic comic book. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
