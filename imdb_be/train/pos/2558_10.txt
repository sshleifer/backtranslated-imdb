I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We are still together. <br /> <br /> However, in the 1950s, he would never have been so easy. <br /> <br /> Life in the army have been mined for action, drama and comedy for many years up to this point. Mined to death. Mixed relationships have given him a new ground to cover. It's old hat now, but then ...? Marry Asian then meant that you either owe someone something, or you're a freak of some sort. This affected both possibilities together with the third. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando did his usual good job. Garner did a better job than he usually does. It is good, but it showed how good he can be. Umecki Chan was a debut too here, and while I think she got her statuette, she is not really a stretch. It was a role that no one who had not been abroad, would not be recognized and the novelty was an extraordinary man. <br /> <br /> The real thief red keys scene. Red was the best thing in the movie. Bank on it. And Japanese lifestyles have been shown in the light of the excellent as well. <br /> <br /> A classic.
