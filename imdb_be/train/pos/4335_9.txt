Oscar-caliber performance of Peter Falk in the Oscar-caliber create roles. I loved the nuances balanced study of the long-standing marriage - how often do we get that in the film, where the film usually ends when the boy and girl together? This is a film for adults, sophisticated look through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - each adapted to each other in the past, and grow throughout history. In addition, he gave me about 10 large belly laugh, and I'm one of those people who usually sits, if not ridiculous to the rest of the audience laugh. It was one of the few truly funny movies that I've seen. Great, original jokes.
