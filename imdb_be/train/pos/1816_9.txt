A lot of reviews on this page, note that this film a little dark for children. It depends on the child. This is not a film for 2-6 year olds; it is more oriented to 8 years of age and older crowd. I saw this film when I was 10, I absolutely loved it. While most animated movies were a little too childish for my taste. This film deals with the more serious problems, and therefore has a bit more emotional impact. In this film, the characters can die and be sent to hell! This gives a little more emotional weight in the scenes where the characters are risking their lives. The good guys are not always very nice and beautiful (like other cartoons). They have a "real" motivation is revenge, and greed, but also compassion and friendship; It shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> A great movie
