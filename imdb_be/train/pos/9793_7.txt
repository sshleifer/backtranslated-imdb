I give this film 7 of 10, because the thieves were interested in their roles and unknown Batwoman creates an interesting "Guess Who" game. The film, however, needs more Robin in it. He appeared in the film in the early and sporadically throughout the rest. I always thought that the new animated series did little justice tagged with the new Robin character, not to mention the Nightwing. This movie just keeps this bad tradition. The film spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his novel, which would not be so bad in a movie, when the novel was not so incredible. It is still a good movie, if you're a fan of Batman, and I would recommend watching it.
