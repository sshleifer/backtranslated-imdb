The only reason I give this movie 8 out of 10 because there are a few films, in my opinion, perfect. This little B picture of a tight story, well told. I've always been intrigued by Alexander Knox, but I saw very little of his films. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and without an ounce of remorse. Performance is one of the most frightening performances I've ever seen. From World War 2, the actors who played the evil Nazi or other types of tapes were sometimes nominated for an Oscar. I believe that, as it was done during the war, the Academy felt honoring performance, as it would be like a celebration of evil. But Knox contains this performance - a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he did not think that there is nothing to make others suffer. I still can not get over it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays hazelnuts gallows or a social butterfly, cast against type, probably the best performance I've ever seen her, too yielding. Maybe not Oscar worthy, but the best of her career. Nothing against it; I enjoyed it in the "small" role is often played. But here she proves that she is up to the task heavier drama. <br /> <br /> If you are a history of human dramas, or stories about the fate of those who suffered from the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend this beautiful little film.
