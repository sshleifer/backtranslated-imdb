Some of the comments here on IMDb equate dogs dog bites to the classic Cat III films of the 90s, but, despite this, no doubt, ferocious, frenetic and very dark, this film with SOA-Soi Cheang not very sleazy, lurid or sensational enough to make this comparison. Nevertheless, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a look, especially if you sand, uncompromising action is your thing. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays Pang, Cambodia You are a person who travels to Hong Kong to kill the wife of a judge; Sam Lee Wai, a ruthless police officer who decided to find him at all costs. With Wai closing in on its goal, Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape ??, until he meets Yue, quite illegal, who needs his help to escape her life of abuse. <br /> <br /> relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography, amazing sound design, a haunting score, and solid performances by Chen and Lee (as well as the novice Pei Pei, as the love interest in Pang) dog bite dog friend for fans of hard Shot Asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of Vengeance trilogy Chan Wook Park's). Scabies, shootings, beatings merciless: all occur regularly in this film and catch safely director Cheang <br /> <br /> Of course, this kind of story, which is designed to have an unhappy ending for all involved. and of course, pretty much everything in this film dies (and ugly death). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in his last moments, the dog is bitten by a dog crosses it: in a ridiculously over-dramatic final scene, Pang Wai and locked in combat, as a pregnant Yue looks at. In the end, after all three of them were seriously stabbed during the scandal, wounded Pang performs DIY Ceasarean on the (now dead) Yue, bringing their child, moments before he dies himself. <br /> <br /> While this film may not be a "classic" piece of Hong Kong surplus, with its delirious OTT action and stylish visuals, this is all it is worth looking for.
