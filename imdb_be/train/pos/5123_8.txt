Unmarried, twenty-something provincial (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and went to Houston, where he learns about life and love in a Texas honky-tonk. At face value, this is a modern love story ... Texas style. There's also a lot of cowboy hats, pickups, beer neon signs, as well as links to the big belt buckles and Rodeo. Music, if not born in Texas, Texas adapted affectionately talents Mickey Gill, Johnny Lee and the Charlie Daniels Band. And Texas strumming ... «y'all». <br /> <br /> The story and characters are as thin as the taste of the Texas five-alarm chili made with Jalapeno peppers. That's enough to make a civilized audience to interrupt the film in favor of a noble classic, starring Laurence Olivier and Ingrid Bergman, can be. "Hamlet" is not. But «Urban Cowboy» is sharp and clear, and I kind of like it. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the film is generally good. Dialogue, production design, costumes and all realistic; edit proficiently. And as casting and action is laudable, if not Oscar worthy. I would not cast Travolta in the role he plays, but he does an excellent job ... Ditto Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson, among others, as well, in a supporting role. But, film has been noticed. A copy of the movie I watched was grainy, and sometimes suffered from a reddish / orange hue, visual signs I saw in other films of the same period of time. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the film does not seem to offer any social or political "message". But I would say that when the «Urban Cowboy» was released twenty-five years ago, she had a very prophetic implications. In 1980, the US had all sorts of problems, not least of all, who are American hostages, Iran. In the minds of many people at the time that the US pushed around, bullied. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others of his time, suggested that the Americans would like to see in their political leaders. .. toughness. «Urban Cowboy» very physical film. Characters in it may not be the brightest people on Earth. But they are cruel! <br /> <br /> All of the "Urban Cowboy" is an anti-intellectual. As a vehicle for the transmission of culture then this 1980 film was one of the few who predicted a new get-tough era for the United States began in 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan. And this era continues to this day, with the president, who probably will not be remembered for his intelligence, but will be remembered for his strength and aggression traits that Americans seem to be committed to the same as the Texans five alarm pepper chili.
