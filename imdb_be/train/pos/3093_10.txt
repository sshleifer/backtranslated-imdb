Why not give the manufacturers showing the chance of all the junk on TV, why not give manufacturers a chance to Six Degrees? Series will go on video? I would like to see how it ends. Placed one season on video and sell it. I was a staunch supporter of the sixth degree, and waited for this comeback. I put a tape recorder on all shows. Thank God for that. I just found out that the show was canceled, and I was heart broken. I wish I knew that it would be canceled, then why did not they tell us? I thought that the show is just developing some depth in the characters. The letter was also pretty good. Steven (Campbell Scott) my all time favorite. I'm sorry to see it go!
