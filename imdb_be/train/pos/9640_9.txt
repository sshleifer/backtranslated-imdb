Most Hollywood movies are not able to capture the full range of experience of teenagers. This film shows exactly how to do it right. It combines elements of humor, pain, rebellion, etc. so that is Comlex and responsive. Ending may be a little clearer, but the fact that the director is not written in advance for all of you, before coming to a conclusion, means that this film suggests a more intelligent spectator.
