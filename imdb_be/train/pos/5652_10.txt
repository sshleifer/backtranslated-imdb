I love the series! Many of the stereotypes that show how Southerrners Hicks is very obvious, but such people do exist too often. Image of the southern state of rings too sure, as well, but sensitive characters reminds one of the many good things about the South as well. Some things never change, and we can see the "good old boy" every day! There is Lucas Buck in every Southern town, which only has to make a phone call to make things happen, and "white trash sandwiches" in the collection of short stories are all too familiar. In addition to supernatural elements, the rest may well happen in the modern south! I think that somehow Trinity, SC, should be in Barnwell County!
