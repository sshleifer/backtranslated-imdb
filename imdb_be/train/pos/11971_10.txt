I think the comments about the show to be a bit of cheese too exaggerated. If a person comes to watch a TV show, what did he look out for? This is to enjoy what he watches the show, if he / she is not a criticism or a person who examines the history. But most of us do not watch the show, and to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is the perfect show to watch after a hard day at the office / school. It makes you laugh, and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> So, Tanner family is a great family, very hypothetical families. If any such a family existed in the real world, it would be a role model for us to follow. But it's a TV show, not a real family, and there's nothing wrong with showing a hypothetical family on television. The fact that the show may not work for so long, shows us that people enjoyed watching it, no matter what the comments later. <br /> <br /> Another good point about the show is that any person of any age, not just enjoy watching it, but it would return the message, but a child, that message will be. Negotiations those Jessie Michelle is very touching, if you do not think of him as a child. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say, after watching each show Full House, there is harmony in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.
