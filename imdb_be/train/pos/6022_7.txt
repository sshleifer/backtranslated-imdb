Often incorrectly Zabriskie Point is a political film by Antonioni, the American film by Antonioni. Stylistically, the suit after «Blow-Up», which means that the pace faster than the previous epic, though certainly no less peculiar. <br /> <br /> In general, a common mistake is not that the film glorifies the hippie generation. This is not so. <br /> <br /> The two main hero comes from a completely different environment. Mark with a "rebellious" young people Daria from corporations real estate agencies. But in the true fashion Antonioni, both alienated, both trying to escape their surroundings. Mark leaves a meeting of rebel students and black panthers disappointed verbose rhetoric, while Daria continues to be uneasy to go with her car. <br /> <br /> Antionioni, the master director, after drawing Rebel youth as entangled and small, and then moves to the city. Medium is saturated with corporatism, billboard advertisements, meaninglessness, which should continue to expand to accommodate this expansion of the population, making a profit at the same time. It is this environment that the two main characters break out, though, it seems to be mainly from the accident. <br /> <br /> In fact, if Darya stopped in a small village on the outskirts of the desert, the environment as well as pants, and the people as well as things played, best illustrated by the old boxing champion, now reduced to shadows of themselves sitting around drinking and smoking and talking nonsense. Stunning melancholy sequence, even more powerful with the inclusion of some half wild children who live around, brought in some "benefactor" and "destruction of this piece of American history." In the not too obscure symbolism is believed Antonioni hippies. Only half a positive view on the canvas of human alienation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the desert, the landscape used to devastating effect, alternately clear and terrible, primitive, wild and dead. The sequence in which the two main characters love, "join" in the fantasy "flower" generation represents a similar sequence in "Red Desert" where Julian tells the story of her son. This colorful interval as a colorless landscape. Bright fantasy in reality half choking. <br /> <br /> The ending, probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in cinema, western civilization torn to pieces. Catharsis, exorcism. <br /> <br Antionioni /> two "international" films (British «Blow-Up» and the American "Zabriskie Point") is less effort than previous masterpieces, but this is mainly due to the faster pace and inevitably contrived setting (swinging London flower-power of America). But when it comes to this, it is clear that he has not lost the edge.
