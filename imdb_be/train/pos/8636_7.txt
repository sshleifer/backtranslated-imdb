So imagine thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who will join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a trip to the west. The last pair investigates the murder of well-known sites for the future of the book; Pete serial killer on the run (unbeknownst to Dave) and his poor Juliette, nya-all-there partner. It's a good cast and the story moves forward, but Pete entirely belivably scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his earlier roles. The best thing here Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her role in `Homicide:. Life on the Street" or in short series `WonderlandÂ» <br /> <br /> Vote: 6
