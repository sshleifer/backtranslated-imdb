The main problem that I see in this film is its assessment that screams with every note, "This is a cheap ass film." There's not much more to say here. Price just sucks. <br /> <br /> The second problem, which I see as very serious, since it involves the unwinding of the plot towards the end of the film (one of the money shots, if you will), is a dialogue between Martha (Barbie ) and sunflower man (Richard occupied), which in March revealed to be the leader of the experiment. At all times during the dialogue, the viewer understands that he / she listens to the dialogue of the film. In other words, the suspension of disbelief cleaves here. The integrity of true dialogue between two people is sacrificed for perforce stuffing information filmmakers would like to convey to the audience. <br /> <br /> The third problem was the casting of Barbie. Although I truly believe that it was a fantastic actress in her work, I feel that this part may be too much of a stretch. The essence of her work, it seemed, there was no variety of network through which the character moves through the film from a loving family Worried mother almost Rambo as a woman on a mission. This aspect of the script, obviously, was a stretch for any actress, and one can not put too much wine, so when Barbeau. To the extent that it is quite well-acted her part, however, I call it only moderately serious problem for the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film did a great job in the first half of the creep factor of the building, especially during his horror flash. I feel that the film would have won more of adherence to these outbreaks as a mechanism to prevent the creep factor fizzling in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> So my integral part of this graduation? I would give it a solid C + to B-, depending on how much credit you are likely to pay a manufacturer for the production of this film on a limited budget. Even two heavy and two moderately serious problem, the film is based on the hard site Jungian the Nazi mysticism. I do not see any problems with the development of the plot or consistency; dialogue with the noted exception of the above, is quite brilliant in places, especially all important trapezoidal scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the film; As already mentioned, the creep ratio was well processed if fizzly bit in the second half; and Nicholas Brendon, who is also associated production, staged a wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is definitely worth a look --- see it you like a Nazi. :)
