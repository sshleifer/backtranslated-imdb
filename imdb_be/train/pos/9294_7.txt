Before I begin, I should point out that I know, the editor of the film. We've never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (those things which were to a bulletin board), and we talked on the phone, so that I have a bias here. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's ironic how while «Rat Pack» culture of the late 50's and early to mid-60s made a comeback in the mid 90- ies, this film from the son of one of the original Rat Pack, and which was made in the same way, it was a failure. Not only that, it was a critical failure; I believe that Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who is not of this Savage (he gave it a mixed review, as I recall). And although I do not think this is the biggest film in the world, and I am not a supporter of Rat Pack, or "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth a look. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it looks stylish and is moving straight ahead. On the other hand, the main characteristics of all good. Richard Dreyfuss surprisingly restrained here as the main gangster returning from the hospital, and has the advantage amusing thereto. Jeff Goldblum goes back to quietly ironic speech he gave in his pre-action days, as the Big Chill. And while Ellen Barkin only requires that the vamp in the film, it makes it exciting. However, this is not a great film; dialogue mostly consists of puns, and many of them do not work (as well as all «Zen Ben" speech). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan terrible here. Nevertheless, I have a good time, and if you like gangster movies, you can be too.
