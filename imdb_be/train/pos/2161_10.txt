How many of us would like, so we can throw the social and cultural commitment and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Shall we dance? this is not a movie about dancing. It is about the study of ourselves, recognizing that we are looking for in life and have the courage to go in search of him. Mr. Sugiyama is an elderly member of Japanese society, where ballroom dancing regarded as inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day Mr. Sugiyama sees a pretty girl, leaning out of windows dancing Acadamy. he was fascinated by it and eventually signs up for dance lessons. He was ashamed of his dance and fear of ridicule. It hides the fact that it is present dance classes from their colleagues and family members. <br /> <br /> There is a funny scene in mensroom office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, partner, who also dances, interrupted by practicing some dance steps. There are many other fun and heartfelt scenes. <br /> <br /> ending is not a fairy tale, but it leaves a feeling of good spectator. <br /> <br /> This film helped me understand the Japanese language a little better people. It is a warm and very worth of film to see.
