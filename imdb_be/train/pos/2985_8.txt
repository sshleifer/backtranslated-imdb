The whole point of doing this film, one of the earliest and best international cinematic color versions of the opera, was to make it more affordable for the masses. And it turned out perfectly in this. The general public will not sit at the love story of two young lovers in exotic ancient Egypt, when he plays a typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with vocal technique to sing nice music correctly. Thus, the visual replacement beautiful principal (young Lauren, beautiful Della Marra and fitting Mr. Maxwell), which makes the story much more likely to give, who are not familiar with the plot or the music more likely to be looked after in a beautiful aria, which otherwise It can not be. In general, a magical introduction to one of the great works of Verdi. I remember when I was in high school, and it is, of course, aroused my interest in opera form, with which I was not very familiar. I still think this film lovingly and would recommend it highly for those who can appreciate the beautiful music accompanied by a better-than-average visuals. Luciano Della dream was outstanding Radames, and unfortunately for the audience did not appear in other films.
