"Protocol" is a B-picture with Miss Goldie Hawn as a bubbly waitress who saves the life of one night visiting Arab encroachments. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity, and gets a new job, which works for the US government. Will the corridors of power in the capital of our country, will ever be the same? Hawn is excellent, as usual, even if the "Protocol" is not as funny as it is the best movie «Private Benjamin». But it's still a good movie, and I laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
