I look forward to each new episode, each re-start looking! The new look of science fiction created by Stargate SG-1 wonder that I hope will never end. In order to combine the past with the future new twist, which fascinates me. Season # 9 must be a thrill in itself. I want to Richard Dean Anderson will appear more frequently in the new season, how I love him dry wit, as his hysterical in his character, Jack O'Neill. Other characters add their own unique show, which makes it a winner, season after season. You cancel this program over the next three years, and you're making a serious mistake. In addition, you need more role in Asgard - they are just too cool.
