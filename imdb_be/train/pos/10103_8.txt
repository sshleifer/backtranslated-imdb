I've spent years looking for a copy of the film (16mm, DVD, VCR), so I could show it to your children. The film is funny, and Spike and the members of his group showed why they were the best musicians in the business. They had to be that good at playing that crazy. I like it and recommend it to movie lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film is about the turn of the century fire, with a crew of misfits that fire department and the group (if you do not fight fires). There's the usual running gag, plus Mayhem Spike Jones and his orchestra. In addition, the comedy relief is provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and straight man, Hugh O'Brien.
