«Bend It Like Beckham» is a movie that has received very little exposure here in the United States. This was probably due to the fact that the film was very British in the dialogue and vocabulary and doing a lot of football (soccer here), that some of them may have problems relating to the US is also sad, because this film with ' It is absolutely fantastic and deserves much more coverage here. I think the plot (from sleep), is that many people can relate to, and in the end, «Bend It Like Beckham» is a good sense of the film to a source of inspiration and a really good acting. I was not too excited to see this film originally, but now I wish I'd seen it before. I highly recommend this movie!
