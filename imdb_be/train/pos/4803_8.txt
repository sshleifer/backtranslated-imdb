It's hard to find just the bad historical drama based on the life of any number of British monarchs. Just a well-respected British or Australian actor, to make it look beautiful, and you are guaranteed success formula Oscar. <br /> <br /> The Young Victoria is no exception, receiving almost all well cinematography amazing and beautiful, soft lighting and beautiful colors and fabrics. Starring Emily Blunt as it can finally float in the film starts from the 18th day of Victoria's birth and moves through the intrigues and problems that surround it ultimately leads to the throne and her famous marriage with Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) . As a young Victoria yourself lamenting that she moved like a chess pawn, the different sides as she finds her footing and her voice, as one of the UK's most influential leaders. <br /> <br /> While it is moving around the chess board is fairly typical of the area is the development of Victoria's relationship with Albert, that makes the film a little more interesting. I confess: I have a degree in history with a specialization in the Victorian era, so I'm a little attached to these figures. Despite numerous disadvantages, as the leaders, the Victoria and Albert were among the first leaders dedicated to improving the civilization for your people. They left a legacy in the arts, public health and education, as well as conservative and funeral culture of Victoria after Albert's death. But these things only briefly hinted at during the movie. <br /> <br /> It's pretty well known that the Victoria and Albert is not only madly in love, but kept the level of respect for each other, usually seen between monarchs in marriages. Even if this is really happening behind the scenes, they were certainly one of the most famous. Blunt and Friend, and has just the right kind of chemistry to make the famous couple of justice, the right combination of restraint and despair. This is another love, as a rule, are not displayed on the screen, especially in this kind of film. This is good to finally see a relationship in which the man and woman on a level playing field. <br /> <br /> But we did not get to see that love is enough. Despite the fact that the filmmakers are trying to cram the matter among the political attributes, this is not to build up the kind of momentum needed to maintain the high voltage. In addition, without going into more advanced an important public work couples, all feel a little bit in limbo, not superficial intimate, and sometimes confusing. It's not such a big problem during the film, but then, the effects wear off rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you have just seen, in spite of the improved performances retracted, most notably Blunt, which captures even the expression of the famous monarch. <br /> <br /> for as much as he tries, Victoria is a success on many levels, but lacks that certain spark that would take him from a solid state into a classic.
