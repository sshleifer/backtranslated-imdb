Anyway, this film manages to be crisp, bitter and touching at the same time. Shalhoub stars as (with Providence) to bring this story to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see life frantic up and down through the most innocent eyes imaginable :. Bird <br /> <br /> Paulie begins its life as a child of the parrot little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl) with a speech impediment. While she will learn to speak correctly, so does Paulie. However, unlike most birds, it can speak and understand all the words. Military father does not love a bird, so he goes to the shop and bought the aging artist, Ivy. It teaches his style, etc., while traveling across the country to find the owner of Poli. The film continues with a few twists of fate, until Paulie ends up in the laboratory, where he eventually tucked away in the basement, and found Russian custodian who touched the bird story. the story under a simple, metaphorical theme, that language is a gift and a curse. I would say that the soundtrack is strange. Beautiful mixture flute, digital databases, and the horn of an increase of the film to the point of pure ecstasy. Sweeping camera angles and breathtaking landscapes adorn the story even more. And as a final note, the puppet plausible. (Unlike the Star Wars where Yoda reminds Mappaet) This film is one of my favorite movies, with the added comment that my wonderful parrot recently died four years. Overall, I give this movie **** out of four stars, two thumbs up and a big hug.
