Verhoeven film was a full and complete garbage. He is a disgusting hack director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he had read part 2 of the book, got bored and decided to make it all from scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would have never supported that trash if he were alive to see this. It is basically stealing the name of the book satirizes politics (which is a good part of it), and throws in some T & A, so that the average American moviegoer idiot does not get bored. <br /> <br /> This anime ISN Â»t perfect, but it is at least substantially exactly as far as I can tell.
