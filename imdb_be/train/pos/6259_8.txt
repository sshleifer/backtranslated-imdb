I'm really outraged commentary I read that the film was "boring" and the beautiful landscape was marred by black-and-white photography. This was done in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely incredible time for him! <br /> <br /> The way that these people had to go through this absolutely wonderful. It took them a week just to cross the river. Women carrying the child in heavy wooden frames, on the back, standing up stiff letter of rock, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I would like to see someone do it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great movie with some truly amazing shots and incredible history.
