Kalifornia film about lost ideals. Journey through dark road, ever. The road of no return. The plot is about a couple sets out to find a better life in California. Man (David Duchovny in his best role so far) wants to write a book about famous crimes that happened in America and his girlfriend - who the photographer - are going to take pictures. Thus, they teach on the trail of the famous murders, not knowing what awaits them on the way. In order to share the costs in the way they decided to find another pair, and they put ads. But the couple, who answers it is not just a couple. This is one of the most amazing couples ever. Girl naive, fragile creature who dreams a lot and loves cacti. The man is just the opposite. Hard ruthless killer. We know that at the beginning of the film, and we follow him on the road to Kalifornia (not from the C, as usual, but with K, apparently symbolizing the word killer), as well as its path of betrayal, murder, and finally, win. All wires, spiritual, Pete Lewis and Forbes give very good performances, and you have to take into account that if the film was made not even one of them was the star. Pictures amazing with darkness covering the largest part of the movie and the music fit the dark nature of the film. In general this is a very good movie. Do not miss it. You think again before taking some stranger in the car to divide gas from!
