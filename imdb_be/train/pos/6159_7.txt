It is a place in England in 1940, three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). She does not want them, but are reluctant to accept them. It seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Magic. (OK - I understand that this is a family film, but - College witchcraft ??? Come on !!) Before she could finish the course, although the college is closed because of the war (???), and it seeks to head down Professor Brown (David Tomlinson). Both she and the children are traveling around on a bed with magical bedknob. <br /> <br /> I first saw it when I was 9 and vaguely remember loving it. He sure does not stand as an adult! History stupid (even to the imagination), children are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) incredibly unpleasant. As Roddy McDowall is the third score and only appears in two short scenes! There's also a trip to the island Naboombu, which is run by animated animals. I thought it might be interesting, but the animation is bad (for Disney), and it has a very rapid and too long a football match between the animals. There are a few saving graces here: Lansbury and Tomlinson just fine; song (while the forgotten) pleasant; long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy, and the Oscar-winning special effects are still pretty big in the end. But a weak storyline, bad animation and nasty kids really pull this one down. I heard that the enhanced version is even worse! I can only give it 7.
