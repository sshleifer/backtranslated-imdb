I've always been a big fan of Sybil Shepperd, ever since I saw her series a few years ago !! This film certainly shows her in a better light !! The film was so perfectly cast and played !! Again and again she falls a bit funny lines, just to make this film one of the best I have ever seen !! It's really out does himself !! Especially Robert Downey Jr. and Sybil Shepperd, they really made the film come true !! Also, I loved the bit where Mavis loses her wig, and she almost dies when he falls to the floor !! This is a film in the best !!
