So Mary and Rhoda have grown old - who has not? I was a teenager, when Mary's prime minister, and the "young adults", when he left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, and so, perhaps, the film could not stand the original comedy series, but it was enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make it a tribute. Example: a producer who hires Maria and then dictates the idea for a new series of ". Older men" Is not that typical of the mentality of modern Hollywood television and movie "bean counters?" That can not be Mary Tyler Moore Show in the best case - but it's a damn good look back at one of the best shows we grew up in the 70s.
