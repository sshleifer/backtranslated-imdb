Lunokhod film Fantasy Music Michael Jackson looks with different segments. I will evaluate each segment individually. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the film with a music video. Music video by Michael Jackson concert performs the song "Man in the Mirror" music video, and show the installation of historical figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King, John Lennon and many more. The first segment was a good choice to open the film I a beautiful song, and also loved the assembly of historical figures. I even loved the message of the song. I give the first segment of 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows the installation of the start of Michael Jackson from the Jackson Five to his solo career. Assembly I thought it was well done, I liked the animation they put into it, and I also liked their selection of songs such as "I am, I want you to come back, bi,'s Thriller, you can feel it as you make me feel. "The only thing I wish they could do a little better in one of the songs in the installation is" We are the world. " The reason why this is all that you see the rain drops and these images of Michael Jackson and the chorus of celebrities, but it's a little hard to see the choir. In addition, the segment is still good. I give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 song Bad. You probably think this is Michael Jackson's clip is bad, well, yes and no. This segment is a video clip, but it redone Kids. Segment was nice, but it was not as good as in other segments. I give it 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 Claymation short musical film, which takes place after a poor version of the baby is called «Speed ​​Demon». Short of Michael Jackson chases his beloved fans and the press, and he disguises himself as a rabbit on a motorcycle and rides to try to get away from them. Claymation chasing sequence was great, but some of the characters in the movie Claymation looked a little fake, when they interact with real people. Also at the end of the clip out of the blue bunny costume Michael Jackson comes to life, and he dances with her. I loved to dance, but it was like out of nowhere. I give it a 8/10 <br /> <br /> The segment 5 Michael Jackson Grammy winning music video "Leave me alone." Music Video of the media poking his nose into the personal life of Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson he feels that they will not leave it alone, no matter how much he proved innocent. Music video actually speaks (but keep in mind that this has happened to child molestation is just all about the rumors about it in the 80s.) But I do not think that this video should be in this film, because it children, cinema and I do not think the kid will understand that he is singing about. I give this clip 8/10 <br /> <br /> The segment 6 leads us to the main story of a film titled «Smooth Criminal». Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers wishing star as a figure of the crime, to protect children (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) from an evil bandit by the name g-BigG (played by Joe Pesci). Segment I thought that really brought the film, especially when he danced and sang the song «Smooth Criminal» with a bunch of criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The strange thing is why the segment of children hanging out with an adult, he never explained why. Also, a character says Joe Pesci on drugs and that he plans to do with them. I mean, why would you talk about drugs in the children's film. Other wise it is good. My evaluation of this segment is 8-10 <br /> <br /> 7 segment is the last segment of the film. The end of the film with Michael Jackson singing a cover version of the song on the Beatle in «Come Together», and then for a loan, we see Michael Jackson sing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael did a good cover of «Come Together" and I think it's a good idea to put in including a talented group of musicians good singer like him. My rating 9/10 <br /> <br /> This film is a good film, Michael Jackson I I think that it actually produces children's Imagination's. film is almost the same as figuratively the Beatles animated film «Yellow Submarine», if you like Michael Jackson and you to the movie with a lot of creativity is a movie. My Overall rating for this movie 8 / 10
