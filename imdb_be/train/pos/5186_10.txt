I was glad to finally see the release of Amazing Stories first season on DVD. I forgot that such a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series. For a long time the only way you have to see this wonderful series was from VHS 2 or 3 collections episode or when Sci-Fi will be re-run episodes. However, if the Sci-Fi will make reruns, they usually adhere to the same episodes. There were some great episodes in the first season as The Mission, that they are not repeated. Does anyone know exactly how long the series ran? He says that by 1987 on top of 1985 here on IMDb, but I thought it was running more than two years. If you loved the Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, and Outer Limits, you'll love this series, and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
