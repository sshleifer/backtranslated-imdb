As we all know, the romantic comedy genre with the ending is already known. Two wires should always come together. At the end of the third act, I was trying to figure out how it will wrap up and how they will end up together. The key was given at the beginning, but you will never understand it until the end. This is a simple hook, but it works. It had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground, but takes a new spin, if ever possible. I liked all the characters NY, and I loved the place. This is a postcard of New York City. In addition, it was nice to watch the movie and did not find anything offensive in it. Thus, if you want a good old fashion romantic movie ... then this is for you.
