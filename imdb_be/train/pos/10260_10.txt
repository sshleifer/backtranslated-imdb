The first installment of the notorious horror series is a woman kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men, torturing her for several days before finally killing her.She brutally beaten, he turned in his chair without end, have her nails pulled, animal intestines thrown at her hot boiling water poured on it, and finally, her eyeball pierced by a needle (actually sick and the opposite scene) .The creators of these memorable torture show tried to make it as realistic and possible for me this one is closest to Snuff you m zhatse get without committing murder on tape.Of course, some special effects are pretty poor, but the idea of ​​making a snuff rather gruesome.I seen as "Flowers of Flesh and Blood" which is more bloody and sadistic, but less disturbing.Anyway, is one of the 'is a must see for horror fans!
