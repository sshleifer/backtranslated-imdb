It's a good movie, although people are not familiar with comics Modesty Blaise and books may find it a bit slow and lacking in action. Modesty fan, the film will be very pleased, especially because it is very faithful in his presentation, "history" Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell listed in the credits as "creative consultant" and the filmmakers must have really paid attention to it, how the plot should be very carefully details of which were presented in the comics over the years {although the events were recast to our days ). The only thing that the real supporter can find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in history. This lack of Willie again, just to be faithful to the chronology of Modesty Blaise, because the action of the film takes place in the first days of modesty career. Alexander stage makes it very believable young Modesty, which actually looks a lot like humility should look like. A welcome change from the parody of Monica Vitti image of modesty.
