Funk, but strictly second tier British glam rock band Strange Fruit breaks at the end of wild'n'wacky excess covered by the 70s. Individual members of the group to disperse and uncomfortable to get into the dim average age in the dim and unprecedented 90 years: a sullen keyboardist Stephen Rea completed without a penny and down on his luck, in vain, neurotic, pretentious soloist Bill Nighy tries (and not) in spending hanging solo career, paranoid drummer Timothy Spall is located in obscurity on a remote farm, so that he can avoid paying a hefty debt arrears, and sullen bassist Jimmy Nail sets the roof for life. Former loving fan asked a patient, understanding, long-suffering manager Julie Aubry gets a group together for a reckless, largely ineffective and disastrous funny twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of Europe.
