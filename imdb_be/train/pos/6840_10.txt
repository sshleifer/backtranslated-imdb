the fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. this film as a beautiful picture to enjoy. scenes museum as a good music video. apr√®s sex scene is too familiar scene throughout our adult lives. but the film will not hold any interest for me without Keith Gordon. Keith Gordon, maybe one of the most underrated actors of our time. almost everything I know about acting came, studying mainly eyes. he was the most convincing person. his character has the qualities I look for in a guy, sensitivity and devotion. Keith Gordon gorgeous. By the way, I kind of want him to shave his beard now, as his lip, chin and Adam's apple had it pretty close to the set of his eyes.
