French novelist, disgusted members of the society of his wife, is sent to North Africa for a breather. There he meets the lively and talented Bedouin girl, living in poverty. To spite his wife, who cares in the Maharaja, he decides to train and educate a girl, and present it in Parisian society as Princesse Tam Tam ... <br /> <br /> amazing Josephine Baker perfectly cast in the title role in this very French film enjoyable. With her huge eyes and infectious smile, she comes in contact with the deepest viewer immediately. Her oversized face and the joy of performance clearly make it a pure pleasure to watch. Baker makes us care about what happens to the poor Alwina during its transformation and the introduction of European manners <br /> <br /> Albert Prejean is doing very well as Pygmalion in Galatians Baker. Georges is also effective as a servant baked mestizo, and Jean Galland as a mysterious maharaja. <br /> <br /> The film is very beautiful and well done, looking a bit like a Busby Berkeley films produced in the same time in America - although unlike American films of this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM is no racism. It should be noted that there was no office or Hays production code in France. Some of the dialogue and action rather provocatively, but we must admit that Baker singing and dancing "Under African Skies," as well as the culmination of its performances in a Paris nightclub, are two of the most memorable moments of cinema. <, Br /> <br /> The actual location shooting in Tunisia, significantly increases the film. <br /> <br /> Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in 1906, into a poor family. Her talent and driving ambition, however, was soon pushed her on the move to the east, and it was briefly acting with the Ziegfeld Follies. Realizing that the United States in the mid-1920s are the big constraints for gifted black woman, she was able to pull myself to Paris, where she eventually joined the Folies Bergere & Le NÃ¨gre Revue. The French love it, and it became a huge celebrity. A brief return to America in 1935 showed that Baker did not change a thing for African-Americans. She returned to France, became a citizen of France, and worked for the resistance in the first days of the war. Baker moved to Morocco for the period and entertained Allied troops stationed there. <br /> <br /> After the war, Baker's fortunes began to slide, and she faced a lot of financial and personal difficulties. For a while it was even banned from returning to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted the offer from the Princess Grace of Monaco in the Principality. Josephine Baker was on the verge of returning, when she died of a stroke in 1975 at the age of 68. <br /> <br /> Appearing only two decent films - ZOUZOU and PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure. But it deserves its place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich and Robson, as one of the truly legendary artists of his generation.
