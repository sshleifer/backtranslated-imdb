This film is just so good! Despite Carmen Electra, this should be one of the best films I've seen in awhile. Jamie Kennedy is just amazing, and Loren Dean plays the insane spoiled movie star very well. The plot is great as well. It's all very real, that is scary. It says here that it's a drama, but it is one hell of funny dramas I've ever seen. Go, check it.
