I rented a movie (I do not think he's got a theatrical release here) to expect the worst. The previews made the film look awful. I was actually very surprised, it was well worth a look; it was loose script, almost as an ensemble piece of film. It was very funny moments in it, and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show, without being too caustic. This disadvantages, mostly awful soundtrack hitting "comedy" effects, but overall, it gives the impression of an honest and true to form generally shows in altmanesque or Larry Sanders Road. <br /> <br /> At the time of this fashion criticize Jerry Springer, it is also an easy target. Springer could make Citizen Kane, and it will be announced, "the worst movie ever made." I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the show. Imperfect, but an innovative and exciting piece of film.
