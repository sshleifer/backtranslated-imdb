It was incredible! Photography, editing, cinematography, music combined transport us to the danger of the tourists. It was a pleasure "slum", avoiding danger. We were there! dream sequences and a flashback sequence ending were fresh. He talked to me. Keep up the good work! Another genre that City of God. Also - do not laugh! - comedy Desperately Seeking Susan. Nice ensemble types, all with large lugs. Unfortunately, I think, Training Day corresponds to the genre as well, with fantastic performances of the ensemble cast. I had to switch over to some of the rough sequences, but all-in-all, a great movie!
