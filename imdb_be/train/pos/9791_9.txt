I will not give anything further, describing the plot of this movie, other than to say that it starts with the return to Israel of a young blind woman, a close friend and companion has just committed suicide. He unfolds like a detective story, like a blind woman trying to figure out why her friend ended his life. As it conducts its investigation and the information is collected, it will inevitably lead to devastating conclusions. The film was able to develop and action, especially as the waist of Sharon Ya'ara, blind woman, fine. Israeli film definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, though few of them have found a large audience in the United States
