This mockery of horror movies, 50-Cold War paranoia, the era of Reagan's America and high school movies, Adam Arkin plays Tony, star defender High full moon in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) to travel to communist Romania, and while he lost in the street one night, he was bitten by a werewolf. When he returns to the US, he can not control his animalistic desires and goes on killing spree. Frustrated, he flees from the city. Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to the city and re-registration in the Lyceum. He still can not control their transformation and citizen, and his friend, to understand that he was not quite human. All of this culminates in a large school football game. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be one of those "so bad it's good" movies in the early 80s. But I was surprised that the film was actually legitimately funny. Actors including Kenneth Mars as a pervert coach, Roz Kelly in a strong former flame Tony, Demond Wilson as a bus driver, and Alan Arkin as an eccentric doctor, struggling with hilarious results. <br /> <br /> while watching this movie, I was struck by how similar letters and humor were «Family Guy». «Full Moon High» is the same as anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously.
