The show was great, it was not only for children, I thought that at first, and for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was mostly about the father looks after the two daughters and a son, he unfortunately died in season 2, I could believe it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I'm dressed they were with the show, like what really happens in real life, and I have to mention farewell episode it was so well done, it must be so difficult for them to take it off, you could say that they were real tears in their eyes. I am a 24-year-old, and this episode even make me cry me, I know how they feel, how my father died when I was 13 years old, too, just like Roy. <br /> <br /> Season 2 and Season 3 have been great comedy in the same season 3 had some of my favorites such Freaky Friday, secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think that the show was strong enough to go on, I was disappointed that it was over, it was one of the best he was not the best family sitcom since Home Improvement and it might be the closest of friends. <br /> <br /> it can never stop, but still likes to watch every day of repetitions.
