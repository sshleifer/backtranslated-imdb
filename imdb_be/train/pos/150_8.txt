The last film of Spanish director agust√≠ villaronga is the study of how children who experience violence and isolation within their remote community, developing in troubled young people who are in need of some mental tools to deal with their latent psychic weakness. Will these tools fanatical religion followed by the level of taking care of others, or simply put on the macho image while participating in male-prostitute, Villaronga create a successful study of how these defects affect the three teenagers living in Spain under Franco . Three witnesses indignant double death or their friends before they are teenagers, and then hide the emotions they are experiencing with their peers frail corpses until they meet again one more time in the hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> cinematic style of the text, as a rule, visually gorgeous as you would expect from a Spanish filmmaker and is very similar to the work of the employee Spaniard Pedro Almodovar with the themes of the struggle with sexual desire as heterosexual and homosexual. An element that is different from the two directors that Villaronga promotes supernatural shade matching with claustrophobia, gritty realism is opposed to the use of Almodovar surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> part gives an idea about the troubled young mind and contains disturbing violence and sexual content. I highly recommend watching this film, because it contains elements that remain with the audience for a significant period of time after the viewing.
