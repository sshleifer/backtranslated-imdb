I have no idea why this film is getting a bad rap so much IMDb users (Some say it was his "worst movie ever." What ?? Does anyone of you have seen Cradle 2 The Grave?) my favorite criticism that the plot is completely stupid, and simply an excuse to hang all the action sequence. Duh! What the crap did you expect from the movie Jet Li? Do you sincerely believe that someone came up with the story, then simply downloaded it from the action? Of course not! Black Mask is awesome, from wall to wall action for nearly a constantly running. It is also extremely terrible, and we get a lot of severed limbs, decapitation, and creative ways, watching the bad guy (and quite a lot of innocent people, too!) Get the slaughter. Most of the other martial arts films Lee is a nursery school, compared with Black Mask; There is no holding back on gratuitous sequences of violence, bloodshed, or actions whatsoever! And it made me happy camper. Again, if you go to the movie Jet Li is waiting for a beautiful dialogue and an intriguing storyline, you're going the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his films (though beware of monstrous dub).
