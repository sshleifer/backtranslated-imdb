This film deals with the Irish rebellion in 1920, and more specifically the life of one man, after he reports to the other bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences. Watching the film, I got the feeling that you could take the script and only some minor updates, do it again, and it is, unfortunately, still suited to contemporary events. But those remakes will not be nearly as good. Great performance Victor McLaglen (for which he deservedly won an Oscar) and an excellent ensemble cast that includes most, if not all of the actor with the shoes in Hollywood at the time, most of them well-known character actor, or set at the time, or just start . Very good movie worth seeing. Highly recommended.
