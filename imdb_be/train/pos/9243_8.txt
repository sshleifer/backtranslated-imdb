Do not listen to many caustic comments and ridiculous hats for this movie ..... just saying, with regard to the ninja movies, these are my friends, this is about as good as it gets! <br /> <br /> Yes, this is nonsense, and the script operation is admittedly absolutely brutal, but the gum - it's so bloody fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, the terrible "actions" (which in the case of the film in question is indeed among the worst I have ever had the pleasure to see!) And funny "story" actually serve only to raise the level of enjoyment tenfold. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the fight scenes are the main attraction in this, although for the most part, I am pleased to say that they are very well placed, especially the final showdown (in which we see that the sun ninja supposedly limited normal laws of gravity ....) <br /> <br /> Believe me, if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not seen Sakura Killers, then you really are missing out on something that, in my opinion, one of the real jewels in the crown of the genre.
