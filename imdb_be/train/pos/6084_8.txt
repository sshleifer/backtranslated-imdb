I was pleased with the cast of influential players. History is one thing to stand up for, even if you are at personal risk in this. At a time when violence and pain are often in the forefront of cinema, this movie focuses on an old-fashioned good cop. Although these stories were made repeatedly, these guys pull it off well. Relax and enjoy. Dennehy is a master movie capture.
