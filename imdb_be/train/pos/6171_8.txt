For those of you who have read the novel highly respected executioner, this film will definitely impress you, because, as the honorable adapt it. Except for one small story, Sturla Gunnarsson film debut is almost dead on the restoration of books (up to the last line). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have not read the novel, this film can be a bit tricky. This, of course, is not a big cinematic drama of the story. Instead, he has a strong element of realism to it, but I would not be different. The best way to describe such a long journey movie fans would say that it is a small scale, the Hindu version of "Fiddler on the Roof." Instead, Jewish / Russian milkman protagonist Gustad Noble banker in the 1970 Bombay during the war Muslim / Hindi with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his eldest son, individualist, a remote one, that gets him involved with some dirty money, and unhealthy surroundings. The ending is entirely happy one, and this is not a sad one, but it is in fact something that includes realism. <br /> <br /> Such a long way is a great little film, but if you want to see it, progress to find it. Unlike the novel, he received very little release.
