The good thing about this film is that it stands alone - you should not have to see the original. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest disadvantage. It would be good to include a few original characters in a new history, and I saw how he developed his life. Sinclair, as in the original, is excellent and provides the best films of comedy moments, as he tries to deal with clumsy and awkward situations, but the supporting cast is not as strong as the original movie. Foresight should congratulate the bold attempt to move the character, and to create an original sequel, but the film ultimately flawed and lacks warmth of the original
