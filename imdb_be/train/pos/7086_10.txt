NB: Spoilers inside. This great film "about" so many things, all of them successful: a sci-fi journey through time, unstable psychology, grim society, that is, a real syndrome, a gradual undermining of belief systems worldwide bioterrorism and emerging love story . <br /> <br /> consequences twisted story line time to stir up a load of hot debate - testifies to the discussion within the framework of this site; or, as an extreme, check dissertation on www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Phew! Such temporary accent speaks mostly with a brilliant story, based on the fine work of David authors and Jeanne peoples, not to mention the inspiration of Chris Marker «La Jetée.» Without a doubt, this is one of the most successful, exciting travel in time films ever conceived . But there are many other levels of speaking here. <br /> <br /> real genius of the film is to focus on the unpleasant side effects of time travel in the mind of James Cole (Bruce Willis, making the best work of his career here). His journey progresses from fanatical vaccines warrior hunting gradually went mad victim ?? and vice versa. Another broad scope of the story more and more emphasizes the personal history between James and Dr. Katherine Railly (excellent Madeleine Stowe). I love the simultaneous switching of transmission / opposing viewpoints of these two characters. For me, it all comes to a head at the scene of a hotel room stuff. Up to this point, James ?? once enthusiastically unwavering determination ?? Now downs full of doubts about their own reality; while Dr. Railly ?? cold and rational scientist ?? finally he becomes wildly convinced absorbing the evidence of James, his dire predictions. Her desperation to go through James and hang on a mission to show how it will come. <br /> <br /> Gil make us care about these characters, especially through a crescendo of tension multithreading their lives. The balance is held between the emotional slides and mounting sci-fi thriller puzzle / elegant. And at the airport interchange heart poundingly intense, because we see that is so clearly by James dreams. It was here, just after James decided to throw the whole mess ?? and fights with his madness more than ever ?? he takes a step back to the plate and do what is necessary for mankind. See Jose and gun ?? (Shortly before this, references to Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and switch identity / confusion of genius.) This film is between the hash-minded people; It not only keeps under repeated viewings, it demands them. "Twelve Monkeys," a smart, provocative, strange, funny and disturbing stuff. <br /> <br /> supporting cast is excellent, especially Brad Pitt stealing all his scenes and show more flexibility as Jeffrey Goines, mad and corrupted, but ever alive. And there's David Morse, Dr. Peters (interesting as the film simply leaves the viewer his evil motivation) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines. But the biggest honors belong to Terry Gilliam, surpassing here - a little - his outstanding "Brazil". (A lot of parallels, of course, especially the lone fighter is trying to avoid its collapse Wednesday :. Swoon within, without fainting) Each frame of the film has its own unique imprint and tone. The soundtrack is amazing, too. <br /> <br /> This is one of the greatest achievements of the 90s, this is my favorite, and be sure to keep for a long time.
