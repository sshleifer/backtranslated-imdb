I enjoyed the cinematic recreation of China in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. Senior male artist wants to convey his art to the young man, even though he has no children. Faces of the actors strange to see. History has shown loyalty and gratitude to those children who are good to them, and their desire to be treated well. Opera in the film reminds me of Farewell My Concubine, which was more complex and confusing. History here reminds me of Charles Dickens's days, when the children were almost moving. The plot is a bit predictable and a little too sentimental for me, but well worth the time to look for heroism, humanity and stories depicted.
