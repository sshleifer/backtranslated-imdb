This film documents the ball chain mid-eighties Harlem. Much more fun than what Palazzo Volpi, although just as sick, this movie is a real gem squalor. One can not help but sympathize with the character of their freakness. The single purpose of the intellectuals of the middle class is documented phenomena garbage and gloss. Here is the genius of garbage is very well documented and duly extolled. idolatry characters tendency of all that glamorous inspires even more love the characters themselves in the part of the viewer, creating a "phenomenon of the phenomenon" effect that makes this film a work of art.
