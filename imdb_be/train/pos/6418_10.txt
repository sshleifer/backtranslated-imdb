I loved this movie. It is a certain inspirational film. It fills you with pride. This film is worth a rental or worth buying. It should be in every home. The best film I've seen in a long time. This will make you crazy, because everyone has Brashear, but in the end it gets better. This is a story of romance, drama, action, and a lot of funny lines to keep you tuned. I love a lot of quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me on task, I want to do. This shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, they all have to do a job for him. It is a long film, but every time I look, I did not notice it until such time as it is. I get so absorbed in it that it goes so fast. I love this movie. I watch it whenever I can.
