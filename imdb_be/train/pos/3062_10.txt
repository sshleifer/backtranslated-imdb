I saw this movie a few months ago on a cable, and it was fantastic. William H. Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was simply amazing. He makes you care about his character, even if it is clearly doing the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell gives an idea that because of the doubt, the best performance I have seen the actress in this year. It is fantastic as a wild young woman wise beyond her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is just awful, like a father, Mace, John Ritter well as shrink stuck in the middle of everything that happens. <br /> <br /> I want it to be in the theater, because I feel that this is a film that should be kind to a wider audience. It's a shame, because it's a hell ALLOT better that most of the new movies coming to the theater at the moment. <br /> <br />
