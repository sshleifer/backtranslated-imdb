It's been a long time since I watched this LOTR. I'm currently hunting for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is totally faithful to the original work. Visual engrosing and sometimes obsession. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Sometimes the film confused or entangled. There are one or two times when the storyline is slowing. But, in general - buy this movie. This is great for kids, adults and collectors.
