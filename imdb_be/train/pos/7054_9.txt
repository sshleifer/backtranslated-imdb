I thought that this movie was a lot better than most critics give him credit. Although it has its own intricate part of the story, it does not much hinder the understanding of the film. That being said, if you are not open to the more liberal political ideas, then this probably is not the film for you. I thought that all the actors in the film were outstanding. Each character has its funny moments, and the audience laughed at the Tribeca Film Festival throughout this. I thought that satire was a little over one specific area, but it is done deliberately. John Cusack is right in saying that, although it is set in the future, it really makes you see now.
