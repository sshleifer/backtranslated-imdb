If you have not seen this inarticulate little caster, you should look for it. This is a story about the awkward, clumsy wartime (McMurray), which is listed 4-F every time it tries to join any branch of the military. He finds a magical lamp that, of course, contains gin (Gene Sheldon), but the genie is even more awkward than it MacMurray, sending it on time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants. It's cute, fun and pure fluff, and you can not help but like it. Areas very similar to the Disney film, in particular, as the two stars (McMurry and Sheldon) two of the many Disney movies in the 50s and 60s, but not together. Needless to say, it all ends well for all, and the audience goes, feeling pretty good.
