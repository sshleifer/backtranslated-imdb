Sitting on the front porch of his home in Burbank, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley wore exactly the same size in each item of clothing, except hats. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the largest of the stuntmen, says that every time Zorro wore his mask, he was alone on the screen <br /> <br /> It was a bit of exaggeration :. there were times that Zorro was clearly Reed Hadley, but also in the tricks we can be satisfied it was Ted to work. <br /> <br /> And what tricks! "Fighting Legion Zorro" is a witness comments here, one of the greatest series. This is interesting and generally very well done. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a great actor, and as someone else said that he did a very good FOP. <br /> <br /> But, admittedly, an action that makes this film so great. <br /> <br /> And what else could we expect from the leadership of this great team, and Whitney English, with great music with a surprisingly prolific William bench (listed here says he was titles, but it is wrong, and those and other composers are listed here were really titles, and I do not know if they did write any music - it sounds like lava), and meanness with, among other things, a large Charles King, and with dozens of bit parts? <br /> <br /> It is also worth noting was the perpetrator plays a radio Tarzan, Jim Pierce, who was in-law Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I suggest you read it a mini-bio.) <br /> <br /> There is a section of slow-depressing, but, hell, it's only a few minutes (maybe 20), and if you have to wade through it, well, you're back to the excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves a great big thank you for presenting this wonderful series, and we have to ask the TCM, to bring us more. <br /> <br /> and we have to thank all the participants that we will see him as the head games, or serial, rather than as a function of re-cut.
