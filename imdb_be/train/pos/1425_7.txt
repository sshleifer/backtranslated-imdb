Just as Al Gore shocked us with his painfully honest and skilfully presented the documentary "An Inconvenient Truth", directed by Alistair Foterzhil and Mark Linfield also remind us that it is about time to improve your lifestyle to save our beautiful planet . "Earth" is also alarm about global warming on our planet has disastrous consequences for all living beings throughout the world. Al Gore showed us the bleak future of the planet Earth, presenting hard facts backed up by documented examples, after a long time is always interesting monologues. The makers of this documentary choose a different but equally effective way to achieve this goal. They did not give us an idea of ​​the future, what will happen to our planet if we do not radically change things around, but they are likely to show us the true beauty of the planet Earth in all its wonderful glory. We see that the places that we knew that there was, but I never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide range of the most unusual places, such as abandoned desert, giant forests full of fauna and flora and icy landscapes as the eye could see. And in all these very different conditions, we see that the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is the film that was to be made, in conjunction with one of Al Gore, in order to make us realize that our planet is too valuable to intervene. Voiceover Patrick Stewart is always relaxing and so is very well done, although at first it sounded as if I was watching the X-Men movie instead! Cinematography, probably the most remarkable of this documentary. At times, that what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that the person with the camera actually had to shoot all those great shots <br /> <br /> In short. This is definitely a must-see for all because it concerns everyone on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is: I never thought that our planet was so amazingly beautiful!
