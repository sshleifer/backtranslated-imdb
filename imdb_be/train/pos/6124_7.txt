This movie is stupid as hell! I think that it was written as a serious film, but then when it came time to film, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, let's throw in some humor and spice it up!" The characters are actually developed a little, too. Oh, and the sequence of death is best. One thing I hate, though, was the hair dryer weapons. What is it?
