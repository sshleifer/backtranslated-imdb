As with this film we are going fabulously, if you always deal with the adventures of the main characters 2. But while the C + J to refuse sex girls trip back to childhood, this pair revel in their lust until the study of homoeroticism. Most of the sex they get from the provocation or unwitting partners, and yet, in spite of their behavior is not deeply-PC, all smiles looms. As the C + G, through all of these, they are not guilty of the heart, rebelling against Quotidien, bourgeois restrictive. As someone remarked that I did not want to know these two, and it's a small miracle that their trip brings scenes mostly comedies and very little tragedy (and the fact that there is that can not be laid at their door) and, so for this reason he left me beguiled, but with a sweet taste in the mouth. I dare say that only the French can get away with a movie like this. And it is part of their genius.
