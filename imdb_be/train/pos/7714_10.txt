There were a lot of '50s sci-fi movies. They were big draws for the Drive-in movie theaters. Many of them were bad even then. This film and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" stand out, both aged well in their own way. From the very beginning of his terrible theremin score (which still sounds strange, as the theremin is hardly ever used) Forbidden Planet takes you where no man has gone before. Speaking of Star Trek have so much stuff in this movie, which was in the TOS Star Trek it as a pilot for the series; from interactive captain / first mate / doctor, mad scientist, extraterrestrial beings, the baby in a short skirt, computer intelligence; all it is a prerequisite in the present, but it was the first of its kind. In addition, it has good action and well-done piece of art, which even today is a certain fear in the imagery. Consider how huge machine Krell successfully depicted with some real depth. I saw it as a child (when screwing: 0), when he was a new movie and it scared me. Of course, every film that was even remotely scary it was then, but I remember that the real worries of the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet movie sci-fi fans can watch a few times and find something new with each viewing.
