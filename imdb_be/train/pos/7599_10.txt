Before you lost everything that was shown on TV it was predictable. It is possible to predict who was going to die and who will find something, but could not predict the lost nothing. Every thing was so wonderfully stunning, and it really was not a mystery because it has so many secrets, but because there was nothing like before everything was so great. I literally become addicted to it. Losing is a classic work of art. It gives you something to look forward to every week. It's genius. Surrounding genius is calm and warm on the beach and so terrible in the jungle. Symbols brilliant every one of them, especially those that are already on the island. The Castaways so dramatically while we can not predict their death, because they have much more to do and so much more to say, and they have the secrets that affect the other shipwreck victim who die with them.
