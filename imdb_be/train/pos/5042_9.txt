Synopsis for this film does a great job in explaining what to expect. This is a very good thriller. Well shot. Hard to believe that this is the directorial debut of Bill Paxton, although some of the shots look much like the storyboards version. <br /> <br /> However, there are a few shots that really look good and show some real insight from Paxton. <br /> <br /> This is a tough story with some great twists at the end, a few of them, all true, all in good fun, and best of all, it dims well enough to make them real twist. <br /> <br /> The child actors in the film do great, too. I'm usually wary of a movie with the kids in the principal role, because they are all too often come off as rejects the Nickelodeon, but both of these kids are doing a good job. <br /> <br /> This film is not bloody. It's not very scary. But it's very, very scary.
