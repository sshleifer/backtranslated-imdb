Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War «Jacknife» came too late, or even redundant. This is one of the few who are trying to cope with the sad side of the second war time after. Unlike films as "Taxi Driver" and "Rambo", who used to represent their protagonists as non-performing heroes in poor post-war environment, the film allows the audience to face with another view of the vet Vietnam. Their development is manifested very clearly before and especially after the war. The problem is obvious, but in all this tragedy there is always a feeling some hope on the basis of love and friendship. «Jacknife» can be quiet Vietnam movie ever, but after nearly 15 years, it's really true, and justified to do so. In addition, it can make us believe that the war is not over yet; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro made one of his best works, but Ed Harris is the star of this film. Perhaps it was his best result ever.
