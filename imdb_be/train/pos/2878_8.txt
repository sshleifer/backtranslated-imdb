For quite a long time in my life, I either do not like this movie, or I liked the film, but not as much as many others. I watched it recently (for the night, oddly enough), and I liked it more than I did, because I was under 6 or something. Now I appreciate it more because I'm a few other classics of Disney, which I watched recently (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or how it is spelled). <br /> <br /> Now I really appreciate the animation, clever "Disney" plot twists, humor, mice, emotion, expression, and plot. The animation is very well done, it often seems you where the other characters, watching them. The animation is also not very good painting style backgrounds, including the city (which is listed twice briefly). Disney changes it from the original tale in remarkably good sense of injecting a clever plot turns, such as mice, which produces clothing and the key part (usually I do not like Disney movies very much, if they are not so similar to the original story, but this I'm not too worried. I feel that they have made the necessary changes to make it a good Disney movie. Often I do not think that Disney has changed the book in a good way in some of his films). <br /> <br /> You know the story already, Cinderella girl working on her horrible stepmother and stepsisters. She goes to the ball with the help of his fairies and lost glass slipper ... <br /> <br /> This is a film very much, to watch other people. Emergency family is not good enough. In order to enjoy it, I recommend you see it with your friends (and immediate family, if you like. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend it for people who love Disney, at least a little, the people who love fairy tales and for those who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
