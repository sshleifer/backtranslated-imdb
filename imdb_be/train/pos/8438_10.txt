HLOTS had an outstanding series, it would never NYPD Blue on HLOTS stories are real, the dialogue is real, then the relationship is real. With HLOTS ago, like in the movies, to tie all the loose ends, it was nice to all the gang together, even more, that it has been shown (I will not say how) Subject was fast paced, emotional and full of the spirit of the series was the week after week. Homicide, Life on the Street, Drama Network at its best !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs up and all that. Thanks to NBC for what we are, finally, we have not received!
