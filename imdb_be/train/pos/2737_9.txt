The film grip from start to finish and b / w photo with the American heartland is stunning. We feel that we are there with them as they cross the big sky country, and then to Mexico and back to America again. Toward the end of the film, a reflection of the rain Robert Blake looks like a small river of sweat and tears rolled down his face. In the end, we go to them up the stairs to their last moment. <br /> <br /> two criminals, played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, you can see on any street in any city. Hickock is a smiling boy in the neighborhood, and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes on the wrong side of town. This point is made in the film, and it always surprises us that the criminals do not differ in appearance than anyone else. Evil, even the most vile, it is part of the human condition. These two crazy people kill the whole family is looking for a safe that does not exist. Once on the move, they start to write bad checks, carving a trail for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many excellent supporting actors. Like John Forsythe as a detective on the case, Alvin Dewey. In addition, Will Geer shines in a short, but beautiful scene as prosecutor <br /> <br /> I have often wanted to see this film all the way to the end, with only caught it in short scraps. I finally get to it when the DVD purchase. The result is the best classic crime movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this brilliant film. For me, this is what a great film all about.
