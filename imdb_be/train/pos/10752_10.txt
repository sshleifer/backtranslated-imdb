It was the most visually stunning, moving, strange and incredible stories that I have ever experienced. Frankly, even those adjectives just can not describe it. I can not just pick one scene that stood out for me. I suppose if I had to list a few would be the reaction to fire victims by breaking the sound jumping; the reaction of the people trapped in an elevator, who did not know what happens when they finally reach the horrible scene; shock and disbelief in the audience; and, finally, silence. <br /> <br /> On the same day, and even now, I think of Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan said, 'I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out suddenly fell silent. It is amazing how so accurate in its description. It was really disturbance in the Force. <br /> <br /> This film demonstrates that the violation. Feeling so incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, fatigue, and a realization of its value. It's all there. Not a thing missing. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful and most moving documentaries and well deserves Amy. Not only because it documents the 9/11, but because it's just all it should be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch, do not forget to grab a box of tissues. You'll need them. I know what I did.
