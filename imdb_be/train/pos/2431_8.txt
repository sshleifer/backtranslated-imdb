Famous was "famous" for them to let go of tension and cartoon style, where half of the main character is in terrible danger, only to be rescued by the hero in the final seconds. This is especially Casper is the only one I can think of, where death actually takes her hand. But even in death, there is a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Standing in the Famous Studios cartoons is that "charity always wins." Popeye always gets his spinach time, Baby Huey always because foxes foxes, the little Audery always "learned your lesson." Some FS cartoons very dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You have to give them credit. just as I like Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry" I do not think that someone would put out the best product in the cartoon that time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (great Winston Sharples), editing voice. They were consistent and illuminates an example of the best that the art form had to offer.
