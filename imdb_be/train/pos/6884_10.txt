This is the miracle of the film is one of those films that have a long, long-term effect on you. I read a review or two from the angry people, I believe, are either Republicans or child beaters and their extremist statements say about the power of films to confront people with their darkest secrets. There is not a work of art is never combined laughter and tears at me before, and it was a miracle the movie. The realism of the film, and performance is Bret Carr will be missed. The very nature of this almost interactive effect, cause people to leave the theater or liberated or question their very identity. Bravo to the next level of cinema.
