Posts movie, but pretty good. Outstanding shot from the top down. Interesting in this storyline, Bette Davis, in fact, the background! Very negative reviews (the name throw in scenic / playwright, tying it as something very negative comments about "anglove in America" ​​etc., etc.) object in the movie too edifying of Germany in World War II. Gosh, it's just a little too complicated for me, understanding morality. <br /> <br /> Theater and movie-making, and acting style change over time and, of course, 70 years later, this film is not done in here. Yes Casablanca the best film (I think), but even though made in the same year, and both have a Nazi in them, Casablanca, above all, a love story. A love story in this film is the second in a spy story - more thriller. Both have a fairly large amount of a few bad accents and outstanding character actor. Children little tedious and can be edited
