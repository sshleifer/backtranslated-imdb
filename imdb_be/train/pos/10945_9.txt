Best show since Seinfeld. It's really funny. Its total concentration itself, Stoner awkward gay neighbors, it crashes into a song or cartoons, make it fresh show on TV. One of the few shows I do watch point. The scene with wise old black lady at the pharmacy ( "Oh, wait now, when you are close, you look old" turns its face with a finger and go lol), overdose of cough syrup, sleep with God, this is so funny, or so stupid, it's just a lot of fun. It illustrates the weaknesses of her sister and ears because they're too darn fine !! I really can not wait until the next show, something I have not felt any show for a long time.
