as a habit I always like to read through the "hated it" reviews of any given film. especially one that I would like to comment. and it's not so much the varieties of the transaction point of counterpoint; I just wanted to see what people say on the reverse side. <br /> <br /> However, I want to address one thing. many people who hated it was called, to paraphrase, "beautiful, but shallow," some even going so far as to say, the desire of this provision until the inability to help his brother was a prose story, at best. <br /> <br /> I would like to disagree. <br /> <br /> like a brother to a brother, who has a similar dysfunction, I can relate. every day, you can see that they are being abused themselves, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it's not about the specifics of what they were doing when; how and why Paul decided to take a gamble and chat with questionable human beings; it's really more about how they are connected. On the one hand, they are the real geniuses, and on the other hand, painful suicide (it is a lot like people like Howard Hughes ?? are the same forces that drive them to the same forces that are tearing them apart ), and all this time you see it, you know it, and what is worse, you realize that you can not do a damn thing about it. <br /> <br /> for Norman McLean, a river runs through it is probably a way to find an answer to the question of why the tragedy had to happen, and who is to blame. in the end, no one, and often, nothing. but it takes a lot of personal angst really come to this realization. sometimes it takes a lifetime. and sometimes it never comes at all.
