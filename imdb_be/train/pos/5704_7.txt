To be fair, I expected a car chase in the movie. There was only one really, but, in addition, «Freeway» was a great movie, which I'm glad to have a per DVD. The only really big names in the cast are in HOMICIDE Richard Belzer as a radio psychiatrist and B-Movie villain steam-Excellance Billy Dry as a revelation citation Freeway Killer. But the rest of the cast, as a rule, give good performances. I especially liked how flyugel gave him character, Sunny, a little guts. It could be a helpless victim of the character, but it is completely rounded, as she searches using drag bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russo, I'm afraid, comes across as a rather wooden, but then again, he plays the character, Frank, is not well fleshed out save for the background of the solar given by his former commander. Tons of great threat to persist throughout the film, and the atmosphere LA lonely highway at night with a killer prowling the length of his sinister gray sedan is an excellent way to build strength, and the music is used to emphasize the film properly formed. I do not know why there are some people who hate this movie so. Different strokes for different folks, I guess. But I absolutely enjoyed the «Freeway», and I highly recommend it.
