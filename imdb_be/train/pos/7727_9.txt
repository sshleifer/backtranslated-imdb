Prohibited PLANET best SF film from the golden age of SF movie, and that makes it a great film is its sense of wonder. Once the spacecraft landed the audience - through man crew - traveling at reasonable times and terrible adventure. Robbie meet unforgettable, mysterious Dr Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter of the Altair, and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - Krell, who died during the night. Or do they? <br /> <br /> You can nitpick and say that the planet is obviously starred in the studio with painted backgrounds, but it adds to the sense of threat claustraphobia I feel and Bebe and Louis Barron`s electronic music adds even more atmosphere < br /> <br /> I`m in shock this movie ISN `IMDB's top 250 movies.
