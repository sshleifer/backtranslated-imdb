Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the biggest game ever was created. It is so fascinated that you could play for hours upon hours without stopping to rest. I lost the game 4 times, but I never received all 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope to achieve them in the end. Even if I did not officially play the game until I was seven, I loved to watch my sister play. Now I'm 13 and still play in this by erasing the game and start over. <br /> <br /> The graphics are incredibly early game N64. The gameplay is addictive. Elements of great management. Level hard, but not impossible. Fights bowsers are complex. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you more, but why do not you just get it for yourself? Place the X-BOX 360, PS3, Wii and away and find yourself a Nintendo 64 and play in this amazing, beautiful game.
