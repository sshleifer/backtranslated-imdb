I've seen tons of HK actioners, and this one is right at the top of the genre. Scenes are just as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie. Kung Fu is spectacular, something terrible pyrotechnics and stunt work heartstopping. Editing went very well, increasing tension and compliments fluid camera work. This film is about an old director Corey Yuen, whose resume is packed with some of the best works in this genre, including Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of three-dimensional character, although Martin, Actor, closest to him. This film is full of archetypes, not characters - sexy killer, stupid thief and his bitchy girlfriend, cackling villains. However, Shannon Lee has a stunning screen presence; She fought well, tricks, and guns. When she was on the screen, it is difficult to tear from her eye. She's very good. Why this woman is not the main star?
