The film is exceptional in its gay iconography and extends it for asthetics music and actor. Throughout the film there is a childlike wonder as seen through the eyes of the protagonist. Her light-hearted look at the world around us funny and beautiful. In a sense, this slacker movie for girls. See this you imagine relaxing entertainment middle movie night. Buy it if you like Diferent takes on the world media and love together (?).
