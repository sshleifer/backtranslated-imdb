Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to fans of indie film. <br /> <br /> However, I do want to point out the similarities between the parts of the film, and Nichols' Closer. One scene in particular where the character of Adrian Grenier in Rosario Dawson questioned about their sex lives, while he was away remarkably similar to the scene in Closer, where the character Clive Owen, Julia Roberts questioned, although she acted with less sharpness and intensity in "Love". Also note that "Anna" is the name of both Dawson and character Roberts. There can not be a coincidence. Now closer it based on a play by Patrick Marber and supposedly this film based on Arthur Schnitzler «Reigen», so I do not know how this relationship is formed. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any ideas?
