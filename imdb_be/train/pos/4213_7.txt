Director Samuel Fuller comes up with a brilliant visual setting: cheeky pickpocket unwittingly raises a woman's purse with microfilm; it turns out that it is the courier for the Communists, and now she's a crook and watched by the police. Formula Film Noir all his glory - before the ingredients have become clich√©s - including waterfront areas, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack, and one hell of highest fights. Performances Widmark, Jean Peters and right on target, and a smart, sharp script is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for the knockout supporting role as "professional snitch." Exciting, atmospheric, hard as nails. *** from ****
