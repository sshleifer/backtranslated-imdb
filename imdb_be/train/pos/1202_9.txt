I really enjoyed this documentary about an attempt to Kenny and Spencer, to convey "Breaking Dawn." It was a great look at how outsiders trying to get inside, to make it big. <br /> <br /> The stories were collected and well organized in an interesting manner, which made the film flow well. Certainly worth a look. My only complaint is that they seemed to be no closure. Maybe it's part of the point. We expect this, but in fact that is what happened (or usually). <br /> <br /> The film is also a great way to see the face and Kenny Spencer outside their Canadian television show. You can see a little of what is yet to come. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see the Papal Chase.
