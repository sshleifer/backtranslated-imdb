This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions, shootings, bad guys and worse guys. It is interesting to see, James Belushi, using his humor to get out of the trouble he got himself that, as he stole $ 12 million from the end of big boss "Skipper. Does this sound cheese. Of course there is. But boy, did I pin this film. it is much better than all the straight to DVD garbage that is produced at the moment. If you can get a silly story than you know that this film has a lot of surprises. one can argue that twists to be predictable. But the fast pace of the film does not give you time to think, too, too many of them, which is good, because this film is not about revealing the final twist. But most of the journey at the moment. only the name is a bit misleading, and this may be the reason why so many people hated this movie. They probably expected a film about the mafia instead of some crooks double intersection to each one. Pure pleasure!
