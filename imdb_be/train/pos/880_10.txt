Probably the best movie of the year for me. These small French film centers on the office of the Secretary brought Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), who spends his days making other men's jobs, titles, and a source of their neglect and the dinner conversation, which is all too clear to her as being partially deaf, she reads lips. The change is driven, when she hires recently pardoned fraudster Polo (Vincent Cassel), as her assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. Mutual dependence, for entirely different reasons, glues them. Carl attracted to Paul and to the fact that it makes her feel attractive to what seems like the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel his feelings, because he needs her help. He owes money to a local gangster and form a plan to steal from it, which will include the ability to Carlas' read lips. I think the main thing that pushes the film way above average suspense / drama strange chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the film, regardless of what the other characters on the screen, you can feel this amazing connection between Carla and Paul. I can not remember when I was a witness to a sexual chemistry between the two actors. Emmanuell Virgo gives a brilliant performance (she won the French Cesar for Best Actress). You never feel like you are looking at a part of the action, it is really Karl. Chameleon, Vincent Cassel is also great. He makes a few unsightly character and attractive and appealing. I loved this film because of these two men, both times when I looked through it, I would like to return to the movie and participate with them all over again.
