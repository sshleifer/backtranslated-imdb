It can be difficult for some people to get used to the production of Hollywood style. Guide strain, apparently filming a stage setting, and the sound quality is bad here and there (the rustling of clothes people sometimes compete with their voices, etc.). <br /> <br /> My friends and I started watching, not knowing what to expect, and the first scene of nearly gave us. It seemed very unnatural and cheese. Then we picked up on the tone of the content, and began to enjoy themselves really. <br /> <br /> It is very funny, despite some corniness. Definitely give it a shot, if you appreciate the great dialogue. In addition, Helena Bonham Carter magic, of course.
