All I've heard about how bad animation is done. This may not be to couple with the fact that everyone is waiting for, but look at it this way. You would expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that the animation was made dry and rough on purpose. It was great to see her character transformation in the film, believing that it is likely to be as close as possible to the life of action, as we'll ever get. I look forward to continuing very quickly. If we want to live action, I think we can be better with virginity or Purgatori. I do not think Lady Death will be good to transfer the film. But be that as it may, it is my personal belief that all the skeptics about this movie is groundless. A lot of pun.
