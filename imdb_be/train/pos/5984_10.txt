This is a great movie, when viewed in the right context - It was supposed to be a parody of teenage horror devil-cult movies (and 80 have seen a lot of them)! I saw this film when it first came out, and immediately liked it. Being a big fan of Kiss, it was great to see Gene in the film. And nothing OZZY as metal-hating preacher can not be all bad! In addition, Fastway has been a favorite of mine, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS (this was pre-DVD) cover for Trick Or Treat Sammy featured illustrations on his knees, playing guitar in a ring of fire with "demon" looking at. It was a special order, and the price of VHS copies at that time (about 1987), it was $ 90! I really like the movie, but not in that ridiculous price. Cover «Ozzy-Gene» was created only for $ 5 reissues. The company releasing it, probably thought that Jean and OZZY were the only well-known people in the movie, so they are better placed them on the cover! Same with the original «Little Shop Of Horrors». - Jack Nicholson was in it only five minutes, but now they have it on the cover, as if he was a major star <br /> <br /> I have a "Trick or Treat" Web site, and it's amazing how many people believe that Sammy Teck was a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate this myth, devoting their soundtrack album to "Saomu Curr». <br /> <br /> All-in-all, it was a good time, rock 'n' roll movie. Definitely not to be taken too seriously and just enjoy!
