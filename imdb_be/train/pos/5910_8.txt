Well, well, it does not get bent round. I'm kidding. <br /> <br /> «Out Bustin '» is actually better and truer name Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Racism and crime dramas get satirical fun meant by our X-rated one animators Ralphie boy. And he does one of his best jobs here. <br /> <br /> On the front of the crime, he reveals the truth. They build it, protect it, boredom and stronger competitors make their (possibly) losing. See for yourself, to see what goes down. <br /> <br /> racist? I do not know. From Scatman (RIP) and the love of the margin (also RIP) to be black and the main point of view, I saw it as a racist attack basically. The fact that Richard Pryor says liked how well. And the younger (up to «Miami Vice») Phil Mike Thomas there was a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> This animated «Blacksploitation» film. It's a good thing. Done well and well done. This will make some squirm (as lynching scene), but unfortunately, that is based on fact. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie really had to rethink that name.
