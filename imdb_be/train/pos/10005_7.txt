Yes ... his art to successfully make the slow pace of a thriller. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in a good amount, and you will not even notice it happening. <br /> <br /> The exact performance of Robin Williams. The corners of sexuality in the film may seem unnecessary and likely to affect how much you like the movie. Nevertheless, the basic plot is very attractive. The film does not rush at you and still excites you enough to keep you interested. Direction good. Using light to achieve the desired effect on the unknown and unexpected good. <br /> <br /> Very good 1 just look, if you want to lay back and hear the fascinating story!
