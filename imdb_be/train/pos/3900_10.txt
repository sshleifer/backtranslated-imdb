It's right at the top of the list of the most hysterically funny shows I've ever seen. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I missed half the jokes. This demonstrates Izzard as brilliantly gifted comedian he is. What I particularly like the fact that he never seems to be Â«dumbing down" the material for its audience. His choice of the time perfectly and the procedure is associated with each other, as a piece of performance, not just a series of gags. Thumbs way up.
