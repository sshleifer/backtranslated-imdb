The main aspect of this film, who will miss the majority of people that Luhzin lives her life like a game of chess. So many people have seen the film, and just did not get it and I do not understand why. While watching this movie, I was taken on a private tour, which I storey. I will try to explain this without any spoilers, but I warn you, I'm talking about things that happen in the film. <br /> <br /> **** **** warns of possible obstacles! **** <br /> <br /> It is the life of the "big steps" against the "small steps". He chooses Natalia to be his queen, and he and she behaves like his aunt first described the King and Queen and their movements, when she introduced him to chess as a boy. Listen to this description. <br /> <br /> If someone asks him a question, he Flashbacks to the past, as if the examination of the previous steps. (Memoirs of a beautifully lit, by the way.) Memories quite interesting as well, because they give not only my point of view, as a child, but also the point of view of another character as well. It's overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Various characters become either his team or his enemies, on foot, bishops and knights, their actions to enlighten you as matter who on whose side they are on. Even their position in the scene is critical to understanding what is happening. Nicely done. <br /> <br /> I will not comment more on what happens with Luhzin character, but I hope it will illuminate what is actually happening in the end. <br /> <br /> This film is constantly working on many levels, so I support him. It was a pleasure and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and symbols is considered as pieces. <br /> <br />
