A small, charming little film, to be sure, but a great set up. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent, and gathered around her lap all the dialogue. It happened in the days of the mind and senses, and I'm sure I do not know why this one got all the attention at the Oscars. Emma is the most accessible and least stuffy Jane Austen story, well told.
