Now this is more like it! The first film had some questionable dialogue and a weaker effect, but it seems that the team behind it got her things together and to continue to put out a solid, thoroughly enjoyable, fun and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats all the way through. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it's just full of great stuff overflowing creativity, and it is less a parody of '80s movies simultaneously. Scenes in Hell large, and therefore, those in the heavens. There really is no shortage of mad-cap adventure romp that is a promise, and you'll never see another movie like this. Even unnatural final act of the film is not as bad as the first, being generally friendly and pleasant in its very clich√© repertoire of family fun movie enjoyment. Even Keanu Reeves, despite looking about 30, it's not so bad here. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a good deal for me.
