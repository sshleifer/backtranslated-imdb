Jet Li once again brings his charismatic presence on the silver screen in the movie Black Mask. In this film, Lee plays Cui, who had escaped from a super-soldier program, seeks to regain the humanity that had robbed him of the program. For this Tsui decides to become a librarian, to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate demands that he clean up problems with his past before he can continue to work for peace. Other members of the super soldier program to be saved at the same time as Tsui, but they want to settle scores with the world and not find inner peace. Thus Tsui is the only thing that can prevent his former teammate to produce information that could cost many innocent people their lives. This film is yelling across the screen at a furious pace and never lets go of his audience. Martial arts is amazing, but because it uses the wire can not be assessed as it deserves by American audiences. If you like the fighters who have an interesting history and require good acting performances, because they deal with the psychological and physical conflict, the black mask for you. I am glad to see that some of the films Jet Li finally become the main stream of the release in the United States and is looking forward to see how the changes that the issue will require (things like dubbing and sound) will affect the film. This is one of the best Lee movies, go out and see it on May 14, when it will be released in America.
