I believe that this film is a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 O 5 times to see it to understand what a great movie it was. First, he describes the face of WW2, that we do not normally see in Hollywood movies. In particular, the German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government shows more "humanized." One of the things that impressed me most was any, by the end of the film, a murder that took place in the forest over the past 20-x ..., that the forest is a place where the final chapters of the Berlin Alexanderplatz Square take place : those forests where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another key for those who like details, is the representation of the door. Fassbinder get people to change every time they walk through the door, or the door is open. Many doors displayed on the screen, open and close. And the characters are changed in their faces, their actions, etc. Anytime that happens. Have you noticed that?
