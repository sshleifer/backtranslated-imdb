Another remake of "A Fistful of Dollars", a remake of Sergio Leone with Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (suggested by the novel "Red Harvest») <br /> <br /> This is one strictly B-Movie. it is assumed that it is quite pleasant. the direction is clear, the current full inspiration, the limitations of his "straight to video" photos are well handled. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses of the film in a catastrophic decision to marry "a handful" / "Bodyguard" land to the south of the site with Leone "Once Upon a Time in the West". Although Leon sent as a "Fistful" and "West", his motivation two films could not be more different. "People Without a Name" (Eastwood) is a border socio-by with a soft spot for single-parent families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with his own broken family, and obsessed with revenge. These two characters have not had much to do with each other. To bring them together, «Gun Crazy» has to twist this story and complicate it, as we do not lose that history, we actually lower. <br /> <br /> But it's B-Movie in the end, and is filled with action and folly; It's funny at this level, just do not expect anything.
