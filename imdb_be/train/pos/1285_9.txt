Disappointment midlife Deputy District Attorney George Maxwell (a fine performance by George E. Carey, who also produced the picture) can not stand him grumpy, frigid wife Edith (very cynical Anne Bellamy) more. To make matters worse, poor George is further burdened by the newborn sun and lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (seductive brunette Sherry Jackson). George has a bad love affair with a beautiful, attractive and free-spirited hippie swinging babysitter Candy Wilson (enthusiastically played with aplomb by Sexy yummy blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications ensue when George finds himself blackmailed bitter Julie Freeman (beautifully venomous turn Kathy Williams), who wants to George in the spring of her psychotic biker friend Laurence Maki (frightening Robert Tessier, who sports a full head of hair here) from jail. Directed by Tom Laughlin (yes, the same guy who portrayed Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McLarty fit perfectly shady history with a victory and a very exciting more than delicious female nudity, hissing soft core sex and violence wet. In addition, they just bind all wild'n'easy relaxed sensitivity of 60 youth culture and to relate the story in a tense 75 minutes of time, thus ensuring that this film does not overstay its welcome. One particular highlight occurs when Candy invites his friend clockwork over the house for an impromptu Maxwells basal Basha complete with pot smoke, wailing rock music, and, of course, hot naked chick dancing. funky assessment Robert O. Ragland hits on the angular position. Austere black-and-white cinematography Stanton Fox adds an extra edge to the sandy delirium untidy habits. Best of all, it's Flick rate as the perfect showcase for a completely magical and ruddy elf Patricia Wymer, which positively lights up the screen with her sweet, bubbly person and breathtaking beauty. Altogether shoddy treatment.
