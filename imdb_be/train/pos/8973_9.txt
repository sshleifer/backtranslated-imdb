I saw this movie when I was a little kid on TV (thank you to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and had nightmares about it for years afterward. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the teachers Bratislav Pojar, one of Canada's best animators National Film Commission. Pojar was, in turn, mentor and colleague for a large Drouin. If you are a Trnka you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The symbolism is obvious, but cleverly used. Opposition and beauty of life (plants) are in opposition with the anonymity of the gloves. The poor puppet hero convicted despite a lack of political programs. <br /> <br /> What I remember most was the feeling of oppression in the decor. In a small room, where the action takes place it is the world of the character. Invasion of the hands is a complete violation of this world. <br /> <br /> beautiful and haunting film. I found a copy of this and other outstanding shorts on Trnka at the public library, and showed it to their own children. You must see.
