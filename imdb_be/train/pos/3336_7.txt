I must admit that I went to Fever Pitch with low expectations. It's no big revelation for me to say that last film Jimmy Fallon (taxi) was Catwomanly bad and trailers for Fever Pitch is all right, but not hypnotized me. I have already prepared some cheese baseball puns for my review ... <br /> <br /> "I love Jimmy Fallon, but taxi was hit one in his film career. Well, now we have steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! another blow, and he returned to the SNL! "or" Buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jack, but do not buy tickets for Fever Pitch. you walk out of the theater and never come back! "Then the film was supposed to go and be a lot more interesting, than I expected. But hey, I could not let my quibbles disappear, right? Another reason, I thought that I did not care for the movie, I Nenov Seeking a Boston Red Sox. My whole family hates them. The mere mention of the name Pedro Martinez sent me running to the bathroom. About people keep ... <br /> <br /> ... Well, I'm back. In any case, my mother, who is a supporter of the St. Louis Cardinals, still believes that the World Series was rigged in the past year. She refuses to believe the Sox won legitimately. But I'm man enough to admit that Fever Pitch made me sympathize with , although only slightly, with distressed supporters Red Sox. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a passion for the sport will be able to relate to this movie on some level. If you have a favorite sports team, you can not fully understand the extreme highs and lows that the fan, such as Ben Fallon can pass through. There's nothing as fresh as the smell of a new season, and nothing quite as smoothly as with a clean sheet. Well, metaphorically speaking. It is a joy to be a fan. "Wait 'till next year" becomes your mantra, your motto, prayer - and Fever Pitch effectively captures the essence <br /> <br /> I love the fact that the film takes a fictional story and throws it against. real life background incredible World Series Red Sox 'work in the past year. I do not like it so much that I want to marry her, but you know what I mean. I expected it to be handled in a pretty bad way, and while some of the humor a bit silly, it's actually quite realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, Uncle Ben took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7 years old, and when he died, he left Ben his two season tickets. Ben has not missed a game in 23 years. At the beginning of every season he has a draft day when he and his friends get together to find out who will go to any games with him. He makes everybody dance for the Yankees games and every time someone complains that he threatens them with tickets for games with the Royals (sorry Mr. Shade) and Devil Rays. This is a very good scene, and it works so well, because I actually know people who are doing the "project of the ticket the day." I also have to admit that I can refer to when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsay and her parents. The Red Sox played a road game, but instead of watching it live on television, Ben decides to tape it. One of the most dangerous things in the life of the recording on the tape of the game, and then being in public places and try not to hear the result. I was there. This is a very intense and scary situation. Weeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when the guy shows up at the restaurant, and remembers watching the game. Ben immediately covers his ears and starts screaming like a banshee, so as not to hear the result. Lindsey confused, and her parents do not know what to think. For example, sports fans can be amazing, I do not deny. But it's real. <br /> <br /> Now that you expect raw material edgy that the Farrelly brothers are known, then you may be disappointed. They have their moments, though, like when Ben says he loves how Lindsey negotiations on the part of her mouth "like a magic stroke victim", but in general it is certainly a softer, more romantic side that dude put on display. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film never gets too juicy. Fortunately, if the juice begins to flow a little, Farrelly know when to step back. Romantic moment with Lindsey jumping on the field and ran to Ben, to declare her undying love for him becomes Ben said sincerely, "You have to tell me about the outfield. This spongy? Â»Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material, he can handle himself well on the big screen, and Drew Barrymore is a constant source of romantic comedy charm. Hype just good solid entertainment that takes a fresh look at a few romantic comedy genre. This is a movie that children can and touch. In particular, children who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and houses that have to deal with it. <br /> <br /> At the present time, when supporters of the Red Sox might have, please, shut up about the "Curse of the Bambino" I of would appreciate. My Memphis Tigers have never won the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially declare my distress more than you. <br /> <br /> Essentially Fans Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore romantic comedy, in the Red Sox, baseball, or sports fanaticism as a whole should consider giving Excitement look. I would not go my way, to be worn and seen it on the first available time, but it will make a big matinee <br /> <br /> Rating :. 3:25 (of 5)
