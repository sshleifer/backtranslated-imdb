The fatal flaw is really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart, and David Lewis in the film. The film's cast all worked very well. Robert Wagner played his part well. Relations between Saboto Jr. and Turner was good. There can be a big difference in age, but they are a unique couple. The two actors really worked together as well. Music in the film is really good Ron Ramin and fits the film very well. There is a bunch of stuff that happens in the movie, which you do not know what is happening and what will happen next, and the movie keeps you going from start to finish. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., and Janine Turner then watch this wonderful movie!
