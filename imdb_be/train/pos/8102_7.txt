Things Going is a historical film. Along with the metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first large fiction shows. It is also one of the first apocalyptic films. It's amazing how the filmmakers predict the onset of World War II, during the year, and even, in a refined form, it will end the year in the real world. But then the film departs from reality, which shows the world devastated by war (only to replace the poisonous gas to create nuclear weapons, which, of course, did not exist in 1936). <br /> <br /> In the last half hour of the film incredible sight that makes innovative use of models and matte paintings - later to become a staple of science fiction. Sadly, after the upcoming, Sci-fi to identify themselves with a cheap B-movies, is a stereotype that will never be broken until 2001: A Space Odyssey after more than 30 years. If they had stayed with the effects of the quality of this movie, it would have been very different in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of its main roles is played several roles in this film, a good effect. Messi plays a big "Doctor Who" -like role as a pilot with an advanced, simple-controlled commander (a very effective implementation of Ralph Richardson) (for 1970) civilization, which is trying to win people to the ravaged country. In the end, the plot covers 100 years. But this is a big problem with this film - there really is not a cohesive story <br /> <br /> Perhaps, in this episodic film. - somewhat reminiscent of intolerance, really - it's hard to have a conventional plot, but I felt more could be made of a material, and although the visual effects in the last third of the picture a truly stunning and well worth the price of admission ... the story is not there, and suddenly the film ends just as it gets interesting. Maybe the producers thought about other future innovations of science fiction: the continuation <br /> <br /> The film Come every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once. In contrast to the archdiocese, however, it can not be repeated viewings.
