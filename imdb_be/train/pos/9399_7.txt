This is a movie that I saw when it first came out, and I've seen a few times over the years. It's always nice <br /> <br /> One thing that comedy does not take sides :. She turned the work and capitalists alike. Only Sid seems beyond the classic struggle, despite the fact that he is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning: Do not read on if you have not seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, though presented quite plausible. Ask yourself, who else can support the majority of his or her weight in one thread tissue? It would cut through almost no support. <br /> <br /> Also, if cornered in an alley, Sid uses garbage can cover both Knight shield. Beautiful symbolism. <br /> <br /> Someday, I will get it on DVD.
