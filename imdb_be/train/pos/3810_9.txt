this is my first review on IMDb, I really do not want to write one, but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now, I feel compelled to add my point of view ... and no, I am not connected in any way to the filmmakers ( yes, yes, how often are you here that earlier ;-)) FYI I am in my late 20s <br /> <br /> first of all, I have to admit, I really like the cartoon, because you see, it is limited only by the imagination of the creators, and they have been very imaginative in this. Not so much in terms of history, but to achieve a very unique and fresh visual style imo. The characters look good, but far from the real, and it works well for the film, in the end, this fairy-tale world. But the backgrounds and the world is filled with bizarre visuals that my jaw dropped in a few times, watching it. Blue, rabbit, like a mini-dragon became the show and is easily some of the funniest moments of the film, he is already a classic, as well as Scrat from Ice Age. History is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-hero has to go out and kill the biggest dragon you can imagine), but who cares when the movie looks and sounds good ;-) 1 thing I should mention, the IMO film is not suitable for very young children, so he has some dark scenes in it and can be scary for children up to 6-8, I'd say it's very few scenes, but it is worth noting, imo. Anyway, I had a great time watching it and can not wait for it to hit the stores in high definition watch it again and again, just for the sheer beauty of it. <br /> <br /> 8,5 for me
