Well, Tenko, without a doubt, the best of British television show ever, shows, directing, casting, suspense, drama ..... all fantastic about it. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the show fell a little later in his last season, is the ending of the film took a beautiful yarn and wove a great story for the series and newcomers fans. I can not recommend this film more to find it and see it. But I advise you to watch the first series, in the first 2 seasons, even better than in the movie. <br /> <br /> obvious (10/10)
