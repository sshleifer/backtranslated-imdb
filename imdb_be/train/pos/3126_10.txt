I do not give ten star ratings easily. The film really need to impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. In addition, this trilogy converged so well that I believe that this is one of the biggest movie trilogies of our time. While all three films could not be more different from Ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry, that the series has been completed, but I could not even try to stop smiling for a few hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment of opening the name came out, I knew we were in for a ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. We all like the previous Bourne films here once again: the action, dialogue, and, of course, a shaky camera. However, for me, that last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the suspense. <br /> <br /> I'll come back to see this movie several times before it is released on DVD, simply because he is a genius. This is a very satisfactory conclusion, and should stand the test of time, as a science fiction film, and in general, the unforgettable trilogy.
