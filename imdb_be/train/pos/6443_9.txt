Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. He recommended that I fried a few weeks ago. I have never looked or did not notice it before, because it falls (as usual) in the category "Swedish film" and those who have become (like me) with Hollywood productions, usually skeptical of any foreign films. Hell, that paradigm shift film touches me because it just keeps my hope that humanity can change for the better the way the Swedish village just a sample of all regions in the world where people live together -. under the control of religion, confusion, lack of courage, predictions disguised cruelty, but also the magician ymasts have fun, to meet, to sing ... It takes a trigger outside to unmask all (who holds one) and make them feel that we are all just people with a desire to live my own life. I can never stop, to see stories like this, because that keeps my hope that, as described above. Five minutes, containing the history of the songs of Gabriella, including her performance is one of my movie-moments ever! Thank you Kay Pollak only for those 5 minutes, which made me happy!
