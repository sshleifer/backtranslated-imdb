I had the pleasure of watching this beautiful movie last night, with the perfect complement question and answer session with the director after watching. I suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to him in death. I had a lot of losses, and this film spoke to me. One of the main topics, as we are not dealing with questions / issues / stories with our loved ones, until it was too late - they're too incapacitated or died before that happens. Talk with your loved ones, listen to and record their stories, to tell people you love them, to resolve disputes. I loved the message that there are no errors. I love the way the director relationship two daughters - as one of six brothers and sisters, it is clear to me that he understood how difficult this relationship. Its history as a filmmaker also comes through loud and clear - what a beautiful film! The casting is outstanding - it is not a film not to be missed!
