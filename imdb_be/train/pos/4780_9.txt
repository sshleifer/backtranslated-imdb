Always thought this movie with video cover. In the end, it manages to buy it for a fiver in the sale and the boy, who the film. Simply stunning performance from the entire body, and it is so beautiful shot. Sometimes even from a distance, so you can only hear the dialogue, as if you really are that distance away picking up the pieces of the story. It's really moving, often funny and very watchable. Not much, but the dialogue is removed in such a way that you feel so much throuout. 9/10 from me. You must see.
