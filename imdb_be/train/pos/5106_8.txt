I believe that every time I see one of those old movies from the 80's, she puts me in a simpler time, no matter how trivial it may seem today. This movie is good. I remember as a small child, and thinking that it was the greatest movie ever. It has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be. Now, as an adult, I can look back and laugh, and still is sad, but this time I actually know what's going on. I found one amazing. How many people can travel in Houston and connect with Cisse, get married, move into a trailer that fall, to deceive, an uncle die, and then come back together, all in the last month? Only in America.
