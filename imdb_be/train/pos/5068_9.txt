This movie is a great movie based on the life of man by the name of Gray Owl in 1930 in Canada. I found it to be just as riveting and heart as a "by Rudy" and "awakening". He picks up later in the life of a bearded owl and followed him through his most rapid and influential period. <br /> <br /> The film is about the Canadian Indian hunter, who believes himself to promoting the plight of Beaver traps. He also predicts a reduction of natural land and overuse of the earth's resources. This is outrageous concept in 1930 and is surprisingly well received. He becomes a well-known speaker and the masses are willing to listen. <br /> <br /> Casting Pierce Brosnan seems rather strange, but it is not outrageous. Anyone who wants to argue that point should watch the first film to understand. Brosnan delivers excellent performance, as does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau strong actress, whose place is next to Brosnan refreshingly natural compared with the forced pairing in recent Bond films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone interested in a good drama, beautiful scenery, or environmental reasons. This is a movie for a family holiday as well, but children under the age of 10 (depending on the term) will have problems following the story.
