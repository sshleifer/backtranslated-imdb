Reasonable, rough, witty, fast-paced, sexy, extravagant, sloppy, erotic, heart and banal, light-flooded ramp Parade is a first class entertainment, which films everything. <br /> <br /> realist, satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and his pace and delivery line is breathtaking. To think that they have just started to shoot artistic photos speak for 7 years before! dialogue, the brightness can not be matched anywhere today, especially given the fact that the "realism" took over and absorbed the modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was made at a time when the Hayes code content restrictions were ignored and the result is a new, self-referential, critical and life movie that spoke directly to the modern audience who is suffering through the depression and general age angst. I would recommend watching any film of this period, ie 1930-1935, for the vision of what a popular movie could potentially be.
