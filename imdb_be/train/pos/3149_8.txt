Not so The Simpsons did it debut there was a sitcom, I do not want to include is not a matter of 2 minutes. This, of course, it was said that the sitcom The Simpsons killed. Not the same. <br /> <br /> In the first season it was so, because the characters are teenagers were not as challenging as they later became. They even went to school time. The following seasons of the nature of where to fledge. Eric, sarcastic sneer, Donna, his level-headed friend, Kelso, dim bulb, Hyde, conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, Fez, pervert exchange student and, finally, Jackie, spoiled rich woman. As for the adult characters was the mother of Eric, the "can you believe that she is so ditzy» suburban mom, dad, Eric, a straight arrow, which, of course, is not such a hard ass when it seemed stupid father of Donna and her dumb blonde mom . All this is true of their characters, but special kudos Kurtwood Smith, who finds the perfect balance between strength and still makes it red Forman quite sympathetically, without forcing us to throw an unexpected wit. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace, of course, the main reason why this show is so good. This is a difficult character to play because it does not allow an actor to engage in wild outperform, as the nature of Kelso, played competently Ashton Kutcher. I loved seeing the two characters interact, because they are very different. <br /> <br /> Guides character a little harder to use, since it is more realistic, and we really need to see the history of an orphan for the hundredth time, although I will say that the authors came up with a brilliant story arc for him in recent seasons . <br /> <br /> Jackie Griffin plays the voice of the artist Mila Kunis oars, and she has nails on a board such as a voice that actually fit her character. Only sad thing is that we have not seen more scenes with her and Eric, because they were F ...... fun together. Too much history has been spent on her relationship problems, because we've already got that in spades with Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> In the past, I would say that the casting of the invited actors have always been great. A few favorites: «Humongous girlfriend in the middle of the year, Pastor Dan, the absolutely amazing Leo plays an equally amazing Thomas Chong, another of Fez" Fez friends who completely crazy and a special appearance in the teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Next, next to Fox, whatever.
