Wow. Really fantastic "journey" a film that has a ton of super-surreal imagery, dark intentions and black, quite a strange feeling, like cartoon animals should see the world. It is inhabited by a very nice-world characters pile bending and flowing with curved backgrounds.As with all cool fantasy, wandering plot is secondary to the terrible visual effects, and we go a little cat and his sister zombies as they face death, flood, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs and fish. I never heard about it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of a surreal pencil work of American cartoonist; Bill Plympton. It's a crazy joy for fans of the odd, beautiful things, and it was me glued to the screen for fear I missed something strange. Simply put, it is «Hello Kitty» without the "o".
