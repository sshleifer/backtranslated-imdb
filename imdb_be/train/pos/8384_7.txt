I read somewhere (in a rather panning review), it is something of a live-action anime mechanism, and I think they are on the right track. I first watched this movie when I was very young, and I'm dying to see him again, and when I finally did recently all the memories came flooding back. I do not think it will be too serious - it's just a bit of good old 80s almost-a-TV-movie fun (it is set against a background of a dark future, although this point is not emphasized too much). What I admired most about this film was not that the dialogue did not sound generic - not a clich√©, entirely predictable line - just good fun! Maybe the time has not regretted this little film, but still I can find appreciation for it at me. In any case it is not perfect, but it is entertaining and does not try to be anything other than that. Let Botany and comic-shop guys to worry about the technical details - who cares? See for yourself and make your own decisions. opinion is important, no one else.
