I finally got to see the notorious «Ice Age». Except, perhaps, not being dead funny as I had hoped to see after a brilliant teaser have a good word I can say about it. Of course, it's not as glamorous as the production of Disney (besides, this is the first attempt to Fox on the full-length CG movie), but he has a huge heart, and in some cases (for example, look into the eyes of Manfred, after we see the sad idea about his past), I was on the verge of tears. But when they reunite the child with his father, I just could not keep them longer. The film, which has no problem to walk the fine line of juicy and clichés and manages to bring more than the best of it; the end result is one of the most touching animated creations I've ever seen. Large interesting characters, who are looking to quickly grow on you (and great voice talent as well) and a lot of funny memorable scenes, especially on behalf of Scrat makes the film more than enough to give it a go. Plus scene Dodo, my favorite funny scene in 2002 <br /> <br /> I really do not understand, but for some reason, it really looks like a CG animation will prevail in the future, but if it just means that there will be more movies like this (and who can forget the creations of Pixar), then I do not mind, at least for now. 9/10
