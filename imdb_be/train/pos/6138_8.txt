It's old-fashioned, amazingly fun children's film with by far the most attractive novice witch ever. Unlike many modern stories that seem to dig into the dark witchcraft, it's just a fairy tale about the hocus-pocus, it's cute, light-hearted and charming. <br /> <br /> story is set in 1940 in the English village with a sprinkling eye, where three cockney children, Charlie, of Carrie, and Paul Rollins, evacuate danger of air raids on the city of the Second World War. They mistakingly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying in absentia to become an apprentice witch. Rosehip and a trio of children use a pen magic bed to go to London on their flying bed. Here they are faced with Emilius Browne, director of the school of Witchcraft fraudulent learning correspondence school Miss Price. Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. At the same time, they also have to deal with a shady character called the scribes and his partner, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury, of course, amazingly gentle as eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Brown, a school principal with a non-existent magic school, which now has become a street magician. This actor was previously cast as children's father in the film Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is very reminiscent of a fairy tale before Mary Poppins is an excellent fantasy stories for children. Perhaps this film is not quite as catchy music as Chim-Chim-Cherry, but it does boast some attractive little melody. Some have been critical, but the film is characterized by excellent special effects. In general, the history is fascinating fun for the whole family. It is a pity that today's children are too complex for this beautiful and magical tale that should appeal to the child in all of us.
