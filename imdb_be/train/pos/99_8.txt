Christmas together actually came ahead of time, but I was raised by John Denver songs from this special has always been my family's Christmas music. For many years we had a crackling tape made of the recording, which means that it's Christmas. A few years ago, I was finally able to find a video of this on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for several years 21, I got to see John and the Muppets in action for yourself. If you ever get the chance, it's a lot of fun - great music, heart warming and cheese. It is also interesting to look at the 70th version of the Muppets, and compare them to newer versions of today. I think that is actually Denver took some heat for this show, as it is - I think, as a rule, the performers do not jeopardize their images, making a sing-a-Long with dolls, but I'm glad he did. Even if you can not keep track of the video, the soundtrack should be as well. It has some Muppified traditional favorites, but also some original tunes Denver as well.
