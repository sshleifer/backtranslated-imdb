War Inc. it's funny, but strange film. Actors lovely, lovely film, too, but I do not know how to describe the plot. I'll go into the plot later. This is a movie with some fantastic casting choice. In addition, John Cusack as a hit-man that we saw a year ago in Grosse point blank that I liked. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff plays a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something like that. Her character is odd. There is a scene where she sticks Scorpio down his pants. And the hits on Hauser (Cusack). There is a twist in the end, with the participation of the two characters. It makes sense. <br /> <br /> This is the only casting choice I go to. Because it's just amazing. The entire film is strange. But sometimes incredibly funny, and I was never boring. Here we have some of the best actors out there. With the exception of Miss Duff. It is not big. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a hit man named Hauser (Cusack). He sent in some town of Middle East oil to put a hit on a man named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). Trying to deal with their personal problems, he should help the wedding of pop star (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a news reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). There is a thing about pop stars, eg. Hauser disgusted by it. There is a scene where she sings a song to him, and then he throws. <br /> <br /> twist late in the film shows a why. The fact is, a twist that I kind of saw it coming. But it does not matter. It's weird, funny and entertaining comedy. I love most of the actors. So really, how I would not recommend it <br /> <br /> War, Inc :. 3.5 / 5
