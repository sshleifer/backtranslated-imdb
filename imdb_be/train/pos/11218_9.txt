This anime is a must see for fans of Evangelion. This earlier work of Hideaki Anno, but his irrepressible, dramatic style fully in place. In addition, those who do not like Evangelion might find this edition a little bit more acceptable. Gunbuster is rather unique for a sci-fi anime is that it's actually based on real science. In fact, the show has a few small "Science lessons" interludes explains the physics behind some of the events in the film. One of the great dramatic moments in the film is a relative time at speeds near that of light. The series does an excellent job of combating imaginably traumatic experience of leaving the land for six months a mission to travel near the speed of light and return to Earth, where ten years ago. The protagonist is age 17 or 18 for the entire series while almost all the other characters are much age. Keep in mind that it is difficult to show on the juice at times. It also has some of the most completely undeserved shots breasts I've ever seen. I found it pretty easy to ignore the poor shape and boo-Hoo scene because otherwise a very good series, but viewers with a low tolerance juice might want to stay away from it. On an interesting note, Gainax, as always, managed to run out of money in the last few episodes. Nevertheless, they were able to use a black-and-white film, and still sketches actions to make a good decision in any case. The ending is a little silly, but it left me with a good feeling in my gut, I could not help but love him. Gunbuster, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of anime around.
