I just finished watching this finely conceived, and beautifully acted / directed film. It was along, I was going to spend my time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network because of the terrible distracting advertisements. Reading the comments previously convinced me to give it a chance. After all, the worst thing that could happen, that I might fall asleep during one of the saddest even longer ads spray error. So why do I watch it? mainly because, if IMDB gives the film «average» 5.8 WHO'S average was 7.3 must be sure hit. <br /> <br /> I was quite happy that I took the time to see this movie, commercial pox and all. Helen Hunt continues to impress me with their ability to make a firm adapting its basic roles persona to fit each role. <br /> <br /> portrait she painted in this film hard cop still astutely man was beautifully executed. If the scene requires a quick blunt, timely delivered verbal communication, she can stand toe to toe with any actor. Nevertheless, she has extensive experience in the delivery volumes of emotional response, not a word, relying only on facial expression and body language. Without advertising, which by design continuity kill any good movie, it would be a real edge-of-seat nail biting. I gave it a 9.0
