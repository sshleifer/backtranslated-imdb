I enjoyed watching the climbers in the beginning, when this woman (Sarah) was filled with horror when she slips away, I thought it was terrible scene, I think, if you see what you see, your nerves in your body get to you, because it will get you full of fear, and your heart beats faster. I watched as the climber, I think Stallone Silvestar is a great actor and I think he will know how to play Rambo and Rocky.
