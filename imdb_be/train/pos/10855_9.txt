Looking back over the last 28 years (since my first contact with the show), all I can say is: After you get it, it will stay with you forever. I remember my initial reaction being: 1) annoying outplayed, 2) produced by 3) unlikeable characters <br /> <br /> Well, two years later, I again watched a few episodes and did not find it nearly as annoying. A year later I was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and acquisitions quickly became his bitter story of human guilt and prospects for happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure the price of the products will be difficult to deal with the company. But, I still think about this show at least once a month with an uncertain watery eyes tight that it seemed a simple time ... <br /> <br /> By the way I am a married man ... (for all who I think this show for women)
