I admit that I'm a vampire junkie: I have seen so many vampire movies I've lost count, and this one is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed with the Vampires John Carpenter's original and when I was descovered sequel I went straight out and bought it. This film is not subject to quite the same rules as the first one, and it's not quite so dark, but close enough, and I felt that he had built on the original well. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss, his performance was pretty, and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in a world in which he lives . One of my favorite parts was only after he meets Zoey and goes to the bathroom diner to check to see if it is more than it seems. His comments irreverant beautiful and yet practical emminently that contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> Other actors, too, were well chosen, and they are beautifully knitted produce entertaining and original film. This is not just a retelling of the first film, and he grew up in the same way on the road Fright Night II rose from Fright Night. There are various elements that make it a fresh film with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you love vampire movies, I would recommend it. If you prefer a less bloody movies then choose something else.
