Many people judge him as a fan service of the film, because a lot of super star in the lead role in this film (Gackt, Hyde, and Wang Lee Hom is a very famous singer in Japan). But do not judge it before you look, this is what I say. Gackt and staff very seriously when he made this film, and they worked so hard. It's a good movie with a tender inside stories. Several scenes can be both fun and some others so sad. They did it so well, yet I can not stop watching it again and again. <br /> <br /> This story is written very well, but I recognize that their action is a little disappointing. This is especially Hyde because of his ability to act under the other, and it is strange to hear, as he speaks with a language other than their mother tongue (Japan). But this is understandable, because it is their first time to act in the film. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt trying to show us how someone could be so weak that they are losing the most important person in their lives. If Toshio was killed when Sho asked Kei turn Yi-Che, to be a vampire like him, because he will not let her die when Brother Shaw died, Kei Shoot son dies, and the best and the beautiful scene when Shaw pass away ~ even I said Gajda skill is still strange, but I give it two clicks up on the stage !! <br /> <br /> There is a time where the story is going too fast, they did not say the reason why the Son could join the local mafia and be the enemy of Shaw, because they are good friends in the past, as well as the son of a brother sho-in-law. <br /> <br /> Whatever, I love this movie ~ (a lot ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action film with a touching beautiful stories.
