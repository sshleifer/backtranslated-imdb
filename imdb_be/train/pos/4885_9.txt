Possible spoilers Re: late-cameos are <br /> <br /> Rarely one to see so many wonderful and memorable character actors (actresses almost entirely, to be exact) in a movie. Even if some of them are only for Kama, each of which is a gem. The British make a combination of comedy and pathos real life better than anyone MMO, so it is not surprising that the majority of British actors <br /> <br /> music is great. without a doubt, a lot had to be duplicated (this Leslie Caron * really * to play the bass guitar so well, perhaps - who knows?) But Cleo Lane unmistakably itself. - her warm visceral sound still turns my crank, like several other jazz singers <br /> <br /> as an aging musician himself, not quite as old and certainly not in this class, of course, it was an encouraging film, as well - a great movie for those whose interesting when they passed him in their profession or vocation whatever it was. . And, of course, a big celebration in the life of Stage <br /> <br /> I missed a bit of the opening, but the previous 9/10 - and it certainly makes us want to see it all.
