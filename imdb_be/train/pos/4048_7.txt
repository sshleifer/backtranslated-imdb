Romer deviate from their usual portraits of the French middle class, to say that a costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the French Revolution. More attractive «La Anglaise ...» (except for the stories) is fabulous aesthetics that Romer was reached. Image digitally decorated too make them look like Baroque paintings. At some point you can not tell your watch or a movie or a series of pictures in the Louvre Musseum. Every shot is a work of art <br /> <br /> My rating :. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> ------------- - - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - ------------------
