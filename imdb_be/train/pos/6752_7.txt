Detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in the murder (Craig Stevens), and then trying to cover it up. Preminger directed the movie has a lot of atmosphere, but the story gets alleviated, if the wife is killed (Gene Tierney) falls Andrews. He makes a pretty good dig themselves in and with a big hole, but it was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for film noir. Gary Merrill big as Scalese, criminal, Andrews obsessed with bringing down, and the tension between them gives the film its energy and drive, especially a scene in the bath with Merrill, Andrews, and Neville Brand, and the night during a visit outside Bellevue Hospital, which establishes, what should be the film's conclusion. High marks for atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc ... and the overall image of the underworld, although the angle of love and simplified elements of good cop bad cop does not help his cause.
