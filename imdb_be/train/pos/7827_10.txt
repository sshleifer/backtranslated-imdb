This film is, quite simply, brilliant. Cinematography is good, great acting and the story is absolutely breathtaking. This is the story Donald Woods, a white South Africa, who considered himself a liberal, yet he did not recognize the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline quite convincingly - so if he Donald Woods appeared on television a few years later, I found its image Kline. Denzel Washington also appears in the masterful performance as before. <br /> <br /> I urge you to look at it. It is long, but worth your patience, because he says such an incredible story. Remember, man, that really happened.
