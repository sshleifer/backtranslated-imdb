My family back to New Orleans late 1600s and early 1700s, and in watching the film, I knew that this was the story of my grandchildren's parents never talked about it, but we knew that it existed. I have cousins, obviously, black Which African-Americans and others who can "pass" as white and chose not to. It's a hard story to watch, when you realize that it's your family, and they say that the Cane River all part of the story. It makes me want to cry, and it makes me want to kick ass, "has ancestors who possessed these plantations and wondering in awe as my great-grandmother's African heritage living in this oppressive and even aristocratic existence ... And at the same time, if I did not come out of this story, I probably will not be a successful business woman I am today successfully live in a fairly integrated world. The action was both beautiful and true, depending on the actor, but it is a film that should have been done. Anne Rice is incredible, and I ask myself why it is "symbolic" to write about my family, and I'm not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
