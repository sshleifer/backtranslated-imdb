It was one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently, I was pleased to see it on the DVD, which is a relief from the view of the old, grainy version of VHS. <br /> <br /> I have not seen him in years, and watched it today does not cease to be surprised how well the film stands up to time. This is one of those rare, perfect comedy storms where large writing (really funny line after a really funny line) paired with a large focus and outstanding achievements in the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore received an Oscar nomination for "Arthur", but lost (though John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" will not win the Best Actor Oscar proof -IT, that neither the comedian could not win the title (another example of Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon craft film perfectly faithful to each of the characters and the heart of the narrative tone. Quite simply, IMHO the film is a rare gem. It is only sad that Steve Gordon died just a year after the "Arthur" was released. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, which is available as of 1/2007, that is so / so. Although the quality of the video jump over old copies of VHS, there is still no widescreen version. <br /> <br /> DVD has a few extras that are nice, but it just is not enough. One example is the commentary from the director on how he is keen as some remote takes and scenes could be included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make a tough choice for the final editing. DVD, being the ideal format for the inclusion of such material, of course, must be offered it. <br /> <br /> This is the original "Arthur", a classic comedy, which is one for the books.
