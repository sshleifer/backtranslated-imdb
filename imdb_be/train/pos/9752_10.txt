Vaugely I remember seeing it when I was 3 years old when my parents accidentally sealed by all but a few seconds later it is with some other caricature. When I was about 8 or 9 years old, when I re-opened it, and as I was then able to understand things better, I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward just a few weeks ago (June 2006), when I re-re discovered it thanks to some online articles / video clips and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with children, but we have 20-30 Somethings it's definitely got the "cult status" written all over it. It's a shame that initial production has gone through a painful process; when Fox gave him enough time, he is likely to be more recognizable in the public eye today. Maybe, if they were to remake it with a very different history and an all-star voice cast it could be, but it is for Fox |, to decide. I'm awkward here, I know. I still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great.
