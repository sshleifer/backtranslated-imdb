Very intense thriller in the chaos of the city of São Paulo, the largest and third-world ugly nightmare in the Brazilian Urban. For the sake of making it easy for those who are wondering about this intrigue and really well made film, it has a grain size of the Mexican feature, "Amores Perros" with a character not too far from the Max Cady, both from Cape Fears, although not by any means, the film a psychopath. The two partners (Alexandre Borges and Mark Rica) for a construction company pay a hitman Anisio (Miklos) to their third partner (and controlling shareholder) in this building decoration. The murder blamed on the city, but things are starting to look very bleak indeed, as a witty and charismatic walking Anisio nightmare decides that he wants to be around very nervous conspirators, not only faithless, but, more importantly, measures of social deconstruction of codes constituting the Brazilian society . Anisio turns poverty into a relationship, and he wants to. It looks almost entirely handheld, grainy, a remarkable performance throughout, especially as the first time the actor (and a member of the classic Brazilian pop group «TITAS»), Paulo Miklos, blinds and Baffles viewer with its pretty funny social terror. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie in the movie Brasília Fest in November 2001, it has since done very well at Sundance and Berlin.
