Dominion Tank Police uncoated doubt one of the most amazing shows ever created, but not only in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) consists essentially of action and fun, the second part is a more serious and should not be considered a second portion in exactly the same way as the first part. Subtlety is really out of this world and features beyond brilliant. You need to have an additional degree of intelligence to appreciate the subtleties of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). I have some complaints though. In the first part, Bonaparte tank literally jumps over the tank shell, and it makes no sense at all. You can also call into question the credibility of Bonaparte jumping on a helicopter wing, even if it was cool. Buaku rules.
