Overshadowed by the "Braveheart" was released in the same year, two costume dramas pray comparison. I admit my bias against Mel Gibson, but I maintain a rational preference "Rob Roy." Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" irresistibly draw the history of Scottish blood, romantic way. "Braveheart" epic ode to personal honor and courage and a great imagination revenge. It is also melodramatic, and sentimental anachronism. Note cornball its use of slow motion shooting. His violence as ugly and nice. This last quality that makes it more attractive to teenagers thinking. While the "Braveheart" superior "Rob Roy" in sheer slaughter levels (not to mention his condescending time), the last film ultimately more mature and satisfying. Its effect is more understated, even more amazing and intelligent. His sex is less spectacular, but more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has implemented a romantic interest. Its interactive attempts bring poetry period. His decayed teeth in the mouths of the actors are trying to get closer to the era of dentistry. Tim Roth and a wonderful villain. Also recommended: "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Patriot." You can find the latest looks more like "Braveheart" with its emphasis on the bloodlust, the first is more like "Rob Roy" in tone. All of the above films deserve their evaluation R for violence.
