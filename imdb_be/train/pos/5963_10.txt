This movie is terrible, but you have to see it because of this. I'm not here to discuss the whole film, only the greatest chase scene ever. If Eddie dumbs milk to Timea, he gets coining along the corridor. Eddie puts obstacles Jocks with hilarious consequences (eg, plates nailing on trumpet, buy DVD and watch it slowly). Best hurdle is knocked over a bucket of mop that one athlete jumps over but output to slide along the ground from the door. But when it slides it accelerates thereby defying physics (mainly friction); but what lies behind the door is the highest. Steep stairs in any school ever, that the athlete moves to the CLEAR, in the air. In fact, he probably would have died of a broken neck. Moreover, it defies all notions of reality, it makes a funny noise is ever done in this situation. Go and buy it. Believe me, this scene is worth your 6 bucks.
