"The Golden Child" was the first movie of Eddie Murphy as his megahit "Beverly Hills." And even if it is not as good as "CPC", is a fun comic adventure. Murphy stars as a finder of lost children, which is assigned to the most unusual case. Its purpose: to find the protagonist, a child with mystical powers. This film could have been called the "Beverly Hills, and the Temple of Doom", as part of this movie plays like a Spielbergian adventure, sort of like a comedy of Indiana Jones. He received a comedy with laughs and adventure with special effects. Lots of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
