My favorite horror film. With the length of the first tracking shot at the final turn of the story, it is a masterpiece of Carpenter. <br /> <br /> Halloween night in 1963, little Michael Meyers killing his older sister. All-Hallows-the eve of 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove Hospital. Halloween night, Michael came home to kill again. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Michael stalks and kills a nurse. Many called or whistles, just the basics. It is almost over powering atmosphere Carpenter fear that generates a voltage. Like any great horror film events telegraphed well in advance, but they still seem to happen by chance, never allowing the audience a chance to second guess the movie. <br /> <br /> In the dark lighting, long steady shots -cam, and (most importantly) that damned awful music creates a very claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I still have to see the movie. There is a body count, but compared to kill those slashers after quite a bit. This most kills almost bloodless. Fear is not of death, but not knowing. <br /> <br /> Effective dance well. PJ Soles provides most of the film is limited to humor (and one of the best Death), Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance, then there is a young (at the time) Jamie Lee Kertis-. Her performance on the ground, seems shy and not confident, but you'll quickly realize that it's perfect for the character that he is shy and non-certified and not quite ready for what she was to face. And, of course, it is absolutely reject Pleasence as defined (perhaps a bit unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Mr. Pleasence rest of the world. <br /> <br /> If the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be over time. Since the release of this film so many years ago, almost countless clones, copy, rip-offs and imitators do not come and steal (usually bad) movies best bits, until almost all of it was familiar. In conjunction with the changes to the expectations of the audience and appetites, one finds a lot of movies diluted brute force. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it should be treated as it was before, and something unique. <br /> <br /> However, I have reservations with highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good, scary time. The highest Reguards. <br /> <br /> 10/10
