I had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for more than 40 years, since my fifth grade teacher, a native Texan, told about those he had seen in his youth. Fortunately, I have lived my entire life in the mid-Atlantic states, where tornadoes are rare and usually not as stringent as those in the Midwest, but I had two close encounters, one in software and others New Jersey, in the past decade. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the family scenes, in particular, conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. If a tornado was close, Dan knew that most of what he had to do, and he probably learned about it at school, so I know what a tornado safety is an important issue in parts of the US, where these storms are more frequent. However, the characters in the movie did two things that some people think are supposed to be done or safe to do the tornado, but in fact should not be made or unreliable. <br /> <br /> If the siren sounded the first Dan and Arthur went through the house and opened the window. For many years, this is what people are told to do, but the safety of a tornado websites currently do not advise to do it. In addition, people were shown hiding in a highway overpass. This technique was made popular in the early 1990s, video, made during the TV crew relatively weak tornado in Kansas. However, in the most severe tornado, people can be sucked out of these overpasses. This happened during the outbreak in May 1999 in Oklahoma. <br /> <br /> tornado hit in this movie in the fall, which is not common for them to make it happen. (Again, one of my close meetings held in late September.) In addition, they traveled to the north-west to south-east, while the majority of these storms in the northern hemisphere are from the southwest to the northeast. However, this is not all that unusual. Known tornado that struck Joliet, Illinois, in the early 1990s, traveling in that direction (as did the one that is involved in my other acquaintance). <br /> <br /> I think that the film had to be installed in the spring of this film based on the book, which in turn was based on a real event that took place June 3, 1980, however, it was still an exciting story .
