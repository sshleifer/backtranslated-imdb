For fans of Colombo, like me, this episode episodes that have made the case why Columbo was so popular, and how good he really is. Ruth Gordon Field Day (as always), playing wittily intelligent crime novelist Abigail Mitchell. It seems that Abigail called her nephew-in-law to sign some documents, making him his heir. She never got over the death of his niece, and convinced her husband was dead niece (Charles Frank) did the dirty deed. To say more would be impossible. Mariette Hartley is a cunning role as personal assistant Abigail. This episode of Columbia in a class by itself. It's really well made TV movie. I recommend it most highly.
