"Fox" is one movie that I remember, for this image of teenagers in the late 1970s. As I was the age of Jodie Foster, I connected with this movie. It is a disappointment, temptation, attitude and rebellious youth. The soundtrack is excellent with inspiring rock, for example. "More than a feeling" Boston and boring style number "on the radio," Donna Summer. Music my late teens. Yes, I will always remember this, even if it was not huge.
