Jackie Chan, in the opinion of many films and martial arts fans in the movie as one of the greatest stars of action ever to decorate a movie screen, and Police Story has strengthened its reputation as a likely successor to the late great Bruce Lee. If Enter The Dragon bare so-called greatness rapper Lee in the 70s, the same can be said about the Police Story Jackie Chan in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy, or any of its US efforts- one film that really embodies the perfection of Chen, not to mention a blow from its status as a high leg kick, crushing bones kung- fu mascot as well as his film career was this police operation the first in a series of successful police films set in the mainland, in Hong Kong today. <br /> <br /> I saw that many of his efforts- well as US-based Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and tuxedo in a roll and opened many of them pale in comparison to the police story. In these films, we saw less "dumbed down" version of Jackie, of which did not get the opportunity to use their combat abilities to the maximum, not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as Drunken Master, police story called. <br /> <br /> The stunts in this film are extraordinary and are the best features in any action movie. Shopping center stage is literally one of a kind and not be seen to be believed: flying shards of glass, Chan, who left hanging outside the bus only stick like crazy desperately chases through the streets of the city, and Chiang successfully making use of all kinds of inanimate objects, and propyl devices as a weapon to fight the bad guys with. <br /> <br /> Given that he is known for causing harm and breaking every bone in his body, and putting himself in danger, perseverance Jackie to show his versatility as a stunt himself without relying on a few of wills his reputation as an expert in kung fu. Especially because he has the bruises to show for it. Thus, he proved that he is not a one-trick pony when it comes to developing and coming up with different and smart-looking moves. <br /> <br /> The story-wise, there is not much to discuss, but what it lacks in the story, he agrees with its end-to-end action and fight sequences. As for the dialogue, which is not really a huge aspect of the film and that is why the majority of fans of Jackie and martial arts films are more interested in the action, as opposed to history. <br /> <br /> Unlike Say matrix, there are no wires or CGI, or any form of computer fraud participation. What you see is what you get- and what you get with the Police Story Jackie Chan is a great epic, full of action and pulsating stunts.It for miles better than the Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour, and all his other American efforts. <, Br /> <br /> Police Story great film and one I would definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice fan of Jackie Chan, but are not sure which one to watch first.
