Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, violent, well-made film about a pickpocket (Widmark), who accidentally aquires top secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage. In addition, participation in the Jean Peters as a hard Broad, which is used as a courier for her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. This is a film noir at best, and although the performances are very good its great character actress Thelma Ritter, who steals the film. How to sell Moe tired street peddler neck ties (and which also sells the information), she is terrific in the role, which earned her another nomination. Its surprising that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Oscar, and she never won. This was to be the role that pointed to her!
