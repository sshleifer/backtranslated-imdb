Since the celebration of Christmas has evolved over the years, whether one focuses on religious or secular tradition, is a time when people need to behave a little better for each other. It somehow slipped past a Scrooge, merchant and money lender in the nineteenth century in London. <br /> <br /> As his nephew reveals his uncle, he does not keep Christmas in any case, because Scrooge feels all this is nonsense. Humanity as Scrooge was superseded long ago, he had a bad case, much like his 20th century counterpart, Mr. Potter Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But, as Charles Dickens told the story, the redemption is not too late for any of us and lonely ghost and three ghosts visit Scrooge and show him how to do it. <br /> <br /> A Christmas Carol is a timeless holiday classic, we sometimes forget that it is a social commentary of the 19th century Great Britain, like Oliver Twist has been. The characters in this movie, the middle and lower class. In Cratchit couple of steps above the street people in Oliver Twist, but they have to fight to stay there. Nevertheless, love and happiness radiate his house, no thanks guy Bob Cratchit works. <br /> <br /> As George Bailey, who made a whole lot of good things in your life and just had to resemble as Scrooge needed a wake up call to the potency, he still had to do good in this old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart in their live performances and filmed the game are pretty much took over the part of Scrooge. But George C. Scott captures an old miser is very good in this movie. Baseness of it, but with a tinge of sadness that makes us root for the change. Scott joins the great tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, who already made great interpretation of Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting roles, I particularly enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as cordial and harsh spirit of Christmas present. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb is one of the 32 variants of A Christmas Carol did, that they are archived, and is one of the best.
