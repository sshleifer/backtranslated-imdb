«Xizao», a story about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions as well as its impact on the family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) leads him to believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu), died. He bases that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his old father's business, a public bath. <br /> <br /> film centers around a family Da Ming, and he must learn the meaning of his father's work, that he always believed the old tradition, which was supposed to die in the near future. In addition, the film explores his relationship with Al-Ming, who is mentally handicapped, as well as the problems of a small community and, as in a bathroom is a place that not only purifies their bodies, but also souls. <br /> <br /> two main themes of the film, the family and progress problems incredibly well treated, and the film never loses the point he is trying to do, both subjects very well developed, and we get an idea of ​​the Chinese society and customs. <br /> <br /> Director, Yang Zhang, tells his story in a simple manner, allowing the characters characters do the job. This is a very simple approach, but it fits the movie perfectly, and I doubt very much that a different style will fit the movie is good. Zhang has great potential, since it can tell a story without the help of visual flashes or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> The current outstanding of its naturalistic approach, each operates in a very natural way, and it looks almost as if they were real people filmed. Three main characters give excellent performances, and in Jiang as Er Ming, of course, dwarfs. <br /> <br /> Even if the film would adhere to the indulgent "old days was much better" message, instead it takes the equilibrium ratio, as saying that progress is good and we have to move on, but we must not forget where we came from, and to keep a balance between modern life and the traditions of old. <br /> <br /> strange and touching film. 8/10
