Although Super Mario 64 is not like the other games in the series, it is still a classic and is as good as the old games. Games with this much replay value are few and far apart. In addition, this game has so much variety. There are 15 levels, each with a number of different tasks that can be done, and a lot of other hidden problems. The game is not very complicated, but its lack of a call does not take away from the game at all. After you beat it, you want to uninstall the game and start over. And its just as much fun the second time or a third time, or two hundredth time. A must have for any owner of the Nintendo 64, and is the cause of itself have the Nintendo 64.
