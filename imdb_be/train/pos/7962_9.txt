Very few so-called "remakes" can be just as good as the originals. This one crosses the border with flying colors. Just a remake, I do not think so! I saw it theatrically in the age of nine, and was completely fascinated and impressed by the film. <br /> <br /> The film certainly offers to compare its 1963 counterpart. Earlier, the film is also an enjoyable and entertaining film, but we must admit that, as a rule, feel more like a nature documentary than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a must-see for animal lovers. We have a wise old golden retriever, shadow; acute, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and a young, cheerful American bulldog chance. Animals brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox, respectively. <br /> <br /> There is virtually nothing offensive in the film. There is a bit scatological humor, but nothing extreme. No hard violence, collect some tense scenes involving beating waterfall, an angry porcupine, and dark train shaft. <br /> <br /> funny, frightening, moving and above all real, it surprised me to see that this film did not win any awards, but not alone. However, I must say that it is just as good as some of the best Picture nominees at the moment.
