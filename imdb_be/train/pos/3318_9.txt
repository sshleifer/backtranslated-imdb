Very nice movie with a great background shown in Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and an easy film junkie, he hit a home run for me. Lots of laughter and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real and real players all references to past Bosox failure. And how nice it is to watch movies with a baseball theme without suffering the excess, over rolling hills, selfish Kevin Costner is trying to make a believer out of a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did an excellent job, as a young couple in love, suffering from Bosox Jimmy "Jones." It was a bit eccentric and in left field, but in fact supporters of socks that that fanatic and live their lives through the fate of their favorite team. The film is floated forward at a rapid pace and the ending, though predictable, had charm and sentimentality of many other popular films, without being overly pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasant return to the screen Garzon. I miss the ever-popular «Stanford Blatch» by Sex & the city. He was always funny, even if he does or says very little. <br /> <br /> So buy yourself two places box, popcorn and get ready to have fun. "Fever Pitch" is the winner.
