Simply put, Oliver! this is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It is filled with memorable songs - «Food Glorious Food», «! Oliver", "Consider yourself" and "Oom-pah-pah", to name just a few - and no less memorable characters <br /> <br />. film musical adaptation of the classic novel by Charles Dickens, as well as the history of Oliver Twist yourself, this is the perfect family film. There are some scary moments - the villain Bill Sykes played Oliver Reed scary enough on their own - but in general, the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults <br /> <br /> History -., Which is almost all, of course, familiar with now - it revolves around a young orphaned boy named Oliver, and his life growing up in London. At first he lived in wages with the rest of his fellow orphans, but after hesitating to Mr. Bumble, the caretaker, he sold the family as a servant. <br /> <br /> After a series of mishaps and close shaves, he meets the Artful Dodger - superbly played a young Jack Wild, who gives his all in the role - and through it, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), which teaches young boys to pick pocket the treasures he keeps for himself. <br /> <br /> The film was shot only in the studio and on the pavilion in Shepperton film studios, but it does not translate at all to shoot. Sets perfectly replicate the Victorian London, as well as costumes worn by the characters. Multi-Oscar and a huge success on its release, Oliver! is a worthy contender for best music constantly and will please anyone who loves cinema.
