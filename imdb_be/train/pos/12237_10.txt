Mating Game magical, entertaining film from the era gone by. Hollywood should consider magical remake of this film. My wife and I would go to see him. <br /> <br /> This is a great romantic comedy, that my wife and I looked at the AMC. <br /> <br /> This film has Tony Randall at its best. Debbie Reynolds was great as always. <br /> <br /> I liked very much. We plan to order on DVD, to add to our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood .... time to dig some of these types of scenarios from an old safe, to update them a bit (without spoiling the original film and the script as you did with the other remakes) and the conduct casting. <br /> <br /> remake will be a big hit on the silver screen, DVD, and cable / SatTV. <br /> <br /> C.
