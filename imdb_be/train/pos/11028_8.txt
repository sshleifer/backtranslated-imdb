To be honest, I did not like that much in this movie when I saw it the first time. But I think the problem is that I have not seen it in the theater. Big mistake! As the # 1 thing to see in the Cliffhanger is a configuration and number 2 is the cinema. Try to see this movie on the big screen possible and a great sound system. The music is good and puts the film to a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I see, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> It is definitely one of the best films Renny Harlin. This guy knows about the action. Die Hard 2, The Long Kiss goodbye, etc. And it is especially good in this movie. The special effect of large and spectacular. Stallone really need this movie to come back with success. Still good to see it!
