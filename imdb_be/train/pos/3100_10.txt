By the end of the first hour of my jaw was settled between my legs. The film never and I mean never, does not allow the action. It can be mild action, but this action. Once again, each member of the cast is ideal. The explosions are realistic, achievable chase scene, and the fight was unbelievable. Matt Damon will always be Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> All I really have to say that each Bourne movie is getting better, and this is no exception. The action rate plot. How they do it, I'll never know. I welcome the man who wrote plays on the screen, each of these films. Because if he did such a great job with the first film, we would not have to say it. <br /> <br /> So do not see in theaters, go experience it in theaters if it's still, where you live, but if not December 11 Bourne comes home to you!
