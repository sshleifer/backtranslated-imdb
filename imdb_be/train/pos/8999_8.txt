These films do not make any ambitious effort to hide his true genre - mannered B movie. The apartment will be out to tell you at the beginning of the definition of sweet. It should also give an adjective meaning cheese. But the two come together in this film in ways that make you go Â«Hmmmmm ... so stupid!" And then you laugh. For example, there is a scene back in the '16th-century Japan, "which shows a pair of Samurai walking in the foreground of the temple. Against the background of the temple, there are few tourists, gazing into the distance in slippers and shorts. Hmmm ... hahahah! I could not help laughing. And acting comes from a decent, to moderate, to my Lord, but that's what makes it funny. You will see some decent actors, and then find other really terrible. I must digress, though, because I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays, and it is amazing. Its air time in the film was quite short, though. I also saw Brian Yamasaki in several plays on the islands during my visits, and it is also better in the theater than in this film. In any case, it is an entertaining film, if you do not got nothing to do on a weekday evening.
