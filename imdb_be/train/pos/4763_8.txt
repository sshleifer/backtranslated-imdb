Unlike other comments, I found the film fascinating, even with all its flaws and some zombie action actors. <br /> <br /> As a technologist, I found that interesting experiments and hardware realistic. While reading the minds of people using the computer sounds fantastic, experiments are carried out now to do just that. I note that these experiments at a very early stage, the results are still not profitable. <br /> <br /> The characters in the film are well cast. Girl, although replays bit dumb looks good. The truck driver is the spitting image of the real truck drivers. The Minister questioned the first (principal investigator said the minister, that his (the Minister), not sure if he believed that God created man, or the man created by God. But at the same moment, when the chips are down, he falls back on his faith. only Ph.D. playing zombies. secrets that they hide suitably fit for their characters. they react like real people will be in the face of death. <br /> <br /> The film is a warning against the danger of unlimited surveillance by government. As strictly a thriller, the film does not have enough etc. stryh sensations. As a scientific exercise with the philosophical foundations of fun.
