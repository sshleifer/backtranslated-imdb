Frankly, I had to go see this movie in reverse, did not expect so much, but hey, I was not deceived, I had a good time. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film is the way that a fresh wind, despite some evidence that they tried to upgrade the Nancy Drew, but it made me think these youth films 60-70s from Europe and Quebec, where they manage to have children receive interaction with adults. In this case, 16-year-old trying to do justice, trying to solve the mystery regarding the death of the actress, who died 25 years ago. In any case, since her father was a business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a secret behind the door? Well, at least, Emma Roberts does a great job here. Curious as chubby children, who first brought the naive support pranks her sister Nancy, but eventually found Nancy quite cool enough to stick with it, even with your questions ... <br /> <br /> rest supporting cast is great and was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook in a different role this time: a single mother (she made it to rescue the family, but this time, she plays a mature woman ...) in any case, don 't blame it, it's fun!
