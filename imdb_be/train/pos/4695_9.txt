What happened to Michael Keaton? What a great actor, and he proves it in this movie. This film actually FUNNY! And the reason why this film is funny for two reasons: a great script and Michael Keaton. This film is one of the funniest comedies in Hollywood history. This film is the ultimate parody of gangster films. In this movie, Hollywood actually ridicules himself by using the gangster film genre as the basis for a truly original comedy. The rest of the cast is funny too, especially the support cast. If you want to laugh and want to watch a movie that contains a non-stop humor, this movie is for you.
