QED was a brilliant show, and he was really one of the very few planning is behind! I suspect that in this era of TIVO and recording devices, it would be much better than it was in 1982. I'm looking forward to it available on DVD! <br /> <br /> While it's true that it has some common with other television shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and Adventure Brisco County Jr., all of which I am a big fan of, QED had much more intellectual quality. He did not suffer because of this, however - the dialogue was witty and action was high. The show ran in the UK as the mastermind, and it was something from the BBC feel to it, but it is better than the value of BBC production, as a rule, were in that era. <br /> <br /> I was nineteen guy when the series originally ran, and it was too much to do in his life, to find the time for television. I remember, my dear mother, however, calling me to remind me that it was required to prove was included, and we will sit on the phone and watch it together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was required to prove a sad loss, and if it can be done with the same quality and values ​​of today, I would like to see it make a return.
