While on the plane, flipping a large selection of movies, I came across the ether! almost by accident. oh boy! choices. <br /> <br /> I remembered vaguely saw the trailer for more than a year ago and had forgotten all about it, without waiting for any more than the other cheesy nonsense movie about stupid reality show. Now I can easily say that it was a hell of a ride. I can not remember the last time I was so excited, scared. Not sure if it was a high altitude, playing with my feelings, but it is unknown to grow gradually through the film until the climax, when you can not look away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the rest of nails you "ve got . <br /> <br /> You'll be the first to go through the personal moral assessment of where you stand on the righteousness of the show. You'll drift off thinking "how people can be so wicked," to "why not, after all?". Ask yourself what you are doing it. Then learn about competitors, their motivations and begin to guess. You will then see the contestant to trigger one by one and carried away, even if you know that the first candidate security. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good directing, a film experience that reminds you of those old movies where you know what will happen in the next scene, but still crave more <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * a few things I would change: <br /> <br /> - the casting of the participants .. I was really moved to the farmers, and we had a little more like him. The idea of ​​a wealthy writer who wants to be known is a bit silly, it felt like you do not care about some of the participants. Although this may have been done on purpose, I think that the audience were able to relate to most competitors. - rules of games, big glitch: <br /> <br /> What happens if 5 participants did not die when he pulls the trigger. You seriously think the last man standing will pull the trigger and run himself !!! they had to give all participants a chance to live, namely :. if the fifth is empty, too, that no one dies <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I have not bothered too much by this bad moments, because I really had a good time. Only I wish I had popcorn with me!
