As other reviewers have noted it is unfair neglected Depression-era film. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written Swerling (Leave her to heaven, Westerner, Lifeboat, etc.), this sober, well-structured and -realized progress of the inhabitants of the slums of New York, they are scammers, beggars, and women forced into prostitution, but they are a community of people, both good and bad, with loyalty as hard as you. <br /> <br /> Perhaps any group, the main among the many outstanding qualities of this film is the contrast between the character of Spencer Tracy, Bill and Loretta Young, Trina. He's tough-talking, aggressive, and, apparently, fearless-- but Bill Sun character who gives the film its sense of survival steel. While it is blunting, Trina actually hangs tough (if the term can be applied to a character, so feminine). Her devotion to him, obviously, and complete. When she becomes pregnant, she says she will raise it himself, if he wants to leave, or "I even give up the child, if you will be happy." This dignity perform Loretta Young (under 20 years), as a fairly simple character that she seems to be no weak or dependent, and the woman who recognizes happiness when she finds him, and does not want anything more.
