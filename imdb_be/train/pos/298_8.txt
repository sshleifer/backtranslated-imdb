New York never looked so good! And neither has anyone in this film. Although the scenario is a little light, you can not help but like this film or any of the characters in it. You almost wish people like this actually exist. The attractiveness of the actors that really put it on (John Ritter, Colleen Camp, and the late Dorothy Stratten particularly good.) Go ahead and rent or buy the movie you'll be glad you did.
