We throw around the "superstar" of the term way too easy these days, but here's a guy who really deserves. <br /> <br /> I was glued to the set of the whole show. The choice of songs was perfect - it contains only the songs that I really wanted to hear and I cut with documentary footage while weaker new songs. I loved that the group was only five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs this power, you do not need a circus fun). <br /> <br /> Shots of the crowd were strange, too. How many artists can affect the original supporters of the Beatles (they now have the 50s and beyond), to get young children to jump into the first lines of "Can not Buy Me Love" and influence at all between them? <br /> <br /> While watching, I also realized that after the tragic death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, instantly became an afterthought. Paul not only did not lose, John and George (no matter what their final relationship was, it must be hard to lose someone with whom you have changed the world), but he also lost his wife Linda, and never seemed to raise the recognition of Lennon's murder I received. I agree that killing Lennon was terrible, but now I realized that Paul was a kind of forgotten later. I was very happy that he has found love again in Heather <br /> <br /> does not apply to those who complain about the quality of audio / video, I had no complaints whatsoever. They were both crystal clear on my set. I think that these same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the format goes; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> I just regret that I did not buy a ticket for this show, when I had the chance. With this video, I was able to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If people remember John Lennon, they first think of his murder, and then his music. Now I have a new understanding of Paul McCartney, because if nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first. And let us hope that another crazy not change it because McCartney catalog very well.
