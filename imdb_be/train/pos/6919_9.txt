"Winchester 73" was the first in a series of Westerns featuring James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. As in most of them is a hero Stuart violent edge that threatens to explode at any moment. <br /> <br /> The name refers to "one thousand" rifles that to compete in rifle shooting, which took place in Dodge City on July 4, 1876. The city is a Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his sidekick High Spade (Millard Mitchell), who are on the trail of Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) last despicable act. They arrive just in time to see the Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) operates salon girl Lola (Shelley Winters) from the city. It turns out that Dutch Henry also in rifle shooting. Lin and Dutch Henry shoot for the coveted prize of victory ropes, but Dutch Henry ropes robbing a gun and runs away. <br /> <br /> Lin and High Spade trace Dutch Henry across the country, where they encounter Lola with her cowardly dandy Steve Miller (Charles Drake) held in the US Cavalry camp in anticipation of Indian attack led by the calf (Rock Hudson), bought an expensive rifle, killing the treacherous gun runner John McIntyre. He received weapons by deceit Dutch Henry poker. The young bull was killed in the attack and the gun goes to Steve. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the ranch, Lola and Steve meet a notorious bandit Waco Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea), who kills Steve and takes iconic rifles and Lola for himself. Dean meets with Dutch Henry, it allows him to regain his "gun" is planning to kill him later. In Tuscosa city, Lin kills Dean Henry as the Dutch holding company plans to the bank is going badly and he flees into the mountains with Lin in the pursuit. In one of the best final shoot-outs ever, they will meet in the final battle. <br /> <br /> I believe that this film was just one of collaboration Stewart / Mann, who was shot in B & W. This beautifully photographed, especially the scene in the "wide open spaces" and, in particular, in the final battle. Stewart plays against type, playing the hero with a hard edge revenge motive, emotion, which he will perform in the future films with Manna. <br /> <br /> As with most universal westerns, this one has a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day. In addition to the above, JC Flippen is like a cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson in various henchmen, Ray Teal as Sheriff chase the Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as a rookie soldier and Edmund Cobb , Chief Youlachi and John War Eagle in various roles in Dodge City sequence. <br /> <br /> classic western in every sense of the word. He is responsible for the re-generation of Stuart career as a star of action.
