I still watch a movie with Nolte in it that I did not like. However, that being said, he made a lot of movies, and I've only seen a few. In my minds eye I keep pictures of his performance here and the one in "The Thin Red Line." Nolte has a full range of acting talent. If it is necessary to shout it roars like a wounded lion. Its best moments are the ones I put in the actors that if he just emotes through the face, hands and body gestures, not uttering a word. Having come to the conclusion that our current generation of actors, by and large, do not have an estimate of what the actor can do without words, without a conscious appreciation of mastering Keaton and Chaplin, this generation of actors belongs too much on mechanical wizardry of computers. Of course, it is also just a sign of the times we live in. If Chaplin had lived in our time .... who knows, it just might also become an avid fan of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I have not read Vonnegut novel from which the film comes to the screen. However, the plot is not so far-fetched or confused that we can not follow the paths laid out, even with all its surprises. Of course, in the beginning, it seems absurd. However, it is also not impossible <br /> <br /> Consider these for beginners :. Spy in the heart of the Third Reich: He Extraordinary Life Fritz Kolbe, that the most important Spy America during the Second World War, Delattre and Pritchard (look at Amazon for more details). Discuss: Secret History of Piercing the Reich: American Spies Inside Nazi Germany DVD (I have seen it here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054), seems to be the production of History Channel. <br /> <br /> So, the story is ridiculous? Contrived so, it is impossible, no. Back to the story. Nolte character typed and takes an incredibly dangerous mission, and unfortunately, the script does not give us an adequate reason why it takes. Was it a kind of passivity that he got caught up in this role, as he says, because it was the best story he ever wrote, and it should play a role? This is a difficult thing to imagine any of us understand. But it was an unusual time and people do strange things. <br /> <br /> The current throughout the film as a whole cast is superb, and as people say, Alan Arkin, always fantastic, very well in a small. role <br /> <br /> I was really shocked by the ending of the film (no - I will not spoil it), and it made me feel terrible about the choice. Perhaps this person believes that the road was finally over, and he said all that was necessary, and that more would be added to the head of the life already filled with numerous burnt pages? Hard to say, but it really shocks. <br /> <br /> Nolte gives one of the best performances that can be expected .... the film room will make you think about many things. This is a very interesting and provoking. What a great movie should be. A bit long, but worth it. By the way, the film music has a choice of one of the best living composers: PÃ¤rt.
