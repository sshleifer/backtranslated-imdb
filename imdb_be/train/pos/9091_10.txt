Fairytale film. With everything you could want in a film. Huge battle scenes and lots of other activities. Exciting, and romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Kind of like the old swordsman movie. Fully entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> editing was quick, and you never get bored for a second. The story is similar to the classic story of trouble in the royal court. Actors are beautiful and magnificent sets. The costumes are spectacular stunt work and imagination. Special effects, too strange. <br /> <br /> Garry Stretch is really impressive, as an actor and a great look. It looks like the right choice for a super star. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies as beautiful as it is usually. He is one of the greatest actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is beautiful and perfect for a leading lady, even doing an English accent with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I've learned that the film has won numerous awards, and I can understand why. <br /> <br /> In general, it is an amazing independent film. See, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give it a TEN + !!!
