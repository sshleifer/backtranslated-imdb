While I agree that this is good, but not a great film for many of the reasons mentioned other posters, I still like it. One reason is the music: I would like to draw attention to a very cool appearance from Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - in a well-staged scene in a nightclub. These guys are two of the best jazz trumpeters of his time, and they manage to convincingly impressed mind Jimmy Stewart playing a hysterical trumpet duet, one tube in each of the ears of Stuart. Candolis really play, that's fine too, although I suspect that the actual music for this scene was later named the two of them. I do not know much about George Dunning, who gets credit for the music (except that he seems to have worked with the Three Stooges on more than one occasion), but the casting of the brothers Candoli jazz-playing witch was a real nice touch.
