This is better than the average of the silent movie, and it's still worth a look if you are a fan of Silents. However, if you are not a supporter of the genre, I suggest you try a few other films before watching it. This is because the story just seems rather old-fashioned and hard to believe in spots. But, despite this, it is still a good movie, and kept my interest. <br /> <br /> cute ladies, unfortunately, hooked up with the wrong person and ran away to marry him. The film begins five years after she came to realize that he really is a cruel thief. Despite this, she is trying to make the best of it and do not dwell on how to live well until this jerk came into her life. However, the rent is due and no money, so the woman is forced to look for work. It becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady, her husband tries to swing the deal. Unfortunately, the lady, they are trying to connect a potential client to dinner can not do it, and seamstress paid handsomely to be the date that person. Well, like Cinderella, it cleans very well, and the man captured with her! What to do now - given that it is actually married and the new guy wants to marry her? Well, watch the movie yourself to see how it all solved. I do not like the way they treated my husband as it seemed awfully predictable and formulaic. However, as soon as he was out of the way, I admire how the film also did not give up the by-the-numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends. <br /> <br /> In general, a very good film worth seeing, but certainly not great.
