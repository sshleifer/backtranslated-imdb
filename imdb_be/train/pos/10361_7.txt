After you choose your jaw from the floor in the knowledge that they are ... not so ... able to put this thing together so quickly that he was released in the same year it ended, you'll discover that it's not half bad plot is attractive and interesting, and walks quickly, this covers a lot of situations, and thus often jumps quickly to the next row or after the two were told. Where it really stands out, which is valid. Views are outstanding. Neill and Streep is flawless. It's also cool to hear so many Australian say in a Hollywood movie, and even those who did not come naturally to him, at least try to focus. The cinematography and editing are good enough, but they do not really go beyond the standard material. The story of this film is compelling and the fact that it is valid only makes it all the more frightening. Despite the fact that I have not read the novel, or heard about what happened outside this picture, I realize that it is very close to the truth. There are some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in it. It is, at times, downright large room drama sessions. I recommend it to any fan of this fellow. 7/10
