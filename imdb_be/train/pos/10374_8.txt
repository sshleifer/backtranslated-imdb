I just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 minute roll. <br /> <br /> Roll a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone), who has a dream to become a sports star. Mat goes to the city and should be picked up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster, Little (John Batchelor) and makes the delivery to him. Needless to say, Mat gets involved in the world George. <br /> <br /> I thought it was great as George Mat teach certain morals and respect while George Mat teaches how to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien were well matched together and did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> Every character in the film complement each other very well, two policemen were great. David Ngumbuzharra brought great comic in the movies. Tiny played pretty gangster, who reminded me of one of my favorite characters Panda "with two hands. <br /> <br /> One of the other things that I liked about the roll that it has demonstrated the city that I grew up and lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. it was good to see the sights and attractions that I grew up with, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> this Rocks «N» Rolls
