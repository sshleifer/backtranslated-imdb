Mark FRECHETTE stars as Mark, radical leftist college. Mark is accused of killing a policeman during a riot campus, and it runs all the way to the desert. It does this by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flies himself. <br /> <br /> After a flying over the desert, Mark sees a car with air. A young woman named Daria comes out and sees Mark circling the plane. Marc plane swoops very low several times, resulting in Darya duck or get hit. When he lands, he met with Daria, which strangely charmed air highjinks Stamps. <br /> <br /> After participating in frank conversations for hours, Mark and Daria undress and make love in the sand. But Mark circumvent the law, they know that he must continue to work. So Mark and Daria short a date quite bitter because he does not get to grow into full-blown romance. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Eraserhead point was from the beginning of the 70s. Both films have a chaotic, vague quality, along with complex meanings and symbols. Frechette was unreasonable person, as his character was in the movie. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed a bank in real life. While serving in prison, Mark died a shameful death. He was killed by the weight of 150 pounds, which fell on him when he was weightlifting. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was a great movie, and special visual effects. Incredible, delayed garbage stage, floating in the air after the explosion, were brilliant. While not as groundbreaking movie like Easy Rider was, Zabriski point still resonates with the beginning of the 70s counterculture. I recommend it for those who love avant-garde films that showcase the turmoil, youth rebellion during the first 70s.
