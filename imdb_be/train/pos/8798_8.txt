First than anything, I will not praise a short film Iñárritu, Mexican and even I am proud of the success of mainstream Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the other hand, I see that most of the reviews focused on their favorite (and not so) short films; but we forget that there is a thin bottom line encircles the entire collection, and perhaps it will not be pleasant for the American people. (Even if it was not the main purpose of producers) <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about the fact that most of the short films do not show the suffering that people went WASP, because the September 11 attack, but the suffering of others . <br /> <br /> You have to prove that I want to say something? Watch a short film in Bosnia, the message: "You are crying because of the people who died in the towers, but we (The Others = Eastern Europeans) are crying for a long time for the crimes committed against our women and no one to pay attention to us, and the world have done to you "<br /> <br /> despite the fact, the history of Burkina Faso in a comedy, there is the same idea :." Are you angry because Osama bin Laden hit you in the evil way, but we (the rest = Africans) should be more angry, because our people are dying of hunger, poverty and AIDS a long time ago, and no one pays attention to us as the whole world did you »<br /> <br /> Now take a look at Sean Penn's short:.. the fall of the twin towers makes you happy on a desert (and alienated) human Thus, the message that power and greed (symbolizes the tower) should fall because people see the sunrise and the flowers bloom? it is noteworthy that this terrible bottom line was proposed by an American. There is so much irony in this short film, it is close to be disruptive. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (really knows, because his anti-capitalism ideology) much more clearly, and shameless in going straight to the point :. "You're angry because your country was attacked by evil forces, but we (others = Hispanic) suffered such a date is something worse, and nobody remembers our grief, the whole world should do for you" <br /> <br /> it is as if creativity of this project was going to say to the Americans: "you see now, America, you not only what are the victim of a world of violence, you are not alone in their pain and, by the way, we (others = nonproliferation Americans) were affected much more than you are from a long time ago, so that we stand with you in your pain ... and, by the way, we regret m, because you had some taste of your own medicine "only the Mexican and French short films have shown some compassion and sympathy for the American people; others, like a slap to the US government, which is not equal to the American people.
