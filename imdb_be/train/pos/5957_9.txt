The name speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> I'm not a film critic, and I will not act like the other pathetic people commenting on this film. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the film Waiting for "t have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the action was amazing and the cinematography was great! It looks like you all had a lot of fun doing this film! I voted 9 of 10, as the sound was strong only on one channel, and not how, but I believe it can be a mistake in the DVD recorder. <br /> <br /> I will definitely check out other movies produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, I thank you!
