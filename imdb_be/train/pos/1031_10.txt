This series is set one year after the mission to Abydos in the Stargate movie. This explains a lot of things that the film forgot to mention. Such as how Stargate was activated without human computer? Where Goauldy (born Ra) come from? How much is there? <br /> <br /> The first episode has retired Jack O'Neill (written with two Ls) called back to active duty by General George Hammond of Stargate attacks shut down by Apophis, powerful Goauldami who killed four people and stole one woman . We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims that she has passed through the gates for the first time, and is determined to go at the moment. We see that Daniel married Abydos, and that there are hundreds of gate addresses, which they can collect. Then the wife of Daniel gets captured by Apophis and become his new queen. <br /> <br /> It's still in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC, which includes nine teams, which team will be Jack SG-1, consisting of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, in native Goauldah to save Daniel's wife and another captured in Abydos name Ska'ra. They are captured, and the same as Apophis gave the order to kill them, and many of the other prisoners, the name of the Jaffa Teal'c, First Prime Apophis, store them and goes to Earth with them, where he made a part of SG-1. <br /> <br /> It was only the beginning of the adventure. During the show, they went backwards and forwards, got moved into an alternate reality that exchange officials, aged, Met alien races, which include the rebel alliance called Goauldov tokra in which Pope Samantha becomes a member of the Asgard, a cute little a race in which we see Thor frequently (he a friend of Jack), and avoid global catastrophe on the skin of their teeth countless times. <br /> <br /> show was recently canceled, but it lasted ten seasons. In season nine, a new enemy called the GPL came to showing off a completely new forces, new dangers and discovering new secrets surrounding the Stargate and its creator, Ancient. Season nine and ten have also seen the introduction of two new characters, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1 and Claudia Black as MalDoran Val female man from another world, which brings a new sense of satisfaction in the team. <br /> <br /> Very good production, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all. Another way to travel across the galaxy, as well as different kinds of adventures, this is one show you will not want to miss. Unlock the gate and step by step. You will not regret it!
