I expect it will be the same schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, so I left it unattended for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far succession stupid shootout and car / boat chases, it was almost a thoughtful analysis of how beautiful girl gets to be as hard as nails, with nothing to be overstated or over-rationalized. <br /> <br /> it is likely that the budgetary constraints on the business helped with this: less time and effort was spent on the search for all the silly way stunt pretending to die, and more was dedicated to make the film worth watching. Hell, fight the biggest gun happens behind the scenes - and the scene where he had heard, the better for this background noise, which adds to the suspense - who will win? Who die <br /> <br /> Alexander flock can not be drop dead gorgeous as Monica Vitti, but few of them, and it certainly has every ounce of class and fire, you need to do the job of the character - and the form her personality, her hair, her tall, slender bodies can be removed directly from the comic strip drawing. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Valdano ~ d was the perfect choice for Blaise bad-guy in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch - even pretty (and I doubt that I would consider taking many violent, psychopathic killers as drinking companions). I can not remember any of the "ex-waiters" Hollywood, which could eliminate the role of pulling it well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Blaise villains always die in the end (no spoilers too!) This is a very good thing, because all the girls who like to spend their time swooning over this disgustingly beautiful and interesting chunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary Joes.
