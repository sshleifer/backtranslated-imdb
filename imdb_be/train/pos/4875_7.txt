"My father is still a business trip" was the title of the review after the «Promise Me This" premiere in Cannes. I understand why many think the same, but the unique expression Kusturica is still present in his new film, and this is why critics can not touch him. I was two o'clock in clean energy without rest. Even if Kusturica is suffering from lack of concentration or fear of empty space, it is still a unique and untouched. Surprisingly good idea Stribor Kusturica. Much more close-ups and landscapes less, in "Life is a Miracle". Marija Petronijević is the femme fatale of the world-class potential, please do not spoil it. Of course, I recommend everyone to see this movie.
