Four stories written by Robert Bloch about the different people who live in a beautiful old mansion, and what happens to them. The first has Denholm Elliott as a novelist, which sees the murderer, he writes about to revive. Some terrible moments and twist at the end was good. Second have Cushing becomes obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife. The third is Christopher Lee, who has a child (Chloe Franks) and afraid of her. All this leads to a rather terrible finale (though the ending was much worse in the history). The latter is, and of comedy with John Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (as chewing the scenery) and cloak that turns people into vampires! There's also a cute line about Christopher Lee played Dracula <br /> <br /> It is a good anthology of horror. - nothing terrible, but the first and the end of the third gave me a few nice little chill. In addition, the fourth is actually very funny and Pete makes a very sexy vampire! In addition, the house itself looks beautiful ... and very scary. It is accurate with some nice atmospheric touches. Very good and unusual film score, too. Overall, a good little horror anthology is well worth looking for. Try to see it on DVD - Lions Gate one looks fantastic strong colors and beautiful sound.
