"Welcome to the Collingwood" offers some of the funniest dialogue in recent years. Watching this comedy by Anthony and Joe Brothers director Russo reminded us, another film may be, we have seen in the past, but since we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to find that we were reminded, was one thousand nine hundred fifty-eight Italian film " Great deal on Madonna Street ", directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> Russo brothers put together a wonderful cast to reflect all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Mace, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, it can not be bad. Since it is part of the ensemble of all the characters have the opportunity in which to shine. <br /> <br /> The film introduces us to a group of mindless potential security crackers from hell. No one could think, these people can continue to work as the one they are taken. What could go wrong, and much more, then, that they are able to do. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker, which also saw the embodiment of a rabbi, should only be confused with the priests of the gang members, who come from a funeral. <br /> <br Cossimo /> The best way to enjoy a movie to sit back and relax and let all these small time con artists doing their job. Let them funny lines will make you laugh as well as anyone can see this band is destined from the beginning to the end!
