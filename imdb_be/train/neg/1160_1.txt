This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen. This is (I think) a rebellious college basketball history, its tough but fair coach, his friend and fellow student (played by michael margott), which has a constant nervous breakdowns. History goes nowhere, there is a zero character development, there is no one to take care of, and performance, with the exception of Bruce Dern as a coach badly. It's hard to believe how talent like Jack Nicholson could send such a terrible movie. Make sure to avoid this turkey.
