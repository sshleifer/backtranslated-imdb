The first half of this film is a pure delight. Roman. That's funny. Excellent performance. Middle knit brother and sister living in Manhattan in the fall on the same woman! Adult. Bright. Witty. What more could you ask. The romantic comedy is a refreshing start. He's heading into uncharted territory. And then it will collapse. <br /> <br /> It's coming from the universal adult comedy at puberty come-from-behind-the-closet stories that has been done many times before. What a disappointment. As a man of the film begins with such promise. Why this should be turned into a pedestrian, "I am who I am" film. Freeze ends jumping Heather Graham shot in the air to celebrate "their happiness in finding themselves" emphasizes the banality of the latter part of the film. <br /> <br /> it might be otherwise. it might be magical. it ended up being the same old same old.
