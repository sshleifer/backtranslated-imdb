... child actors annoying. In addition, it seems as if the creators of this film struggled to fill 90 minutes. Decent death scene, though. If not for the death scene, this film will be very Disneyish feelings for him. <br /> <br /> The main character of the child does not seem nearly as scary as it should have been. If I was in the middle of the forest with the tooth fairy ghost killer type person, you can bet your ass I would not wander and ride a bicycle. <br /> <br /> In general, I've seen worse (ie, it is Waits), but it's nothing that I would like to see again or recommend anyone to bother with it if you're not an avid collector of horror.
