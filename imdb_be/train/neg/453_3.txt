Well, the first good: performance of Cher and cinematography. Although I do not Cher fan, it provides excellent performance and part of it was well written. The cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance <br /> <br /> The Rest :. Thin plot, the performance of Nicolas Cage, and fully unhumorous and feeble attempt to reflect the Italian-American family from New York. Firstly, once each time a cell opened his mouth, I cringed. I do not know what accent he tries to use. I honestly did not, he was not sure how some of New York City or Italian accent I've ever heard. It was quite surreal. And it is not because I am a supporter of the accuracy of his voice just cloyed in my ears. And I like Nicolas Cage in other productions. Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have a lot of Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York, and to be honest, I was more laughter and felt more joy in evaluating the Italian ethnic family far than this film provided. And it would be a boring night at home. That summed up.
