Ensemble uninteresting and unsympathetic characters twist and turn your way through the flimsy plot, which can be interesting if you could only bring himself to care. This "twisting and turning" I am saying does not refer to history (which contains all the suspending tuna casserole recipe), but the inability of the director to keep the characters face even remotely centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has a very good nose and left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the film the big names, they are persuaded to do so. If you think that this film was not released in theaters, despite the existence of an all-star cast, you might be inclined to think that something stinks. <br /> <br /> In fact, it does.
