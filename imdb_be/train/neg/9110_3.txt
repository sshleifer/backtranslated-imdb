I watched this movie on 3'o am, while on the same day, where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. Still, I think it was not good, this movie was not good at all. The reasons that a lot. <br /> <br /> To act is not all that well, and from time to time the situation that occurs in it reminded me of a poor 90-Chevy Chase comedy. I mean, come on, how the situation in handcuffs, and the situation in poker among the servants ... This film was so obviously based very much on the ground, and that's OK. But if I had not seen first before you see it, it would have sucked even worse. As an end, it came very suddenly, and I felt that I had no end, what so ever ... Sebastian has changed very suddenly, and it seems to be this film, as it was done solely to explain the NR 1, and, no matter how time and effort has been used to create anything else good. The cost is the same as in the first, and he did not feel like a movie at all ... <br /> <br /> They were pumped situation with a lot of style and class, but they did not, and thus way, this movie was bad ...
