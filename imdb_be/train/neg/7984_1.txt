Too many secondary storylines without primary. Too many hot buttons are pushed, without any reason, they were able to push the boring film that does not say every dramatic element that there is: death, divorce, money issues, child-rearing problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug addiction, adoption , rejected love, travel problems, sex, generations of misunderstanding, robbery, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "deep true love" ?? You would think that it would make an interesting film, but hell no ?? All these events are secondary to something primary that does not exist. Sad. Not to mention the fact that the "ultra-deep" (and super-long) lecture the child at the end of the film is complete nonsense. . Pity <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention: the actors, all of them are pretty good. That's what kept me from it an exception. To bad their talents disappeared, the film is well shot, too: light, movement, etc. each episode - that's all in place. This simply means that it is not enough.
