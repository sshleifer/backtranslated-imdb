It is badly done, a poor remake of the classic Parineeta Bimalda in. The story is based on the book Saratov Chandra of the same name, and a distortion of the original. Well it is possible to estimate a degree of creativity, but not imaginary creation. , Action on all depend on the whole movie is fictitious. Shekar choice words about his father abusing Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and diseases and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene where Shekhar (Saif) slaps Lolita absolutely ridiculous with the flow of the film and characters, rather sharp, the feelings, and could easily have been avoided. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Balan completely unworthy of the film and a cheap trick to attract an audience. If the creative work is not true to the original and destroy his spirit, work is falling apart. The song Â«piyu bola" quite normal. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of the film is the scene where Saif stands for itself and rebels against his father. This is a positive deviation from the original and deserves credit. On these items this film deserves 3 stars. Song and dance Rekha smacks of artificiality and wear it. The song is melodious, but I remember that he had heard somewhere before, and if I am not mistaken Iam melody seems to have been plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, okay, that times have changed since then until now. But this film does not even reflect modern times. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers are becoming more violent impressed NRIs and NRI capturing lucrative entertainment market. These films are ultimately not belong to India or any other part of the world.
