Firstly, remember that I saw this movie on TV and dubbed English - which can be completely spoiled the atmosphere. Nevertheless, I will vote for what I've seen, and I hope that will direct people from this version. I found this film is excruciatingly boring. The whole atmosphere of the film is lost with dubbing slowly leaving frustrated stalker movie. I'm sorry, but the worst movie of the sin in my book to be slow, except in cases where a film about philosophy. I have not seen a deep philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I missed something, but I have to tell him how I see it. I rated it a "1". What can I say, the United States focused on the tastes may be.
