It is difficult to make an impartial judgment on the film as it is, that such an impact on me at such a young age. This is due to the doubts, the worst kind of exploitation of the film. I was unfortunate enough to see this movie for the first time in my youth, the Iwill never forget. I thought it was the worst movie ever made. Then I saw him again at the beginning of this year and was once again horrified. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fanatic, or the one to say what others should and should not see, but I take great offense at the way in which something as horrible as rape is seen in this movie. I love animals a movie, but it's just ugly. Rent instead of some Rus Meyer.
