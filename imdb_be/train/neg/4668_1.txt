Potential film extravaganza, set during the 19th century, is not able to produce. With big-name actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, and many others, there were no grounds for the film to fail. However, the film did not have an ending, it was sorry excuse for a story line, and fell to pieces of its continuity. The typical story rich girl and a poor boy, brought together by love and destroyed the beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval is touching the side of early death of his mother and absentee father. Father plays Finney, a violation of human torturing his daughter in life and death. He believes that the absence of his daughter's good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status. The actors tried in vain to save what is left of the storyline. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting precious time, those who look sadly. I give this movie 1 instead of 0, and purely for attempts to cast. Save yourself, stay away from Washington Square.
