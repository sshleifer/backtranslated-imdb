On the surface, "Show me the money" must have at least completed the full season. You were always entertaining William Shatner as host, surrounded by a baker's dozen of beautiful long-legged models common name «The Million Dollar Dancers». You were well-experienced participants who had interesting stories to tell about his life, and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia. And you had a lot of money! So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of the game was a failure. Good game need to show at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting ECS ​​and the ability for the viewer to play along at home. The best, most durable of them have all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM was not. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game was one of the most difficult any prime-time game show in history, let me explain how the game works, as short as possible. <br /> <br /> The enemy began with a word or short phrase, followed by the selection of the letters A, B, C (subtle plug for the network?). Each letter was attached to a single issue, everything from the word or phrase. Once the participant has selected one of the letters, they can either answer that question, to transfer and choose the second letter. When they went, they should look to the next question, and had the same option. However, if they have passed the second question, they had to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After they answered, and before they know that if their answer was correct, then they should have chosen one of the 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of money in a scroll with its part. They showed her a dollar amount (ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000), and depending on when the participant responded correctly ... or ... answered incorrectly, this amount will be added to or subtracted from their pot. <br /> <br /> However, with me so far? In addition, there was one dancer who had something known as «The Killer card." If you choose a dancer with a killer card, and you've got your question right, you were safe, and the game continued. However, if you were wrong, you have one last question to answer. If you got that last question wrong, you are out of the game. If you got it right, the game continues. <br /> <br /> There was no quit smoking, do not waste the money is not earned until you either answered six questions or received six questions correctly, or you were still in the hole you could not earn enough money, to get back. Is that clear? Good! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I saw, there was a complete lack of tension, because the game design. Athlete can pass the questions that they knew that they did not know, and answer many questions, they know they put pressure even less. Then they could still find a small amount of dollars, even after there is no question in advance, which meant that not until now has been a "drama". And the fact that they could answer the five questions correctly and still have a chance to win this was a big mistake. And the step of the questions was deathly slow: often the questions were so obvious that it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers <br /> <br /> stimulation. , Lack of any real tension at any time during the show, and they are very complex rules prevented the program to work, despite the Shatner talents associated with the dance in.
