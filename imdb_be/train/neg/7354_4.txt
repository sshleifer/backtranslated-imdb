As Hammer Completist I was afraid of the time when I would have to pick up the courage to see this movie and the one following it, stay on the bus. I saw one bus film and thought it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was full of all the terrible comedy, which prevented the British television screens around in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed to say that there was actually a part of this movie I laughed. I do not know whether it was because I am now familiar with the characters and enjoy some situations, knowing how they will react. I found particularly funny black, though I could have sworn, at any point in the trilogy, he says his catchphrase, "I'll get you Butler". <br /> <br /> Looking at the rest buses jokes begin to wear thin, and these three films can be compared with the early trilogy Hammer, Dick Barton, in that the second film is made better (although it is probably the only way that they You could compare). <br /> <br /> the only people who want to watch this movie, probably fans of the series, which will no doubt enjoy this, and Completists hammer, as I do. For Completists I would say that this film is not so bad, and I can certainly think of the worst comedies Hammer.
