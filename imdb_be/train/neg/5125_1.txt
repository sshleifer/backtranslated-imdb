As a youth pastor, I've heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. Act was not the best. This is forgivable. This is the message that this is not so: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you will solve the better to make an interesting catch, stop to feel, start touchdowns, and even in the playoffs. All because Jesus miraculously turns horrific undersized weaklings in the All-American athletes. I laughed out loud when the coach quoted scripture to explain the kicker, why he did not know enough field goals. However, we expect more to come. You will receive a new truck, raise to $ 6,000, and you and your wife's struggle with infertility suddenly come to an end during pregnancy - twice. Then you will win the state championship, because God helps wimp kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he had ever hit before - and the wind, at least - all because "God wanted to do it," then you will. to win the state championship again next year. None of these good things would not have happened, the team did not choose to follow Jesus will be all their heart <br /> <br /> That's what I took away from the film :. God can do anything he wants to do if he wants to do it - and it's all about how to make our life better, easier and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and help them win games. What does the Bible this story is based on? I Bet St. Stephen if he wanted to know the key to a safe life, before he was stoned to death. Someone had to do this film for 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for moving Jesus. It would have saved them all a lot of trouble.
