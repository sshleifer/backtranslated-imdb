What should be a simple ordinary mystery storyline involving the dead philanthropist is, in fact, a headache inducing story about a bunch of characters (only a great actor as Ginger Rogers, in the very early role) all trying to find the killer among the small cast of residents in a luxury residential building . These characters range from downright silly really mean. The cheap production of low budget, most of the action revolves around Rogers and her leading man (some guy, I do not care who it is, because it really sucked) to talk about their different possibilities of crime solving, at the same time constantly cut an absurd detective with his head in his example. To be honest, I was never a worse time to watch an old movie-b speed of this type, and I've seen some real head-slappers. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the butler did not do it, because it was not the butler. But pay attention to a guy who is closest to the butler. There I go. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
