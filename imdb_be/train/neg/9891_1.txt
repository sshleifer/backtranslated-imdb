I think the biggest disappointment in this film was the fact that until the end, I did not expect that the current teachers acting to invade and to apologize for the poor was the action. If you feel a strong storyline, brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a different set of images and spectacular, it's a shame that little attention was paid to act. <br /> <br />
