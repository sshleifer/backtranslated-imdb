The film is notable for three reasons. <br /> <br /> First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two series "Superman", this low budget feature was made and released in cinemas, marking George Reeves and Phyllis Coates initial manifestations as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is re-used in the series. Outside the city Silby, six miles deep oil well into the "Hollow Earth", which allows "Mole-Men," to rise to the surface. Forget about the other holes (the ones in the plot). <br /> <br /> Secondly, unlike most invasive SF movies of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and control) forces in preaching and to ensure tolerance and acceptance of difference against the raging mob vigilantes segregation. A lot of "soft-mannered reporter" here! Clark Kent, who knows and arrogant, takes control of the situation in all ( "I'll deal with this!"), Even help in a hospital gown to remove the bullet from Mole-Man! As Superman, he was softer than Clark to Lois evil, but also the voice of reason and tolerance, he protests against the vigilantes as "Nazi stormtroopers.Â» <br /> <br /> Third, you will notice that the transition from Fleischer, like an animated cartoon Superman flight in two series before "live action" fly in the "Adventures of Superman" has not yet been done.
