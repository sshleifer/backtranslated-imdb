I work in a video store, I found it was my bounden duty to talk about the worst films I have ever seen, and warn their friends and colleagues from it. In the midst of one day and a heated debate about what is the worst movie, my friend dared me to look B.T.K. The killer even that if I could watch the whole movie and still maintain my previous choice was the worst movie ever, he would have to watch it. I lost. I believe that even I have done better than this video in high school, and it was hardly the great feats of the young genius. This film not only was there that seemed to be the cost of production (it looks like it was shot on a bad camera, although it is wonderfully clear), but in the current (wood, flooring, and miserable does not scratch the surface), and also just in general a bad movie feeling. I remember the scene where I heard glass break, I suddenly thought of some bad plays high school (I know that links in high school too often here, but this film seems very juvenile) both in terms of recruitment, it seemed too fake, but like people read their lines from the script, not quite sure what's really going on. My review does not do this film justice, because I can not tell you how eerie the time I spent watching it. It is almost ironic that I am a miserable job, describing the pathetic excuse for a movie.
