I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not, it is very close. Have you ever seen a poor teenage soap opera. Well this is one of them. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLE SPOILER) Girl: I want to go somewhere <br /> <br /> guy :. All that is needed here <br /> <br /> Girl:., But I want to take myself somewhere different <. br /> <br /> guy: I'll take you somewhere <br /> <br /> ... By doing this line they have sex .. Music bad dads and bad punk rock. If you ever read the book, avoid this film like the plague. They completely change the face of the characters and events. In addition, they are easy to get rid of things. In addition, the film ends around before finishing a book. This is a terrible movie. So if you have not read the book, do not look. If you read a book, write it (the film). If you want a silly teenage soap operas, which are of lower quality than the average low-grade teen soap opera, go for it. On the other hand, should we expect anything else from MTV?
