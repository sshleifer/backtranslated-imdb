I searched everywhere to find a video store this film, being a big fan of Elvis, I, and I found it to be a huge disappointment. Kurt Russell had most of the "Elvis" is moving down and voice imitation was great, but dubbed in Elvis singing voice just did not work for me. voice always coincide didnt russels with his mouth, and that was to get lost in the plot is difficult for me, because it bothered me that it was noticeable. In addition, there were so many freaking difference in the film, people who do not know much about Elvis probably consider them facts. songs performed by him before he wrote them in real life, a time when he received his first guitar is not so, it is quite sure that his brother Jesse Garron was buried in an unmarked grave, and not one with a huge tombstone reading Jesse Garron . I know it's just a TV movie, but they miss important events like come-back special, and pulled some of the scenes from too long. if you want to see a good movie, which shows Elvis in his premiere THATS rent, as it is, or even a concert of Elvis. hear and see the real Elvis preforms is the only way to really see his talent. (Brilliant statement I know, but still ... go out there and take a good Elvis flick.)
