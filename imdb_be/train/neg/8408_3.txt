Wow, that is very unusual in one respect: as a rule, the first film in a long line of sequels is the best of the bunch. People are surprised when they continued in fact better. With Tarzan, I thought that this movie was the worst of the bunch, or at least the first six, which include Tarzan my pack DVD Collection. . I'll be happy to look over a few times, but I sat through this through turkey, thanks to a few characters <br /> <br /> Well, let's start with the good news first: <br /> <br /> The good - a lot of action with a large number of wild animals on display, even if they are just footage. You see a lion attack, crocodiles, hippopotamus, panther, you name it and you will see several different tribes of all kinds, including Pygmies (called "dwarfs" in the film.) As this film was made almost 75 years ago, I do not It can bring down any of realism, because they do not have it in the film, which for a long time. They do the best they can so that you come to terms with the actors speak in front of a fake background. However, Weissmuller made a lot of scenes and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan make a well-built beautiful couple, if ever there was one in those golden years of cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is of historical importance (with so many sequels) is that it shows how Tarzan and Jane got the beginning of learning English <br /> <br /> BAD -. since the "Jane Parker" Tarzan is accepted in almost every scene with her Maureen O'Sullivan in hysterics, crying scene after scene. That's enough to give you a headache, and it destroys the film. Fortunately, she had calmed down in the sequels, but not in this movie. The film also makes no use for «The Great White Hunter» way as C. Aubrey Smith, who plays Jane's father, Neil Hamilton as "Harry Holt" safari guide, shoot every animal in sight, whether the animals are threatened if no. These people kill- happy, especially Smith. On another note, it's too bad that there is nothing here to explain how to be Tarzan in the jungle, in the first place. There's no history of it here or frames of his growing up. He's just there when Jane and the band to get to a certain point in Africa.
