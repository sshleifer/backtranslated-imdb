Truly awful film made cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Decent enough to see the film, but completely devoid of any tension at all times for the movie bombs. Ford, as someone put it here, sleepwalks though this with his usual smile. There are some parts thrown around- Canadian former army and the RAF, defused a bomb in the war, his wife leaves Tel, but none of these stories do not add to the back lot. Bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to undermine the party minutes? In this respect, a period of time we are talking about here? The Second World War and post-war ?? I assumed the latter, which makes bomber motive is even more prominent. In general, though, just a terrible film. There are a lot of good time bomb click to skip this. Watch any episode of «Danger UXB» for a more exciting time, roughly at the same time running.
