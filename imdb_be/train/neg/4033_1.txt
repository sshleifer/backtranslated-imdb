It hurts me to write such a scathing review, but not doing so I'll just encourage these people. First, just because the film is made on a small budget, it does not automatically make it good, or what will be punished. In fact, in this case a small budget is likely to achieve a single movie in that it prevented a large amount of money to spend on one leg of a race horse with a damn. Have you ever seen the comedy in the theater? Ever heard people laughing and I thought, "what are you in the Dickens?" Well, even these twats not laugh. Things got so bad in the middle, like my cat took his very first bath. This is not a movie, it children ....: No monkeys make images that leave you feeling like moving to France. We must go, there is a clown at my door .............
