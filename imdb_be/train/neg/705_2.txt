There's so little here fantastic Anne Rice books, here, it does not make any sense. Some of the characters - the intense and wonderful characters - do not do it on the screen at all, and those who are watered to such an extent that there is no reason for their existence <br /> <br /> Where. relations between Christophe and Marseille? Where continuation of the romance between Marseille and Juliet? Why Shares rose is at all since her story never told? Where rape and ransom Marie, whose greatest attribute (and falling) is that it can pass for white - and her marriage to Richard? Why the end of the film with the beating Marseille in the hands of his father? We learn nothing about Aglae beyond what it bitch who hates her husband; why not explain the background of this hatred? <br /> <br /> As for the performances, there is not one that is better than mediocre, although it is probably due to the lousy script. The best of the party is that the actor playing Richard - but Richard is not on the screen is enough to save the film. Worse Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, although again, it comes down to the actress, who has nothing to do with the fact that she gave a little work. <br /> <br /> In general, it's just awful. I thought that it would be impossible for any Anne Rice's book-turned-movie worse than Paradise pleasure, but All Saints makes this look like a mess critical hit. How is it that such a slut she Rice will allow it to work best, to become a trash on the screen?
