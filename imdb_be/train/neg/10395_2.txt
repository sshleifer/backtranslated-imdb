Quite what the producers of this monstrous adaptations have tried to make it impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> group of top quality actors in the main part of the well (with a few exceptions), which give a very good performance. Penelope Keith perfect as Aunt Louise and equally well Joanna Lumley as Diana. All is well with the scenarios they were given. <br /> <br /> So much for good. On average, will include sets. Nancherrow none other than the house, described in the book, although oddly the house they used to give the home looks strange, as he did. Hence it is clear that the confidence of the house is too big. In subsequent chapters, the authors decided to bring the whole story back to the UK, apparently to save money, though, and with a little imagination, I have no doubt that they could be restored to Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now the bad, the film script. It's such a terrible poor adaptation is difficult to find words to condemn it. Edward died in the Battle of Britain, but survives, blinded. He makes a brief appearance and then commits suicide - why ?? Loveday changed from a young woman totally in love with his wife Guus Clever farmer who can refuse the Love of your life with a little tear (less emotional than the Brief Encounter). Gus, a man intoxicated and passionately in love, ready to give love without complaint. Walter (Majah in the book) is obtained from fine family man unfaithful husband. Jess made psychologically disturbed young woman who will not talk. Aunt Biddy still have problems with alcohol, but now without any justification. Trusting the house is occupied by the army without any reason at all, except for a very short scene with Jesse, who has a fear of armed soldiers. Although breast Miss Mortimer absolutely beautiful, I could not see their reflection on several occasions moved the story forward. Perfectly name Nettlebed becomes routine Dobson. Word limit prevents me to continue this list. <br /> <br /> There is continued (which I lost interest after watching this nonsense), and I'm wondering if changes have been made to create a following of history. It is hard to imagine that Pilcher would have approved this grotesque distortion of her books; presumably she lost control when the rights were acquired.
