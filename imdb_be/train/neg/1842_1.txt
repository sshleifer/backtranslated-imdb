This is my first review of the film on IMDb. I was forced to join after watching this movie. I can not in good conscience allow this film to be a non-peer reviewed by me. ! People should be warned <br /> <br /> First of all, my rating: 0 (as in "zeroÂ») <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weisz and Christopher Walken, and nevertheless, I hated this movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there is no script. Dialogue is unrealistic and plain boring, contrived situation, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, bad and uninteresting characters and the story, though based on a good room, this is nonsense. This film is a piece of crap. <br /> <br /> It does not matter to spend money on this film, it's not even worth your time spent playing. Please do not see ... I beg you!
