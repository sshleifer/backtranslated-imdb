Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal already preparing a sequel about a young corporal in the US in Afghanistan. He also happens to be a highly skilled surgeon and freely roaming around Kabul, who works for the wounded soldiers of NATO. In the most severe mission, he accidentally picks up a sniper rifle and shoot Osama Bin Laden with a distance of about 3,000 yards. He finally promoted to Sergeant, but can not decide between a sniper and a surgeon's career, so he leaves the army as a whole. Years later, frustrated with civilian life, he joined the Navy and the last scene shows that he is honored to wear a white uniform.
