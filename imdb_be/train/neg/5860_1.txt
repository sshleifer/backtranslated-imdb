It is difficult to express words of the obvious terrible this film. A whole new vocabulary to be invented to describe the complete lack of anything even remotely known as "humor" or "entertainment" in the "Rabbit Test". So, as a small contribution to this in the future efforts, I would like to offer a word : <br /> <br /> «Hubiriffic» combination "arrogant" and "stunning" (. prime) is used to describe an excessively ambitious scrapes like film "Rabbit test". <br /> <br /> Joan Rivers and «Hollywood Squares» Producer Jay Redack is strictly over-achieved their poor ability to please in this 82-minute festival of misery, an attempt to bring the airplane! style comedy moldy jokes collection (note to Joan: German doctors are not funny, as the Vaudeville) dug up from their graves in the Catskills - is bad enough. But this recipe is a cinematic crime directorial style River, which can be described as "ugly", and casting times and the future have-beens so want to please, they outperform even the weakest of unsuitable jokes. <br /> <br /> Adrift in the Sargasso Sea is the unlucky sap Billy Crystal in his debut film, the role of the hapless hero Lionel film. Looking at the crystal in this picture very much like watching a blind man walk in a minefield; in the end, crawling reflex becomes a semi-permanent state as a cheap joke after joke cheap explodes in his face. <br /> <br /> I can only speculate about such an audience that can actually, like a rabbit test. Cabbage, clams and slightly delayed lizards all likely candidates. But for the self-conscious, thinking people - I enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before I would recommend "Rabbit Test".
