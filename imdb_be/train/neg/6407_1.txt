I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullet. It mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously, though, this film is a living proof that the formula works. If it is not broke, it does not need to Fixin. -Streetwise yet vulnerable heroine, a hardened ex-cop martial artist with a heart of gold and a serial killer from the "issues." Pure magic.
