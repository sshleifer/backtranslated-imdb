Bollywood supporters largely keep Mard Amitabh Bachan in high regard, but I think it is very overstated. Manmohan Des collaborated previously on films like Suhaag, Parvarish, Omar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and bullets, and I saw all of them I liked, so I had very high expectations before I watched Mard and was bitterly disappointed . My main complaint about Mard is that it feels like Omar Akbar Anthony Part 2 may be, Mr. Desai ran out of ideas, in the end, he used this formula for years and years. 1. First of all, some of the members of the body are repeated from AAA, for instance, a police inspector who brings Omar, a Muslim, who brings to Akbar, Nirupam Roy and a few more. 2. At the AAA Nirupam Roy loses sight in Mard she loses her voice 3. AAA is the famous song (scars Shirdi Sai Baba) well in Mard we have Amitabh singing Mao Sherawali. Seeing AAA more than 1,000 times, I noticed that right away. <br /> <br /> My other gripe is that some of the situation just seems funny, though Manmohan Desa did leave your brain at the door sort of movie, but Mard I thought he had gone too far. My last gripe, that in comparison with the songs in the previous films Manmohan Des I found the songs quite disappointing. I know there are many fans who swear by it, but I did not like it one bit. It really pains me to write this review because I am such a big fan and loved his movies since I was a kid.
