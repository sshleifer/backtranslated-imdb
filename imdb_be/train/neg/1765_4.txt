OK - helicopter shots are fantastic, and director made good use of some of the main attractions of Barcelona. Otherwise ... the volume of production has been undermined during the first few minutes, and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week. Pompey had a magic and fun to watch, Abel Folk has more depth, and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He needs to put his martial arts training to good use and be the running jump serious figure. The rest of the cast was made of wood, at best, but mostly paper. So - if you are nostalgic of Spain - is a picture card with a twist of action, and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
