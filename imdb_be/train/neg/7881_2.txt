This film is a portrait of half spastic teenager Benjamin, who must attend a boarding school because of his lousy grade math. He did not do the best experience in my life before and suffered severe self problems. After a rough start in his new school, he begins to make one, she falls in love and makes some things Pieish American teenager. <br /> <br /> In addition to some elements of comedy, the film is told in a very serious manner, with an emphasis on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this story outline, save time and see something else. If you do, please note the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is a complete loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong, and then it goes unfortunately all the time. For me he is the "magic loser" was not one that you can feel sympathy and laugh with. Instead, he and his behavior is really annoying me and my teenage years not so far behind, I could barely stand to watch. <br /> <br /> 2) The film struggles to be realistic and the story, it seems, but from my experience the characters simply do not (except, perhaps, Janosch). And yes, I know that this film is based on the auto-biography written by 17-year-old - but which have some experience with the German school and a German youth itself, I do not believe him <br /> <br /> 3.) It is shown that sexual awakening really important thing for a movie with this plot. But I doubt that teenagers do "ejaculate on cookies," where all the competition to hit the cookies with his semen during mass masturbation in the woods, and the loser has to eat sperm wet biscuit after. Although this kind of amused me despicable, it is not funny, nor emphasizing serious attempts this movie <br /> <br /> 4) There is a sub-plot about the family of Benjamin, and his father had betrayed his wife. - so far, I do not know why he's there and where to put it. I'm just bored. <br /> <br /> Well, I personally hated the film because the character of Benjamin, because without communication, concepts, schemes, whatever, and it's failing to be dramatic and serious. Nevertheless, I can image that some people may find it reasonable and touching. If you liked «The Other Sister» you will probably like this one too. I hated both. <br /> <br /> 17-year-old boys do not have to write an autobiography, and when they do, it does not seem a good idea to make a film out of it. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
