It makes sense to me that this film gets rave in Hollywood, because often in Hollywood is just a popularity contest. It also makes sense if you think that people who like the film could just be a reaction to countless songs that spit on you, and not the content of the story. However, this movie is overrated and exaggerated. Eddie Murphy looks ridiculous. In no case do Zheniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles to Oscar-par performance so much raved over the first film was even out. I can not even believe that Condon is created to stand out on the directing Oscar, when all he did was to assemble an album. Glitz does not replace the personal storyline. a bunch of songs is not a movie make.
