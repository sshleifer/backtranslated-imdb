The worst mistake of my life. <br /> <br /> I picked this movie up at Target for $ 5 because I realized, "Hey, this is Sandler I can get some cheap laughs." I was wrong, completely wrong. -This is in the middle of the movie, all three of my friends were already asleep, and I was still suffering. Worst storyline, the worst case scenario, the worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to hit her head against the wall for an hour, then I would stop, and you know why? Because it felt damn good. After scrape my head I'm stuck this damn film in the microwave and watch it burn .... and that felt better than anything else I've ever done. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Kill Bill, just get over that shit. I HATE YOU FOR Sandler REALLY happens through with it and ruining the whole day of my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
