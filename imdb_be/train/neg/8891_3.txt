Easily the most famous of all Shakespeare's plays, it was seriously let down here. Rubbish direction, congestive work in the studio and erratic performances spoil a beautiful tragedy. <br /> <br /> In the city of Verona, the Capulets and Montagues were at war for centuries, but the tragedy is inevitable, when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), A Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), Capulet. Bloodshed quickly breaks ... <br /> <br /> In the studio, especially in the daytime scenes, seriously stagnant energy game. This is the story, which, with its energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. In conjunction with this hideous costumes, too many ridiculous tights and codpieces. Stage fighting looks terrible, with too much stretching and running to be interesting. <br /> <br /> Patrick Rayekart too easy, to be truly effective Romeo. He controls the intensity of the character when the story gets going, but his majestic accent and soft, expressionless eyes often limit its range. It is very difficult for the audience relates to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire too young to be a good Juliet - she captures the innocence of the hero, but a little more would have been welcome sassiness <br /> <br /> The supporting role is not much better .. Joseph O'Connor Friar Laurence is a good thing, but too many of his best lines were cut. Anthony Andrews Mercutio relies on the stage, not the camera. He gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks pretty funny as a result. Alan Rickman, played down his role, has almost no presence as Tybalt. He developed advantage and intensity to deliver some excellent display representations in the coming years, but it's not in evidence here. Prince can be a fine role with his short appearances, but the actor Laurence Naismith not give the part of any authority on the camera. Only Micheal Hordern, in perhaps his best role in this series, comes out of this with any dignity. His Capulet played well and joy to watch. <br /> <br /> See one of the other versions of the story instead.
