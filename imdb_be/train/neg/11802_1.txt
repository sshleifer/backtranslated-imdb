Utter dreck. I got up to 16 minutes / 27, second paragraph, and surrendered. I would give it a negative review amount if it were possible (although «pissible» is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike hiss could see and almost feel between Stanwyck and MacMurray in the original, the chemistry between the dumb ol 'Dick tilt and What-it-face here simply does not exist. The foot becomes unattractive chunky bracelet? There's no cigarette-lighting-to-finger tip? And I thought I was sick, if they have killed form (and rightly so, believe me), Lee J. Cobb as Keyes almost belching / upchucking your way through an explanation of his "little man" g-Garloupis. No offense to non-sighted, but it looks as if a detachment of the blind men ran amuck with both the scenography Dietrichson and Neff houses. The same goes for those dreadful plaid pants worn by Phyllis. And my God, how much does $$ Neff does, he lives with a view of the huge harbor? This, folks, again, it all happens in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can get through it better, you have a much stronger constitution than I do, or you're a masochist. But please, take some Alka-Seltzer first, or you will develop a "little man" of your own, which can never leave. Be careful, obviously.
