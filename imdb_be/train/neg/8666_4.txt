This TV thriller made it all the talk, little action. He works hard to create a convoluted plot, but the writing is so confusing exposition still murky at best. In the end, I did not know about these characters than I do in the beginning. It has a quasi-scenario "Ten Little Indians", but ditches him halfway through in favor of highlighting Sally Field and its exposure of the murderer. overacts field here with a graceless I rarely saw her. Early introduction of good, but to write quickly departs from the course and in the end becomes the top. A lot of hysteria, and the constant thunder and lightning effects (which adds nothing). Curious refusal to producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, they could not give us more than a script full of red herrings and Sally Field, who are hiding in the closet?
