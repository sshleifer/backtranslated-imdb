I knew this film was supposed to be so bad that it was interesting, so I went into it with that expectation. I just found it so bad it was deadly boring. Whiny song is funny for about 10 seconds, until you realize that there is nothing reasonable about it, except for his deliberately irritating quality. Seeing things get splattered with tomatoes aging for about 30 seconds. Not only is there nothing reasonable or a funny movie to be placed, with the exception of. He could stand for 3-4 minutes sketch comedy can be, but it's just not a feature film of any tension.
