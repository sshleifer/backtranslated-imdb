Without a doubt, Frank Sinatra was a talented actor, but also a talented singer. In the end, very few actors can now get the scene just right in one take, and it was pretty much working principle of Sinatra on the set. <br /> <br /> I feel that in the 1960s wore on, the quality of a man's movies really started to tank. A series of detective Tony Rome was nothing more than trying to compete with a series of Dean Martin's Matt Helm, which was released at the same time. Maybe even a contest, James Bond, but nothing really worked for Frank during those years. His personal life is in shambles, his music fade ... Sinatra appeared as a return to the 1950s. The last great Sinatra film of this period was probably Express von Ryan in 1965.
