Animation in this reinterpretation of Peter and the Wolf is excellent, but on 29 minutes, the film, which induces sleep. They should have called it "Peter and snails," because everything is moving at a snail's pace. I could not even watch a movie in one sitting - I was watching it for 15 minutes at a time, and it was pure torture <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes. - do not watch this movie - and you will thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the appointments Oscar watched the first few minutes of candidates. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the Best Animated Short (short!) Category, voters have to sit through the whole thing. I already feel sorry for them - and should predict that there is no way this film is closer to the victory.
