My brother is in love with this show, let's get this straight. I fully agree with those who said that it was copied from Dexter's Laboratory and Magical parents. <br /> <br /> I never liked rather strange parents, I mean, some things even make me laugh, but most of the time it's just annoying and not cute at all. This is almost exactly how I feel about Johnny Test. Besides, nothing makes me laugh on the show. The gags are so stupid and meaningless, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but the kids do not dress like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is amazing, but C'Mon! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Laboratory, which used to be one of my favorite shows and I still do not mind watching. What disgusts me and shame Johnny Test makes absolute JOKE of this wonderful show! <br /> <br /> Another thing. . Dog. There. Irritating Sv. He louder and back than Johnny! And cheerful accent? What is fiction! I hate a dog to death, and I hope that he dies, because it would be better for the children to see, what to listen to and watch the opposite shit that happens in this show, and picking up the gay accent. <br /> <br /> If you want, you do not eyeballs, not looking to burn in the flames of a miraculous and your brain is fried from the show!
