Absolutely miserable waste of film !! Nothing ever happens. A lot of ghosts, almost train, no mystery, no interest. Constant and brutal attempts comedies painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a lot of people stuck in the middle of nya-places, because their train was delayed for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railroad leaves no place for them to stay in a violent storm? I think not. Oh, they can walk 4 miles in the dead black fields. mmm, yes. Of course. Or, they can get themselves on the railroad hospitality and stay in "haunted" train station. The station, which would have proved nothing but deadly boring, completely without ghosts, interest, or the plot. <br /> <br /> So it is very terribly sad that it seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added to the list of the lost film !! Aargh !!
