I was not as impressed with this, as well as many other reviewers. Of course, he has a pair of beautiful girls playing erotic, lesbian vampire. Marian Morris and D. Anulka played by these two wonderful siren with razor teeth, which work to cars on the road out of the way, the device for your home (in the evening), and invite their prey ... their sex starved male boudoir, what is happening there. .. well, after they undressed and kissing each other in the main, they kill their visitors. Director José Ramón Larraz has some flashes of brilliance with his camera. Some scenes are really horrible and efficient execution, but sex alone does not hold the film up (no pun intended ... at least consciously). There's really not a lot of history here. We have two girls. We have shown an inexplicable and unexplained beginning, where we see them with a pistol shot. Why? What does this mean: "Why do we have a guy who stays for a few days to welcome the guy at the hotel, who insists that he knows what it years ago This is the goal of course, I have a more general questions, such as? that there are a couple of good-looking girls do, like vampires in the English countryside and has a wine cellar filled with wines from the Carpathian Mountains? in any case, the script is replete with such defects. It is also very poor on the steps outside the catch victims, wine and dine them (literally), and then go to bed in the basement. atryml end Noah movement with some juicy scenes, but it is anti-climatic. is, as I said, some effective scenes director ... I especially liked ... the girls dressed and were shot in the forest in search of his production house is also the most impressive set and the two girls, as I said, very cute Marianne Morris in particular stands out -. more than one for your old film fans, silent screen veteran Beth Love has a short cameo T A Full movie.
