Just as we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this film. Propaganda hack on the dirty end of what seems to have once been outstanding and idealistic career Pacino plays the role look like a bulk bed and attack with all absolutely false and inconsistent southern accent. <br /> <br /> The plot spooler this way and that with so many loose ends and incredible that the mind reels (and then retreat). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger there, not doing much. Her scene with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. It is hard to believe that they mean a lot to each other. There is no energy there. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone, on the other hand, the screen lit up. It was electric, and her scenes with Pacino were certainly the most interesting in the film, but not enough to save Al embarrassment.
