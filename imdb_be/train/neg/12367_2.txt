Loony Tunes decided (at least) two times in the future. The first time was brilliantly funny "Duck Dodgers". Last time was with this ?? hmm ?? efforts. «Loonatics Unleashed" is not without merit, and can be regarded as a good product, if not for the fact that he is not up to the quality of Warner Brothers. WB cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor, attractive, at least as many adults as children. These pedestrian superhero scenes, on the other hand, can not convince an adult to pass through them. <br /> <br /> The premise of the series is that ordinary people 6 (2 rabbits, the Tasmanian devil, duck, via Roadrunner, Coyote and) live in the "city-world" with Acmetropolis and acquire supernormal when a meteorite falls to the planet in 2772. that is confusing is that section names especially those individuals with the countdown to 2772 with the 21 th century, Cute, but frelling nonsense. <br /> <br /> In each episode, the super sextet ?? in the background is moderately amusing, but basically corny jokes ?? fight against various supervillains. For the most part, these are the types that appear in each series of mediocre superhero adventures, and even some of the best. Like many mediocre superhero series, this one takes its villains too serious for the context. And, of course, these guys only characters who laugh ?? ordinary evil laugh, of course. Why is it that the thieves always predictable superhero adventure ?? ALWAYS ?? laughing wickedly at every opportunity? Animated material of this kind seem to leave only laughter in the province of villains and (sometimes) their henchpeople and / or henchthings. <br /> <br /> In fact, the creators of the series have missed their best bets right from the get-go. characters superpower sometimes based on previous normal abilities, but sometimes not. The problem here is that we do not see enough looniness WB. Lexi and Ace have a fairly normal biologically produced energy weapons and have little or no facial features could be described as "like beetles." What we have here is basically stupid and drekish «Teen Titans», including its too "modern" animation "look", but with animals. Fe. <br /> <br /> Another misstep is the creators of the program (or) the villains. As noted earlier, it is not very creative and do a little evil laugh excessively. Surprisingly, the authors completely miss the obvious villains manufacturing method of the characters in the Security Council action, as well as the main characters. Adding to the fun would be, say, Jupiter Sam ?? The Thaddeus and still hunting Wabbits ?? and Tech Coyote turns into a really neurotic villain ?? and so on. Oh, the sadness of lost opportunities. ?? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all of the products held in too much overtime work (ie, the second season). However, we can rejoice in the fact that there is something new out there for 14-going-on-9 crowd. Others may rely on the third season of Duck Dodgers.
