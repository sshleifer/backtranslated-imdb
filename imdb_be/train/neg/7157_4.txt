First observed 5/26/2002 - 4 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Weird story about druid witch who is trying to capture ages, body adopting granddaughter. At least, I think that's the attitude. A kind of terrible quality is carried throughout the film not unlike Stephen King's The Shining. The difference lies in the fact that there was campiness by Nicholson, which is not in this movie. It's not very serious, until near the end, when some lame one-liners and attempt Litening moods do not work. Performances are not a problem here, but the story. All does not seem to come together very smoothly, and the viewer is left with a large number of pieces of information and without a real understanding of what happened in the movie. There is a very small idle performance of Christopher Walken as his uncle's granddaughter, who, of course, gives him top billing in an attempt to sell the film. Do not buy into this trick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
