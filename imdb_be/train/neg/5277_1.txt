I caught it on Showtime today and was amazed at how a movie with such an interesting location can end up being so incredibly awful. WHO IS YOUR DADDY? Star Brandon Davis as taken high schooler Chris Hughes, a freak, who inherits the heir to the empire porn left to him by his biological parents. Although the premise sounds like a movie can be a lot of fun, it is destroyed by the director inept directing for the first time Fikmna in clich√©d and predictable scenarios and actions that even bad lines in video standards. Even the usually funny Charlie Talbert turns into a surprisingly dismal performance, as the best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and desperate not funny. 1/10
