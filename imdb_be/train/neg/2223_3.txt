Corny, cliched dialogue and drafting (the same stuff that we saw throughout the 1980s, the movie fantasy), ice hockey to music, and paint in the numbers of characters knocks it out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans. <, Br /> <br /> thing that saves this film from the junk heap beautiful crutch work Bakshi, the rotoscoping, and the fact that Frazetta animators taught how to paint like him. It Frazetta ... in motion. Violence is an exciting and art direction and animation, unlike any other sword and sorcery movie period. <br /> <br /> I love to look at it without the sound, plays the soundtrack to the first film Conan instead.
