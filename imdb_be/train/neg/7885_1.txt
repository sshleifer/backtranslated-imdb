I believe that according to the religion of the government and of the films. If I want a sermon, I will go to church, but I do not want one of the film. I do not mind some supernatural themes (after all, the religion of the supernatural, as you can get!), But this movie was so much preaching to him that I was very annoyed. The hostess reminded me of witches that seen in other films. The bad guy even thought he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a stupid ending: the hero went to a meeting and yelled at all these old people, and that broke the spell. If only life were so simple. I think that if the movies are so stupid that they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! PREACHING containing HERE!
