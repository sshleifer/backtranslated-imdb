I'm really looking forward to this show, considering the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed! Once again we are led to believe that the KGB is a group of incompetent idiots who do not have a clue what they are doing. At one point there is a funny scene in which four KGB agents could not handle a CIA agent. I'm sick of the biased, one-sided and completely inaccurate image Spy Games, which took place during the Cold War. I find it funny that the US will not be able to make objective movies about their involvement in WW2 and beyond. Just as useless U-571, where we are led to believe that the United States got a machine Enigma, again, completely false. <br /> <br /> To honor the "Company" is very well shot and acted. Locales also exceptionally well implemented. Alfred Molina put in a great performance as it does Keaton (the conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to love this show and no doubt that will eventually look at other 2 episodes, but I really want to try to stop the American production to reflect their spy, military, etc., like Superman, which largely intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet. He is aging quickly and seriously detract from the believability of what could be 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
