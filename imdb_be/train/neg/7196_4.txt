Inspector Gadget (1999) ** <br /> <br /> Starring: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg, 80 minutes, Rated PG <br /> <br /> by Blake French: <br /> <br /> the new Disney film "inspector Gadget," about a police officer named John, who survived a major accident, and the saved state of the art experimental work, which turns it into a robotic machine, an agent who has the tools and cunning of all types built into his body when using it, when he says: «Go Go», only to be called inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> the actual structure of the film is very similar to the formation of the Inspector Gadget of the body itself. It's a noisy, fragmented, and consists of an energetic bunch half heart tricky thrown together to do something that does not have much to do with something real. The film is basically a series of rebel action sequences, which are originally glued to the characters and uneven history that only children between the ages of 6-9 will enjoy. <br /> <br /> policeman who sharply again is played by Matthew Broderick, who "Inspector Gadget" was not on the spree success with films like "Elections". His character becomes Inspector Gadget after meeting with the heavy hand of the villain of the film on behalf of Clough. He plays Rupert Everett, who has already gone through a disaster this year with a terrible "W. Shakespeare A Midsummer Nights Dream.» <br /> <br /> There is a romantic story line in the movie, as well as a sufficient number of scenes involving Inspector Gadget details silly body and the mechanism elements. It has a foot Gadget and drooling over an attractive brand character, played by Joely Fisher, both for its appearance and its knowledge of the particular invention made by her late father, who was killed earlier Claw. Competition develops in the fight scenes and the causes of many events in the film. As the protagonist Gadget The Mobil, the life of the car, which is designed for the most Inspector Gadget. He is voiced by D.L. Hughly of comedy comedy «Hughly years." <br /> <br /> «Inspector Gadget" is a film that I found very bad. I know, I'm not the target audience of filmmakers, but even my ten-year relative found the film to his dislikes. The film is full of various shortcomings and obvious problems. I have never found myself caring about the characters. There is no mood of a few neat opening credits, as opposed to a much worse 1997 movie, "Mr. I", which was opened with clips from the original cartoon. It's too much to ask for the same type of things in this comedy, which is rarely funny and hardly ever convincing. The general formulation is not nothing but a mess of incomplete gags and consists of a joke :. Clumsy goofiness <br /> <br /> Inspector Gadget in B movies such as lust audience for Borders to help understand what can happen and what can not. In the "Inspector Gadget" no such boundaries. This is truly nothing more than a party time for the actors, who had a lot of fun grimly. I remember still lacks comedy released a few years ago called "Blankman", which again contained a lot of props and energy, as well as the actors, of course, have fun with all the gizmos and props, but it also was not something necessary for each film: audience participation. <br /> <br /> and a character that I found out there are many Left Gadgets daughter, who by the end of the film, I still do not know, I do not know what her name is. It is only used as a plot device, and I ask how it has been used to further the plot as well. For her presence does not bring anything to the case or productive for the film. We will never know her reaction to surgery or injury in case of his father. Thus, it was someone who could not completely be omitted and little effect on the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to state that the "Inspector Gadget" is a terrible lack of justification for the children's comedy. And believe it or not, I consider myself to compare this film last for years and very violent Anti-young audience a picture of action "Blade". I declare once again that I'd much rather have a movie where nothing happens, than the one in which everything happens. "Inspector Gadget" had so much going for it at the same time, he did just made me dizzy. <br /> <br />
