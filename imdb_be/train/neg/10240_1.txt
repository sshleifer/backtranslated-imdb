I love all kinds of movies, especially horror. That being said, Survival does not live up to ANY hype around it. <br /> <br /> I can not give him any points for originality. There's nothing wrong with studying the same topics or alteration of what others have done. He had just become a cop for indie films, to take us on a journey through the forest shredder, crazy killer, and, as of late, throw in some crazy family. On these lines I have to compare it with the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (although the twist is that one, obviously), and others. Survival drops to a short way against comparable films. The plot is just not original in any way. Some films are obtained with a weak (and by on-Done) portion with excellent actions, special FX, or a variety of other factors. Survivial does not have any of this to the bank. If you pay attention to the following: the film never took off. I do not knock or blame the actors for this, neither the director. The dialogue was mediocre at best, and the actors involved had never shown (not to mention, it was not) the talent to pull it out. I have 2 honors. Leading man in this movie definitely has the look, but I seriously think that he has to consider more training before he is ready to carry the film. Actor portraying Greg also had the potential, but we never got to see any of it (watch the movie to understand why you do not believe ..). <br /> <br /> grainy appearance of the film. Oh yeah, it's a bit TID-bit movie making magic is designed to take us to the glory days of "Grindhouse" movies. In today's movie-making, which has become a rarity. He either works or it does not. In this case, it just does not work. There are too many other defects occur, so that the winds knocked out of the film entirely by adding to it. At the same time, I think they did a good job, adding that grain. That is some good grain quality. I think the other scenario, the better, and possibly actors, they should try another "Grindhouse" again. They probably pull it off. <br /> <br /> As for the technical aspects, in my opinion, they never gelled for me, too. Improving care could be taken with sound (sounds like it was fed directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that) and shot on the DV, it was too soft for my taste. <br /> <br /> it is, all I have to say that .....
