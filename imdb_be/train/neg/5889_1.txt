First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are constantly getting better. From sad emotional films 70s and 80s, the films from that point actually began to have a bit of humor. Imagine .. Actual comedies were made! Movies were actually starting to get funny and entertaining, as opposed to a long time, dark, depressing and sad. <br /> <br /> During the 90's and 00's some really great movies have been made of the "new generation" of filmmakers. The film after the film was praised by critics and played a lot of money. It has become the norm! <br /> <br /> Then the United States ... <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * SMALL it's just not funny. Not once. Not ever. But the thing is ... We think it's funny. Because we are accustomed to Norwegian films to be funny. Especially with a cast like this with some really funny comedians. But .. They do not say or do anything funny! Where is the humor? Show me a sense of humor! This awkward clerk plays Harald EY? Is this really funny replays unrealistic football coach? Is it in the comments of Arne Neck? The film is just not funny! <br /> <br /> But that's not my main rants about United. It is precisely predictable. (And then I'm afraid that the Norwegian comedy came to a standstill, since I have seen it in many other films as well.) All the while, you just know it will be good finish. All the characters exactly as they appear in the beginning of the film, and everyone gets exactly what they deserve in the end. There's absolutely no room for surprises for everyone! <br /> <br /> In general, I can say that I was a bad feeling after watching this movie. It was a movie that made me realize that we probably need new blood in the Norwegian film industry ... again <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
