The only film that I ever went to. Strange, because I paid for myself and my date, and I'm really cheap. But my brain could not stand more dreck to put on, especially since I could write funnier stuff while bound and gagged. <br /> <br /> From the beginning and until the end of the film offends. Worse, it's not funny. It was not funny then, and it is certain that it is not funny now. But even worse is that this film is the beginning of the end is really smart, sophisticated comedy. It's juvenile, really babble script and the idea of ​​the era (which continues to this day), where cheap laughs and sexual overtones dominate comedy culture in the film. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympics? High School that the child does not think about it? Beginning of the end.
