This film seems to be completely pointless. There's no reason why everything that happens in it happening, as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway and thought, "How can I wrap it?". And that was Jared Harris and Christopher Walken think? They did it for a bet? I can not tell you the story, I'm not sure that there is a very sincere, but if it is not registered. Jared and his bird in Ireland after she falls down the stairs, while lashing up, as you do. They go into the house with a very annoying little girl in it, found Chris Tafer Walken, who dug up some old woman preserved in the peat. He brings her back to life for no other reason than that he continues the story, and she shows her gratitude by immediately glaze it. Since then, it all becomes a bit silly. A couple of hours my life that I would go back!
