In light of recent and quite good Batman Brave and the Bold, now is the time to carry a fatal blow to this error in the life of Batman. Being a huge fan of the first revival of Tim Burton's 20 years ago, I was able to take different ways in the nature, dark or mannerisms. This one just is not credible: too many effects, poor intrigues and so few questions. What is great about Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality: a detective, crime fighter, a playboy, philanthropist, etc. Batman shows him only in his karate days. And by the way, how did Penguin is capable of such virtuosity when jumping in the air, regardless of his plump satiety? And look at the Joker, in a mixture of Blanka Street Fighter 2 and stereotypical reggae man that Batman fan could make such a betrayal? Not for me anyway. Batman is much better without the «The» articles to his name.
