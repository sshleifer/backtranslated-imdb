What a monstrous piece of garbage !!! Who are all these people who Blubber how good is it? Yes, it's "art"; and yes, it's "alien", but .... this is not enough. The plot is boring and inconsequential as a reality show, but not so smoothly done <br /> <br /> People are inherently uninteresting. but as signs, they do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them. If they are based on real people, I feel very, very sorry for them. <br /> <br /> violence (and some of them are very strong), it seems very flashy and gratuitous. It's like a manufacturer has a vision to be Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think a lot of it, or <br /> <br /> And, oh yes. And if I had neighbors like that, I would have to move!
