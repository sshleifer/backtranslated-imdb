You know what movie you're getting into when a serial killer protagonist is transported to the electric chair (in what appears to be a bakery truck), only to the prison car collides with (and I am not making this up) genetic engineering tanker. Mucus, which leaps forward it melts and fuses his DNA with snow, making our hero killer snowman. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie, however, is the over-the-shoulder shot snowman thrashing poor chmy in which his hands look suspiciously like a pair of white gloves Potholder oven. <br /> <br /> Mmmm, trash ...
