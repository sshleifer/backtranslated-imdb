When I first started watching this movie, I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors, but soon I realized that this film is really about the people on the train. The interaction between people, like the ones you can see on any given day in the street, and on the occasion when there is a little more interesting situation dialogue becomes unnatural and boring. Its not that I do not understand how this film is trying to portray how people interact, it's just that in this film, they are very sad. If you want to see and analyze the kinds of relationships you would be better to actually go and buy a ticket on the train and look at the people on the train with you. It's real, but you would not go to the cinema to watch a movie about you sit there watching a movie.
