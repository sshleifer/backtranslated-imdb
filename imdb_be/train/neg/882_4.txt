There is a reason this went straight to the analog video story insinuating, Nick Cage plays Johnny sloppy sex in the way churches and other scenes that border on the tasteless (like the scene in the laundry room) will spoil the movie. Judge Reinhold as a cuckold is okay-, but the film itself, with its themes of revenge and degradation are not well made. But this is a good movie for coins contests-, because very few people have seen it.
