The film itself is not so bad; many of the comments point to the obvious shortcomings of the script, but it's watchable. What really gives me the creeps, although the fact that people like Justin Timberlake even erupt for a movie, and on top of that, both the films. I must admit that I've never heard a person's name, before looking at it, but the very moment he appeared, I was just annoyed. Voice shit face bad plagiarism Legolas pose terrible, and he can not even properly coordinate all three of them. He said to say, I was glad when he got jumped after leaving a disco, because I was hoping that with the time it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only. I wish I was wrong. These two, as well as LL Cool J offers a very decent performance, and they are the main reason why I give it a 4. <br /> <br /> I see a lot of upcoming movies with small Timberlekami thrown ... and can not believe it,
