I remembered the name of that good. For me it was a movie Flora Robson with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in a supporting role. And it was the voice of Vincent weight of whiskers. Well, Flora Robson was great. Her next signature, it would be for me, "55 Days at Peking". The same role, but with a variety of luxury dresses. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was the subtext. I love black and white films. Was everything done in Elizbethan every night? It was Talky and difficult to understand at times. I could not tell which was the love interest. It was the Spaniard or is Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth I would be a brilliant strategist to recommend that the fire ships sent against the armada. Apparently, he was working for the Empire, but not for the script. It might be more accurate historically, but Bette Davis more attractive scenario. And I missed the light of day!
