Of course, this one is actually not a blockbuster, and not assigned a position. "Dieter" is the first title is quite popular German musician who ever loved or hated the kind of action and the fact that this film is about. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter" wrote a few years ago, but it should not be precise on this. The movie is filled with some kind of sexually offensive content (at least for the US standard), which is a fun (not for the other "actors", of course) or dumb - it depends on your individual type of humor or you have to be "sick" -Fan or not. Technically speaking, there is not much to criticize. Speaking I find this movie to be OK film.
