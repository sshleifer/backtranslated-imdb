If it smells like garbage, and if it looks like garbage, it should be clear of debris. This is definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. bad style of directing Tony Scott puts shame already uninteresting and slightly dark story of the life of Domino Harvte as a mercenary. History is completely broken and confused look. Some aspects of the story were ridiculous and absolutely incredible. It seems that all the action scenes were loosely strung and bad points of the plot and hardcore action. Knightley does get completely naked in this, though. That is the one and only up to this film. If you want to see her naked just not fast forward the film to about a half hour into it, and you'll catch a bunch of nipple. I strongly recommend that no one is watching this film ever! </ 3
