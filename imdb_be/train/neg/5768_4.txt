Well, I was excited at first to upload an animated film with open source, only to be destroyed by the demo reel. The animation is excellent, lip sync awful, and you continue to watch a movie in the hope of understanding what is going on, only to realize nothing is happening. You do not feel any emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators for wasting your time. I've seen short films with renewed emotion to twice as fast! This could up with was a beautiful short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I am sure that more and more in Blender excited to showcase its software and its ability to render, but I'm sorry, guys, speaking of stories, which makes the film.
