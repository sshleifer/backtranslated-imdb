Sad sad film about the town in the 50s. How anyone could think that this is a classic? Producer pretty much ended his career, pushing his girlfriend, Sybil Shepard, in a few films, which were higher than the way her acting ability. I think that this film gives an idea of ​​how a poor future movies will be Peter Bogdonovitch. Career Cybil Shepard took a dive after a few films that Peter Bogdonovich production. It was not until "moonlighting" that her career began to return. I thought the acting was poor color reproduction with "The Graduate." I noticed that this film was not shown in the United States. The only place where I watched it was abroad in Europe late in the night.
