My God, what's happening? Movie by Uwe Boll and positive feedback? Wow! <br /> <br /> It is pleasant to note that most of the positive reviews come from beginners to work in Boll. I myself, as I have said in previous reviews Uwe Boll, only to watch their movies in the hope that one day it will actually do something good. I mean..IT MUST GET ONE DAY! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the seed is not on the same day. I do not even know where to start a lame attempt a horror movie, that seed is. It is important to remember that people are sickos in the world that way due watching different patients acts on the video or the network ..... so if Mr. Ball said. I still can not for the life of me understand why the real footage of animal cruelty and murder had been necessary in the first 10 minutes of the film. I understand that the concept of Seed (killer) is Siko ~ d and likes to watch things ..... but can not understand why Mr. Ball thought to put real footage in the film will work. Can shock us? Hmm ..... Well, I, for one, does not shrink and can handle to see anything on tape. I do not even find the use of real animal cruelty footage exciting in the least degree. If you're trying to shock me, it did not work. He just reminded me of how messed up the world because these things happen, and because that Uwe Boll is allowed to continue to make films. This kind of context that may have worked in films in the 70s / 80s (Cannibal Holocaust), but today's market. <br /> <br /> At the same time out of the way, we can move on to the fact that Uwe was able to give the film a very cheap feel all like BloodRayne 2. You can just tell that there was not a lot of money floating around for the production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr. Ball does not really care to create a worthy history, we were treated to the sad shots of policemen watching various videos seeds of victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of the video ends in the speeded fault of the victim. It's all very boring and tedious. I will not comment on the small stage, as it is funny and just another cheap "shock" factor. <br /> <br /> If you can sit down for the first 25 minutes, then you will be treated by the police officers go through a very dark house to catch the seed. The lighting is terrible and Uwe have the old "I'm not using a constant cam" bummer, what he did with BloodRayne 2. Watch how police officers die in all stupidly increasing the path to such a point as Seed is caught. This scene is soooo bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it. The cops really say Seed he could shoot him. For some not-to-be-known reasons, the police did not shoot him. Given that the seed is Sicko, which kills children and adults, you would think at this point will prevail, that the meaning of the script. <br /> <br /> Hence the turn to perform silly scene, and then the cops hide alive Seed (and they know that it alive..why not shoot him in the head ????) and then Seed produced from the earth, and then kill some random woman with a hammer, and then steal one family. <br /> <br /> police what I'm trying to convey to you all that it's just silly! It's not even Hollywood horror silly .... just stupid. Uwe Boll can not send ****. Anyone from any ounce of taste agrees with this statement. Whoever looks this film and found it interesting in any way shape or form you need to seriously look at myself as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again, we were treated badly acted, directed, lit, custom, scenic piece of shit UB.
