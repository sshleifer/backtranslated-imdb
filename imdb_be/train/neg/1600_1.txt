The biggest hit National Lampoon is "Animal House", and rightly so. It was interesting, hoarse and good-natured. <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of every other movie National Lampoon. Including "Class Reunion". <br /> <br /> Please do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ( "Flounder") from "The Menagerie." Or the fact that John Hughes wrote this jumbled mess. This reunion is about as fun as a root canal, and twice hurt. <br /> <br /> One star, and it is to be generous. Again, I always thought that most of my old classmates were demons, vampires and serial killers, too.
