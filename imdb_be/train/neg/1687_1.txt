If you go to see this movie, you will hold a grudge against the cinema, director, producer, actors, and the man who told you to go see! Ashamed Gellar, for putting your name and face to this poor excuse for a movie. It may have been more scared when Japanese actors were just talking in Japanese, instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to boo when the movie ended ... real disappointment after all the hype on TV and movie trailer promoting this lame creator of money. Sarah Michelle really should not act at all to make this film ... she just practiced their skills with a frown. Do not waste your time and money on this film.
