What a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It is good begins with a title sequence, but this is about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> In the film, something about the rats turn into monsters and going on killing spree. Act not so much the poor, but the script does not make sense, and the film is not even scared, despite the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It's really amazing that some of the group amassed the garbage bag and thought it would make a good film. <br /> <br /> This is not a good film. This is rubbish, and I urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it! One out of ten.
