It just seems to work fine form any film starring Dolph Lundgren is bad! I do not know if this is what the story line in the leaky, or Dolph such a bad actor. Lot spoiler here, he does not seem overdue for pushing and grabbing and touching thing in this film. In my opinion, it is strange that some of these projects to find venture capital to get to the bank and to the theater.
