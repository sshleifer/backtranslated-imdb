This film is an excellent example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized. There are two ways to take in the horror films, either you do not really explain what is happening (or who the murderer is, as in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) or give the characters a lot of history and characteristics, so that the explanation is (potentially Halloween an example of this). <br /> <br /> unfortunately, Creep fails in this regard. I see absolutely no reason to give a small fraction of the prehistory to Craig without fully capture the essence of his character or his motivations. Neither character is not fully realized, although the circular nature of the character Kate in the film the most perfect part of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, this story is mostly unmotivated, and none of the performances do not give it to the necessities of life, to make it fun and enough to overcome the lack of context and an empty film that pulled down the film. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this film will go down as yet another example of the film (the majority) that could be a lot better, even though it will never be great. The only thing that was properly used in the film was the setting: the characters, the story, the direction, and the whole letter would benefit from a serious facelift <br /> <br /> Creep really serve a purpose as meaningless ,. silly horror film, without intellectual or emotional investment, but unfortunately, that's about it ...
