"Fist Skull" opens with a warning and offer services free funeral if you have to die to watch it - now there's a hook! The story itself is quite an interesting premise for a horror flick: the wily husband to marry a rich woman with a history of mental illness, and then tries to convince her that she is going crazy from the shrill sounds, the mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at the wrong time. Add a formula quite terrible gardener who still keeps the memory of the first man's wife, he was ordained. Maybe this is just what the 1950s did not have the technology to remove some of the frightening scenes needed for the juice to this film, the methods used here, it seems far-fetched and ordinary. But then again, when I first saw "The house on the hill" ghosts as nine years old, he gave me a nervous jeebies in the same way, I am sure that this film made young viewers of the same era. <br /> <br /> do not get me wrong, the movie is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. But there are some great atmospheric tension as a whole is huge, but Whitlock unfurnished houses and gardens and a swimming pool is a nice touch. For me, it is best to act out scenes includes Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) is going to manic in the pond, which is trying to restore the hidden skull, he just sneaks right in the clothes, and all in a clean contrast to the mentally disabled gardener (directed by Alex Nicol in double role). It makes you wonder who the real fool was <br /> <br /> In his own good sense, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about this neat roadster Whitlock composition of their first appearance in the - in the gullwing. 1958! At least, I have to jump out of your seat!
