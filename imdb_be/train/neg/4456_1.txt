This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. The fact that it has a flimsy story's bad enough that they hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the premise of this film before I started watching, but entered his open-minded enough to accept even so, that the authors considered it appropriate to introduce Elijah Wood sign Mt hooligan scene. <br /> <br /> but the film throws inaccuracy inaccurate after that. the point that by the middle of the film, each of them makes you cringe harder than the time before <br /> <br /> Let's clarify a few things: Bullies are not subject to virtually break its own pub to run -of-mill league games; they are not set to kill each other; they are not only wearing Stone Island (and others in the crowd, bullies, or NO to do). They are certainly not, if we take exception to the new member of the firm, carried on their competitor's territory for a pie and mash. And I would like to meet HOOL, who will go and grass on top of the boy of his firm to a rival firm. (Although you can scratch what I said about installing to a kill each other, if one exists). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I have not seen a film on this subject, doesn "t contain some fancy whims, but this is on par with the brand for the ignorant. <br /> <br /> I found it ironic that the US nemesis Wood morally condemned his character that the cocaine user, when it is an integral part of the British hooligan scene. The film picks entirely defy morality Wood and instead avoid any firm using coke. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think I made my point. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is very mundane, and I'm sure that if I had not spent the entire film, which is crying glasses and more, made above, I would guess that happened before i. And believe me, I was well ahead. <br /> <br /> I get the distinct impression that this film is aimed at people with the hope that women will use injections of emotional problems raised. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the creators could not completely. This is too unreal to be accessible to anyone who knows about the scene, and I can not believe that the kind of woman who is looking for emotional movies Fenya to any of the characters who have given their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> is there any good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I am rarely impressed by slow motion action, of course, not when it is a struggle, as the point is to fold will awaken enough anyway. <br /> <br /> There are some funny moments when unrealistic. Wood's trip to school did bring a smile to me. But a few mildly amusing moments almost did not make up for viewing two o'clock fabricated complete waste. <br /> <br /> If you are a British avoided like the plague, unless for the further development of the misconceptions of the scene, if you do not know. If you're an American, you can enjoy, as is clear from the market into account. But no one can deny, the plot is not contrived, predictable and, ultimately, over the top.
