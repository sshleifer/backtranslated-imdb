What I think I'll probably be better, as the new Star Wars movie "The Way threat" it is that it is likely to hit "Titanic" of the water, if you'll excuse the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thus to knock him out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone announce, "Titanic" is the biggest movie they've ever seen, I think to myself: "You do not see a lot of movies, do not you?" What a travesty. You could do 50 good films that are a lot better than "Titanic", and for the same price tag. <br /> <br /> Â«Well, he has won numerous awards academy, many people really loved him," as one might say in his defense. Well, a lot of people like Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but it does not mean that it is high quality. Thus, millions of fans of Elvis may be incorrect. <br /> <br /> I'll be the first to admit that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype the film. I waited for a month or so to see it, and ultimately, it does not meet the expectations that are installed on it, which is simply called more attention to the awful silly love story. It is true, "The Phantom Menace" is likely to suffer the same fate. but. <br /> <br /> James Cameron's "Titanic" is. a) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b) three o'clock epic that has his best moments distributed in the trailer. c) juicy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something better left to the documentary, which I would have enjoyed more. e) the film with the arrogance that lives up to the level shown with a real ship. e) robbery 3:00, I'll never go back, because the greatest motivation for a time machine, I can think of. When I meet someone who has not seen it yet, I say, "I would like to change places with you." D) spit in the face of any true victim of hypothermia. How long do we have to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water, and are still meaningful sentences? h), fortunately, a film that has not been recognized for all existing achievements at the Oscars. i) technological achievement in film, and little else. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm posting this as anonymous comment I salute not Objection 10,000 thirteen years old fans of Leonardo DiCaprio, who will no doubt to his defense, and I'm not very interested in hearing protection in the Titanic story, the action or longer.
