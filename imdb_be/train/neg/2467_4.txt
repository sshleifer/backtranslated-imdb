This movie gets in 6/10 rating from me, and 9/10. And here's why: As a standard horror movie for standard horror crowd, where the action and the blood and the scares are taken into consideration, the film bore you. It is basically a family drama similar to what you want to see on the Lifetime channel, but put in the universe of horror. The history and age-old formula, restored by hundreds of times. If you are looking for some originality in plot structure or minimum conflict, you will be disappointed. Take a zombie, and you'll have something as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind, stumbling on the cheese. It is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic idea of ​​synopsis and quite original and over-the-top. This is literally what you and your friends will joke about when you're half drunk. ,, But it's a joke actually got a theatrical release. The idea gets a 9/10 from me. The only reason it is not perfect, because they could take it even further, but they are not. <br /> <br /> The combination of both mixed. I thought it was interesting, but like most of all comedies, it was not funny. I had my mother and sister watching me and jokes that we made about it have been funnier jokes script. There were moments of complete genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films are taking this kind of over-the-top risk and original ideas. I just can not say that it was wonderful, even with him, because of the lack of originality of the plot. <br /> <br /> great family film. A great movie to watch with a bunch of guys (or girls). A great movie to watch with someone. ,, But if you look at it alone, it will be a bit boring. Other people always do this kind of movie funnier and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
