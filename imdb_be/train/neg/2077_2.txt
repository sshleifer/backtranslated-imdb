I need a reason to get out of the house, while the paint dried. - left the movie after hours to go back and see the paint dry <br /> <br /> I do not remember ever leaving the film before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not until the cast and went on "going and going" bad - come on! Uma Thurman doing this stuff? Pretty lame special effects. These were the old characters and the actors do a superficial horny 20-something lives. - just kind of annoying and unhealthy feeling <br /> <br /> This review is the base only for the first hour - it may become better. I just had to go home and see if the paint dried darker shade than when it went on.
