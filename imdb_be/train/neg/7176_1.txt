I have nothing more to say, but it was awful. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. And if some of the actors do not want to make people question their sexuality, then perhaps they should refrain from more of these films. There have been at least one saw that left me wondering. Just my opinion. Shudder to think what's going on, that was cut from the film. Interestingly shudder that passed through the minds of the actors who have made this film. I shudder to think about the process of thinking and voyeurism that was happening in the minds of directors. As I've said it a humiliating mess. It's not even funny. As Ebert said the film Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, not a good story and it is not even a good porno. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
