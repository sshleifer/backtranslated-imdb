For such a great classic story, the setting (location), Grendel disappointment. As a writer, I blame the script, which completely lacked dramatic tension. Heading the club's history and would be useful to give a new look to the literary classics. For some strange reason, that heading was dropped early on. To find out it was filmed in 21 days tells me, "rushed" and, unfortunately, shows. Now we have to wait for the version of Hollywood on the big screen. I have a word on the FX, I can tolerate really crappy CGI, but the script has to swing, and this one was too slow, spartan and lacking in drama. I blame it on the actors, but ... since I know what to write more than acting, I'll call on my colleague.
