I saw this movie at the drive-in in 1959 to "Howard the Duck" I do not think this is the worst movie I have ever seen. This film tried to unite all the families in the other; comedy, horror, teenage angst, and the hot rod to be boars "My mother's car." Maybe he deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of its time.
