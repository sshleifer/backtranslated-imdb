I personally hated the movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotypical, and the whole idea was to rip off «The Cutting Edge» and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character snotty girl who gets immersed in a place where it does not belong. The whole place hates her, and even worse have a hot guy who seemingly does not like it (well, the Spirit of the whole damn school hates you). Surprisingly, she finds a way to fit in and do anything to please her, plus, the guy gets apply head over heels in love with her. Then comes the choice of where it needs to choose between figure skating and hockey. She chooses ice, then she goes to the citizens of figure skating, and gets to be on the Olympic team. No real surprise there. <br /> <br /> The whole film was not so damn predictable You knew that was going to happen before you even see it. It was so awful, I almost threw up, and by the time I finished playing, I had a terrible headache and the desire to shoot to see this shit. He can not see, if you are not under ten, or actually as black teen movies.
