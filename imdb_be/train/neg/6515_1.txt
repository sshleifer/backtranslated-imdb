This is not a boring film, the audience could stay in his chair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, as a filmmaker and an actor here. The storyline is simple: after the divorce, and ten years in hollywoodian unstable, author of the play is the desire to love the camera. The first question that really is all that: what is written, that happened to be? Both no answer, "yes" or "no" draws M.Berkowitz as a low average human undisputed. If you look in the fantasy of love, like this one, I Recommand you to read some independent comic Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt very disappointed to hear so much against in my country, France. I know that the American people tend to say that the French are arrogant (which may be true at the time), and so on, and I am sure that the French (and the world) have a lot of angst against America, but why so much hatred ? I do not think that I could not enjoy this film only due to the fact that one way or another.
