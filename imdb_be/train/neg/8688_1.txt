If only sex you've ever had it with farm animals, the tag line for the film is likely to still be misleading. <br /> <br /> It is definitely one of the most boring films I had the pleasure to try and see lately. I found the DVD lying around in the house of my friend, and I made the sad mistake of not burning it. <br /> <br /> I can not say any details without spoiling the film, because there is only about 5 parts to this movie. Just try to imagine someone making a film about the things on the C-SPAN only fictional film 10 times less interesting than the sad debate on C-SPAN. <br /> <br /> I think that there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie, but I could not tell exactly what it was after I gouched has eyeballs, and threw them on the Richard Gere.
