This film stars, among other things, «SlapChop» Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Battafuoko - not exactly the names that scream "quality". And with such a sublime parody as "Supermodel taking a dump" (this is exactly what it sounds like), a guy who robs the sperm bank ( "Reimer"), necrophilia with the rotten corpse of a black rudiments of the market (with the participation of a Man digging that must be them from a jar), a lot of fun and a lot of jokes, a parody of a giant phallus, which is a superhero and forced abortion. The painfully unfunny parody (such as "Batman and Rhymer»), acting is not good enough to be considered an amateur film and only crude in order to be crude ... and stupid. I really believe that a group of 8-year-old could easily make a funny movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> It seems that this film has led to a lawsuit «Slap Shot» Vince against Scientologists. Frankly, I do not know who is hurt in this case !!! Apparently, he argued that in some way a Scientologist destroyed his reputation and sinking of the film. Regardless of the fact that the film repels junk from start to finish, and 99% unfunny (compared, Ebola funnier) ... and those wonderful things that I can say about the film. <br /> <br /> By the way, Bobby Lee (from «Mad TV») wearing a diaper and participate in a silent fake porn film. Strange that his career could overcome this.
