it may have been a good film if learn something more interesting, and not just the surface of a lesbian relationship, if that was the point of the movie ... it's predictably not to mention the fact that the two girls resemble Russian group tATu. ..coincidence? I do not think so. There is nothing original in this film, to support him, so they had to use what is already famous.You knows the recipe. Other actors ... well, I just do not know what their role should be. Most of them are well - known people in Romania, and I should mention some of them are not even actors (egMihaela Radulescu) .SO summarize his "girl group tasteless" desperate + / publicity in need of "actor" + a non-existent plot + occasion to swear to shock = Love sick .... too bad ... the idea was good, though ... and I seriously keep myself from commenting title ...
