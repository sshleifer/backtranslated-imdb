The American Humane Association, which is a source familiar clause "did not prevent no animal ..." (registered trademark of AHA), start to control the use of animals in the film industry for more than 60 years ago, after being blindfolded horse was forced to jump to his death from the top of the cliff for a shot at Jesse James movie (1939). Needless to say, a brutal act of killing all the entertainment aspect of the film for me. I suppose you could say that, at least, the horse did not die in vain, as it was the beginning gras public awakening to the callous and horrible pain caused the animal to the glory of filmmaking, but I can not help but feel that if the poor animal had no choice, it sure would not be the way that it would take!
