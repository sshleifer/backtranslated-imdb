Well, I must say that before the discovery of "the Beast". saying that he does not really fit into this category, but some strange things that had an annoying squeaking! And personally, I think that my grandmother could run away from this thing, but in any case. I was actually there in this film, even though it has the protagonist of a drunkard and a drug addict heroine did not come as a call. But such scenes as when she runs out of the train, and you can see the picture on the door was kind of awful, and where the guard had just been killed, and "monster" put his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then disaster delayed Form moment revealed the monster he just became your average horror, thrills with limited or deterred. Gradually, I got bored and wanted to close the piece. Like the majority of people said to have been the introduction of homeless people to do that, especially a guy, he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there. I think that this film could really was something special instead it has become what every horror are now! Just boring and well, not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a cheap fright here and there, or a senseless gusset Festival (which is limited, it is unlikely in reality) all means give it a go, but all you serious observers horror to look somewhere else much better movies out there.
