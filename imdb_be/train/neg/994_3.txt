This movie sucked plain and simple. Okay, so it's basically about a girl who gets raped and she gets revenge on another man to rape a rapist. The rapist is a cold shower, but she is partly to blame the victim. I mean, they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff, but if the abuser tries to sleep with her, she does not allow him as a rapist rapes her. And it's a rape scene for a girl is very small, and it's really not to show or something, but when it comes to getting raped by the rapist, it is quite a long time rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> 3,2 / 10
