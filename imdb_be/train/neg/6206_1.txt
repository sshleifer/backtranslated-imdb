Thomas Clay was mixing with the wrong types. That's the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and quite difficult and walks to the drug mad end, as if, as a director, he does not go much better. We get to know the title of the main character, which is a bit of an outsider, we see him in school and at home is not quite fitting to feeling embarrassed myself so many teenagers do. Robert falls with the bad guys and starts missing school, and to take drugs, and before you know it, he is a psycho rapist. <br /> <br /> The film is really about the complete failure of Clay, to understand the relationship between the images of violence and acts of violence, Clay seems to think the crazy young generation done evil scenes of war on our televisions. but he took the most disgusting piece of simulated violence. Is this guy for real? <br /> <br /> If Clay had not seen the YouTube, perhaps he is not naive and knows to be made with a rigid climactic scene of his movie? All who want to see the most disgusting scene from the end of the movie, and I'm sure that will be something that sticks with people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is meaningless in the commission of such an act of violence in the film Clay not only condemns young people who actively participate in the prevention of war, he curses himself as the originator of extreme violence tasteless by reason than his own personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> Shame on all involved.
