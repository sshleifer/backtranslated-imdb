I am hiding for several years. I've never been moved in to post here before, so maybe, this film is worth a star, but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD, passing it in the movie because of an illness and did not bother to watch it until now. I have not read in detail about this, of course, was not even thinking about this film in a few months. It was just that a friend took in the store, so he was watching. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The inoculation I said in a summary of the top is in the trailer and the poster. Right from the off, Jason Statham has hair. As in any other film GR. Or any movie JS, what I saw. At least not in the quantities on display here. And Ray Liotta in the shorts should be warned in advance. It's scary and funny, but not ha-ha-humorous way. He was more in the almost-but-slightly mutated Office-and-so, the lack of the sort of humor way. Each of them say the same thing: "This movie is what you would expect this movie is not like that." <br /> <br /> Now, based on previous wide, movie-watching experience, I was waiting for this movie to be a few things. How to: <br /> <br /> () coherent, <br /> <br /> () interesting or attractive, <br /> <br /> () is not a complete and total mess of the navel of dreams, <br / > <br /> () something more substantial than a motley bunch of poorly implemented stories on what is just a standard ideology of eastern mysticism, dressed as "cool, modern, self-art-form", "brie /> <br / > () I hope to be better than "idiot". <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed, my tone, she completely failed to check any box above. Instead it was: <br /> <br /> (x) {poorly edited the tempo throughout the store, 70s-style fans 8 High jump cuts, incomprehensible "plot" to "twist !!!" comes through the battered flash installation back, I could go on ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) shot, as if depressed goth 14yr-old, who has just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with curtains depicted <br /> <br /> (x) as its own back with the whole "I'm very smart, I 'motif / message that he feels has decided to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure that s people (ie: everyone who does not like). in the audience to make sure they understand, <br /> <br /> (x) is a real waste of my time <br /> <br /> with regard to the undoubted ability of some people to "get" anything out of this well. I'm glad you enjoyed it. One poster said something that caught my attention: under-25s, probably understand this better because of editing. Maybe, but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible, not less. As for «Genius only recognizes enlightened" brigade there, go suck a bow and grow. There's nothing more arrogant and self-centered than people who say that the reason other people do not know great art because they do not understand "the craft / materials / lunar cycle / Higher rational thinking thread" that "filmmaker / poet / artist / palm reader / idiot Savant »uses to explain his" vision / grand scheme / unity with Gaia / great big bucket of hurt. <br /> <br /> for me and many, many more people, it trash. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, history, poetry, nothing is for view the other person should be interesting and moving. In any direction, be it metaphorical, spiritual, emotional, or whatever you feel yourself. <br /> <br /> The only way it affected me was ahead in time two hours closer to my own inevitable death. "The biggest trick he ever pulled was making you think that part of this film is anything at all» <br /> <br /> And now, please, by all means, to toast my buns for me.
