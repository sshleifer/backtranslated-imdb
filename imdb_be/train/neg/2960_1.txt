This is, without doubt, only the worst movie ever made. There will not argue here. This is it. End of story. The history of juvenile and sub-moronic, looking like it was created by the three-year-olds are fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept just dumb. It is inconceivable how someone could come up with something so stupid and think that it was interesting. Jokes also completely inaccurate. If you have not seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your pathological wondering how bad this film, please do not ask me to describe it. Words can not express how absolutely awful this movie. This is not just bad, in fact, a bad film. Even those in the cohesion, if not entertainment value. This. ,, It. ,, Phew! Think of the worst stories ever told, and multiply it by the level of hazard for 5000, and you still do not come close to that awful this film. Dove Pokemon movie one point, giving the film one point, it seems like nothing short of charity. That's how bad it is. Perhaps the producers and directors even take film classes? Since this is a perfect example of how not to make a film. It seems that some amateur high on paint thinner made this film. If you rented it, please take it back and ask for a refund. And do not even think about renting again.
