This film should never have done. Honestly, I have to admit that before I saw it, I had serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, but she has done a lot of movies in the Netherlands, and the young woman who has taken the lead role in a TV personality with a constant smile on his face and not a lot of self-criticism. The actor, who starred in the other I saw recently in Bride Flight and although this film is better, it does not convince me that. To start with the story, I did not read the novel it's based on, but the script, wherein the substrate film is something that can be done with children in mind, a party to celebrate a birthday on a rainy Sunday afternoon, not someone or director of peers who loves to watch a good movie. What is really disturbing was overdubbed dialogue, it was a big part of the time to speak out. My wishes go to the cameraman, at least, he was trying to make something out of it. It is a pity that the film is edited lousy, if not, some of the scenes were certainly more believable.
