Cars in this movie are awesome. To act in this film is terrible. The plot and scenes control does not make sense and are equally bad. If you are really worried about a movie where someone slips and suddenly is ridiculously faster, save labor and money. A good film for racing fans? Well, there's the part where they make the mistake of referring to the racing driver as the driver of the rally car. If you can not tell the difference, you go see it, you'll have a blast. It really comes down to it, there is really very good cars in this film, they are driven badly and quite unreal. Actions hit mainly due to a very bad story. If you want to see a hot girl, turn MTVA or VH1 instead. I am disappointed that such good cars will be presented in such a bad film. If the class of cars were matching the film, they have to participate in the race with rusty bicycles.
