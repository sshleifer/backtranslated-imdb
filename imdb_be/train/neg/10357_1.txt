I really do not like this film, because it does not really bring through messages and ideas L'Engle brought in her novel. We read the novel in our English class and I absolutely loved it, I'm afraid that I can not say the same for the film. There were some significant differences between the novel and adapted version, and it just does not make any credit imaginative genius that Madeleine L'Engle! It is for this reason I gave it a poor rating. Nha see this movie if you are a big fan of the word L'Engle, because you will be very disappointed. However, when you watch a movie for entertainment purposes (or education, as it was in my case), then it is a good movie!
