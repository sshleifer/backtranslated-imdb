Unlike many, I do not find the premise or the theme of the show a little bit offensive. Its implementation, however, is a different matter. How many B-minus movies, all decent jokes appear to have been spliced ​​in the trailers. For most of the 22-minute-so minutes we were sitting waiting for an imperfect piece of any real humor. Or at least something to keep one of fussiness remote counting or carpet fibers. With a few exceptions effect badly; comic over-emoting and gesturing with some of the actors may be well suited for late night infomercial, but not prime sitcom (even a Canadian one.) Although admittedly the original a cultural point of view, I can not help but think that this mostly misfired shot CBC, to repeat the success of Corner gas. Unfortunately, they got tons - and the script - is completely wrong for the prairies. The final insult, they probably could not even afford to have the work done at the location real small town (Why? They are so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Maybe they think the audience will be fooled by the exterior of the city center Rezhayna? As a proud Canadian, I hope this thing goes away soon, and that the rest of the world, primed by publicists KDSA able to quickly forget this colossal embarrassment sitcom.
