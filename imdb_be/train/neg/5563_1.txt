Dolph Lundgren litter and frown your way through this incoherent mystery / thriller, it's not as cool as the box would have you believe. He really is very good here, but the story is a mess clich√© B-movies (detectives, revenge, tycoon, whores, S & M), which looks like it was done, as they went along. The film picks up slightly in the second half, but for a decent Lundgren Flick, rent Red scorpion instead.
