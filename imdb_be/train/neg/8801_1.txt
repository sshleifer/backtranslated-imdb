Pieces (edited) together with parts of the dead body (deleted scenes) from corpses (Anchorman), the Frankenstein Monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy), certainly did not take my eyes (that you ever wanted to look twice .. . ..maybe even once for that matter). <br /> <br /> often -The relative to the scene in WURB made relevant third narrator. Even more alarming is the fact that the characters in WURB not compatible with versions of themselves, that we had in the late TV presenter (in the opening of the story we told WURB occurs shortly after the original.) At the end of Anchorman, Burgundy has grown from the beginning movie and have adopted a hybrid co-presenter / lover. In this film, he returned to his immature people from leprosy phone calls Veronica (obviously, they are more of the same scenes from the original Anchorman splicing and WURB.) <br /> <br /> part that makes this film constantly developing the plot, it includes bank-robbing clan without reason called the Clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit through. This region was the evil of original scripts for the TV presenter. <br /> <br /> Most of the other scenes involving our news teams of Channel 4 clearly alternate / deleted incurs from Anchorman scene. They go in the same direction as that of the original, the same as the original "group of whining about a woman on the team," the scene, and the same cat fashion show segment, Veronica objected to the statements. <br /> <br /> Burgundy resumes his first date with a disc with views of San Diego and dinner at his favorite club, Tinos. Neither character remembers that they were on the disk in place until and unless Burgundy comes to Tinos with Veronica, he introduces him to her as if they had never been before. Oh, and they wear the same clothes as in their original date <br /> <br /> However, I have to give some credit to the filmmakers. - even if WURB no more than a reasonable way of presenting the deleted scenes are linked together with a story. Between these two stories Ron Burgundy - is weak. In retrospect, it is quite a feat for Anchorman WURB risen from the ashes. You stay classy, ​​IMDb. Thank you.
