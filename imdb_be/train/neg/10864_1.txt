So I wanted to give this film a chance to take the 2:00 of my life (in fact it was only 35 minutes) has been my desire to try to understand and hopefully appreciate Indian cinema. All I ever saw was a bit older than S.Ray films. <br /> <br /> reread IMDb I came across this and after seeing the rating 8.7 I came to the conclusion, it should be one that will open the door neizvestnymov and bring artistic pleasure. Oh, how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of the 970 people who voted by Indians and only company outside the Bollywood production was Adam Sandler movies. <br /> <br /> With this rating, the film will rank at the 9th place on the list of top 250 IMDb movie above Citizen Cane, Goodfellas Psycho! I'm really not in the mood to see and criticize, because there is simply nothing that I think it is worth recalling this painful experience. My only hope is that there are many Hindu who wanted me to find this movie as it is - stupid, with lots of cheese and kitsch music.
