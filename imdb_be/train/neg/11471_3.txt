Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws? Orca is not quite "Jaws rip off", but it is obvious that he was trying to capitalize on the success of Jaws. First of all Orca in my opinion, it was a bad film, not scary, but it certainly is not good, on average, at best. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a male killer whale (orca) after seeing his assistant and his unborn calf killed to avenge the fisherman. I could not stand to watch this movie again. The direction of this film is poor, and in comparison with the jaw, it looks like the director, the producers and writers were almost worthless. <br /> <br /> As for the action, it was very average and the likelihood, however, the actual characters that did not cute. The effects were good for their time, and footage of whales looked very good. <br /> <br /> The violence is confusing, bloody, and not recommended for the more sensitive people. Music is exaggerated and very loudly, drowning out the sound effects and annoying at times. I hated the fact that they exaggerated the intelligence of killer whales (orcas sun mate with only one assistant, as shown in the Orca). <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was a bad / poor, in my opinion, due to the reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this film is more of a concept of place among animals and people, so I'm not going to bash this film, and I can understand why some people may like it <br /> <br /> My Rating: 3.5. / 10 (but for its concept, perhaps, 5/10)
