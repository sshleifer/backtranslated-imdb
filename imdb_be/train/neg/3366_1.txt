Given the original version of the film "Ghosts" in my top ten films of all time: "I went up to this fit with trepidation I was right to be cautious, because this movie is poorly written and poorly executed loading old nonsense, all those participating should be. ashamed. original was scared me as a kid for a reason! you can not see anything. Robert Wise use of innovative camera-work and excellent lighting to generate fear and that is why the work. shame the new version is that it relies on intelligent special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, even more sad that the ingredients were there (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones), to do something else. This film should be viewed only as an example of the massacre studio!
