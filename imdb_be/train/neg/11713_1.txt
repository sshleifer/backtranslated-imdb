Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen in years ... I could not watch it until the end ... It's a waste of time ... I'm sorry Snipes that he ended in a film. There's really not much to say about it. Terrible acts incredibly bad line, history, everything. The only reason I would advise you to see this movie, if you really want to see how the movie should be. Just to tell you one scene: the police are looking for Snipes, and they are around the building with helicopters and cars, they shoot around inside the building, but still they were whispering, so that Snipes did not suspect.
