I rarely write reviews on IMDb.com, but I have to warn potential viewers that the film is terrible. Just awful. Like Shaw Bros. movie (I'm not a hater.), and I had high hopes for this, since I found it listed on many sites "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Cinema." (Now I am convinced that these top 10 lists all of the jobs cut and paste.) Firstly, it is difficult to their action in the film. Most of the film consists of talking about the story, which is an amazing feat, because it is thin at best. And the action itself can be impressive in 1978, but this routine by today's standards. Special warning for Netflix users: DVD-they send a terrible; picture is horrifying, and it's not even 16: 9 enhanced.
