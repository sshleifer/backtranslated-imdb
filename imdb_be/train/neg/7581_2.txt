I saw this movie for the second day in a class film school, and I have not seen the film Almodovar before, but went expecting it to be good. Unfortunately, it was pointless film with only a couple of laughs interspersed with two hours of boredom. High heels is just a collection of random scenes that may have worked in their own individual films, but do not put together in a meaningful whole in general. <br /> <br /> So I thought. Then, the next day, my professor of film spent an entire class period, which explains all the hidden small parts of the film, such as a fresco depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers on a background of a transvestite scene some comments about the lack of identity and Spain as a country develops under fascist rule . Apparently, the whole film full of clever little tricks and visual references like this. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? It is still a bad film. It takes more than the depth and complexity to make a good film - you still have to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention to, something to motivate the viewer enough to actually take care of all the subtle tricks. High heels give us a surprising off-beat characters, but keep them in the main routine situation, recycled from other films do not use them, and it looks like Almodovar, to make any point. What is the significance, for example, a Hitchcockian surprise revelation of character, which occurs at the end of the movie? Why is it that even there? Just surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is a funny scene, which deals with the news. And that's all it is the only leisure time. The rest of the movie is just pointless film references and visual signals, which apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my professor of film, it will not take more than one at a condescending deception for the film to be good.
