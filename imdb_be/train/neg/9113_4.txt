They had so much potential for this film, and they completely fall flat. In the first cruel, we are left wondering what prompted the protagonists to become, as they are, and act as they do. There is almost no character development at all in this prequel. It's actually a very sad story, but the film did not do anything for me. It was as if they came from a well instead of writing unnecessary F-word. And the end is absolutely no sense and does not explain anything. Drafting was just awful. Another thing that bothered me is that they used to rent 3 of Exact same lines that were in the original. Such as "Down boy," or kissing scenes, and a few others I can not remember. I was not impressed at all by acting Robin, but Amy did a great job. This is the only thing that reconciled the film.
