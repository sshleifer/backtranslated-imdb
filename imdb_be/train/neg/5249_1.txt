I'm 13 and I hated this film its worst movie in the world, I really wasted my time watching it and was disappointed that calls on the cover and on the back of the film it looks pretty good, but I was wrong its bad. but when I saw Delta it was a very different and a bad actress and I really do not know how old 2 girls trying to be, I was so embarrassed. the film was in some parts confusing and I did not enjoy it at all, but I watched the entire film just to see if it would be better, but it did not, it was boring, dull, and did I say I do not think BORING.and that many other people like him, as well as the sad boring me.boring
