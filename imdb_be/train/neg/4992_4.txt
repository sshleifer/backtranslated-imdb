This film is just another average action movie, but it could be much better. If the gun out they really needed some help choreography. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made this brilliant sequence in the heat, as they move up the street from the robbery - would be turned into a sequence of actions dull into something special. As the rest of the movie was okay - predictable, but watchable - better than one would expect from this type of film. Then the final scene, the show-down, the one we have been waiting for, but it was like something out of the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wild boar, nothing gets, and they run around the house trying to kill each other - the same old, same old.
