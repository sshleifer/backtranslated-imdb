I thought that I was going to watch a horror film .. and end up laughing all the way throughout the film. In a scene where people are transformed into a werewolf, I thought they were joking. Today's computer games ten times better animation. Low budget, is a fitting comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf film. It has good special effects, as they should be (a man transformed into a werewolf). If you do not want to have a good laugh, I would not recommend you to watch this movie. This film is a joke.
