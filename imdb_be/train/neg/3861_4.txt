I'm not a big fan of Rom / com the best of times. Some of them were pretty good (dream checking for Insomniac), but it is once more of the same, but less. <br /> <br /> Over time 100min work, I expected more than one laugh every 30mins, only real belly laugh when men instinctivly travelers and friends to help the character Lee. <br /> <br /> All I can say to avoid. I gaurentee there are at least 10 other films on the shelf, you deserve $$ <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 (And just because I'm a big fan of Lee)
