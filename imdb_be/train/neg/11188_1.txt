It really is the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever. Period. I actually paid Â£ 3,50, to see this steaming excrement from the film. Incredibly sad, bad acting, terrible script, often incoherent and too many scenes that seem to have no relation to the overall film (for example, when the priest arrives partner's Heath Ledger nailed to the wall of a ghost ... what is the point in this scene ? answers on a postcard please ...) <br /> <br /> I had to get a medal for sticking with this film, because it constantly works. I would like to take a strong blow to the groin than to sit through the film again. <br /> <br /> This should be thrown in the IMDb bottom 100-th I hope my voice is 1/10 to help him on his way.
