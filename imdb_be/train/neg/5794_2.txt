Germans are in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun. Good guys never die, when his dramatic purpose. "Plot" has so many holes it ridiculous. (Where are the German soldiers go when they rolled the fuel tank to the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, the hijacking of a train? How crazy it! Germans know where you are going to go, it's not like you can leave a mark and drive off! What a waste. I would like to bonk yourself on the head with a ball striker hammer 10 times, you have to sit through it again. I mean, seriously, it felt like it was done in the 60s, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! A-Team is more plausible than this horrible excuse for a movie. Just look, if you need a good laugh. This film is a Tele Sevalas, that the Green Beret was John Wayne.
