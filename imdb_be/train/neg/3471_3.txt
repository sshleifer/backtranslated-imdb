this film was more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Afflki seriously do not try to act any way or form. He just sucked. Nothing about the film was not believable. The first problems were with brings, where a person gives everything of value in order to save Santa Claus army, but it does not show why. And then the grandmother puts her head in oven- really beautiful and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie is not even in the same tone as the film. There was no explanation of the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose a house, which he has chosen; there was no plausible reaction from the family he had chosen; and people swayed here and there without any reason to be swayed (Example :. Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters go down a sled steep slope- this incident that makes it suddenly fall in love with him Riiiight ...) Anyway, It was a funny moment or two, but they were rare in the film. This seriously must also rewrite (or 4). I hope you enjoy!
