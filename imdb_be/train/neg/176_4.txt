<br /> <br /> I saw it on the channel Sci-Fi. He came to the right after the first. For some reason, this movie kept me interested. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Well ... It was a bad, this guy got involved with the adoption of the film. In the first film, he was "mind" to kill people, but in this sequel, half of murders / attempted murder were the main reason. Director Stanley killed due to creative differences, he grabbed coauthor of creative differences, but the deal with an attempt to kill the cast? A lot of the cast, no movies. He wanted to "look real when they died?" If this was to be such a high budget film, special effects, MAN. Of course, as the first captured the girl leaves, and Stanley ends up being messed up, and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This film had potential. And the saddest thing is that, of all ... really sad part is ... I would watch "The hut on the lake 3." Just because I like Judd Nelson, and he was the only good part of this sequel.
