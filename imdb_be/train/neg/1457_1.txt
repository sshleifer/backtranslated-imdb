I watched this film several times, and all I can say is that it is a low-budget trash, and that he has nothing to do with the real facts of history. Actors performance is very poor, but is the result of the limited capacity of existing ones. Anyone who watched this movie, is now likely to think of Hitler as some mad crazy skinny, who works with a pistol, some Chicago gangster. I can only say that there are much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years, and that the rise of evil is very much below average. I can recommend the German Downfall film, which you can see the brilliant performance of Swiss actor Bruno Ganz on the roll of Adolf Hitler.
