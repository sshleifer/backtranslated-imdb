This film was awarded the 1990 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the past few weeks, I've seen dozens of candidates and recipients of this award in the past 30 years, and I really think that this movie might just be the worst of all - but it was not the only candidate, but won !! I believe that 1989 must have just been a terrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like a super-thin Uncle festers. It seems simple articulated figures that are moved using stop-motion animation. All the same - with the same faces, body and clothes. The only difference is that each of them has a different number of the picture on their backs. All of them are standing on a large platform, suspended as if by magic, into space. Each of them has a pole, and also the box on the platform. Platform starts a little bit and in response to tilting the men move in an attempt to balance the platform. It goes on and on and on and on for a long period of time. The only relief from this tedious when one of them is valid until the end of a rather nasty, but it's just not enough to make it fun to watch at least. Besides passable animation stop motion, this short does not offer anything interesting for me .... NOTHING. <br /> <br /> By the way, most of the short bauble also released in 1989, and I have no idea why it was not among the candidates. It was a great short and was much better than any of the candidates, who a year or a year ago. Perhaps, Pixar's success in recent years has led to a deviation in relation to them, but a bauble so smart and so funny, it seems almost criminal to ignore it. Can Pixar did not enter into it? It seems unlikely.
