Timberlake's performance almost attacked on the screen. It was not all bad, I just think that the role of reporters is not so for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played a typical role of a rapper, tough guy around the cooler. I do not think, cracked a smile throughout the film, even if proposed to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman largely carried the entire movie. It has some funny scenes, which are the high point of the film. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was not good or bad, he was just "there." <br /> <br /> In general, it is Stupid movie. bad story. a lot of bad actions or wrong roles for the actors.
