Preminger directs this world as the history of the pen. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her bohemian as a widower father David Niven holiday in southern France with peanut Demongeot. Things are fine until a family friend Deborah Kerr shows up. Nivens, degenerate womanizer finds winning Kerr is too hard to resist. It's good to Seeberg until Niven loves her and leaves her (as he did with all the women in his past ... including Demongeot). When it appears as though it becomes second banana in life Niven, SEBERG exact revenge Kerr. Preminzher tells the story in flashback from the perspective SEBERG and skillfully combines black and white with sun colored scenes. Cinematography Perinal staggering. The film shows some of the least despotic direction Preminger, although he rarely allows a close-up, making it difficult to understand that the actors really feel. Laurents wrote the script, and it is full of sour dialogue and funny scenes (mostly involving noisy birds Demongeot). Seberg justify pretty good, but Niven is in its least attractive ... and he shows no chemistry or Seeberg or Kerr. Preminzher really MIS-steps with this cast. This is a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg would-be bride and Martha Hunt as his kooky mother. Juliette Greco, playing himself, singing the title song in a night club in Paris. Big names on Preminzher regularly Saul Bass.
