With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in the movie you figure one can not go wrong. But what can I say? It was a terrible miss. A film about Peter Sellers as the older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a very strange young not to mention the attractive hippie Goldie Hawn. The film is incredibly inconsistent, and I about it do not understand anything. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this film proves it. <br /> <br /> This songs about ?? Arabella Cinderella "is pretty cool, but it's true. I only recommend this movie for people who love to watch the extreme novelty of the movie, it's almost the definition of one. I think this film is more than just a sign of the time, in terms of experimentation and defined all around the singularity, the problem is that the quality is completely shot and the writing, not to mention the direction of just there. <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers, in particular, very horrible, it will go from doctor Streynzhlav and being there for their entire career, stupid movies like this and Magic Christian, which was very similar to this one in the context and style, but this film did have a few funny moments. This one is meaningless, and I'm sad that someone as great as Peter Sellers was in this film. It is not recommended for everyone.
