But there are those, and not necessarily the Anglo-Saxon Yahoos, who do not care for the French; and the character of Xavier is not going to sway them <br /> <br /> Let's look at his stereotypical Frenchman attributes :. <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check. <br /> <br /> 2). Piercing, undernourished appearance, check, despite the: <br /> <br /> 3). Great cuisine understanding. Check. <br /> <br /> 4). Warm diligence. Check. (Forget about the fact that he had a rich stockbroker, watching him in the movie, he seems to put in ten hours working week.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check.

Check. <br /> <br /> If Mo redneck or not, there is no reason for her fall for that smug European reproach, except the script so dictate. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, like other reviewers man, I love to see cute, tiny body of Karen Elena. I give the film four stars; two of them for that.
