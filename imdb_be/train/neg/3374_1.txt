This film is considered by some as a classic - I have no idea why. It is terrible to the point of being ridiculous. The only saving grace in this film is the supply of cheese line, so that toe curlingly uncomfortable, you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are some good songs and good choreography in this movie, but SO WHAT! There is no plot, it is set in a theater without a change of scenery, and Michael Douglas as depressing as ever. My brother once made me to see this movie, because he said that I can not believe how bad the movie can get! He was right. <br /> <br /> Normally a film of this terrible, I would recommend that people do not have to watch it, but in this case I think that people should like to put it any other bad movie you've seen in the long term.
