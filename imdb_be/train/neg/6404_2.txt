Spoilers ... if that is possible .... ,,,,,, like a rabid fan of Robin Williams, I felt it necessary to purchase this film as the first appearance on the screen. Wow ... I could not imagine a more intoxicating movie. In fact, the film takes one bad joke after another, that your uncle would Artie tell you after dinner and dramatizes them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in 30 seconds skit. <br /> <br /> I'm for bawdy humor, but humor was not nice vulgar or obscene ... is simply intoxicating. There's no redeeming qualities in this film, except for Robin Williams fanatics like me who just have to have every piece of film.
