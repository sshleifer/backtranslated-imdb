I found it to be a good movie to pass the time, but no chance of any historical value. The image of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> twisting the facts ... funny! She gave birth while feeding its people!?!? Oh, please ... pregnant queen of Egypt (especially one) will not bother to go from one room to another for this reason! They tried to make it seem holy please! And then, as they tried to justify her killing her own sister ... indescribable. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of his time. Its decisions are based is nothing but their feelings and morality. She did all that only two reasons: the power and self-preservation! She has a family, where she was recognized for survival, what she has done very well. All that stands in her way was either killed (her siblings) or seduced (Ceasar and Marc Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was too strong to kill and too ... gay temptation. Thus, it was the end of it ...
