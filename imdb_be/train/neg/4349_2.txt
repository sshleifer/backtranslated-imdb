This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas is not only the one of the best films made crimes. This film should be considered closer to Part2 sting or perhaps speed zone. Remember these gems! The only reason why this film was supposed to earn a cult following the original was made. The film lacked all De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard. There was not a nice character and it is the fault of all responsibility for it. I hope that the coming to power of the Razzie win everyone he possibly can, and maybe even invent some new categories, to allow him to be the champion. After I watched this S @ T * FEST film, I sat down and watched an original way to get Carlitos and bad taste out of my mouth. After watching this I want to Pachanga I came and slapped me out of my misery.
