I would give this movie a zero, or even below, because, unfortunately, that is what he deserves. I honestly never come out of a movie, but this one was so awful awful that I could not stand another minute of it. Please, please, please- miss this film for mankind-. If you want a hot lesbian movie you can really delve into, it is not. <br /> <br /> It is ugly, unsightly leads choppy structure, funny dialogue, and it is absolutely unconvincing every conceivable way, in an absolutely basic level, it will not be entertained. All about "Mango KissÂ» is so unnatural, it is worse than any student film I've seen. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, the entire film is based on a constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over story. written probably also wrote a novel, because they insisted on telling all, rather than to show it. We just have to assume that Lou and Laurel are the best of friends, and in a special relationship, despite that there is no development of character, to illustrate this. In addition, this film continues to impose in new characters after the first five minutes, and not naturally, and in a still image of the characters with their name written on the screen. There is no administration, no development of any of the characters. We did not get to see any of them . <br /> <br /> this is an amateur film that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I am a cheerful woman who watched this movie with my roommate (another gay woman), and we both found this film to be a depressing view of queer cinema. I'm starting to think that lesbians and gay movies very much like Christian rock - it does not matter how brutal it is, people will still flock to it, and no champion, no matter how poor the quality. Please do not rent it !! Instead, let's stimulate the production of gay and lesbian films QUALITY rental "incorrigible" or "Fire" or "to Heavenly Creatures", rather than to swallow all that mindless tripe they are aimed at the gay community (ie, Queer As Folk) .
