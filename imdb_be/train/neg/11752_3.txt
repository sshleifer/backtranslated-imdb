I love the animated show. I like Nick a lot of fare, including Hey Arnold. But the movement of TV shows on the big screen is not easy, and it just did not feel big enough. It was more like a long episode of the show, and he just does not move along that well. Judging by the behavior of children, which we had with us, he did not kill that well with them either.
