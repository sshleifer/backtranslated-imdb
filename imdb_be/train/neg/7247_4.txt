In a nutshell: it's cookie cutter romantic comedy, which really wants to and tries something else. He wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. He wants to be a deep and people. It has interesting shots from the camera, lighting, music, editing, all of which give him a sense of the importance of the film. Smart dialogue - from time to time. There are some "laughing out loud" moments <br /> <br /> But that's what keeps it from being ultimately anything more than a generic late night cable in the field, time-killer :. <br /> <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - how many times can a sad-sack Joe puppy blankly into space with his jaw dropped before he starts to annoy? Maybe some saliva would help. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - she really flat here, and not only in the chest. Its role should be, this lively, sweet, caring girl who just keeps himself in the wrong situations, very embarrassed, as a consequence, which is why the sad-sack loser like Schwimmer has a chance with her. But Gwenneth plays her very sad. Combine this with saliva puppy-dog face (above), and you have very little chemistry to care for <br /> <br /> (I continued to portray someone else in this role -. Kate Hudson, for example). <, Br /> <br /> 3. The script and story - a material that occurs only in the ground does not ring true; all problems to get wrapped up in the end with a neat and tidy bow on the top, it seems that the whistle and the writers just said, "Oh, time to wrap it up, got on the train!" So they dragged the Hollywood formula book mentioned all the boxes, and went home.
