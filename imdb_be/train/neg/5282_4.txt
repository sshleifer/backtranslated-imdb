I must admit that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can in no way compete with the version 1995. The reason why I watched it, I was not completely satisfied with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like a captain I imagined when I read a book. And he did. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only redemptive quality of the film. The rest, as non-Austen as possible. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would never have to run through the streets of Bath as it is. It was not in her nature, and it just has not been done since the lady. Anne Elliot of the book was a woman, and she had the advantage. There are other painful anachronism, but this was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotations from the books, they are in a completely inappropriate moments, warning those who know that the book is another important part of the book either absent or reversed. <br /> <br /> Even though this version is much shorter than the other, it feels like all rushed. Very little attention has been made to introduce the characters to show their inclinations and motivations. Important scenes were omitted. How could they possibly have butchered the final scene in this case? Disaster! And it was not nearly as nice as the other photographed. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you like the Osten, then you do not waste your time with this.
