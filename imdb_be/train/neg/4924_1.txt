This movie is really bad. It can be tough, but it's true. It really is. Poor script, every vampire clich√© in the book is used, and no sympathy are not given at all to the origins of the protagonist ... ie ole Dracula. There have been some really brilliant Dracula / vampire movies in the past, but it does not even make it to the "heavy" slot. <br /> <br /> Take the choice of people who seem to have dropped out of teen slasher course, add a drop of Dracula Lore and mix in a heady tonic religious / surreal dreamy ... and you get tangled mess of film - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I really can not find good things to say about this film, as if it was not so bad that it was done in the first place, they seem to have done Jonny Lee Miller effect English accent ... the problem with that I hear you cry ... Well, he is English, but it sounds like an American trying to do an English accent. <br /> <br /> In general, you can also say, your money (if you are thinking of buying it), or rent it, watch it, and discover why this is how scary as Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La's pretty scary!
