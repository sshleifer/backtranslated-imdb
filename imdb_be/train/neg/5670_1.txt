The only reason, «The Norliss Tapes» deserves no stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Other than getting to see Angie baby in the previous play "Policewoman", there is nothing else worth seeing here <br /> <br /> Synopsis :. <br /> <br /> *** Minor spoilers ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss fused to write a book about the supernatural. One day he mysteriously disappears after calling his publisher, and believing that he had stumbled on something that put him in danger of death. The entire series, for which the unfortunate pilot was written apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks through «Norliss tape." - a set of audio tapes writer, recorded during the investigation into the supernatural <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies - but not before buying the ancient Egyptian scarab ring from the local occultists, guaranteeing him a trinket would give him immortality after death. We quickly discovered the ring does not give itself immortality. Instead, it only revives the body sculptor, allowing him to avoid his tomb so that he could run around the city drainage beautiful girls all their blood. <br /> <br /> Blue-faced, yellow-eyed and snarling with ARRRGHHHHHHs lodges' t heard since the last time you watched the "Scooby-Doo" cartoons, sculptor attacking his wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She runs away and through a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss, to get his help in solving the mystery of the supernatural appearance of her late husband on her property. <br /> <br /> So this guy is a vampire? No. There are no vampires in this story, despite what you may have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of their victims - he collects it. How? I do not know. We only see him no hitter ever collecting. Why? In order to fulfill the second part of its bid for immortality. It turns out, he revived the sculptor will only be allowed to live forever, if he builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth from a mixture of clay and human blood. After he finished, Sargoth plans to populate the statue, using it as their gateway to our world <br /> <br /> The final analysis :. <br /> <br /> «Ribbon Norliss» did not take as a series for a very good reason ... it was garbage. As you can see from my outline of the story is insignificant, ill-conceived mess. Nha action and dialogue offer no better. It's not even a contender for "So bad it's good» Award. Sometimes it is simply bad bad. <br /> <br /> After years of hearing about the great underground peals merits «The Norliss Tapes," I was very excited to find it airing on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. It is a pity that I did not set out for the fall. <br /> <br /> After this groaner screened for the first time two days ago, I can only assume, any applause you've heard so far from the other reviewers IMDB is based on those who view the show on the basis of vague memories and nostalgia for youth. Or perhaps they are just dedicated fans of Dan Curtis. In any event, they have offered you a misleading reviews <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid "The Norliss Tapes." - October 17, 2003
