Previous comment got me to write this. He says that Muslims are light and dark Serbs (because our blood is mixed). This comment just goes to show that this view can be done racist.Look, nothing.I'm race color blind.I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. So, I might add, that I am not 100% Serb, I have some Austrian and Croatian blood in me, but will point.I'm dark, half-breed? Is this so? Any use of racial prejudice with ill intent as Lantos (producer9and director for racist me.Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia. I hope they are all in hell, but it will not return our dead relatives back. I'm proud to be Serbian, and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes, I am from Serbia, and I multiethnical family ) .This film does not show the suffering Serbs or Croats within Sarajevo, terrible street terrorism Andes, Muslim extremism.I add: I kneel and pray for all the innocent brothers and sisters of the Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox Christians killed in this movie manipulation war.This our suffering, false humanism, which does not help all.It Lantos help line the pockets with a female, good!
