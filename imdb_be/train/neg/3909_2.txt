When I learned that there was a film that was my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Winona Ryder, I went through the roof! But I had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and I still bruise.First all signs, Jeremy Irons (Actor I still admire even after this disappointment) played just awful. He treated his family like crap, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not get or sympathize with any of the characters, and I'm not a prude, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary, or they could be mitigated. Wynona and symbols Antonio, could be developed much more, and their romance could be much hotter. And what is the nature of the Meryl and her "mystical powers"? Why did they not go to it any more? This film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that it really is a lousy movie, and there was a lot of wasted talent.
