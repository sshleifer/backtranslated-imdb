Where to start ?! ,,, ... I feel violated! This right has been violated! I just spent my life 1.5HRS, 1.5HRS, I could spend doing something more useful, like watching paint dry on this so-called horror film. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not funny, it is not dramatic, nor his actions, his personal ... <br /> <br /> it is predictable, it sad, it's tragic ... <br /> <br /> I may have come a bit harsh here, but hours of this film, and you'll feel the same way ... or ... no, do not look ... if you do not want to feel violated as well.
