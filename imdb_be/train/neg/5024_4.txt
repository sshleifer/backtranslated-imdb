There's not much to say about it. Gammera is a kind of fire turtle breathing. He was released from a nuclear explosion. He heads to the ground and begins to destroy buildings and tanks, and other debris (oh yes, the power lines. I almost forgot). At one time, at the beginning of the film, he befriends a little boy, and instead of just throw it or crushing it, he puts it on the ground. Safe. Since then, we have to watch this little Chubby faced cad show and run, and run show, show and runs away. For some reason, Gammera able to hear the baby from 20,000 feet. Oh, well, the story to try to get Gammera, to get to a place where it can be put on board the rocket and shot into space. As usual, the monster lumbering and inconsistent (the guy in the suit Gammera). The Japanese army (with the help of the Americans), consume sufficient quantity of ammunition and firepower to solve the national debt, and, of course, it does not do any good. They need to know it anyway. We saw a lot of monsters stomping on Tokyo. Do not put them down, because they can be fun, but it really is not very good.
