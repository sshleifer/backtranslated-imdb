VILLA RIDES (1968) is something of a big disappointment! Although Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the script with Robert Towne, it still serves as the director of the film written leadenly dry on unobtrusive Buzz Kulik. Firstly, the top by Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He is not charismatic enough to play in the great Mexican revolutionary! His one performance banknote lacks the fire and taste of Anthony Quinn and Gilbert Roland could bring to the role. Brynner just looks like a Russian nobleman, dressed as a Mexican bandit who is in the midst of the Mexican Revolution, and not Russian. In addition, the second by Robert Mitchum is completely lost in the picture! His role as a biplane flying ace lobbing homemade bombs from the air in the revolution is badly written a poor role that could be played any small star. Mitch does not have a decent line in the entire film, and brings in the head of his other Mexican Revolution picture a much higher «Bandido» (1956), which, unfortunately, no one seems to have any interest in the release on DVD. In addition, there is no any style «Villa Rides» also suffers greatly without the presence of the female stars! There starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitch joyful eyes, but her casting only superficial. Someone like Claudia Cardinale and Jean Peters could perhaps have added some much-needed recesses intermittently storyline. <br /> <br /> There are a few good scenes in the film, but to do a few good scenes. does not make the film, and less perfect than Panavision image quality, as well as over repeated Maurice Jarre ringtone theme does not help matters <br /> <br /> Like any habit Paramount no additives - not even a trailer! So, frustration cinema and DVD presentations, which could and should have been much better.
