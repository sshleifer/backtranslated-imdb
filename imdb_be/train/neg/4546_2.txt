I just saw this movie and not read the book. Good thing the movie is that in some parts it gets you to think for a while on a spiritual topic, evolution, sincronicity and your part of the world. <br /> <br /> However, the immersion of the film can be easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters. Clearly, the book loses a lot in this film version. Events that were suppose to show sincronicity occur almost unrecognizable. Much thought should be done for the viewer to see the scene indicates a coincidence, and even harder to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose. <br /> <br /> educators scene visually poor and do not create a better sense of what he had. Do you remember the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? Well, there's nothing like it. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes are performed poorly. There are many scenes that do not develop the story, and do not help in creating the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> the best actors in the film, namely, Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Prochnow can not save it. The first two seem to be given more scenes than their characters have to try to save the movie, and because they pay more, but it does not work. Most of the scenes do not really need to, and does not help at all the history. <br /> <br /> JÃ¼rgen doing well in their scenes and sells as the evil guy (as always), but the script will not help him in everything. The scene in which he first tries to convince John (Matthew Settle), to join him just a bad scenario. Execution scene when he dies in an explosion absurdly poorly executed. Memories throughout the film may not even be commented on. <br /> <br /> In general, this film big waist of time to read the book! I have not read, but it's probably a billion times better than it should be. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I had to write my first comment to IMDb.
