This is probably the worst excuse for a television program, since, oh, I do not know what's going on now? Nothing has happened on this funny "series". Despite the fact that it is basically a blow Britney and Kevin yourself, you do not get any good parts of their privacy. It's basically just them do silly things, jocular small talk and act like white trash. Look, I love the music of Britney as well as the next baby, but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to Britney, they would look at her clip her toenails (yes, it can be the actual episode). Thank God, the two broke up, because they were sick sad together. This show is TOXIC!
