Have you ever wondered why the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands, it seems, will automatically assume the sense of humor of black Americans? regardless of their ethnic origin? Well, this film does not give any answer to this question is often thought - but it will provide excellent research <br /> <br /> From the outset, the film acts as a kind of "old school" for the Pacific Islands of New Zealand. Which immediately raises the question, what exactly is the point of such a task. Is this meant to perpetuate old stereotypes of the Pacific Islands of New Zealand? or he is going to use this potential market? History of weak jokes humor, and the end is expected. This film has not done anything for New Zealand cinema, as it is simply appropriated romantic comedy, which is devoid of any merit.
