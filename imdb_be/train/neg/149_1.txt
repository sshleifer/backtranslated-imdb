Well, you know the rest! This must be the worst film I've seen in a long long time. I can only imagine what Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay, taking on this role. <br /> <br /> The leading role is played (for me) is completely unknown, and I would guess that disappeared back into obscurity as soon as this turkey. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee martial arts led charge in the early 70s and since then fight scenes should be a martial art based on, or at least using brutal methods of street fighting. This film uses quick cuts to show the martial arts, however, even this can not hide the fact that the lady did not know how to throw a punch. On average, 8-year-old boy would take it apart in this show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only thing on show here, as it has not won a Razzie for her year.
