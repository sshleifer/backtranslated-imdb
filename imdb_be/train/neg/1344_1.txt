Any movie with a name as funny as "wandering" should automatically attract the attention of every lover of bad movies, but the story is very different than what we can expect that after watching the DVD cover. Bagman is not a good film. It falls into the category of films that appear to be (and probably are) filmed on home video camera. Act badly. I have not heard or seen such a wooden valid from Troll 2. There are a lot of scenes with nudity and sex, but they are clearly jumped in too quickly. Symbols morons and completely forgettable. Ending (which I will not spoil) it can easily be solved after viewing the very first scene. Because of the bad character of the film is nothing but terrible production values ​​is not really scary (awful attempts at realistic blood moving scenes where the car is clearly stationary, etc.). It recommended for fans of bad movies.
