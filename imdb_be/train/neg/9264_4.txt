This is worse than a sequel based on characters created by David Seltzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) concerns marriage name Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They take a little girl named Delia from the monastery. Gene York to re-elect for the congressman, and he is chairman of the finance committee. Meanwhile, Delia appears around when the unexplained deaths occur. It creates wreak havoc when it's a metaphysical fair as numerology shopping, therapy, counseling, healing, yoga, tarot, including other destroyed. Karen York hires a private eye (Michael Lerner), to explore strange and bizarre events. <br /> <br /> This TV sequel reflects the thrills, chills, macabre events and bloody murder. Delia, such as Demiyno seems to send a new gruesome murders every few minutes of the film, is a terrible murder. The main excitement is to observe that the new and innocent victim can be done using the mediocre special effects. In addition, the middling protagonist, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, but a good secondary cast such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and recently deceased Don S Davis, he was captain of the army turned to acting. As always, excellent musical accompaniment comes from Omen I and III of the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is intended solely for the hardcore followers Omen saga. Bad movie directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Preliminary and much better options are the following: a very beautiful original "Omen" (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) Richard Donner; «Damien» (William Holden, Lee Grant) Don Taylor; "The Final Conflict" (Sam Neill and Tisza Harrow) by Graham Baker. Rating: Below average.
