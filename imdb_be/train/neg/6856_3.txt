The film begins promisingly, with an early scene in which Frank Morgan advises against marriage to Gary Cooper's daughter, Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, playing shamelessly gold miners, loudly complaining about Cooper about his alleged need for the hands of his family - including his daughter, Anita Louise. I'm a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan (in my opinion) a Hollywood treasure legend Cooper and Louise very beautiful, versatile and underrated actress rarely seen in the title role. I also have nothing against Teresa Wright, and while not blessed with a large range, it usually delivers a heart-warming speech. <br /> <br /> With a promising opening, the story slips down the slope all the way to the end. I did not find anything funny about the burned house Cooper B-to-be in-laws. Butler in a fastidious, non-smoker household would never just leave carelessly, allowing Cooper to continue to smoke, or if he is, of course, put it with some means of getting rid of his untimely cigarettes. In addition, no one with any common sense would not allow himself to leave holding a lighted cigarette, without the need for some means of getting rid of him. And finally, no one in their right mind crease cigarette in a handkerchief and puts it in your pocket! This entire sequence just did Cooper seems silly and awkward. This is a bad idea - poorly conceived and filmed in a way that causes ridicule not laugh. <br /> <br /> Compulsory medical examination Cooper as unnatural. No one dares to undergo a full medical examination without his advice or his goals to give their consent! This Cooper did so too removed from reality to be funny - it's absurd! Stealing children out of hospitals is a serious offense, and it too, there's nothing funny about it. And finally, the scenes are too fussy, neurotic attention Cooper to feeding and weight of his child may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their newborns. But for me, they just seem tedious and slow. Wardrobe and propyl departments moved into first place in those scenes, while paradoxically, the writer went to bed. <br /> <br /> The lines just not in the script to generate a sense of humor. They just miss out on all cylinders. The laughter did not come in a mile-a-minute, but more like a light year a minute. The only time the movie has any energy or humor, if Frank Morgan on the camera. <br /> <br /> The scene, which is completely wasted if the two love interests Cooper and his parents closed in the same hotel room together. There is probably rich in Vienna humor somewhere in the mine, but not retrieved any of them. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the two very pretty girls are going to get hurt. As might be expected, it is the character of Anita Louise that gets thrown at her to-be wedding night! Although it is not the camera, that it was her destiny, and it's not particularly funny - even as a free end. She has not done anything in this film to make me callous (unlike Gail Patrick, let's say, in my wife's favorite). So I expect that (possibly "hope" is the best word in the context of the film!) For Anita Louise enjoy a happy ending too. The fact that such a good character, in fact destroyed at the end of the film is actually undermining the effect of the "happy ending" for the Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen, for the witty dialogue is so typical for the era of movies ... and never delivered. Frank Morgan Good performance in a slightly different role completely wasted here.
