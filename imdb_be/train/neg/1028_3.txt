I can not remember the last time I reacted to the statement, both emotionally as I did Justin Timberlake in "Edison". I'm so emotional I wanted to scream in despair, destroyed the screen, it is easy to take desperate cries of nihilism. Timberlake terribly miscast; in fact, rejecting it as casting Andy Dick to play a leading role in "Patton" or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But it's almost beside the point. <br /> <br /> Timberlake just a bad actor, and he would have been just as bad in any role. I used to have problems with the acting talent of Ben Affleck, but Timberlake makes Affleck looks like Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Judi Dench. With his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), his boyish looks and emotional expressions that follow from something like "25 Cliche expression for actors," it poisons the screen on which it inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, I It is not and will not buy its role as an amateur wrestler who became a journalist exchange for justice. it just will not fly. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake alone is not to blame for his failure. Directed by David J. Burke of his not only in (essentially) the lead role, but also places it in the side of Morgan Freeman, Evin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes, and (I was surprised that it was good) LL Cool J. I can imagine one almost physically suffer watching some of these actors interact with Timberleykomom <br /> <br / > there is a positive side of the course :. moment any of these actors interact without Justin where he feels like a double relief, pleasure, if you will. Freeman and Spacey can not be more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but in ten minutes blissfully unlike his scenes with our wrong with anym hero. Dylan McDermott and breath of fresh air <br /> <br /> But enough bashing Timberlake. - there are no words in this particular case to do the trick. "Edison" is very, very ordinary story of corruption. This section ranges from cliches simply ridiculous. However, I admired the motivation to do it, that I regard as a tribute to films like "Serpico" and "Donnie Brasco," or maybe even "Chinatown." Do not get me wrong - "Edison" is not even in the same ballpark as those movies, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief, to admire its reason of existence, perhaps to justify my sat through it <br /> <br . /> The script, by itself, has some surprisingly bad writing. Yes, it does have some decent outcome, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (which is unused here) and Timberlake seems like it was lifted straight from an episode of Dawson Creek. This is your typical far too fights exchange in fact, let's impression-to-audience-with-how-we-hole joint (and not) dialogue. This dialogue, mind, punctuated by great music at the wrong time - sometimes it feels like "Edison" wants to turn into a music video where scenes of emotion is not communicated through actions, namely through poorly chosen music and the speed version of the film (read speed). <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, "Edison" is a curiosity. He sure as hell was cast to kill for but overshadowed by the performances Timberlekami that simply does not work. In the film, as with most art, if one thing is off, it all feels off. Directors are required to make tough decisions. David J. Burke missed here. Some scenes play well in and of themselves, but on the whole, they did not stick out like puzzle pieces of different puzzles, bundled into one incoherent picture. And it is not particularly addictive puzzle game to start.
