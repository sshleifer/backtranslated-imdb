Nacho Vigalondo very famous in Spain. He is my native poor showman who can make you feel sick ... very uncomfortable. Nacho did a few commercials on TV, I remember the one in which Nacho looked for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (commercial was about Mc Carney CD collection). <br /> <br /> This short film as commercial Nacho: bad plot, bad directing, and terrible performances. I can not believe that disgusting film, as it was in the theater Kodak. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nachos could have made this film because of his wife, producer of 7:35, the woman is very well connected with the Spanish TV business.
