It only gets beat because star David Hasselhoff. Well, then let me hit him. Compared with the garbage they call horror comes in our time, this film is not so bad. It has a beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot, but can not speak very well. There is a great scene with her when she was raped supernatural. She shows her beautiful body. Linda Blair does nothing here, and Hasselhoff. 3/10
