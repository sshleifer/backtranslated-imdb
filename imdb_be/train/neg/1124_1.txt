The opening shot was the best thing about this movie because he gave you the hope that you will see a hot, well-thought-independent film. Hell, the opening shot to fill me hope. As the "film" has progressed at a slow, plodding way, my thoughts were different with respect to this "film": Was there too much butter on my popcorn? Did the actors have to pay a director to be in this "movie"? I get my ticket validated at the box office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! This is the only exception was made about watching a movie at home on the cinema, because at home you can turn it off. Was there any redeeming value? Peter Lemongelli as a standard college "nerd" had his moments, especially in the dog collar. In addition, that "film" has gone from being a comedy to family drama to spiritual uplifter. It succeeded in any of these areas. Oh, and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
