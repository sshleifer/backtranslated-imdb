The "lapsed Catholic" who was 11 years of Catholic school, but has not been to Mass in 35 years for weddings and funerals, with the exception, I thought I'd get a kick out of it. And I did. ,, During the first two-thirds of the movie. It's all standard stuff - a strict parochial school teaching, repressed sexuality, etc. But then, suddenly, the film has turned mean. Really means. Now you see, I've seen this before pedophilia scandals hit. ,, And maybe I would not be so offended by such ugly, hideous dripping in the Catholic Church, if I had known about these abominations (eg Catholic life!) And coverups. <br /> <br /> It was a few years ago, I rented the video, and I'm not coming back to rent it again from a new perspective. He just left a dirty, nasty, nasty taste in the mouth. ,, It is interesting that the experience of all of the actors were the Church, either because they * really * hate it, or they whored to wage. It's incredibly anti-Catholic film offensive to those who have a glimpse of the lumen of respect for Catholic Education. What I still do, because there was no the best teachers in the 50-ies. What else did these nuns, they forced me to learn to read and write in English. They made us remember. (How many children today can do simple arithmetic in their heads?) True, there is nothing more important for success in America. Can I read it? Can I add / subtract / multiply / divide? Excellent. You can get any academic degree you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will serve you well, and not only, as you continue your studies, but also for the rest of your life, no matter what you think of the Catholic "mythology" we all had to learn. <, Br /> <br /> such a big cast, so vile, rotten script. I really feel bad (and no, it is not "bad" - believe me, the nuns taught me better) for the writer and director <br /> <br /> I thought I have mixed feelings about the Catholic school .. But the participants of the project They must have had these bad (ie.e, dumb) children who were sitting in the back of the room, if they are willing to participate in the creation of this film.
