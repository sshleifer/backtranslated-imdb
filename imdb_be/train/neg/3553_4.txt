"Incubus" is a mixture of good (an interesting murder mystery), the bad (a disconnected scenario, careless resolution, poorly made stage attack) and the strange (the strong incestuous overtones, strangely sleepy and ill execution of John Cassavetes - that character actually had mean to be so «Wacko»?). Not as insulting as it is famous, but not particularly well, either. (* 1/2)
