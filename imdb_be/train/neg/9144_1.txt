This film is just really awful, eye candy, who plays Ben only can compensate for everything else that is not the case with this film. <br /> <br /> Writer / director / producer / lead actor, and so was probably a good idea to create a film that touches important issues of gay marriage, adoption of family, religion, homophobia, on the grounds of crime hatred, and just about any other issue, which carries a gay these times, but is trying to ram each question in such a badly conceived the film does little justice any of those reasons. <br /> <br /> Poor script, evasion is very ordinary, but the dialogue and which operates only in a deplorable state. Homo-hating brother is playing in the main camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors (I think I saw more passion as corn flakes ad). They act tough, and the dialogue is forced (the scene where the detective brother feeds his line was the highlight). <br /> <br /> I'm just glad to see that the creator of this train wreck is not pushed any other debris in the distribution and if he thinks doing so, I have some advice - JUST DO NOT DO IT.
