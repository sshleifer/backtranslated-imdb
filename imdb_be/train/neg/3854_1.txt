Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who under the guidance of a reputable agent has great potential. Obviously, the man who led it in this parody is not someone who cares nothing about his career. I sat in the theater, among adolescents who have left en masse to find another film to penetrate wondering who thought that this film will appeal to anyone. It was poorly written, the casting director can only put 1 or 2 minutes of effort on the character and the director obviously did not care.
