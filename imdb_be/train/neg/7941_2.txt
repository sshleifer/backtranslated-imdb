As the 2000s came to an end, the adopted daughter of the King of the Congo went ahead and made a tearful ANNOUNCEMENTS her show as coming to an end. <br /> <br /> While Ms. Winfrey was tearing up, I laughed and cried, like a wild Indian from the old west. <br /> <br /> So what does Oprah do? it takes well-known people, and places them on her show. that famous people? people affected (just like it but these people have lost more than their virginity) they suffered melted face (profit), missing limbs (the real story, see the end point), and undermined by violence (too many to count) . and once they come to the show, and tell your story, as if we have not heard of it before tons and tons of time (Bethany Hamilton, I've heard your story about the loss of a hand to a shark from the first day, which was October 31, 2003 do not tell me that there are no hard feelings.) But most important, perhaps, was on the Oprah interview Michael Jackson in 1993, after being accused of child molesters. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has passed since then. but one particular show talked about Michael's personal life, which is something not many people were aware of at the time. <br /> <br /> The real impact of Oprah comes from middle-aged women and moms. They seem to think that it is Jesus as personal time. but what I see in Oprah some great Ghetto lady that made him great, and she's just showing how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that it shows is going to end soon. we need the best television programs.
