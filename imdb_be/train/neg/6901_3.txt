The most positive thing I can say for this stupid stupid local "comedy" production is that it is harmless. In fact, it's so strange soft that wonder how many dozens of rewrite committee he was to have such a complete removal of the face. This is not witty, it's not entertainment, this is not discerning, and it's not chic. It's just a well-balanced, laughless, the progression of the four losers who need to change their ways - and their attitude towards women - to be able to attend the wedding of his best friend <br /> <br /> With acting, it would be sub-par for. the local amateur dramatic society, the storyline is so tired, that would make the forty-third season of 'Allo' Allo looks fresh, and jokes about as humorous as watching rotten vegetables, Wedding Sione in nevertheless scored ten (yes 10) nominations in the film NZ awards recently. <br /> <br /> Luckily, someone saw sense and he did not win a single one.
