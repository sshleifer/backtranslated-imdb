I'm a huge fan of the Stooges, but the one and only redemptive quality of this film has something Curl it. Committed long before he began to drink heavily, it is its own in this classic (and Larry is not bad). character Moe is a direct part of the (mostly), and the film would be better called "Curl and Larry movie." Not that any of the Stooges films were very good (in my opinion), but also as one of the commentators said here, as it is sad that this movie was real potential. Casting was good, it was well directed, filmed and edited, but the storyline was trying to be something serious with just a few tricks Stooges and musical numbers (which I guess was good then) thrown in. The best thing you can do for yourself during this movie, you should really think it should be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash (which is a matter of debate) is expected Coeur / Larry scenes and dream or find something in the kitchen to eat for the rest of it.
