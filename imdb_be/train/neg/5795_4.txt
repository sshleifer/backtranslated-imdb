"Lies" is about the romance between 18-year-old bucktoothed student and thin 38-year-old married man with a pair of protags spends about half the screen time is engaged in naked sex and hockey whipping, and the second half of the winding through the pathetic na√Øve storyline, which seems a little more than excuse for sex scenes. At very low cost of production, including the obvious sanitary appliances and fake erotic sex in a story that is a jumble of comedy and drama, "Lie" is rapidly becoming excessive nausea. Of the almost 2 hours of running, subtitles, and so little substance, "Lies" are simply not recommended. (C)
