I have to admit, this version of Shakespeare to shame in advance! No one may speak except nurses, which was my fav! Juliet had good skills as a teenager, but she can not give emotional depth of its line, and we really can never connect to it. It is worse than making a scene when she contemplating drink sleeping pills ... God stop whining! I'd poured it into his mouth to close it! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Given his other big films (Brideshead Revisited, of Ivanhoe, The Scarlet Pimpernel), it is quite the shocker. And do not get me started on Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It's still good to see if you are on a hunt to see all Romeo and Juliet ever done in the history of cinema. Olivia is the best version of Leonardo, and then release, Leslie Howard, then the current Leo and Clare!
