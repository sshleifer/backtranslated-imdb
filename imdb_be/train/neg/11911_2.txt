I sat glued to the screen, rivets, yawning, but keeping an attentive eye. I waited for the next terrible special effects, or the next ridiculously clichéd plot point to show full strength, so that I could learn how to do the film. <br /> <br /> It seems they have found to do this movie, the crew watched every single other action / sci-fi / shoot-em-up / good vs. evil film ever made, and I saw interesting things and said, "Hey, we can do it", for example, the only car in the parking lot about a mile from what seems like a one way road with no shoulder intended for parking, one car is a hero, an attractive brunette born bile thrown on. The car blows into pieces before it even gets to him. Special effects were quite obvious, my biggest beef with this film. But what really put it in my bad books was unlikely, and no reasons for so many items! For example, an antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to cause harm to a bizarre way, going to a lone military truck carrying important VIP. Unnamed security guys with guns out of the car, you know that they are already dead. Then the guy VIP protection says: "In no case do not you leave this truck, you know what I mean?" He goes to find the beast that killed his 3 friends, he gets hit in almost comical fashion clichés. Then, for no apparent reason, contrary to logic, conventions, and common sense, dumb ass get out of the VIP TRUCK !!! Much of what happened in the course of the film does not make sense. Transparent cast distanced me from the film, as well as a bad camera-work, and things that just make you go ". Wow, it's incredibly cheesy" Shiri Appleby saved the film from 1, because it gave the film one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience of sex appeal.
