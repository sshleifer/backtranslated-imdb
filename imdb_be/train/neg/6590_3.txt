The reviews that I read this movie was pretty decent, so I decided to check it out. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group of friends. The history of the silly, mix two parts with one part Ringu Prom Night, spraying, I know what you did last summer, and add a small pinch of Single White Female - now mix until completely meaningless. There is nothing new to this subject, and reviewing cliche I grew so fond of even entertaining this time. The film jumps from the past too much, and as soon as I made sense of all that, I realized that she still does not make sense. The characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters, all of your favorite stereotypes - greedy selfish lawyer, egocentric actress, it was there was a baseball star, video voyeur, bitter girl, ghostly quiet chicken, the "better than well" good girl, Freakin 'black cat .. . and I did not care about any of them. Perhaps a better writer could do the job in the movie, there were some decent scenes in it, but on the whole the film was a mess. It should also be noted that there is "videotape" that would have been impossible to shoot. <br /> <br /> This film is not the worst Asian horror has to offer is far, but it's still pretty bad. If you just want to see some horrible image in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud some of the top acts, or just want to scream "you're stupid!" On the silver screen, or just want to have another Asian horror film sleeves, if someone or ask you how much you have seen - this film is for you. <br /> <br /> Those who are looking for a decent plot to look elsewhere.
