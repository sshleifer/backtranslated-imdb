It was great to see some of my favorite star 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked absolutely wonderful. But it was. They did not have any signs or a good line to work with. I did not know or care what the characters do. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were okay, Patty Henson Colleen Camp and was fully competent and confident in their smallest parts of the Sidekick. They showed some talent, and it's sad, they went to appear in more and better films. Unfortunately, I do not think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to speak in this its only important role in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have supporters, and I was very open, when I started to watch it, I'm a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his latest film, "Meow cat" and all his early in «Nickleodeon» of them with "targets". So, it really surprised me that I could barely stay awake to watch this one. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that this film about the detective agency, where detectives and customers get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, the ex-girlfriend Bogdanovich, Shepherd was a hit TV series called "Moonlight" to steal the idea of ​​history with Bogdanovich. Of course, there is the biggest difference is that the series relied on colors, witty dialogue, while it is trying to make a farce and a few eccentric lines <br /> <br /> The result :. Not without any "Paper Moon» and only a very pale version of "what's up, Doc."
