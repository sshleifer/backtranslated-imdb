I basically found the Curve Eden to be very poorly constructed, making it difficult to watch. Nevertheless, there is something I have to say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere at the beginning of the 70s in the selection of settings and clothing. "Back to the land" philosophy and interest in sexual exploration and drugs that are not sharply decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70-ies was right, as was the "do not ask, do not tell" pseudo-liberalism of the brethren from the east coast intellectuals except that I would have thought that it is more likely one of New England schools, rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine the "good Ole boy" mentality still dominated even elite schools like this one. Another thing that I appreciated and may refer to the fact that it was a time when homosexuality was not related so much leathermen or transvestites, and I appreciate some homosexual role is not associated with this very abuse images. I felt that it was very unfortunate that the "gay culture" has taken on some of the standard forms in the 80 to Castro and Christopher streets, and they defined the movement and left from a large number of gay men who were more subdued in its image life. I appreciated the movie mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way in which we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without the "scene."
