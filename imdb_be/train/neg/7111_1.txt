- Young to move to the house of the dead ex-wife's husband. It's not long before the new wife begins to feel that someone does not want her in the house. She sees the skull all around the house. But if the husband examines, he can not find anything. Someone is trying to take her back to the shelter, she was recently fired from? Or is it the ghost of his dead wife is trying to get a new wife from their home? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I watched Fist Skull without the help of MST3K crew. And, in all likelihood, will be the last time, when I look at it like that. Can you say boring? I do not say normal blunt - I say, watching the grass grow dim. There are large areas of the film where nothing happens. The screen might go blank, and I would get so much fun with it. Symbols drones on and on with the uniform conversations imaginable. Screaming skull are likely to be sold as an assistant to sleep <br /> <br /> -. Actors do not help matters much. Most of them provide a line with conviction, usually reserved for primary school games. I have not watched it, but I would be shocked to discover that someone connected with this film ever to appear in what cinematic value. I will not even go into the script the actors of this work. Let's just say that the characters are some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered in the film <br /> <br /> -. You have been warned! Either avoid this one at all costs, or at least look for MST3K version.
