This movie has some of the worst acts that I have ever seen! Some scenes are original, such as nails, penetrating through the floor. This nail trap catches the bad guys. The rest of the film degrades as you go. I can not believe that this film is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time. I also can not believe that there are over! Next movie shit that I want to watch it R.O.T.O.R. R.O.T.O.R can really be a lot worse than this? <br /> <br />
