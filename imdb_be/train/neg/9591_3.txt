If you read the original novel, like me, you probably hate this thing. <br /> <br /> film version _Absolute Beginners_ is nightmarish conglomeration of anachronistic in 1980, which attempted to create a "part time" set in the late 1950s and is unable to repair or even to pay tribute to this period - the United States makes terrible _Dirty Dancing_ similar to 1963, except that the film proved financially successful, although as an amateur recording of the screen. In addition to suffering from "look too 1980s», the characters have been changed, rearranged, and downplayed the fact that only the characteristics they have in common with those of the novel slightest n verhnevyya views and, of course, their names: Susie becomes the narrator of the varicella former girlfriend and disorderly negrophile, who are willing to plan to marry the old queen shut up for the money (in her own admission in the first few pages) in the unfortunate and naive -archetype «Eve» seduced by fame and glamor, exploited and somehow fraudulently in a marriage with his boss, who is surprisingly not given Van Dyke and spiky hair. She and the narrator, renamed "Colin" (after the author, Colin MacInnes) for the film, as in the relationship. <br /> <br /> Big character, Jill, a lesbian, it would seem, even Butch «FOP as the" in her mid 20s, which acts as a pimp on the young cadres and the bubble-headed lesbians, and one of the closest friends of the narrator, spreading open the wisdom of the narrator, is reduced to a kind of "extra name" and a few one-off line, and so comic clothes. <br /> <br /> Fabulous Hoplite, a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel, as is reduced to the point of being meaningless in the film, spent the night up and all but ignore etsya. <br /> <br /> narrator's father in the novel is its native sad minor nature, but in the film he played rip as optimistic and surprisingly energetic, despite the shabby area and the confusion of his marriage with the mother of the narrator seems to be, for all practical purposes, ignored. <br /> <br /> in their favor, music (because it is) well composed, and you have to give production and leaf crews loan actually takes a string of books ( "... a few days, they will write a musical about the 1950s ...") as inspiration for writing Muzychi Noah, but the world's poor to park to musicals, this is one of the most poorly executed in tandem. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_ elements necessary plot treated as afterthoughts. Unlike _The Apple_, is volatile and non-uniform flow between the musical numbers and conversational dialogue. <br /> <br /> You really can not blame him "too 1980s» feel for what it was created in the 1980s. _Annie_ film version released in 1981, to pay tribute to the amazingly well done look and feel in New York in 1930, and _Napolean Dynamite_ manages to capture the gritty look and the appearance of the 1980s, in spite of the made on a low budget in 2003 (although this is not explicitly set in the 1980s, those who survived the decades can not deny that the film "feels very 1980s»). Obviously, it was _possible_ make something good out of it, especially given the cult status that the source of the novel in the UK, but it is not the best, perhaps, in look and feel, as well as in the processing of the raw material, which is very disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Maybe, if you do not read and do not have the intention of reading the novel, you might enjoy this cutesy 1980 th anachronism giving a shameful parody of the late 1950s Soho London modernist jazz set. I can clearly see that the writing team were trying to, but they certainly could have done better. With Boy George as nominal and mixed race musicians and bands on the charts in 1986, the United Kingdom, they definitely do need _NOT_ bowdlerise characters in a way that they end up doing. In fact, I would go so far as saying that the authors wound up doing what both the book and the film was criticized harshly - it will end up with a bunch of adults scroll shit and treatment of its target teen-aged audience as the two-bit idiots to make a quick buck off.
