I love movies, and I will watch any movie all the way through, just to give him a chance. Finally, I can say that I found a film that I can not watch all the way through. There are very stale and monotonous, the CGI looks like a computer geek did it in the basement of his mother with minimal software and ..... long scene just ... go !!!! And this film THREE HOURS LONG !!! I do not even make it to 15 minutes, while I will not soon sent DVD. The scenes with the aliens is very short. Ummm, instead, to call it a "War of the Worlds", it allows you to name it "The War Walking long distances." It costs $ 5 million to make! What they spend money on, a dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> Yes, but on a positive note, one scene, you have to look when the first aliens start killing people. It's fun, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons, they still writhing within 20 seconds after that. <br /> <br /> So .... like I said, if you are a fan of sad, stale, less action movies, here's one for your DVD collection. But I'm not writing this to you, I wrote it for billions and billions of other people who will hate this movie. It's not worth your time and money <br /> <br /> I know it's in the book, but the book is not so long, and I complete book worm / nerd / monster / whatever, but why? Just get a version of Steven Spielberg, it's not all that good, but it's 10 times better than this !! <br /> <br /> I give it a big, fat ZERO 10.
