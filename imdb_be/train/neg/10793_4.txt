I saw this film at the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2005. Based on the short story fiction author Brian Aldiss on science, this film tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, conjoined twins who thwarted by their families, the impresario, to form a rock band. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately trick, the film is also the priest (if you pardon the pun). Mixing genres, styles and moods, Director (whose previous film was an excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha) lose their way pretty quickly. I was never sure that I had to take it all seriously or not. Flashbacks, dream sequence, it was only a little more. In addition, the promised rock 'n' roll just do not touch me. It reminded me a little too much at times, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, the film I found an original and moving. But in this case, the songs just were not as good, and were not the main characters sympathetic. More unfavorable comparison would be just as frustrating Velvet Goldmine.
