Would not it be great if Not Another Teen Movie actually put an end to all this stupid, pointless, I am getting more sex than you teen movies? In an ideal world, yes. Nevertheless, this one is even worse. This one is not humiliating for the stars, it is humiliating for the distributor. All jokes are mostly students dissected things that people probably are not interested in, but it is "ridiculous". Devon Sawa, who was really good in the Final Destination, is simply bored in this film. It makes you wonder, when he was bad on purpose. Evaluation: F
