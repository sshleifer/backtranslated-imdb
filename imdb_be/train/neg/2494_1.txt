Which is a joke. I watch it on channel 1, and I think watching paint dry is much more fun. What happened to Wang Ding, who got him strapped into this nightmare. Terrible acts very sad story and terrible direction. It's so scary, it's ridiculous. This is suppose to be full of suspense, but it is a comedy. If you want to see the terrible effects, an absurd script writing and poor site, check out this film with. If I were Van Den, I would ask not only for my 10% of my agent, but the bastard fire in the process. That the turkey. It is not even fit to be on the MST 3K !! It would be a good film to cure your insomnia. I especially like the part where Van Dien is thrown overboard, and then make it back in a few minutes! I can only image what it was written by non-union writers, enjoying the writer's strike. What a terrible movie !!!
