I did not recognize above average Haneke shooting skills. For example, I appreciate it lingering on an unremarkable-natural-day lighting settings, as a powerful way to get a strong sense of realism. However, with regard to the content of the film, I was very sad to see that in the 21st century, there is still a desire to pathologise domination-subordination relationship or feelings (of practice and / or BDSM). The problem is that the main character has with his mother is incredibly urgent, as alienation and uncomprehension felt Walter (I do not mean lover of frustration that did not like back in the same way, which is understandable, I mean, he looks at her, as if she was mad, or as if he was a monk, come on!). I mean D / s is not something new in the world, and I think it's pretty silly to consider the subject as if it were something "quaint" or abnormal; it is not so. In general, the films on this theme is really behind the times. <br /> <br /> So, for me, I feel, that the film ends up being a pretty film to record the program, worried very outdated theories psicoanalitical (ISN Â»so it's almost a shame?), and that is not really related to the actual lives and experiences of those who are engaged in the D / s relationship (personal experience, forums, IRC-chats even recent research scientist will tell it).
