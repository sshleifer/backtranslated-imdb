Can I do this until I need glasses? at least proves the point that anyone can make a movie. Talent is not taken into account. People who unleashed this pathetic bunch spewing vomit into the light, the lack of any semblance of talent, taste and intelligence. The target audience should be composed of recently labotimized, and children playing with their excrement. Anybody else would be too world-wise, to even get a chuckle out of this film. It consists of a series of sketches sophmoric in which the climax did not even reach explicit. It ends on the ridiculous. Jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children say (usually a pot or related to sexuality), where they do not know the meaning of all the terms that they use. You know, one of the fathers and mothers car garage. To apply any method of stricter criticism it would be pointless, since the usual standards of acting, writing, direction, and are never even heard of creative "minds." for this mess. In order not to be subjective, but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously think about their purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
