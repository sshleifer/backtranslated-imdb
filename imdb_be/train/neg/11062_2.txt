Way to go Ace! You have just made a frightening, extremely intriguing story about an ogre necrophiliac in a soft, soft, drama. Obviously, the film entitled Dahmer would be one of two types: The horror or documentary entitled? It was neither. It was not close to any detailed facts (in fact, it almost did not have any substance at all) It was not really hurt or scared, or do not even try to be very disturbing. (As if you were to try !!) What the hell is this writer / director thinks ?? Here is one of the most real-life examples of patients with serial killers ever, and we get a bad shot, badly behaved gay bar roofie rape and lengthy flashbacks buzzing alone time in the house of his old father. I think that Jacobson was actually trying to present (or invent) "soft side" with j.Dahmer.
