Hello, everyone, if you saw "Singing in the Rain" scene you remember Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. You will also remember a dance number, Donald O'Connor, «Make« Em Laugh ». If you've seen «Royal Wedding», you will remember, Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you've seen "Jailhouse Rock," you even remember the number of the names of the dance choreography of the king himself. <br /> <br /> That is what is missing here. There may be several blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. The closest was Chuck McGowan «I can do it." The fact that you have a number of talented people on stage, which move together, do not play a big role dance film. Richard Attenborough was at fault in the accident. He pointed the camera at the scene and thought that would be good. <br /> <br /> Yelling at people Listening part in Broadway's not fun. Michael Douglas is just as bad discard, if he was in the Western or comedy. He's all right, if he is in the film, Michael Douglas, where we see him yelling at someone, we would like to cry on. She does not work here. <br /> <br /> Starring well for Michael, of course, the exception. A good film could be made even with the songs that were in the process of production, but someone had to think of ways to remove it. <br /> <br /> The next time they do one of them, I hope they call me first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
