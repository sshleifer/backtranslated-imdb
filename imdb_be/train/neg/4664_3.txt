3 I voted for this film, because it looks great, as does all the production Greenaways. However, it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap.I know a lot of people like this movie, but I'm tired of it very quickly. It is definitely not for everyone. Omnipresent McGregor, obviously, took part for the sake of crediblity, I think, but it really should not be wasting your time. I do not want to put anyone to corner a poser, but please ..... !!! On the positive side it is visually very attractive, and I enjoyed the music, but I could not see it through, and I can not say that for many films. I usually look at it, but this is unbearable !!
