This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends and since it is not one of us knew the story was finished. Apart from the lack of plot, the action was brutal, the "special effects" were not so special, and it was an absolutely awful. Just redemptive factor of the film is that it is so incredibly bad that it's pretty funny. You can not help, but laugh at zombies collision while actors spew bad dialogue. I would not recommend this movie, who are looking for a good movie, but that's what a group of friends get together and had a good laugh. this is working joke among my friends and I. 1 10.
