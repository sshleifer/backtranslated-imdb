This program does not do it for me, although I am a supporter of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me is that there was not a single scene that is not dominated by the main character. This made it a bit two-dimensional, and I gave up before the program was completed. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave their criticism there as I am not a film critic, but recommendations on IMDb states, you have to put in 10 rows comment. It was to remind me of the Hudson Hawk is the main character is in every scene, and I hope that the authors of this program could use a little more variety to engage with audiences. I have no doubt that the talent of any of the cast and crew, it's just that after seeing things like "wires", I have come to expect a lot from a police drama.
