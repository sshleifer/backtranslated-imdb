To be honest, where do I start! It was a low budget, badly acted film, it was because it was the cheese we all bursting with laughter as it was completely late! Sword fighting scenes are not even sword fighting, they played around with some plastic swords, which they bought at Wal-Mart, and all of them are doing just moaning to try to make it look like they are struggling !! My family and I were in the mood for a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and it was a movie Sawtooth Island. I mean, it looked great, but when we watched it at home, I almost died after the first stage. <br /> <br /> And the plot of the film, storyboard, script, etc..was piles of garbage, I do not even know why the director and producer even waste your time doing it !! But if you happen to stumble upon this movie..do entirely get it !!!!!
