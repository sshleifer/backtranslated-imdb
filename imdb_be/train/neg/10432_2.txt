Horrible ending - and I can not believe that Moore spent the year comes up with it. Claps of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, Hubbard claimed that the pen is only three weeks. It was actually quite disappointing for me to throw the disks of the first 3.5 years. Now, the first 1.5 hours was action packed, though absurd in the room, and then turned into a slow, painful, babbling dissolution series. Unbelievable how slow and drawn out, that last hour was. If we think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in his materialism, I was looking through Ishmael Daniel Quinn. Absurd to think 38K people to drop everything for a "fresh start." Absurd throw in the Four of a Kind, and again being Baltar and Six. Absurd to throw in the Mitochondrial Eve. It is simply absurd.
