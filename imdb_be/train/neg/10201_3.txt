This is a typical "crime" thriller. Perfect crime carried out and police investigator, ignoring all the keys immediately know who to blame. The viewer has to wait for the whole movie perpetrators being caught. As a result, every single episode of "Columbo" and "Murder, She Wrote." The director refers to the history of wage showing the police the next episode of Matlock! This story barely fills 90 minutes, but the director insists on the use of 120 minutes filled with every clich√© in the book. Skip this, you can not grab anything.
