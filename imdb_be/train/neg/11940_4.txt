Well, I'd be lying if I said that it can easily compete with Spiderman or Batman movie. However, it was more appealing to me is a moral value. I first bought a VHS, when my son was about 2 years old, and it immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are ardent fans of Robert Townsend, and have been since he used a credit card to finance his first film «Hollywood Shuffle». However, he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical consultants to make the film more believable, but his movies still fun. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man gives character to the Urban Contemporary feel. I've always felt that if superheroes, they do not provide the same scenario as shown in the comics. Meteor Man realistic character with real problems :. Vehicle broken, bad neighborhood, local drug trafficking bands using spread for children, etc. The volume of its mission has remained largely within the community <br /> <br /> What is found that really interesting, outside the "forever young" version of James Earl Jones, was how the region responded to his newfound powers . It was not long before they had a full agenda lined up for him, without his input, of course. It was fun to hear their offer to lend it to other communities, where their extended families lived. <br /> <br /> So, the plot was weak, the film was predictable, was a bad action and continuity was rotten, but it ranked # 1 with my children. Robert Townsend is working to bring 'home' movies, so to speak. I doubt that he ever really be recognized as a talented actor / producer / director, he really is, but there will always be those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> One thing to think about the film that I find funny: the entire fight with Simon, no one bothered to call the police ???? In addition, mothers and fathers, you know that will be watching their son fight from the window? My mother would have been right there scrapping my hand, feet on the toes. Dad will be charged with a gun. lol <br /> <br /> Rent and check it out. It is worth seeing at least once and is good for those of you fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Great job with cameos Robert!
