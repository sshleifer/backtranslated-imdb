This is a continuation of the weak: it does not have an interest and a light touch of the magnificent «Man Called Horse» in almost all aspects and compared with each other, they hardly seem the same genre <br /> <br /> The Return. almost a parody of the first and trying to cause a variety of Native American ceremonies, but comes across as trying too hard to bottle the magic of the first. In this film, the tribe lost and abandoned, lost their homeland, modern life encroached on paradise, and they live in extreme poverty, and poverty. Perhaps this is the moment: the first movie took us to a place where we want to be a simpler time. This leads us to the Indians in a helpless broken world and the White Man is a hero and a savior, which is rather negates the whole idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first was the fact that the white man knew, and found that this civilization lies in the values ​​rather than Western materialism. In the second film it all, but not enough, and so we end up with a weak film. <br /> <br /> The big disappointment.
