The film tries to be a mockumentary - filmed in documentary form, but with many of the obviously scripted - but fails to Sun providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of mockumentary. In addition, the film purports to be about finding true love in Los Angeles, but it is nothing more than an uninteresting look at the amateur filmmaker is trying to make his first "big movie."
