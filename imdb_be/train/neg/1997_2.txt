This version is probably available at your local dollar store on DVD. Printing is not great, no sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 minutes or so to spare, you will get your money's worth (which is not saying much). Anna Neagle is very fresh, like Nanette. Regardless of its delights can be back on the same day, they are not obvious in this film. A large number of excellent character actors appear in the film (Helen Broderick, Pitts, seiza, even Arden), but the material falls noticeably lacking their talents. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how these occurred performers make the most of poor writing. Musical numbers (there are actually only two) is pretty awful. Obviously, the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original "No, No, Nanette." For what it's worth, the DVD can be purchased for $ 1.00. It's worth that much just to say that you have already seen.
