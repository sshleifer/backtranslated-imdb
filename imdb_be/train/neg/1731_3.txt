Gloomy zone has reached a certain mythology about it - just like Star Trek. This is because there are a lot of loyal fans of the show, that no matter what he thinks, that each episode was not a winner. They are the ones who score each individual display 10 and can not objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, some time ago I reviewed all the original episodes of Star Trek (good and bad), because the overall ratings and reviews have been very positive. Now it's time to do the same for the Dark Zone. <br /> <br /> While I gained a lot of episodes of 10, this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad. The letter was in fact indecent bad. Two men from opposite sides in the Great War are seen wandering through the entire episode. After some time, it is obvious that they are the only two people left in the world - how do you know really stupid and utterly unconvincing conclusion. Usually twist at the end makes a great episode - it's one killed him!
