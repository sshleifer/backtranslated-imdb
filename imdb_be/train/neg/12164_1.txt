this film is not the first one good.the almost sucked, but it was impossible that the end to make it worth watching.this one has nothing.there is zero fear, zero voltage or not suspense.this not of murders movie.most horror show anything .there nO gusset speak of.this can be almost TVYM, for a little bit of nudity, except a little violence.the action is not very good, either.and not get me started on dialogue.as for the surprise ending, surprisingly, there is not one.i suggest that it could be worse, though I do not see how.but, again, it is less than 80 minutes, so I think the pieces it's a good thing.although he felt a lot more. apparently this version cut film.i found it a very cheap price, but still not worth it.If you want directing a graphical version, check edition.anyway Anchor Bay, this version of the sleeping Camp II: Unhappy Campers gets a big fat 1 / 10 from me. psif you watch this movie, you will probably be bored and unhappy camper.if you are a true fan, you can pick up Sleepaway Camp Anchor Bay (with a survival kit) three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and features
