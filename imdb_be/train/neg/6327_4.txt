I thought that this movie will be much better than it was. It sounded like a parody of spy away Gener, and the beginning of it reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this film went short. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous. KGB and the Soviet Union, Russia began to spy school to teach their spy, how to act, as the Americans, but the city they created it to train a bit dated, so they grab two Yankees from the US to revive up. I do not know, but it seems to be just there. This becomes very odd when the next one in the Russian city just says a Russian accent. Someone screwed up in the casting. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is painfully dry for comedy. There is one, two funny tops spots, and they are nothing to sing and dance as well. The film, after all, is likely to put you to sleep. <br /> <br /> And as twisted punch in the face, this film is as much about the US, it makes me sick. The film continues to say again and again that the United States and Russia, God is the devil. It's kind of a smear campaign that has been done against the Japanese in World War 2. The film is, as does everyone think that the United States are full of themselves. <br /> <br /> it gets 4 out of 10 and I'm good. He should definitely get one, but the dance scene was funny, but then again pulled away long enough to be really funny.
