Honestly, I did not want to "ordered" - that was obvious pattern. - a lot, but compared to this piece of shit, it looks like a piece of art <br /> <br /> Not only that, the people who move in the film (the term would cast an insult to all other members) shall be present several classes of actors the guy who will build the installation did not even see the plane from afar. It's so funny that the flight attendance of 747, only 3 on the board, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogical. (For example: the use of sleeping gas, do not use it, then use it anyway) that dropped my rating, finally, at the bottom <br /> <br /> You can have more fun rearranging you sock drawer or drill a hole in the knee and fill it with milk.
