Sky Captain may be the best terrible movie that I have seen in a long time. Rife with amazing CG and special effects, studded with A-list actors (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and endlessly cute Giovanni Ribisi) and races with abuse, but Indiana Jones-of Esquire story line, this should be a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Â«If there is a" be the key term here, of course. <br /> <br /> Jude Law plays Joe Sky Captain with excellent focus and much more- -shoulder, heart melts grins, but you can not make something out of nothing, and even his delivery and frivolous boyish good looks can not save movie dialogue stone. (If he had hit Giovanni Ribisi on the back and said, "Good boy, Dex," just one more time, I would just barfed guy in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow and Polly Perkins, no less than the nerve grating. Her nasal whine and not quite sarcastic comments to age in the first ten minutes of the film. Maybe she put too much effort into the game Comic stereotypical 30-heroine-, who knows? I expected more from her. An example of how such a character has been played (and play well) in the late '90s movie "Ghost" featuring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent a movie and you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the saving grace of the film. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in the sling. I admit it.) Within a few short scenes, both actors somehow turned out to rise above the tired material and provides better performance than riveting them dry, two-dimensional castmates. <, Br /> <br /> plot and progression of established history it was old, boring, and basically just a uniform combination of every good scene from an action movie for the past thirty years. Hurried pace in the first half of the film, and the snail's pace in the second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess, in the end of the film output, but to find out who is the key villain as well. Mating pretty formulaic, also- Polly Perkins and Sky Captain, apparently reunited after years of separation from bitter-finished novel, and their history is not so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched. When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the film's end, no one was surprised, and no one cares either. <br /> <br /> It belongs to the director for the appreciation of Bai Ling is enough to put her in a skintight vinyl film fullness, as well as intriguing sepia serving coloring throughout. But Sky Captain, in spite of all the essential elements of being a great movie falls flat on his face. Not even worth the $ 2.75 I paid to get into the theater.
