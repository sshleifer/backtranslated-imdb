After watching dozens of episodes, I decided to abandon the show, as it reflects unrealistic in a way that is mathematical modeling. In the episodes that Charlie predict the future behavior of people with the help of mathematical models, I thought that my profession is now joking about. I'm not a mathematician, a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. Therefore, I will try to explain to the layman, why what is shown close to the "fun" stories. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the right model to predict the situation is challenging. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even he would have to spend a lot of time to study for the appropriate model, in particular, for having to guess what someone will do, or where it will be in the near future. Persons flawed and haphazard, NO modeling for them. Even Isaac Asimov wrote that in the 1950s. Even if the model for a particular individual, it would be a probability (stoichastic) one, that is, he has a good chance to make an incorrect prediction. <br /> <br /> Second, admitting the right model for someone or a situation is shown, the model parameters must be known. These parameters are constants of equations, such as the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m / s2), and are often not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Eppes has to be someone for a genius to know the correct settings for the model he chooses. And after the model and options are chosen, they must be checked. Oddly enough, they are not, and miraculously, they fit exactly the situation that is currently predicted. <br /> <br /> In the third place, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only in numbers, but also scientific -fi movies: the computational effort required to solve these models. Try to make Excel to solve a complex model with a large number of equations and variables, and one will find doing a herculean job. Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software solution for their models, it can be stuck with hardware that is terribly slow. And even with the right combination of software / hardware, the model solution may well take several days to reach. He solves them immediately! I could use my computer in my research, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it is not the best show. Symbols few stereotypically, but not even remotely funny, as in the Big Bang Theory is. Stupid crime and Charlie Eppes solve them sometimes make the FBI look pretty incompetent. <br /> <br /> For a layman, the show can work. For others, the way things are handled makes it hard to swallow!
