This is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, it's terrible. Christopher Lee is a good thing, but it is hardly in it, only a part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the name. "End of the World" really bad film, I stopped playing it close to the end it was so bad, but for fans of b-movie, which has a brain to withstand the vomit.
