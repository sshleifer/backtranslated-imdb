Steep Red Planet (Quickie review) <br /> <br /> As well as "People with the planet X» is a bizarre science fiction story is killed from an era where fantasy and science fiction was still a bit the same. Meaning, we've got some very funny special effects and uncontrolled pseudoscience masquerading as science fiction. And yes, this is another "classic", released in the high transmission quality with a distinct pattern and sharp sound - at the Midnite Movies <br /> <br /> Thus, the main reason to see this movie.? Oh, this is certainly all that time our crew spacecraft to Mars. (What, you thought the "Angry Red Planet" called Neptune?) Prior to that some pretty low quality space crew on board the spacecraft, in which they smoke and throw around a chauvinistic sexist banter aimed at members of the "frail female" with the crew. It would be somewhat offensive by today's standards, if it were not so damn funny. But Mars is the true reason we are seeing this thing. The film, as a rule, black and white, but Mars and Mars screaming bloody red. He starred in this wonderful red plasticy tide gives evil red planet is quite interesting look overexposed redness. It's really quite a sight ?? as well as (haha) aliens audience witnesses. Better to be «ratbatspidercrab.» Do you think this is a joke? This is what they call it in the movie! This is a gigantic chimera (little doll) things, combining the features of rats, mice, spiders and crabs. It limits all along puppety and scares the crap out of our "heroic crew." There are other bizarre and poorly imagined, the aliens are not seen, but this one takes the cake. In the end, after a harrowing experience on Mars, sexist board crew of "ship" and returns to the fact that the planet they came from. <br /> <br /> It is not for everyone. Science fiction movie lovers and curiosity seekers, and some general moviegoers. Supporters of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have a field day with this one (if they never got to it on the show). <br /> <br /> 2/10 to current estimates, 6/10 Nostalgia accounts, 4/10 overall. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
