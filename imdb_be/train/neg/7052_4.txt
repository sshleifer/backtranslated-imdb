God this movie was just so boring, except for the music, which I really liked, I mean, that was the point, really makes this movie, please, who is reading this review entirely to watch this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can act, but he was really miserable in this movie, I'm actually ashamed to be one of his supporters, especially in this movie, it was just too bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another pretty face without any lack of talent what so ever, it may not work at all, and there was no sense of her being in the film, as well as for another girl Radha she was well, I think, but I could have done better. <br /> <br /> it's a waste of time. please buy great music i do not look this film.
