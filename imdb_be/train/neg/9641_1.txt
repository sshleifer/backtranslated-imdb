When you watch this movie, you are either a supporter of Fred deer Ray, you've found it for $ 4.99 a shelf in the Suncoast and thought, "What I have to lose," revolves around the video store or with your eyes closed and took the first movie of your finger touched?. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterical bad. He has all that scary movie needs: a scenario involving a stunning dialogue and confuse workarounds in the plot, silly science involving psychics and other dimensions, continuity, which seems to travel through wormholes in space and time, the actors who not only wooden, but it seems to border embarrassed, gratuitous nudity (not all of it is that you will be sure to ask), and of course, the 5 'monster playing what I assume that it is a child. <br /> <br Fred deer Rey Underneath /> all this, however, there is something resembling a heart - as if Mickey and Judy decided to gather all the children in the area and make the film Monster (hey my dad can send it to, we can use the red paint from my local hardware store Pope John, and I know that this ex-stripper, which can act in it) <br /> <br /> Watch the blooper reel on the subtitles -. you will get to know why the final version of the movie was so crappy. <br /> <br /> By the way, Biohazard II ... The Alien Force is also worth a look, but do not have the same trashy veneer nice to make one.
