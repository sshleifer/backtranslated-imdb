I sat through this GenCon only because it was quiet and I could doze off. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Cathy? WTF? If the woman who played Flea and Abe Vigoda busy or something? <br /> <br /> In fact, not funny piece of garbage. The characters were stereotyped unintentionally (I think ...) and wood, most of them felt that they were on autopilot. The so-called "fun" situation described in some other so-called reviews were so beaten, I weeped for authors. <br /> <br /> I'm confused how anyone can find it worth their time, seriously. I'm only giving it 3 out of 10, because in order to be 2 or 1, then it will need to be long or five hours or more have Lebrok.
