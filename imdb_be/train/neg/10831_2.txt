I think that the director / writer to say something. Let's see what it might be ... a. Frog to the terrible storms? b. I can get someone like Tom Cruise, to say, "C" words many times and it looks like a bad Rafter? a. Cast my wife and get her to say the word «F» every 2 seconds. That aside, I really liked the beginning and frogs storm. The rest was continuous and excessively long (eds), overly lenient failure. I am glad that many of you liked it! <br /> <br />
