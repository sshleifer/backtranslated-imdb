Entertainment Tonight was to go down hill over the last few years, but last night (August 17, 2006), they have reached a new low. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to try to inflate their broadcast, they decided to place the JonBenet Ramsey bullies in their body real pictures last night ... saying, "pictures of the things you've never seen before." These two photographs were graphic and very disturbing. One of them was in the side of her face and head / neck, and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck and bruises on his face. It was so awful awful, I could not believe it. How it should be done with at least remotely related to Hollywood Entertainment ?? Nothing !! They lowered the level of the dignity and value to a new low .... and it shows. Earlier this Premiere watch ... and it's just garbage now. <br /> <br /> I'll watch Access Hollywood today.
