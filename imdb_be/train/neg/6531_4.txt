Firstly, I would like to say that the comments from users alone left me with tears in his eyes from laughing. One comment that bad movies SF become a good comedy right on the mark. MST3000 did it live through this. <br /> <br /> If you look at the malicious RED PLANET fever dream of a 10-year-old comic book reader since 1959, you have a handle on this sucker. All the elements are here: pseudoscience, sometimes logical, often funny infantile. Teenage boy, attitude toward sex, a "gigolo" Captain (good call on that one, guys!) Makes eye on buxom "scientist" with hair so red it is surprising that not enroll fire alarm. Funny concept of Mars as a planet, so strange, that all is red, another alien monster has the face of a mouse, and an alien blob has an eye, rotating like a baby toy. Comic, overweight astronaut (!) Who sounds like he never finished 8th grade in Brooklyn and has psychotic fixation on his beam gun. And, of course, the fact that someone else = dangerous evil. If these people have met alien, they would roast it in two seconds flat! "OW" in fact! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I appreciated the film at a low level. However, it is never boring (except when a scientist tries to explain - only to make it sounds more ridiculous), and you must recognize that your small nucleus of a child, it makes you jump a few times. <br /> <br /> Well, then do not accept it. I think you've never been 10.
