It had to be one of the most horrific gods WrestleMania ever, and is retained only for 2 matches. Hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, and Vince McMahon vs. Shawn Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete wash-out and, to be honest, I almost fell asleep it was so omission match chest was not worthy undertaker appear in it and the match between the Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke. If you are really a big fan of WWE and WWF missed the first few days, and WrestleMania 17 and 19, you'll probably love it. But I found it was Wrestlemania left much to be desired.
