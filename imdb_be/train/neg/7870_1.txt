The original "Aliens" was an original, fun, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 should be a candidate for "Worst first sequel to a really good movie." The LV2 all continue to shout when the gag does not work the first is repeated 5 more times with some vague hope that it will eventually become ridiculous. LV2 LV1 terrible parody, except, of course, a parody must be inventive. If you loved the LV1 just do not see this movie, just to see LV1 again !!
