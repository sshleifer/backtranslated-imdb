It seemed strange combination of Withnail and I with a room with a view .. sometimes it worked, other times it did not. A tragedy that they changed the name to the American release, though .. Keep Apidistra Flying is much better than nothing the name Merry War. The acting was good, the script was good .. all in all it was a mediocre movie ..
