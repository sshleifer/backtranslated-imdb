When I stumbled upon the script in text form, I would read it and, perhaps, to laugh. I would not, however, laugh at points in the film where the director seemed to want me to laugh. Although I'm still not quite sure where it is. I do not care if it's Woody Allen, the writer can not write dialogue or, at least, he can not consciously write dialogue then make the performances of the actors are able to draw even the most gentle laughter of clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrasing) "I am an art historian, I am looking to get a job in an art gallery» <br /> <br /> So, it says that, but to be honest, then. you know, any critics who would say that? How would you answer? <br /> <br /> «Really? an art gallery? who would have thought? »<br /> <br /> The whole scenario is replete with gaudy kind of quasi-intellectualism, I would not have expected from such a respected nature writer. I admit that I have no knowledge of the other work of Elena and, judging by this one I do not want to start learning. Disgusting characters, without exception, to demonstrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Really very poor character to write? You be the judge.
