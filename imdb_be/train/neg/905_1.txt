An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) became pregnant by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry her out of duty, but she turns him down flat and decides to raise a child alone. Things are going fine, until the child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) become worse. <br /> <br /> I saw the silent version and the audio version of Â«Stella Dallas." None affected me a lot (and I cry easily), but they were well done when dated. An attempt to alter it in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I think Midler was quite incomprehensible forces after the success of "Beach" to do that. This is (predictably) bombed. History funny and dated by today's standards. Although Alvarado Midler and give good performances, this film really captivates and I was bored silly end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help in a supporting role. Flimsy and dull. Actually - who thought that it would work? See 1937 Stanwyck version instead. I give it 1.
