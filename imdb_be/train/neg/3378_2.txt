By the time this film was released, I saw Chorus Line on stage 4 times and was most eagerly anticipating long-rumored movie production in history. My wife and I were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. It was not just disappointing, it was a punch in the stomach. <br /> <br /> First of all, the story was "moved beyond", so to speak, by including scenes not in theater. These limits are a big part of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> The second and third together (to appoint its own order): one of the original songs, with a very dynamic dance number, has been removed; song has been added that was not in manufacturing stage. Say what ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason why I gave the film 2 stars instead of 1 is my passion for talent and hard work performers. I just saw Chorus Line at the stage of 6 times, and do not mind seeing him 6 more times before I die. She beautifully written, with great music, and heart- painfully true stories. If you want to see a musical, which includes a large "cattle call" audition, I recommend the All That Jazz. If you want to see the history of the corps de ballet, to see him on stage.
