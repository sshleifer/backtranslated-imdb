I've never watched a movie in such a short time. The only salvation was the fast forward function of your DVD device. It was like a bad movie made CBC. There were apparently no money for lighting, filming, sets accommodation, writers, editors, actors ... Ah, there was absolutely no stories too! I need to write ten lines of comment ... Bad, awful, awful, awful, painful, tortuous, gall, nauseating, disgusting, Fromage, disgusting, contrived, unattractive, reverse, pukey, stinky, smelly, nasty, rotten, all -thumbs down, and I do not know if I can continue to go to complete all ten lines of how bad this piece of shit-O-Matic production was!
