This film is the perhaps the worst film I've ever seen in my entire life! The plot is funny and all the "little man" shit just so stupid. The whole movie is unrealistic and dumb. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". It's just a horrible piece of meaningless, which would never have made it to the theaters. Jokes are not funny and the action is terrible. Please, I beg to save money than to see this useless piece of shit. I had to endure sitting through a small man for an hour and half wishing my eyes will bleed. I am shocked that something like this could even be considered! Who writes this crap? Actors have no talent what so ever, these people get into Hollywood? They make money on this stuff!
