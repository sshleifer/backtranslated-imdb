In my life I've seen a lot of great and terrible movies. I am not an expert in the professional review, but I will definitely say something about it. Firstly, these actors are the worst I've seen ... Their actions are so unreal that you might even want to throw the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think that these actors were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another terrible thing about these dialogs - they are so inaccurate. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It seems that your 14-year-old son could do better. I feel that this film had a budget similar to the account of my 14-year-old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message reaches you - to save you time and money.
