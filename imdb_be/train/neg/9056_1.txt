I've seen some bad movies in my life, but this one must be one of the worst. Definately bottom 100 material (IMO, that is). <br /> <br /> We go for two pairs, the Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonen Graf and Natasha Richardson as the Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as candy) in the same car on the Roadtrip in Renault. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Lonnie is not too happy with their sex lives, so that he is cheating his wife with Kendo which despirately trying to have a child, Roy, meanwhile, is not too sure if his sperm in order so he gets it checked out by your doctor. <br /> <br /> At the present time, I read the back of the DVD, but my friend did and she blurted out about 20 minutes later: "Oh, yes, she's going to end up pregnant, but her husband could not have any infant. Spot on, as this movie is soooo predictable. as well as sad. and annoying. it makes no sense. Next. Terrible. <br /> <br /> An example of how this movie stinks. Two pairs contained in them big car to Nevada, where they stayed for 2 police officers, because they did not stop at the stop sign. The guys know each other, and nareshts ie, bribe two officers with beer case. Not only that, this scene is meaningless and is not important (or even necessary) for the film, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talk and talk and talk without ever anywhere. < br /> <br /> I still puke to think about the final, though. it seems that Roy did not have a problem there, so that he is the father of the child. How many times it happens in the movies ... try something new! Cheated on his wife eventually forgave her husband and best friend for that matter, and they all live happily ever after. Ugh. <br /> <br /> The best scene of the movie at the end, with a couple of shots of the Grand Canyon. Why could not they just keep the camera in 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> One would expect more from this cast (although Thornton really trying), but you can not blame them. Writers, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
