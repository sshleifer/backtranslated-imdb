Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I try to see all of his work. It is known that he single-handedly save the movies with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This film suffers from a low budget, and that the value of production is alarming. Please ... for the love of Christopher .... avoid this movie!
