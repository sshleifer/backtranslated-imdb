This movie is really scary. terrible as this waste 84 minutes of your life. The special effects are so terrible. Act was not convincing. <br /> <br /> Its about a crocodile that attacks the kind of tourist as they shoot a documentary about the "blood of surfing." Blood surfing when they surf around the sharks, but it turns out terrible injustice when the 31-foot crocodile interrupts the holiday there. Sharks do not look real. Crocodile worse, and it becomes even more pathetic when they run away form the creature, but the crocodile sticks and 2 women flash. The deaths are fake and the pirates simply fill time. <br /> <br /> meaningless, scary movie is not worth watching !!
