: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed in the Abiding Joy Love. I waited a long time to see it, and I finally got a chance, when he was back in the air on Thursday night at Hallmark. I love the first three "love" movies, but this one was nothing like I thought it would be. The whole movie was boring and depressing, it means a lot of inconsistencies, and editing was very bad - for many of the scenes from the context. I also think that the death of Cathy child happened so fast, and the appearance of Clarks in the film just does not seem to fit. It seems that none of the actors really did not want to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between the Mission and Willy at all. <br /> <br /> I think the writers should have gone further in the book. It seems that every film that has been made so far merely slip farther and farther from the writings of Janette Oke in. I mean in the movie, they never mentioned a thing about the mine and two boys and Clark get injured because of it. And I think that Miss and Willies reaction to the death of Katie could be shown and heard, not just heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been made so far, I'd have to say that Law Abiding Joy Bench is my least favorite. I hope that the following four films that more books followed, and when the nature of the Clarks I hope in them that he had received the most, and I hope that part is not so fresh. I also hope that there is a Scotty and Cookie and possibly even Marty, but who knows what the writers will have in store next.
