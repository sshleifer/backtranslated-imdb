I think Elisabeth Rohm, although it may try, is not very good at all. I believe that this is due to the budget, it may be the only one they could get for this price. Basically I watched him in the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most believable and without a doubt the most compelling to watch. If he was not on the screen, the thing is broken. It was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the creeps, but rest assured that he is kind, funny sympathized with people in real life. He even said that this role gave him the ants <br /> <br /> I'll watch anything with him in this, but Elisabeth Rohm. - never. She was just as exciting as down in law and order. Perhaps a very good man, but not an actress.
