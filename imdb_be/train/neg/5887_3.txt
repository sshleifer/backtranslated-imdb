Jane Russell was an excellent musical comedy performer in the same name of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" ?? but, unfortunately, this film squanders these skills. There is a budget Paris and a good photo, but the film just does not work. Ms. Russell, it seems It plays Marilyn Monroe This leaves no one to adequately play Jane Russell Some of the other players are WAY elements <br /> <br /> there are several scenes confuse most, keep in mind:... there is a music room, where African boneheaded cannibals "cook" the brunette in a pot, after Mr. Alan Young in a gorilla suit <br /> <br /> It's interesting, sometimes inconvenient., a waste of resources. <br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Gene Crane, Alan Young, Scott Brady
