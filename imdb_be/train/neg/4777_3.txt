The idea of ​​this film was good. It is a pity that it was not well written. Casting Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea, and he did an excellent job. Meanwhile Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. Kirstie Alley character could become a big one, and even showed some possibilities once, but the writer is really pumped up, making her role is basically helpless female. It was completely incompatible with the strong independent character, it had to be. I do not care about the operating Alley anyway. The film should end about fifteen minutes earlier than it did. Director milk the cow dry to the incredible commitment. I'll keep it in my collection of example only performances in Poitiers.
