this is what you get if you let 10-year-old (manic-American), to write a story about the moon trip. Absolute rubbish without any redeeming qualities Maybe he spent some charm in the 3D-department. but as a descriptive and entertaining animation does not have anything to do spend an hour and a half worth. Save your time and money and watch the bolts in place <br /> <br /> Damn. Not enough lines, but I feel that sums up ... well, I agree with the above review - it's like the Cold War propaganda stories. Maybe it would be more interesting if they did it on the fly, revealing the hoax about landing on the moon, or the dead flies in the first minute. BTW - why it was deformed all the main character flies? - no one had a full set of limbs!
