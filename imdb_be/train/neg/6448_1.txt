Creature Unknown right word for this film. Or, maybe you should call the unknown film. This film is a piece of shit right from the start. It has a very silly "plot" really helpless "action", and so some "special effects.Â» <br /> <br /> Some thirty-something year old "post-adolescent" are trapped in the forest mad , reptile, rubber suit creature lurking around endlessly. What you get with this film a bunch of talk and very little action. Do you have a girl walks through the woods to talk, and then you have children (with heavy mascara on), walk through the woods to talk. All this is so boring! <br /> <br /> The very essence of rare throughout most of the film. If you specify the image is distorted to hide the fact that a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that this suit, so the cause blurring and distortion of the image. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie to ANY, so the word and those who praised him here, most likely, people who were picked up from the street to "act" in this movie is really stunning! Skip this for sure!
