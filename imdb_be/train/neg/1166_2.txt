Seeing as compared to earlier, I had high hopes for the living. Description of the film on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Live does not deliver. VERY slow development. Load capacity broskomami and cool visual effects. The room was intriguing, but the gain does not compensate for the accumulation. We could do a lot more in the end. Much of the film simply "sit". Simply put, the three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and 50 minutes, we were struggling to make it through to the end. It really need more percussive elements. If you are looking for Ichi the killer or Versus fighting type, then save about $ disappointments load.
