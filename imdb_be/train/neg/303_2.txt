It is impossible for me to objectively review this movie. Not that I did not try, mind you - but I sit down, and I'm right at the age of VHS, and I look at the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old again and grabbed my own Care Bear and watch a movie with your eyes open and eager heart. <br /> <br /> I can see objectively that this film is a bizarre combination of fluffy baby merchandising mascot and terrible prepubertal children with the forces of evil, which has a fine history and uninteresting animations. But my inner five-year-old is coming, "Hooray! Caring bears! "Every time I think about it. So - I just (be careful, reluctantly) recommend this film to anyone who saw him during his early youth, can call on the strange power of nostalgia watching it (like me) or those, lovably cynical Gen-X / Y-ERS that consciously looking perfectly bad / awesome (a category in which this film ... certainly belongs). For those who are actually looking for a compelling movie or a hearty family vacation: You can continue to watch.
