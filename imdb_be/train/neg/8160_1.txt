and not, the pleasure of hours. it's just bad. it is shocking that people have posted positive things about it here. the story sucks, acting bad, it's not scary, special effects special sun - oh no! Blackboard my hands, leave it! of gee - mirror turns into water! hair, clothes and make-up in the 50's scenes are not precise, and they got a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play high-school version of himself. it was later in the Nightmare on Elm Street thing. I like to sit to watch a cheesy horror movie, as much as anyone else, but it is better bad out there to choose from.
