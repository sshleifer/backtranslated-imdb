If I had not read Pat Barker «Union Street», before seeing this film, I would have liked it. Unfortuntately it is not. It really is my kind of film is well done, and in any case I would like to say otherwise, but an adaptation, it is not from every angle. <br /> <br /> harrowing novel about the reality of living in the northern part of the British working class has seized the deep and refused to let go for a few weeks after I graduated. I went through tears, disgust, shock, anger, compassion and anguish when reading about women in Union Street. Excellent. Roman, from time to time I heard that I could not read any more, but I have an affair just could not put down. Holding the case, but fascinating. <br /> <br /> film. Dear. Hollywood took the truth and reality of Barker, and slept the sweet layer of powdered sugar on top of it. A great film that inspired soundtrack, excellent performance, a story of hope and romance ... yes. Adaptation of «Union Street» ... no. <br /> <br /> Women Union Street, and their stories are condensed in the nature of the Fund, their stories touched, but many of them are discarded. I understand that some of the tales Barker sensitive issues and too terrible for mass viewing, and that film with about 7 leading characters is simply not practical, but the content is not my main issue. The essence of the novel and the real gut lost - the darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard and graphics described the stench of poverty replaced the sun, beautiful houses and shimmering account of William <br /> <br /. > If you liked the movie for its positivity and hope in the face of "reality", I suggest that you hesitate to read a book without first preparing himself to something more like "Schindler's List" ... but without a happy ending.
