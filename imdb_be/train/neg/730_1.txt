I have not seen the first film, and if it is anything like this there is not much desire. <br /> <br /> Just I watched it a few hours ago I was struggling to remember a thing about it. <br /> <br /> From what I remember, it's the main plot seems very annoying group of people to stay at home with this quirky old woman from Friday 13th and prosecuted human plank of wood. <br /> <br /> Some people die, the film ends, I start a lawsuit against the person who sold me this film, I want to compensate for the lack of time in my life. <br /> <br /> I will pay Â£ 1 and to take this film from my hands ...... Oh wait, I already gave his "friend."
