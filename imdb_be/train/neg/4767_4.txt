I watched this movie, I liked the story, a group of strangers are in captivity, trying to understand how they relate to each other. <br /> <br /> Setting and putting apparently under the influence of the first (and best) saw the film, and although there was not much action history has moved in a relatively good pace. <br /> <br /> there was relief comedy ion in the form of two bickering "alpha males" and it was a pleasant surprise (for me anyway) to see Melissa Joan Hart has not given up acting more <br /> < br /> a few things let it for me personally. 1. Pedophile was through is characterized by making it excites all, from children to the dead. <br /> <br /> 2. MJH line about her ex police "get it it ", when in fact, he was the least worthy person to be there, he did not consciously contributed to the events that led to their capture. <br /> <br /> 3, ending ..... a movie, etc. Ost ends in the middle of something going on? There was no consent, neither rock hanger, not obviously end ... it just ends. <br /> <br /> And when I dropped two stars on my rating. The first 2 points I would let be pushed, but not the end!
