Ouch! This one was a bit painful to sit through. He has a nice and funny premise, but everything goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine almost always pedestrian and annoying, and it does not disappoint in this. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville played surprisingly decent performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among other things, played the way from the top. I know that this is the way a part was written, and it's hard to blame the actor, if the script and the director should they make such a hack. If you are going to be outrageous characters, that's fine, but you've got to have good stuff to make it work. It's not here. Run away screaming in this film, if at all possible.
