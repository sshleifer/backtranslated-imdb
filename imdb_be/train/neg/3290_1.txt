This movie sucked! They took something from my childhood, and raped her in the john! This movie was so bad that I wanted to go home and keep my «Dukes» DVDs and cry in the corner. The cast was awesome! He was not a "jackass", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving. If Boss Hogg evil? If Rosco's a tough guy? They have never been! Boss Hogg and Rosco was a greedy idiot was. When Jesse smoking pot? He never did! Do not get me wrong, I'm very liberal, and there is nothing wrong with a little Chiba, but he did not have a place in this film! The only thing good about this film was the trailers before the movie and titles. It was a waste of time, money and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
