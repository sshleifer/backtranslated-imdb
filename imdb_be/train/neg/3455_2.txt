Geez! This is one of those movies that you think, previously discussed, but you did not. I mean, you do not give a shit about it, but somehow it came to mind, <br /> <br /> To be honest and short. this is one of the worst, sad and stupid grinders have ever done. I can not nothing good about this piece of shit, because hardly worthy of sequences that could say that it is made by professional filmmakers say. <br /> <br /> Death Scenes awful bloodless, foolish. The plot is somehow good taking into account that he copied the "popcorn" in 1991. <br /> <br /> To make things even worse, it is not a film so bad it's good. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> Ringwald tried to make it better, but it was not enough.
