This woman, who works as an intern for the photographer goes home and takes a bath, where she discovers the hole in the ceiling. So she comes to learn that her neighbor over her photographer. This film could have a great site, but then the plot drains any hope. The problem I had with this film that every ten seconds someone snorting heroin. When they learned of the scene where someone sniffing heroin, it will be a very good film. Every time I thought that the scene takes place somewhere, someone has inhaled a white powder. It was really lame to have so many drugs in a movie. He drew attention away from the main plot of the story and a great photographer. Lesbian stuff does not bother me. I watched a movie about art. I found a film about drug use.
