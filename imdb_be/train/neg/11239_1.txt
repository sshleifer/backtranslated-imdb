Ignore the comments behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments about the film should be the payment of royalties. This is a terrible film in all respects. Imagine students without money and without a sense of humor, do slasher / comedy video. They will receive a D to this. College kids will get a deuce or asked to leave the school. After all, this monster has been done "Professionals" I believe that there should be a prison sentence, or at least a movie probation. I like to watch bad movies as "Plan 9 from Outer Space", but this thing is not even fall into this category. The script, action, sound, and direction is so bad that it is almost unwatchable. If you like to watch bad movies that are funny stick with Ed Wood, or black actors of the 1970s horror films. After watching this, you get the feeling that you spent an hour and a half of his life.
