How in the name of God, I made this film ever get the distribution? It looks as though it was shot on someone's cell phone and takes a script girl screaming victim whole new depth. They literally scream at all 90 minutes of the film. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no signs, not a lot of action. Just screaming and more screaming. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and quickly wound through it, to see if anything happens. It does not - for the screaming, of course, the exception. enough Odlly, the act of passing through it on fast forward highlights another problem - there is no talk of the camera. Each shot looks like any other shot. - the average distance of one corner, dumb, stupid, dull <br /> <br /> This is not so bad it's good. It's just bad.
