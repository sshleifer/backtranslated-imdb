Sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to evaluate the merits. Well, that's my opinion anyway. This one will always be in a bad movie category, simply because everything, but Shu Qi's performance was terrible. <br /> <br /> The military says Angel Kato (Shu Qi), a professional thief turned immediately after the departure of her lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years ago. But her past comes back to haunt her as Chi Lam kidnapped for ransom software owned by Cat Company operates. To save him, she encourages her old friends from their orphaned days, six other women evil to save the day ... <br /> <br /> I may have said a synopsis cheesily, but it's a cheesy story. In fact, the entire script and direction, there was no quality at all. Much of the dialogue does not make sense, and in conjunction with a plot that was as thin as rice paper in water. If I could sum up, to make a bad movie with Jackie Chan, rent comedy, choreography lift, throw the budget, and you have Martial Angels. Formular of the work without any imagination at all <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, I have to give credit where credit is due, and Shu Qi was probably the only person to come out unscathed from the hardcore action, as it was her performance that shone. Well, you can not say that she was beautiful - because she had absolutely nothing to work - but she still managed to dig out some of the character of their role. In addition, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin did any other impression - even though they were mostly very short and flickering <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the film just fell apart .. The scenes and dialogues were completely unnatural and incredible special effects were obviously made on the cheap without any attempt to clear the boundaries between humans and mask blue screen, poor editing involving multiple breaks in the action scenes, camera angles, which were elementary and unflattering, and the direction I've seen better from a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I think that this film was too much to do chefs. Most likely, the budget was submitted to the overproduction of enthusiasm have seven babies at the same silver screen. It did not leave much more. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the way the movie was made was like a cheap porn free porn. Charlie's Angels, it is not. In fact, while the sisters can do it for yourself, none of this was in fact that is clearly here. <br /> <br /> Definitely one to forget.
