I've never seen any of these originals SciFi before, it was the first. I think it's only fair to judge the action, direction / production, set design and even CGI effects on other films SciFi. In order to compare it with your typical Hollywood production unjustly. I will say, however, that the whole Aztec Rex is not quite a masterpiece reminiscent of Werner Herzog's Aguirre, the wrath of God. <br /> <br /> I will begin by noting that, yes, I recognize the fact that this film has more to do with culture-clash than the dinosaurs. Despite this a future made-for-TV sci-fi film, there are some basic context of history, which I will explore. Symbolic elements included fairly obvious <br /> <br /> Thus, as a student of history, theology, mythology and cinema :. I found that outrageous dialogue and the theme of the plot is somewhat disappointing. I do not ask any MEA culpas on behalf of the manufacturers - as I said in the film what it is. But to me that most of the younger demographic for this film is likely to rely on television to give them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem is most explicitly Ayacoatl character (not to comment on the performance Luckman, but just as it was written by her character, though, I say that it has some work to do before it gets any Emmy nods). It is through her character, that the actions of the Spanish Europeans justified. Its function in the film as a love interest Rios claims that the European path is the right way, just because they are Europeans. There really is no other reasons given. It's really just left with the assumption that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the Europeans over Aztec, because their clothes, language, ideology, etc. more familiar with them than the Aztecs - so that Aztec portrayed as adversarial and "back". And it's not just that the viewer is left with this opinion because of the ethnocentric perception on the part of the viewer, but it does seem that the story is trying to convince the viewer - as if the Aztecs were unable to come up with a plan - if not a better one - to draw a dinosaur until his death on a bed of sticks punji <br /> <br /> in justice, there is a subgroup of the Spaniards, who are portrayed as pillaging churches and intent on simply abusing mother. Mesoamericans. There is also a scene where we have a Christian saint, noting achievements of the Aztecs: "They have agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc." - But in the end it is still an Aztec warrior, who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the film even over the "thunder lizards" (more on this later). He it is portrayed as a treacherous, duplicitous, and attempts to send a romantic European Spaniard, tricking him into consuming hallucinogenic mind changes mushrooms - important spiritual component to certain aspects and a religion indigenous Meso and North Americans (again, more on that later), so that it can keep a woman he feels belongs to him, and from the Spaniard. <br /> <br /> At present, the analysis of the true nature of history (leaving obvious Christian against the pagan themes with a table) with the symbolic point of view - the viewer can easily take these so-called thunder lizard to be representatives of the Mesoamerican ideology / theology, which in this the film is shown as an intent to: bloodthirstiness, cruelty, cruelty to the dictates of the wicked, maybe even evil? In opposition, we have this group of Christian travelers, led by a young Hernando Cortes, who are portrayed as naive, but in general, noble, lambs, captured in a dark pagan world of the Aztecs. In addition, the title of the film Aztec Rex, which leads to the idea that we are talking about dinosaurs that eat people. However, that Aztec Rex translates Aztec King, the head of the Aztec state, or in this case, the "state of being". (So ​​why it was changed to the film's title). So who in fact we see the new King of the Aztecs in the end? This remains the Spaniard, Rios. Aztec Rex for a new European ideology that has overcome, because of the disease, bloodshed, war and famine, the Native Americans. Rios represents the ideal Europe - how leading this film would like to have them in mind (as opposed to the Cortes, which is a "practical-yet-still-noble European"). But if you study the Holocaust of the American continent, let's be honest: not symbolic component of the history of this film have it back? <br /> <br /> I have to say that the Aztec Rex in the worst case a bit racist, or be good about it, not knowing, in the best case. <br /> <br /> And yes, I know it's just a film, it's all meant to be a pleasure, I understand, but that in the end we are left with the idea that Rios was the father of the last Aztec lines? Interestingly, the indigenous Mesoamericans would think of it ends ... as for myself, I thought it was a little too self-indulgent <br /> <br /> The best performance of the film is in a wig in Ziering. - though striking - it was at least change the look Ziering enough, so I did not think I was watching a yuppie from 90210 the leading bunch of the conquistadors in the heart of darkness. Ziering actually proved himself more than capable actor in this film, I actually bought him a job, or at least, I had forgotten that it Ziering anyway. I do not know who his agent, but he needs to get more work done. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it was also nice to see Jim McGee again. I've been a fan since it is too short scene-stealing performance in 1988 Scrooged <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma -. DeusExMachina529@aol.com
