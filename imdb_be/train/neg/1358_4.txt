The word "Swedish" and "action film" do not mix. It is becoming more and more evident with each new genre. This is yet another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) is working on an Air Force base with top-secret computer systems. Once foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he does not do what he is told. They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> In this film there is ups and downs. And usually in films Swedish action is no "window" only "fall". So I think that there is something in this film showed some quality. I'll start with the positive comments I can say that the film is technically well done. Footage of planes and helicopters flying shot well and look very nice. It acts very different quality. Shanti Roney does a decent performance at Bonnevie stiff and unnatural, as usual (I wonder how long the Swedish filmmakers are going to continue to use it, even if it is acting wood flooring?). Stefan Sauk ridiculously as "cool" special forces people who come to the base to investigate. <br /> <br /> What about the scene? Well, as I said above the wings of airplanes and helicopters, performing a good flight. But other than that there is not much action to talk about it. This is a common problem with the Swedish fighters. There is just not enough action happening. Maybe this is the budget problem, maybe it's film culture. I do not know, but it adversely affects the experience. Because, frankly, the story and the action is not good enough for this film to rely on it. <br /> <br /> I rate this 4/10 for effort.
