Everything in this film tells Raffy Carruthers how talented she is, what a great director, she will turn one day to be, etc. I think they are just being good. Even Kimble Rendall, who was the director of this film, shows more talent than she does. "Next Jane Campion," they called it; and, even apart from the fact that they are both over-rated, two have so much in common. They are both direct movies. They are both women. They are both Australian. (Well, give or take.) <br /> <br /> So it is one of those movies where the character is considered to be brilliant, and we just have to swallow hard and accept it. But I'll tell you what kind of Carruthers: It's cute. -And fascinating. No really. Here are some thoughts about her lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) Part of the talent of the director is dealing with people. Why Carruthers so phenomenally bad getting her crew even pay attention to her? Thus, to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and kill, I'm waiting. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is it one of the most unconvincing image shooting I've ever seen? In the end, he was shot on real film-making. How could they get it wrong? If Randall was a lot less than half in under-staffed decline, it is surprising that he finished his film at all <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers. - a fictional filmmaker - set out to create a brand new 1980 movies horror flick. Fat chance. I doubt that it can be done these days. I suspect that Randall - in fact, talented filmmaker - has set itself the same task, I realized that it could not be done, and happy (Sigh) knowing parody instead. Of course, it is not enough to work as a parody of a parody. Once the crew stop in an isolated mansion movie just spends most of his time doing the bad thing is that the 1980s horror films made ... well, not so much. <br /> <br /> (4) And yet, and yet ... the film begins with a parody, but in forging an honest-to-goodness 80s horror, starring (it's too good to be true) Ringwald. This styling is much better than it's worth. (This is a bad sign when you find yourself wishing that you were watching a movie-within-on-film, not a film.) However, he was also shot in the late 1990s. Perhaps, it is still possible to make 1980 the first terror. You just have to give up in order to know the parody stuff and eat it. <br /> <br /> (5) I would never again wondered what the 1980s teen horror if all the characters were an Australian accent, but now I know. And oddly enough, I'm glad that I know. Need I never knew what I had done.
