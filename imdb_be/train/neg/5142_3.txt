After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, he made one of his worst: Gentlemen of Nerve. During the first year in the film Chaplin made up about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental point of view, gag, editing, fun, shooting place, etc. This one takes place on the racetrack, where Chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying. Mabel Normand there with my friend, too, and Chaplin was able to get rid of both his friends and Mabel. Then he woos Mabel in the stands without visible consequences of his behavior. Many farce in here, but there is very little else to recommend this film to others, watching Chaplin develop. I saw the imprint has deteriorated, which may impact on its implementation. Charley Chase can be glimpsed. * 4 star.
