I think it's sad that Christians (and I am one) believes that we should make such films as "backward." We have much better stories to tell, that there should not be as instructive. I was very disappointed with this film. As an aspiring filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this film as a perfect example for what I will not do with my career in the movies.
