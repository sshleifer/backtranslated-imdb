Aldolpho (Steve Bush), an aspiring filmmaker who lives in New York, beating the apartment and rely on his mother to help make the rent. He has a nice neighbor named Angelique (Jennifer Beals), who may or may not be married, but who Aldolpho would like to star in his film. If Al unexpectedly receives financial funding promise for his film from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he's got it made. That is, as long as Joe does not take Al together on an adventure to steal the Porsche for a part of the financial support. Will the film be made to Aldolpho completely without moral spine? And Angelica will appear in the film? This, in the opinion of the audience, a terrible movie. Scenario plaintively, with a plot that wanders willy-nilly. Beals practically growls its entire line and the Bushes, although cute, it's unattractive. There are a lot of bad stuff and pushes the characters to boot. And finally, the production value is very poor, too, which makes the film look for the second speed at all times. If you have time on your hands, it's still a good idea to not take risks with this film. But, if you are notorious masochist, go ahead and watch the damn thing. Beals looks beautiful in the end.
