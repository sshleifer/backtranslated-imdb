Without a doubt, the worst film I've seen in a long time. I endured to the end, because it certainly should be something here, but no. The plot, if it is not a clich√© to the point of non-existence is haunting; dialogue, which must be street just shot down; characters never develop for sketches; Set-pieces of templates. Worse, given its co-director, photography is the only way <br /> <br /> The comments in other places that lift it together Get Carter, The Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser way away sign. Lives of the Saints are missing their innovation does not mention their depth and shading. In short, their craft. Ruthless editor could probably cut it down to a decent 30-minute short, but it's worth it is the sixth project forms the film realized on the scale of millions of pounds; incoherent and bloated with the claims. That it has received funding (of course, only because of the name Rankin) while other small films fight for the cash burden for the British film industry.
