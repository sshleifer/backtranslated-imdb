Star Dolph Lundgren, as a former policeman / boxer who is looking for curly Boston scene, to find out who killed his brother, who was well comprehended in society, but along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this film, as on the basis of his work here, one would forget Lundgren rise to fame involved the role of the action. It says this stuff does not work Lundgren nothing, in fact, completely Lundgren left to dry in soggy thriller that is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-Star Daniel Brett is also good, in fact, the film works best when it focuses around chemistry Lundgren and Brett really was the film time to study the relationship of the film would be pretty decent. However, the film dull, the action does not exist, the plot is not given enough study (too many sad B.S around investigation Lundgren employers of his brother) and the film for nothing hill and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is actually very good (as a freshman Danielle Brett), but the film just knocking from one sequence to another, which makes this film particularly disappointing. If anything else, though, it shows how underrated Lundgren is an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 C 4- (poor)
