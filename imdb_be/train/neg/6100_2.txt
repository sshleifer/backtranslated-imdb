Efforts towards (This is not a review of good intentions, it of the final product), this film is poorly written, replayed, and poorly aimed. History clearly has potential, but this story is never present in this film. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a man. It was passion, desire, love, pain, confusion, weakness and self-doubt as well as the rest of us. You never know that from the film leading role in. Actually apply it to each character in the film, but in the case of Burton: Each proposal in question. Epic speech over the top, as if from a non-human robot. In fact, the only scene that plays well in a board meeting, and I realized that because she does it! Every idea that she has an incredibly in its context, and it comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of self-examination on the spot. For example, when she sees the wounded, it will start to broadcast on the battlefield needs and to protect soldiers and pasting of white flags, etc. How to play the movie, there's no way she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> in custody, this film robs Clara Barton from her struggle. This deprives her of her humanity, and inherently devalues ​​everything that she did, because the script is written in a cliché. The author does not know Clara Barton, and seems to be based on his screenplay on encyclopaedia Britannica article. (Yes, they were the ones then) But hey, good Technicolor! (What a difference)
