I was glad to hear that Cesar Montana decided to make a film in a language Cebuano. (Not "dialect" as most Filipinos would be wrong to call it. How Cebuano and Tagalog are mutually unintelligible, as the French and Spanish languages ​​relate to each other.) But I was very disappointed when I saw that movie. Being Canada, with Cebuano parents, I was optimistic about the revival of Visayan film industry when I heard about this movie. I was further pleased to hear that he was not another stupid action movie or melodrama as Filipinos love these types of movies. But, unfortunately I was inferior. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy serve ego trip for Ce . The sar Montana Montana, of course, plays a hero of the movie and when I say "hero", I mean the most stereotypical manner;. Its function is to win the girl's heart and lead Bol-PREVIEW to victory against the Japanese His character has no depth and complexity. . He just suited hero form. Other characters are one-dimensional, they all fit their roles cookie cutter. <br /> <br /> I'm all for slow moving / meditative films, but this movie was simply to move slowly. It's actually not meditate on something. Just because a movie is historically-themed drama and sedentary does not make it a well made film. <br /> <br /> Especially annoying American actor Philip Anthony. His speech was uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> If you would like to revive the Montana Visayan film industry he has exactly thought out. He said that he wanted to do Visayan films that could compete in the Cannes and Toronto, and so on, but really, this movie would have been booed and hissed at such festivals. Even if it means sacrificing quality to get Visayan movies in the public mind, he should at least make a film that would attract an audience. It is obvious that he does not think about this or get information about what films garner awards at Cannes so viewers attracted by the movie would have been at least a foot in the door. <br /> <br /> Now I'm afraid, Visayan movies are not made for a long time again because of this film. If I ever said a Filipino, I want to see more of the Visayan movies, of course, I would like to get an answer like, "Visayas do not make good films. Do not you see, Panaghoy Sa Subochev? "Of course, it's funny, because it is one of the examples of Visayan film and perhaps the only example of someone in our time would be likely to see. <br /> <br /> An example of movies, meditation, and not just move slowly, are the Tagalog movie Blackout or David Lynch's The Straight Story. I hate to promote language Tagalog as it is infinite, and encourage unfair and pushed down the throat of non-Tagalog Filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade, I say that Blackout is a very good movie. These films largely depend on what Hitchcock called "pure cinema". Images without words are used to convey the story. But I lean a little to the definition of these two films is that these films use images without words to convey the mood of the film. and they do it very well. Panaghoy believes that if they just take excellent shots of the landscape, they set the mood. <br /> <br /> But there are so many Filipino movies which show a dying mother or grandmother ???
