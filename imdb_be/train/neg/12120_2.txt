In what could be otherwise mediocre, mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties (thin "free love" period), the creators of this film heap of ridiculous scenario after scenario, and the absurd perfection with only trivial little cherry on top, happy ending. At no time did I ever feel sympathy for Diane Lane and Anna Paquin in their caring nursing free of middle class life, and I do not feel emasculated by Liv Shrieber. The storyline runs along it slowly in a predictable, pathetic conclusion, and the only thing that is interesting and watchable about this movie stunning Diane Lane topless. Here's a hint, it occurs about 30 minutes into the film. Fast forward to this part and skip the rest.
