Oh, CGI. Blessing when used correctly. Sin with it is used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing used in the numerous bad Jaws rip-off. <br /> <br /> Thus, anyone who has read any amount of my published reviews probably noticed two things. 1: I like the low-budget horror films. And 2: If there is a nice guy said low-budget movie, I usually point them out. So let's just get this out of the way right now. That's one low-budget horror film, I did not want to. Action, for the most part, it's horrible, laughable effects, and the script Battlefield Earth rivals as the worst I have witnessed this year. How cute boy resident ... Dax Miller (Bog) wins the prize hands down. This boy is hot! And it is strange that he is not just a toned body with beautiful eyes and a nice example ... he can actually act (well, just as it can in this odious film). Now that we have a service chores out of the way, let's get this over with. <br /> <br /> In the version of Cliff Notes, here's the story (do not worry, I will try not to give anything away) ... <br /> <br /> crew is sent to a remote island to a documentary about two surfer (set of cute boy and his friend) that surfing with sharks. Unknown to them quite large saltwater crocodile lurking around the island. Croc shows up, mayhem follows, and people eat. the end credits roll. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this film a lot of punches. He started very well, but soon turned into a silly and stupid. The protagonist becomes a dinner (in a rather humorous way), and the rest of our heroes pronounced due to the severity of the victims. In addition, if this crocodile is on the top of the food chain, both on land and in the water, all the sharks around? If this thing can eat 40 feet of the boat, I do not think that a few poor sharks will follow around. FX is one of the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see. CGI is horrible, and they even managed to screw up animatronic crocodiles. Attention filmmakers. National Geographic. The opening of the store. Croc Hunter. They know that crocodiles are similar. You obviously do not refer to any of them, judging by the enormity of the saw at the end of the film. And what about the pusher pirate gangs / drugs? You just need one more reason to rip off the top women? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get a little sub-genre in the world of cinema. With alligators, and this extension, Lake Placid, crocodile, and now Blood Surf, now it looks like "oversized crocodile / alligator" films should now get its own category in Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought Crocodile Tobe Hooper was good. Blood Surf, sucked <br /> <br /> My rating :. D-
