I watched this film when Joe Bob Briggs took Monstervision on TNTE. Even he could not make the film enjoyable. The only reason why I did not see it until the end, because I am teaching video production and I wanted to make sure that my students never anything this bad not done ... but it took all of my intestinal fortitude to sit through it, though. It's like watching your great-grandmother is flirting with 15-year-old boy ... excruciatingly painful. <br /> <br /> If you have taken an actual film, dipped it in paint thinner, then watched it, it would be more interesting. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this film in Bargin bunker in S-Mart, withdraw from him, as if he was a rattlesnake.
