I do not know who CL Kramer, the director of this film, but I have a strong suspicion that A) she's a lesbian and Bed and), it is some way disgraced everyone involved in this project to participate, in order to prove that they are not homophobic. <, Br /> <br /> I can imagine all thought: "My God, this is terrible. Not funny. Pedestrian. It is lame. "But to keep their mouths for fear they will be labeled anti-gay, or they" do not get "the gay lifestyle. (This is probably why Kramer throws gay to play gay, too.) Anyway, it's not even worth reviewing. The actors are all directed to play every scene is completely over the top, so there is no sincerity or credibility in what they do. He is full of clich√©s, and there is nothing about this film, which is a little funny -. Much less funny <br /> <br /> I hated it, and I'm not afraid to say so. It is a pity that the weak-willed people who gave Kramer the money to make the bomb were not unbiased in their opinion.
