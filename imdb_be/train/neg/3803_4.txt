The film seems disjointed and, in general, poorly written. The script moves, like 10 different people, written, and none of them talk to each other. Apparently, they wanted to take a page from Miracle on 34th Street (original) film type, but it is done in such a way that a bad movie apart. This film is only for the very young, and even they will see that the one who knows what the scenario is almost nothing about baseball. Such as: <br /> <br /> ?? If angels in dead last place does not seem to take care of the owner, and he is concerned that his manager just had a fight with his jug ?? On the mound ?? or that he was punching after the play announcer team play live. However, if the team is one game away from winning the division, he gets bent out of shape over history (sourced 6-year-old), the manager to get help from a child who claims to have seen these angels. That sounds worse? Losing control of violent manager, whose team has lost 15 in a row? Or winning coach at the border of the playoffs, which acts a bit eccentric and helps foster children? The reaction of the owner does not make sense. He moved to change his mind Maggie and her "right out of the clich√© land" speech during a press conference. <br /> <br /> ?? Angels have to play for the Division in the final weekend series against the White Sox, but at the end of the game Keep the announcer say Angels "won the pennant." Pennant is not decided until someone does not win the league championship, and not the regular season division title. <br /> <br /> ?? Witt Bass fool the pitcher is a starting pitcher and wins the game, which breaks Angela loss ??, ie starting pitcher ?? The very next day. <br /> <br /> ?? Mel Clark (Donets) is called in the ninth inning threw 156 pitches in a low ball games swords. usually in low scoring games, pitch count is significantly lower than it is usually about 80-90 pitches. <br /> <br /> ?? ''S AL "Angel says at the end" Championships should be won by themselves ", despite the fact that he and his angels were manipulation and fixation of the game throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, as there are many other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10 years), this film may be of interest. It's too bad ?? done correctly it could be a classic. Completely wrong, as it is to forget the mess that will live forever as UHF / cable Saturday morning washing.
