Usually, I know that after the first minute of the film, when I hate him or love him ... but now that I was wrong <br /> <br /> The start was great. "It's based on a true story" and blah blah blah things funny. After, cartoons and a description of the lives of children with pictures made me think I made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Then, seeing cheerful false view of Toronto was cool. In addition, the situation and the appearance of the house, seemed to confirm my first thought. <br /> <br /> It was perhaps the first 10 minutes of the film ... which then looked like an eternity. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me not knowing English Canadian humor (this is possible, the English Canadians do not always understand the humor in ebektsev), but hey ... it was not enough material in that in a short film, * anything * anymore. Maybe it could be the meaning of the title? In any case, almost all filled, and very few things have been even close to the ridiculous, in my mind <br /> <br /> in fact, the "product" was better than the movie, at least, to understand the motivations that made all the bad ideas had a great potential;... that's why I make a film, interested "annoying disappearances" things. But still, I did not know that the whole universe disappears, and with it, even a point in the film. <br /> <br /> If you are English Canadians, it seems, you could assess the local humor, given the odd number of people who gave the film 8 otherwise, just think twice before you lose your precious time ...
