I agree with most of the other guys. Waste of precious time and photons. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke worth the paper was written. The only time my POV is Olli Dietrich, like Pinocchio. ( «Egal, uh eh muß Waldsterben») This is reminiscent of the old days with RTL Zamstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the performances of the actors, as most of them do not even seem to have a good time in the production process and just "do their own thing." The camera is good, funny story, I think you would not be ashamed, even if you discuss it with a lot of beer. <br /> <br /> In addition, I yawned constantly wondered how a script like this could even be considered for the production and waited for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son was happy, but he was satisfied with so little at this age :-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, Rating 1 point 1 point there is almost too much .. .
