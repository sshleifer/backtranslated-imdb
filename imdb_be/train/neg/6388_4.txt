Brothers Quay directors, according to traditional thought, should have stuck to the creation of short films. I myself really liked their first film institute Benjamenta, but judging from their sophomore effort, earthquake serviceman, I am ready to agree, they do not come close to their past made even genius in a full-length. Piano Tuner, without a doubt, a great movie to watch, and often listen to. Unfortunately, this is borderline painful to sit through his confusing descriptive and glacial pace. Reading the plot synopsis, it sounds like a very good story. But the brothers failed miserably to bring it to life. One thing they should consider to avoid completely in the future: dialogue. My God, it's horrible here. Huge bust.
