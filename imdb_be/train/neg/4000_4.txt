I enjoyed the «American Movie», so I took the first film of Chris Smith, which I thought was a documentary, too. In the first minute I saw that it was not, but I gave it a go. <br /> <br /> What is a dead-end film. Being true to life is unlikely to serve you, if you're just going to explore tediousness, individuals. tediousness that we are already familiar with. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but that will come as a relevation to anyone that 1) many jobs suck and 2) most of them are bad, minimum wage jobs in the service sector ??? I knew that before I saw the movie. It does not really provide the expertise that, in any case, as while the film tries to feel the "real" (handheld camera, no music, etc.), what happens hardly plays as it would in the "real world ". <, Br /> <br /> if the employer so gay Randy when he picks up his check, after Randy go to him 3 days later, when the guy said that he expected him to stay 6 months ?? Or the next day after the rejection of his work (and screwing machines, he worked for), that everything will be so easy on him ?? <br /> <br /> The big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy, this guy is a loser. Not because he was stuck in these works is crummy apartment, it looks like one. He's dope. He does not pay attention or even really try on these works. He has zero mobility. If I had to hire someone, he would not make it past the interview. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to what Chris Smith takes the next, but the boys, knock "this-is-an- important film" material. "American Jobs" does not work.
