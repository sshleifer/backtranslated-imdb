The first one was the best. The second one sucked, because dialogue was terrible. Although the plot is not so bad (in fact, all the storylines are good and bad). Throughout the film, I leave dosed several times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great experience in martial arts, but it is not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker, too, was not good. And Zhang Ziyi, I can say a few lines, horrible acts (But this is based on her script). All the characters were not so good. But some of the things that I like in the rush hour 2 is always action and fewer sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan does not do what is good for him.
