I had the "honor" to attend a special screening of "absence of light," a horror convention in Ohio. <br /> <br /> In the first place, you know that you are in trouble when the director introduces the film, saying: "Now keep in mind, we did not have a lot of money ..." is not that non-budgetary bad movies, but if the director is using this as an excuse, the results are always poor. And there is no better example than this unwatchable dream festival. <br /> <br /> In fact, "no light" is the world's first underground movie: This is the only time I had a dream-talented cast of genre vets actually made me. Charismatic actors like David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Bannister accidentally get in and out of the movie and be as uninteresting as amateurish entirely names. Who their characters? What are they saying? What is the difference? It's all so boring, you will cease to care about anything or anyone. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and left the theater. Not surprisingly, as most of the actors in the performance of official duties. <br /> <br /> Anyone curious genre fans would be good to stay away from that. With some luck, this film will never see the "light" day.
