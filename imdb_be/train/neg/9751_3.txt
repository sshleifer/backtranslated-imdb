The only reason I did not give this film is less than 3 stars because it is not quite on par with films like Manos: the hands of fate. the greatest crime of this film is the fact that the head is touching the sad and scary British unforgivable. The premise of this movie sounds promising potential, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction they went with it was quite interesting. It was more a film about research funding and Bowties, than projecting laser. Actors were made of wood, indifferent and aloof. As well as a love affair between two scientists--, which was nothing but intriguing. I've never been able to say what the attraction was between them, as there was no chemistry. And I do not understand why the main guy Melty person decided to kill everyone he met. At least, now I know that I always have to give someone a fair hearing before I cut their research grants, otherwise they are obsessed about killing senseless with silly hand gestures.
