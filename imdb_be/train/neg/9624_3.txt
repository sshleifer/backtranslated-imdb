Given the potential of this step was, the reality of disappointment. While it's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in the film, even this can not turn it around. Most of the action was predictable. Jokes were flat to slightly amusing. And they were the characters are not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it just did not happen. Ben Stiller was hilarious in "There's something about Mary." Here, it seems, it will just through movement. When they should pick up the plot of "friends", they should have known that something was wrong. Toilet humor had to stay in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> Watch "50 First Dates" instead.
