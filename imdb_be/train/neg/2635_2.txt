I was willing to put up with a lot since the end of the spring / summer action movie down, but overall, it was due to the fact that most of them are of sufficient value (ie, cool special effects, exciting plot twists, comic value, Steve Buscemi , etc.). This film, however, there was nothing of this. All we got was a cheap buzz from a few minutes cleavage Eva Longoria (issue of Maxim cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, background, character development, continuity, etc. I would insist on, but to be honest, I might willingly forgotten most of the film. <br /> <br /> All this time I was in the theater, I have legs not only spending the afternoon watching 24 season on DVD. Save your money on it, man. If you really, really, really do not like splitting Longoria Eva.
