Absolutely horrible Mexican film supposedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about Paperboy wanting to go to the nuthouse frames hidden in the woods, to write a story about how it works, and so on ... When our hero, Gaston, is given a great show Dr. Maillard, head of the orphanage, we see all kinds of things that are suppose to be awful, such as men hang around for a long time I was in prison, and comedy, for example, our hero as a joke at the soldiers as he comes down the stairs, looming on the side of the building. Then there is one kind that might have been designed to be both: a man a man, dressed as a chicken, but it is true of chicken that pecks around the earth for the chicken feed. The scene was supposed to be a comedic highlight of the film, but at least for me, it was the lowest point of the movie and really the most disgusting, if you believed that adult men and women thought it might be even remotely interesting. Ah! It really is the real horror that Dr. Tarr and his name is Legion Changes. And that brings me to this statement facts about the film, which is most of the films that are several names changes, as a rule, have some serious problems. Yes, this is obvious, but some distribution problems, and others, of which this is one, there are numerous changes in the name, so that someone can buy without knowing the same litter more than once. This, of course, garbage. This is very little going for it. The only artist should have a look at Claudio Brook, as the head of the orphanage. He's one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally, bellow orders, sashays with a sword in his hand, and he praises the chicken. I'm so tired of hearing him talk about "soothing system" as it is a means to cure the mentally ill. That bunch ludicrosity (Hey, the film, as with the scenario as it deserves this kind of speech). It will not take you long to figure out that it is happening at the shelter will be more interesting. Cinematic chicken scratch!
