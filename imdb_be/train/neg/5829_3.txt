I watched this movie as a preview of an art exhibition of Matthew Barney. This, of course, prepared me. I almost missed the show and, in hindsight, probably should be. <br /> <br /> Further points to be large (Bjork) and photos of the rich and colorful content generally tedious and predictable. Gee, I really need anyone to wear pearls to find out what the pearl divers were before. The film was mostly silly mixture of Japanese cultural references and industrial frames whaling modern technologies used in the layout of hunting / harvesting. The film "peaks" with enough gratuitous shock technique to turn your stomach. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the film? While some may argue that this anti-whaling piece, you can equally argue that this somehow justifies its whaling. Personally, I think it was an attempt to Barney on "blue" the audience with her anal, fecal, mutilation and fetishes of cannibals <br /> <br /> The result:. When you do not get down in the sense of art Barney, Don "t bother to see this film. Message is not clear, the pace is slow and pretentious cultural references. If you're after a shock technique, you'll do better in one of the many «Undead» movie or tracking down an old copy of Hustler and taking into faecal-cartoon.
