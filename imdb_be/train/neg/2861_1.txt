I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this film. I thought it was a porn movie, when it started, and it is never better. Actions music drowns out the actor. Horrible. Save your money! You should read all the way through the film b \ c, they knew that music will drown out the line says. I never got a part of the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show the cows and pigs, and butchered. What does this have to do with "real" BTK killer? I understand why there was no well-known actors \ actresses in this film. The script would turn me on first reading the page. You'd better watch paint dry.
