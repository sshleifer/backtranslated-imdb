Of course, I like the short cartoons, but I did not like it. Naturally, the kids will love it. But then again, I'm not a child anymore (though I still consider myself young). <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about the story, for the simple reason that there is no history. How is it possible that this dragon cartoon was nominated for an Oscar? Well ... I think it's because people are in the 30s were more than happy not so much than it is now. At the present time in which we live, everything has to happen quickly. Look at the movies in our time, and you have come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow people to be slow. It's really a shame. I wish I lived in the 30s, because it seems so calm. But every time has its ups and downs, I think ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you love music (and frogs), you should see this cartoon. Otherwise, do not spill your time on it.
