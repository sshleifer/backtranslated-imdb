Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely gorgeous in this movie, but the story is, unfortunately, immature, and the energy of David Schwimmer is something like a cold slurry. When he closes his mouth and getting serious for a moment or two there is a peak that loser. Who would have thought that the 25-year-old kids will be entertained?
