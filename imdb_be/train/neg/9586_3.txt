After the revolution, the disastrous, this film was pretty much the last nail in the coffin of wren and, consequently, the British film industry. The film is absolute pants, it is full of music from jazz revival, undertaken the mid-80s, and based on the book and the author, who was briefly popular at the time and deservedly sank back into obscurity. Temple looking for ages trying to find Suzette and came up with 8-Wonders Patsy Kensett another man who was briefly popular at the time. By the time the film came out postproduction Jazz revival was over, as well as career Kensett and the film met quite indifferent audience movie. <br /> <br /> Satisfactory exaggeration for some of the worst / campest / Cheesiest action ever adorn the British silver screen to watch it for almost 20 years, and the film really cringeworthy.
