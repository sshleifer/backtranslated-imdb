This "documentary" is proof of the talent is used for secondary purposes. The fact that it is financed by the Venezuelan government gives it a lack of rule of law in order to find the truth about what really happened those terrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela, even we Venezuelans do not know for sure. <, Br /> <br /> There are ways of lies, and the director of this material are both inaction and knowledge. <br /> <br /> Venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by a foreign audience, and they will take advantage of it. For example * Possible SPOILERS * they show about Chavez shooting demonstrators in an empty street (what the hell they did it?) On the way say that they did not kill anyone, but he did not show the image, we have all seen, here, the opposition protesters ( and journalist) provides a dead or injured on the other side of that "empty" str. They can not explain why the chopper political police was the only one authorized to fly over Caracas in this day and did not do anything against the snipers, who were all over the rooftops nearby Presidential Palace, that will be exhibited, as it were inefficient to be security measures to protect the president. A few days after the "revolution", the chief of the military guard responsible was asked in the National Assembly (our Congress) why they did not oppose the snipers, and he said, "because they were not there to act against the president" is not it recognition? <br /> <br /> There is so much more that a high rank military announced that Chavez had resigned and 2 days later he said that he lied, because "this policy" and currently, the Minister of internal Affairs Chavez administration. <br /> <br /> He would have me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this "documentary" made to sell the image of a world apa good old Hugo Chavez, who runs for the poor and the rich poor opposition, which wants to it at any cost, if the truth is that 60-70% of people who reject his government, and that percentage includes the poor. <, Br /> <br /> I hope that those of you who have seen and bought it will be able to see another version that would have made the Venezuelan people groups without showing at least 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda is back!
