Well, I must say that this is probably the worst film I've seen this year! Jokes were very moist (do not expect from the film as PG) (PG assessment in Canada), and they were not funny! With this great cast, I at least expect a good action, but I did not even realize. I'm a big fan of Rein Wilson and it's the first time I was very disappointed with my performance. Neither Luke Wilosn or symbols Uma Thurman are not even a little cute and I really did not care what happened to one of them. I did not expect it at all, as in the past, I really liked the other films of this director (Six Days Seven Nights, for example), this movie is not worth the $ 10 it cost me, and I strongly recommend you do not see this movie, I guarantee, that you will, as I ask the film ends.
