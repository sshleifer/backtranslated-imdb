Next to the chopper films of the 1970s and 80 years, of which about walking dead were probably the second most popular horror subgenre. While Slasher films were "Black Christmas" and "Halloween" to get all this happens, click the zombies were films of George Romero's "Dead". Not surprisingly, shortly after the success of his first two in the series, the other directors wanted cash. Many Italian producers were particularly interested, such as Fulci, who brought us "zombie" in the year after Romero's "Dawn of the Dead", known as "Zombi" in Italy and some other countries, and it is there that the film Fulci was known as the Â«Zombi 2". In addition to the walking dead it has no relation to the film Romero, but it's a good film in its own right. It was a great success in Europe and 9 years later, the sequel was born <br /> <br /> Pros :. A lot of beautiful, lush landscapes. A high score. Act is not quite good, but throw the game, and seems to enjoy the experience. After the kind of slow start, the pace of moves as in the movie action. Lots of cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad movie fans. Good work makeup effects. A lot of blood and some decent gore <br /> <br /> Cons :. Almost plot less. Nothing you have not seen before. Roughly tear some stuff from the first pair of "Return of the Living Dead" films. Cardboard characters. Not aged too well due to poor rock 1980 (not what I say, all the rock music of the period, bad), clothing and the overall feel of the film <br /> <br /> Final thoughts. : first of all, this is not really a continuation of the cult in Fulci. In fact, I do not know if he ever meant to pick up where the movie ended. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill at the time of production and eventually leave and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei movies quite funny, but this movie many well mannered fun. And that's all this film actually, just something to watch for fun <br /> <br /> My Rating: 3.5. / 5 (so-bad-is-good rating) 2/5 (Serious rating)
