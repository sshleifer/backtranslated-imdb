this film was a major disappointment. the level of ruthless cruelty and violence were very disturbing in this film. some of the scenes were really too ugly and vile. the main characters can not be identified with or even sympathize. the leading character of the hero was slippery as they come. sickroom / hothouse atmosphere lends itself over-the-top stage. little or nothing he could do to learn about the Spanish Civil War with this film. Fortunately, I was in Spain and I understand that it's not real! In addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a horrible "horror" was also very abusive and ill-treated, while the DVD will be packaged and marketed to attract a gay audience. actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess.i think if you love to watch children and pets are slaughtered, this film may especially appeal to you.
