Worst Bob Hope comedy ever (and that includes some heavy competition). Hopes on the island with the sailors, dreams aloud to be in the bath with a geisha girl "steering his ship." Someone, of course, directing the Hope oxcart over the precipice, as it shows the Phillies dealers and Gina Lollobrigida, and still can not work any laughs or excitement. Where Bing Crosby, if you really need it?
