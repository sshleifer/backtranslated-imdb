This program bugs me! There's no humor to it and are too serious to be called "fun"! It's just too educational for my taste! Symbols are very stereotypical and ugly. Plots are redundant and morality is simply repeated over and over again. Where's the fun in that? In addition, I believe that it was on the BBC too long and too many airs. Is there really need to have a slot on the T.V every 2 or 3 months if a whole new show runs out of episodes? I think it's time that the BBC dating back some of his old show, as Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snork, Moomin, raccoons and Count Duckula addition to constantly give contracts to these new shows! I thought, BBC, where return Danger Mouse, so what's going on with this? 3/10
