I have 2 home entertainment stores, and I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this one was so bad that it forced me to create and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserves an Oscar for his role in Godfather III, when compared to Judd Kolagrande th in this film. <br /> <br /> This Robotic and inspiration. Her lover has just died one month prior to its arrival at the Â«Rubber House", which he gave her. Once there, she discovers that he cheated on her in all her ways, but none of them does not seem to register with her. During the day, she begins a relationship with Leslie (Defoe) caretaker of the house. Despite the fact that she is married to Defoe from the screen, her scenes with him were cold and objective. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I missed it. Willem Dafoe not even able to save this film from an amateur cinematic train wreck that it is.
