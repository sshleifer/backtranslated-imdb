«Pandemonium» is a film of horrors of deception that comes off more stupid funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedy. Especially comedy skits. "Aircraft", "The Naked Gun" trilogy "Blazing Saddle," "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" some of my favorite comedies, which forge a specific genre. «Pandemonium» is not there with these films. Most of the scenes in this movie, I was sitting in a daze, because the film is not so funny. There are a few laughs in the movie, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh so much more than a few times, and that's all this movie has going for it. Geez «Scream» was more laughter than this film, and it was more of a horror movie. How strange is that? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
