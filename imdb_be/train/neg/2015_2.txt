I'm really looking forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I aviation nut and byt_nast a serious love affair with helicopters. I do not like this program because it takes imagination to an incredible level. speed record for helicopters of the world was set at 249 miles per hour on the Westland Lynx few years ago. The only chopper, which has always been more of an experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. He struck out 300, and was an integral helicopter, which means that he was a pusher propeller at the end of the fuselage, providing traction. <br /> <br /> In short, none of the helicopter can not fly more than 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight. And the Bell 222, the "actor", which reflects AirWolf not very fast, even for a helicopter. And it does not remain in production for a long time. <br /> <br /> There was a movie that came out in this period of time under the name "Blue Thunder," which was much more realistic.
