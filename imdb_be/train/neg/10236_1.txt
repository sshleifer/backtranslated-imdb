Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before a legion of cinema purists push them latte, let me stop. Much as I enjoyed it, it is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen, and definitely the worst film I've seen in a movie theater (more claims, as I remember, Daredevil on the big screen). Two wires (Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) have been inconclusive at best and did terrible at worst. Of course, they did not help the scenario, which had as much emotional depth as the Daphne & Celeste and one response that was as convincing as protection OJ. Plot (to stretch the term lightly) was thin to non-existent and the "gore" scenes, while, of course, hard to be unrelated and ridiculously formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert), who kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various forms of torture, visceral and psychological and physical. Scenes of torture feel disconnected set pieces and the focus was directly on the shock rather than scaring the audience. Despite the fact that there really is a very, very few positives to draw from this film, his redemptive features of those same flaws that make it such a terrible movie. I have never heard more vocal audience in the movie. Twenty minutes later, the entire movie was Stsyazhko and remained so throughout. For my part I went blew with a laugh, inspired by the film, which ascended to the top of the horrible movie. Whichever way you look at it, it's really cinematic achievements and plans for the future director's imitators More minutely, it does not make the movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I did not mention that I was able to get into the movie for free ... so I can afford to laugh at it. I still want to ask for your money back ... it was really bad.
