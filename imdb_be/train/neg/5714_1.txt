I have seen many good Korean films, including thrillers and films with darker overtones, but this one will defend. The director seems to be a sadist who accidentally get someone to produce a litter. The film has some entertainment value and not a thriller. I can not believe that someone really made such a film. While acting in, the storyline and the feeling it goes badly. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I'm not going to see any films of this director. There is no point in making the film, and a complete disappointment in the fact thrillers moments. All this shows the scene of a psychopath waste drums with poorly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence, thinking that makes it irresistible. Very disappointing movie, and I highly recommend to skip all the films of this kind.
