WOW! Pretty awful stuff. Road Plot Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor in Sardinia and hooks with Arto director Joseph Losey for this amazingly irresponsible Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays the rich who die widow holds the fort on its minions on the island, where it dictates, very loudly, her memoirs to the Secretary incredibly patient. If the villain Burton is claiming to be a poet and an old friend, Taylor knows her time is up. Ludicrious extremes --- it is difficult to determine whether Taylor and Burton are bad or if it is the intention of Williams to make his character so unsightly. If so, then the action is brilliant! Burton mutters his line, including several times BOOM words, while Taylor's screams her. It's really awful. So Noel Coward as malicious trustee Taylor, the "Witch of Capri.Â» <br /> <br /> As expected BOOM how fleeting time and how quickly life moves --- Williams two standard themes, but it is so the laid by Losey, it was Taylor and Burton is not written for an audience during their mostly silly monologues, any substance, the film would have completely blurred. <br /> <br /> Boom does have gorgeous photos --- camera would be in focus screw the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting cast features Shimkus, a large Romolo Valli as a resourceful doctor Taylor and Michael Dunn, as it is opposite a dwarf guard ... he and his dog are doing a number on Burton!
