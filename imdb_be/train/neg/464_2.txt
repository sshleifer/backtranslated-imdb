This film is not funny in any case, he is trying to be funny with his lame humor, which is so dry and boring that the film only 2 hours of torture. Throughout the film, I thought one thing, "when it's all over." One thing that you have to give them that they have very little mildly funny moments, which is also why I gave him as much as 2 stars. This is not original, and uses practically every old blonde joke in the book, even those that were not funny the first time. It basically is a film humiliate blonde and record the whole repetoir blonde jokes. <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie spoiled blonde humor, do not pay any amount of money an hour, it's just that bad.
