The whole thing is very nice to look at Europe at..the shooting location was a good idea. The leading actors are attractive. Cost servicable. <br /> <br /> But then they say! And, the plot is designed! And it was getting worse. Pacino sleepwalking and Keller continued to talk about how sad she is..hello, dear, you're not alone. If he does an imitation of Mae West, you may have to hide their faces, that it hurts to look. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how any actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this, or a better question is why it ended up stinking so bad? <br /> <br /> because death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you should have low satisfaction here. Maybe it should feel as empty and cold as death. But I still can not recommend it.
