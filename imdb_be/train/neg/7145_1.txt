Apparently Hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak. This film was mind numbingly bad. The casting was horrible, unspeakable force, and the story-filled holes. Scenario? who needs a script? I was surprised that the film was not verbally vulgar, I thought it would be, but I got enough T & A shots Until recently, all my life. The film was like listening to a 19-year-old street racer from ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell a story. Being so bad, the script, I thought that the two brothers in the film were lovers in the first. Scene at the racetrack, along with the female actor in the film is stored makes me think of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of film that Grindhouse modeled himself after ... Only the authors thought that they were serious.
