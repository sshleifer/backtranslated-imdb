I had a clear displeasure to see this film at the International Film Festival in Vancouver in 2006. I attended the festival for more than 5 years, and of course I've seen some bad movies about. Nevertheless, "The First Bite" has reached a completely new low in the film. Despite shooting in beautiful locations with rare, exquisite close-up of fabulous food, the film racked excessive number of twists and unnatural characters, until I was practically begging for it to end. <br /> <br /> lead actor, David La Haye, completely failed to show character development throughout the film, drawing pompous chef from start to finish. Additional sub-areas, such as eating disorders, have been developed so bad and did not fit into any context, which showed that the film up to that point. <br /> <br /> The theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt to hide the film, which does not achieve anything, not going anywhere, and totally disappointing.
