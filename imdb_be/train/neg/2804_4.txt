I was probably spoiled by something, at first, to see the version of 1973 of Michael Zheyston and Sorcha Cusack ago 1983 adaptation of such a disappointment. I just do not get no chemistry between the two main stars. Many watched and theatrical performances simply do not do it for me, and that everything about putting Tim in the role of Rochester. If the casting director actually ever read the book. Very strange! He's a great actor, but Mr. Rochester, it is not exactly so! And ZIL was just, well, strange, a little mixture corresponds to pair with. At this contribute to the supporting cast were very good and Lowood scene for me was the best adaptation, but in general, do not grab any novel magic. Of course, there would have to ask someone to look at it as a real adaptation of the novel. This let you down!
