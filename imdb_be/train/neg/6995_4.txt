Funny how many of the people who say that it is much better version of Romero, tend to be very young (judging by other posts). What we have here is slippery, action, mountain and "whoopee" filled 2:00 MTV video. Frantic editing, pop video camera work, "cool" music blah <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a complete disaster) ... pretty good acting all round, fully predictable in the "who will die next" general rate and cash in on the dawn of the dead's name, which will only generate a lot of income from the original fans that will go and see it out of curiosity ... <br /> <br /> not remakes of the classics on the nerves ? If they can not really come up with something original? Why remake of Dawn Of The Dead? What made the original special (middle segment of the children to think so sad to be slow to show how, when you get everything you ever wanted to you still do not like it) is completely absent. This action flick, simply and clearly. The faster, the better. If you are in the cinema of action (and this 2004 version is well done) is fair enough, but for those who like a little matter of his films ... get ready to sigh (again) ... <br /> <br /> View cinema in the next few years, we have received a number of redesigned Godfather director who most fashionable pop in at the moment, and Star wars redone, all the children say the new version is miles better than the old version so slowly and sadly, and holds a camera picture over 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> is not bad, but after 10 years, they will still abmyarkovvats Romero's version, it does not smear
