As a professor of Native film, I can honestly say that this is probably one of the scariest movies with Native content that I have ever visited. I would like to get a root canal than watch this movie again. Using stereotypes not creative attempt to use conventional parts Coyote stories and the poor performance of the cells were degraded only fight uncreative storyline and bad scenario. Writer and director showed the worst part of the colonizing approach to portraying the indigenous peoples and communities. If this man is the Native, they have to go home and apologize to everyone that they know for a fact that Apple and internalized racism and bad sense of humor, that they have developed. If this person is not native, they should seriously reconsider their white privilege and ask yourself if they show pending, unintended racism, or if they deliberately do not understand. My only hope is that the fundamental actors in this film had a good time and at least paid for their efforts. If you want to see good films Native, then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance Me Outside, the river Medicine, Powwow Highway, smoke signals ... to name just a few.
