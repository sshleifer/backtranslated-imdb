Michael Jackson would have claimed a place for the top to the nature of the golden child, because he loves children. It does not work (and why would they?), So instead we have Eddie Murphy to save the world, save Â«Kid Midas." I highly recommend any future writer to study carefully, please, stupid actor dialogue in this whimsical fantasy - adventure - comedy, it's a step closer to Ishtar. Regardless of Murphy says or does can be most liked, but do not be offended about his fine comic talent; he does not belong in this film, and the same went to the DR. Doolittle! Violence and visuals combined reasons stomp camp as a cult classic, and that would not make sense, as the Hollywood movie fanatics and kept cashing in on the guy. Speaking of visuals, they were pulled off remarkably well during the presidential Fame Ronald Reagan. Murphy is much better to come to America, and 48 hours, but this film is not stale my touch of golden honey for a sweet, crunchy taste.
