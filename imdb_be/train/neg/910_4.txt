The storyline was very straight forward and easy to follow and contains many no brainer comedy to the point where it just got boring. Some audience members seemed funny, but I like more intellectual humor. <br /> <br /> There have been several well-known Swedish actors in the film and their performance was decent considering the scenario. Lena was Andrew looks good as always. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the original film, so I can not say that it is better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you love movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this film might be worth a look at.
