The fact that stands out in my mind, in this film (unfortunately), is the introduction, in which John Berlin (Andy Garcia) leading into the city. You see his Mercedes to pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like it is loaded from the redwoods. It's pretty nice. <br /> <br /> As for Andy Garcia plays a character on the Berlin family, well ... Andy too Hispanic / Latin to be patency. Maybe Caucasian father married his Spanish mother in this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you put it in people's farms, and the provincials, it stands out like a sore thumb, especially with his accent that erupts when he is angry. Yes, I know, big deal right? It's still a good actor. <br /> <br /> As for the name of a serial killer who nicknames his victims Jennifer. All of the victims blind, and he divides them. The killer took a break, but then pops up, when a blind witness (do not ask), Helen Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman does a good job playing the blind man, to my surprise. When I saw Lance Henriksen plays Sgt. Freddy Ross I'm worried. Henriques has played in some pretty strange films, especially in recent times. I still can not forget it in a bloodbath cinema, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> Berlin films in a small town with LA detective. He begins to investigate the murder of Jennifer after spending parts of the body in the local landfill. His brilliance in the disclosure of one of the victims was blind, it seemed far-fetched. It is also ironic spoiler * the murder of Freddy, a record and the name similarity. I'm very confused as to the logic of how to come at eight «Jennifers». And the killer motive is simply mad not fit a lot of impact. Looking back, this film is probably more true to life, showing the unsuspecting man as capable of murder simply because they have become a little Wacko over time or may have been born Looney Toons. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich does a great job in his interrogation Garcia! Albeit not the police will not be legally allowed to push someone hard and the eggs they had no right to get knocked out. As for the ending, it's a little strange, but very controversial, as well as Sgt. Ross's murder. Killer chooses to go after his run victim, preferring instead to frolick I think. <br /> <br /> And there are so many possibilities, it has a goal, it's funny to her. I will not spoil the end, because, in spite of that sweating is a good surprise. After that, though, you're likely to say, as I did, "the boy she was lucky!" 4/10
