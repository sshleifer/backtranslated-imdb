Jack London's life was, of course, quite picturesque for dozens of films about different aspects of it. Sadly, however, to say that his life was used for the film had some propaganda war that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of your character. <br /> <br /> Jack London, who barely saw 40 years of age when he died, he wrote some of the best stories around. He wrote about what he knew, but he also wrote like everyone else in bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him. Some of this experience in the day and time would have been condemned as racism. But it was the Second World War, London, and was a great believer in the "yellow peril", as it was called back in the day. <br /> <br /> Two-thirds of the film covers his life as an author, we see him years a sailor where he got the inspiration for The Sea Wolf. We see it in the Yukon in the cabin miner with a dog that had no doubt that his inspiration for The Call of the wild. London was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about the right paper for the world to enjoy since. <br /> <br /> The final third of its business with sometimes as a war correspondent covering the Russo-Japanese War. London was a socialist, but socialism does not include people who were Oriental. As with several million others, he saw the growing immigration of Asians to our Pacific coast as a threat to jobs for white people. He favors tougher immigration policy for Mongoloid. <br /> <br /> The film puts the cart before the horse. London presented as a man who had seen because he was on hand in the Russian-Japanese War, Japan's ambitions were, and for that reason was just as xenophobic as he is. In fact, a kind of brutality that is present during the Second World War were not existing at the time of the Russian-Japanese conflict. Japan had its imperial ambitions, but also all the others, including the United States at the time. But our immigration policies, caused by pressure from the West Coast of our politicians has been a big factor that contributes to a worsening of relations with Japan in a few generations. London was part of the reason is not a prophet crying in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> This film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston, who later made several films with a slightly larger budget than Jack London. If he had a little more money Bronston, you may have received a James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, and who would be right for this role. Instead, they got Michael O'Shea, who was making his second film after Lady Burlesque. O'Shea fine in the part, but of course, there was no box office. <br /> <br /> In London, covering the war, he meets up with Captain Tanaka, who plays Leonard Strong, actor, specializing in Asian and played a ton of them during the Second World War. From the perspective of 1905 Strong contours in the best tradition of Fu Manchu empire to Japan until the adoption by the United States in the end. They must have passed a big shift from Kachan crowd. <br /> <br /> A lot, of course, remains of London's life, including his first wife. The game is the second and only wife in the film, Susan Hayward, which comes only in the movies, when it is half finished. I wish we would have seen her again. Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband of nearly 40 years, dying in 1955. <br /> <br /> O'Shea actually met and married the leading lady in his life Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London, and they were married for 30 years until he died O'Shea in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe one day we'll get an idea of ​​Jack London, who will much better than this one.
