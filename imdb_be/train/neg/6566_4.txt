I watched this movie, after so much trouble in downloading it via Rapidshare. And I have to say that he does not deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so swollen that I was really looking forward to see it. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those films that do not meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, despite a long history. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "On the waterfront". <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was irritable, especially when it comes from America. Direction lacked quality many times, except for a few scenes between <br /> <br /> Give this script for any of them -. Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra and I am 100% sure that they will make a magnificent movie of it. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying Parinda was bad. It was just not good enough.
