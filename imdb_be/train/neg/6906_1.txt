Not only that, this film has a bad plot, bad acting and terrible direction, it opens up a whole new sense of racism. <br /> <br /> In this film, "White" chicks are bitches, "white" boys are Saas-be gangsters, and successfully (yes again) "White" entrepreneurs get up toilet shitters. <br / > <br /> I just wonder what would have happened if I would have done the exact same movie with the same storyline and script, but I did it for Caucasians. "He's a dude, it's good to finally see your 've ceased to meet these black chicks. »<br /> <br /> no one notices, but watch this movie again and you will tear the way they are drawn new Zealand« white lopchyki. "Suddenly his white people, which are the main cause of gang aggression and whores out for quick explosion. Only Samoans girl has a heart, there is no such thing as not slutty white girl. <br /> <br /> This I resent that they could not have done this movie without giving Caucasian community in New Zealand disgusting profile. If you think I'm overgeneralizing, go see this movie, and see what you do with the "white boys". Just because Samoans want to call us the "white boys" in real life, it does not mean that it's ridiculous. If I said hey black boy I'll let the teeth. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie. NOT waste your money. not a racist.
