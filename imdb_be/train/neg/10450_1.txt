This movie was the worst film I've seen, as «Date Movie». I laughed through out the entire movie and not be afraid. It was funny how the snake will be looking for a certain part of the body to attack the passengers, such as the eyes, the tongue, the example, the chest. When we saw National Geographic Channel we know snakes custom remain permanent on the body when they bite. For each specific scene snake bite and the passenger will be bitten by a man on the body. I believe that the manufacturer has not studied it about snakes and their behavior. I can not believe I wasted my money on this movie.So I do not recommend this film trust just wait until he is in a dollar theater or rent it out.
