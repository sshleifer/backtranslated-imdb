So I finally saw the movie "My Left Foot" last night after years of asserting my mother, how strange ... The central performance Day-Lewis is really wonderful and amazing, but someone even with minimal impact on its other work must wait at least <br /> <br /> fatal miscalculation in my eyes was that, becoming obsessed with the evidence of normality that person. the film decided to show it as a complete and total jerk. On the one hand, I can see that this is a logical relationship; mankind always has the ability to be controversial, and disability should not overshadow it. I just want to neutral observers would not be so forgiving of deviant behavior and assume that circumstances will automatically make it excusable. They do not. Playing normal, and so yes, people with disabilities play - but they do not do so because they are disabled; they do it because they are being unreasonable. Physical disturbance does not give you the right to throw a hissy fit in public, just because someone you love turns you down. <br /> <br /> There are certain things, if you are unwise to disabled or unable to -bodied. Giving someone a tacit permission to download a football directly on the head with the sole purpose of the installation in one of them. (True, I once saved a penalty from star striker schools with my face, but I belonged to that time. It was not for adoption.) Participation in a brawl in a bar the other. Enjoying the fact that your father is only distributed chat with you after you have proven themselves capable of metaphorically jumping through hoops physical masochism takes a step too far. All these things are silly, and suffering, through them, as a way to demonstrate their courage, does not make them less foolish <br /> <br /> So, yes. just because you have overcome obstacles to achieve great things does not make you any less a push ... Being a good person is a priority; setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down on the list.
