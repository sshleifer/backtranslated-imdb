If ever there was a movie that deserves a big fat zero rating was this pile of crap. I love zombie movies, and even bad, usually something going for them, but this is not an atrocity. I actually started to get angry to watch this movie, because it's so insulting the poor, I can not believe that the people responsible for this will actually think it was acceptable. <br /> <br /> There's no plot and no story is cut with scenes of sadism and whipping. People do not react, or act in any way resemble human beings. The entire film is also shot in two rooms poorly decorated vaguely reminiscent of the places they need to be. All this is a meaningless mess, it does not go anywhere, and when the zombies finally prove they look like trash and did not do very much. <br /> <br /> I could have done better than the movie it is, so you could, and so could someone who had never seen a film before. It's pathetic and without a doubt the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it is the worst movie of all time. You will notice, incidentally, that the only positive reviews give it 10/10 and I urge you to buy the DVD. I can not imagine who sincerely thinks is neutral, it is a good film, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and generous.
