This film is very very very poor. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> It was a bit of tension, but not so much to make you jump out of the chair. He slowly begins to build-up of tension. But it is not a success. At least, if you ask me. Although at some points or moments, I have to say that it was a bit funny, when people got shot and they went down. <br /> <br /> They should have done something like Scary Movie, it might be better to film. Because I only watched the film, skipping scenes and got bored through the film. I must say that I felt sleepy to watch this movie, so I'm sure that I can say that it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> Or do not waste time even thinking it has something to do with this film, except to leave it where it already exists, where it is very dusty ..
