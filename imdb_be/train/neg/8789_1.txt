I checked it out a DVD for a dollar so I can easily smile, like a terrible movie unfolds. every time you think you can not get any worse, it inevitably does. Actions absolutely terrible. the story does not make sense at all. The name "cold place" in the American version of the DVD has absolutely nothing to do with the script. Scenes so obviously taken their first take. There are a lot of mistakes during the dialogues, which show that is simply not going to do more to take, at least, try to make the movie bearable. I can not remember having seen the worst film, and I sometimes get bad - well, you can not stop with Wesley Snipes, except. Neto, who am I kidding, while bad, Unstoppable deserves Best Picture award at the Oscars, when compared with that piece of shit.
