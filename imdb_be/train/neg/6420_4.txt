Okay I admit, he started a very nice and well, but then he just fell down, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar would could even finished reading the script in about 5 minutes into the film, the only reason why I actually sat through all film, was, I would like to see a turnaround in the week, and to my surprise, well, people I can not even tell you if there was even one, because the end just leaves you confused, and then credit the role, I was like that hell? it does not deserve to run the theater, I'm sorry, but I do not mean it was horrible, only reaso I gave it a 4 because it was a few parts of the nervous ... That's it! You can see it, they do not say to you, do not, hey, you might even like it or even love it! but if you hate it, do not say I did not warn you!
