Regarded by many critics as one of the biggest ugliest types of all time (certainly the biggest bitch career directed by Brian De Palma). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his mistress Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. His story captures another smug guy reporter Peter Lan (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my short ... <br /> <br /> What is this movie supposed to be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it sure does not add much. This undermines the unimaginably vile, a two-dimensional characters that you never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but could not finish it because it was not to my liking), but it is clear to me that those who made / make fun novel consider this film to be a complete travesty. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many talented actors strive hard to give a below average film a kind of quality and fail. What a waste. <br /> <br /> The problems begin with the casting of a nice guy Tom Hanks in the role, which is clearly supposed to be callous. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of the Brit. Bruce Willis bad, badly miscast in the role. That the thinking there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even Morgan Freeman can avoid the film with his dignity intact, being obliged to deliver a lame, heavy-handed lecture on "integrity" after the menopause. <Br. /> <br /> The film ends with a farce absurd <br /> <br /> I like the assembly of talent; for I will give it four out of ten, but I'm sure that some people say that it is much better, the film could be made from the original material.
