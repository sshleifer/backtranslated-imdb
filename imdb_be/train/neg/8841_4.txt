Parasomnia has an interesting premise, but the story is poorly done without any tension or even logical approach. Throw in a convincing, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played a big role in the movies as Cop Scanner 2 Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and gum. The rest of the cast is not known (and not so good), with the exception of Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West of large Re-Animator trilogy). But it can play a role, as in a dream (which is a bit of what he is doing here). The main problem lies in the fact that the actions of the characters does not make sense at all. The story is quite dull and predictable cheap computer effects, mixed with some bloody scenes, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This could be so much better, I did not get good reviews about it. This is below average really.
