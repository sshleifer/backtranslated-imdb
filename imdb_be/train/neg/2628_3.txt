Directed by Sidney J. Furie created in Hollow Point, postmodern absurdist masterpiece that defies and constantly surprises the audience. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to ask the question of what happens to a tired conventional traditionalist paradigm "plot" and "characteristics", if you remove the crutches "motivation" and "reason." <br /> <br /> As a result leads me to say that my opinion of him he could not get any higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this movie makes no sense, the law enforcement agents are flat out unsympathetic and organized criminals is completely crazy to.
