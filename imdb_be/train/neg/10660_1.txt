Sorry for the people calling Kamal Haasan «ulaganaayakan», perhaps, for them is ulagam Tollywood! Comeon guys..this movie thriller without thrills .. <br /> <br /> out of your ulagam and just watch some high-class thriller as suspicious or even silence of the lambs. <br /> <br /> technically good, but style over substance Kamal does not look like a police officer, there's no thrill at all boring and dragging to the end you may be salutary 3 precious hours of your life, if miss to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Kamal at its best is the best in Tollywood
