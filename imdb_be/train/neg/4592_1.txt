This film made me very angry. I desperately wanted to strangulation "scientists" and invisible filmmakers during it. Very, very painful to sit through. Pretentious babble and in the worst way. Little good information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of ​​new Haggai horse sh * t. The worst offenders were cracked pot quacks Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza tells us that most people lead a life of mediocrity and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, lives on a higher level. Even the ideas and attitudes that I basically agree with presented in such a heavy-handed, clumsy, superior, pretentious, instructive way, I felt the desire to repudiate them. I think that's what made me so angry that they have done what is really profound aspects of the established scientific thought and overshadowed them with their new age scam. Much of this is based around the concept of erroneous application of quantum theory to macrocosm. Notably, theatrical part of Marley Matlin are amateurish and cliché-ridden <br /> <br /> I would refer people instead of the excellent survey Bryson science :. "A brief history of nearly everything." There's a lot of deep wonder of life and the universe in real established science.
