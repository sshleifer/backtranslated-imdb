This film is not very good. It's sad, and not a lot of blood for a horror movie. The plot is just trods with not much going on. And I think that a female vampire was so stupid. She had a lot of chances to score vampire hunters, as it shows that it was the lighting like reflexes. But every time she has one of them pinned, it just takes time and there is always something going on, where it does not bite them. Not surprisingly, it did not go directly to a cable <br /> <br /> The verdict :. Not everywhere is as good as the first vampire movie. You SUCKER, if you spend your time on it.
