This film describes the experiences of several killers (one Burt Reynolds), a prostitute, and two transvestites over an interval of several hours to overnight in Miami. The converging storylines eventually bring all the people together in one place and time. The film was mildly entertaining, but the biggest problem is that everything happens at night, and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the fact that it was impossible to see what was happening. In several scenes you can see where they are trying to "stretch" the developing process of saving images. Who does not know how to operate a movie camera. It is strange that this film was even released!
