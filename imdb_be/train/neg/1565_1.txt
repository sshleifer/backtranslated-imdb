The film uses the name for the ultra-lame story. Kill murder, it would be good. The film includes scenes of a taboo, to force the viewer to move back into their seats. The scenes are unnecessary and gusty. The film is a novice screenwriter could be associated. Just a waste of film props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this film, if it is not worth the 10 lines of my time, but I have to push to let people know to avoid nonsense. When people are counting on you to choose a good movie to movie nights, choose something else. If you have a soul, not to damage it, exposing themselves to this stuff.
