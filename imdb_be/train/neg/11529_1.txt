Yes, unfortunately, I stumbled on this DVD and found that it was incredibly awful. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if some idiot in an orange hat, which calls itself the "Orange Sherbert» is the best creative idea these guys could come up with for the character, then they should be, certainly not in the shooting scene. Poor "suits" bad "interview", and basically there is not a single "Fighter" on all the disk with any piece of charisma. <br /> <br /> «struggle» in Splatter Rampage Wrestling anything more than they are idiots gently and playfully jumping together on a trampoline. They are sure to giggle together all the time, too, which makes the experience more like a change for the kids than the "fight Deathmatch». <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is pretty lackluster Backyard Wrestling clone. Only instead of blood, weapons, chaos and WRESTLING, we have a trampoline, giggling children, terrible audio and some guy called Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> The fight fan or not, to avoid this DVD. It's terrible.
