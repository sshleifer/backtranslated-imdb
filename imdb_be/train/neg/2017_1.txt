The plot is believable, but banal, that is beautiful and neglected wife of a wealthy and influential man has an affair with a psychotic piece of bread, then trying to cover it up like crazy stems and blackmails her. But what develops from there Chmielno illogical. Despite the resources that are available to ordinary couples who have money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine seems to have only one internal, their lawyer and the local police (who say that they can not do anything) at their disposal while they struggle with the uncertainty and terror. They do not have their own security staff (only fancy security system, they mishandle), household or base personnel, drivers, etc. Even there, it is clear, the means to hire a private nurse round hours to care for the hero, if he suffers from a life-threatening injury, leaving a man and wife is one, and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is portrayed as having drunk brains and our hero, the oligarch, to behave in the most unexpected and irrational manner. Manufacturing is an insult to viewers who wasted my time with this nonsense and crimes of embezzlement talents of veteran Jose Oliva and Don Murray actors (what were they thinking?). And shame on the whole period of the television service for insulting the intelligence of his audience for this tasteless offerings.
