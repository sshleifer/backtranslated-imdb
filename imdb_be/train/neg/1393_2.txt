I thought, watch the video of employment in the corporate compliance was tedious. This film went nowhere fast. What could be more cheesy episode zone half an hour twilight turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars, the picture of some dude pool (it really should answer your phone, by the way) dot matrix printer is doing his job, and Heuy and Louey sitting in a yellow lit control room repeating the Â«T minus 10 and counting," as if something exciting would happen. This is not so, do not expect. The best thing about this film to see James Best and Gerald MCC in something other than the well-known TV personalities out there, and reaching to find something good. And do not get me started on the music, which was composed entirely of the drum, some large marine mammals, as well as feedback microphone connection. This film is as close as I've given yet, but he gets a 2 because I actually was able to finish this insomnia cure, and did not have to leave in the middle. Avoid at all costs.
