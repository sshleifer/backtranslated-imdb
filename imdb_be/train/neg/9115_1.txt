If you ask me, the first one was really the best one. Look at Sarah MG, it is a real, medium, tough girl, look at Amy Adams is just stupid stick. It's nothing! People do not like it! Secondly, Sebastian was lovely and hot in the first film, he is now "baby face". History is not so good, and I do not understand. Why they do not do this first, it is the beginning. Loosy actors, anything with history. It's not cruel, it plays. The first of these is the best actors, the best story, and its average value. I think that music is better Cruel 1 and the music better in Cruel 3. This is not the worst film I've seen, but compaer with the first one of his one big, big, big nothing.
