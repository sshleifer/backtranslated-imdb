Shame it! There I was comfortable in a chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, bouyant in the hope of another wonderful night of entertainment Muppet. What do I get? Disappointed! How Muppets can go from the sublime to this Christmas Carol? Humor was terrible, the songs were worse than the country and the Western (and that's saying something), and the story was confused and poor as Blind Pew. I think that the main problem lay in the fact that they have bitten off too much in an attempt to Treasure Island. Short story, such as the Christmas Carol, is ideal because you can weave a sharp turns Muppet around him .... then you have to drag along a portion of all the fun stopped. Whence Muppets go from here? How about Muppets Wizard of Oz?
