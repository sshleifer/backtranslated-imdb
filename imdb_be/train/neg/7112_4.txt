Well, I must admit that it was one of my favorites as a child, when I used to watch it on a home projector as drum super-8. Currently, there is not much to recommend it, except for the intrinsic value of the camp the actors who are "terrified" copies of human skulls. The special effects are pretty stupid, basically consist of skulls on the wires and superimposed "ghost" image. <br /> <br /> But there's something to be said for the sets. A mansion in which this occurs is quite terrible, especially since it is mostly unfurnished (perhaps due to budgetary considerations?). <br /> <br /> This is certainly cause more laughter than screams, however. Just try not to giggle when my wife (who is doing more than its share of screaming) goes into the greenhouse and encounters with the ghost of the former husband.
