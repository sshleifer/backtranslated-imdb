Look, there's nothing spectacularly offensive about this movie, it's just boring. This is a typical rom-com with the ending you can see coming before you have seen so much as a trailer. The main difference is that classical Rom-KM solve their stories with wit and lack of pretentiousness. This film has no pretensions, but it does not really make any sense of motion, you feel as if you could get up and leave at any time. Production of the film also has a kind of debut film made about fifteen years ago. I would recommend re-watch a classic film like When Harry Met Sally instead shallow imitation. Oh, another big problem ... there is no chemistry. If you are used to seeing Michael looks all cute as Vaughn in alias, you are going to be seriously disappointed with the way they made it look here.
