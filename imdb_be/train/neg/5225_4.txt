This entry Drummond lacks continuity. Most of these elements has its own stupidity, delayed marriage, and so on. However, it has an infinite number of events that occur in the near darkness, as the characters run from one place to another. The house is more like a city. There's also Leo G. Carroll, who is the obvious suspect, which no one seems to even look. He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious, but Drummond and people do not seem to pick up on something. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to good effect and a very good finish. <br /> <br /> I know that Elzhi to be a comic figure, but as Nigel Bruce in the movie Rathbone Sherlock Holmes, he is so funny that it's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intellect to be near him. There is a story behind it, which will explain how he and Drummond became adherents?
