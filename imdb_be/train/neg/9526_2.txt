Way back when I was filming the video for free I chose this one. OOPS Things I would like to mention is the summary had already been given such. 1: Someone who has had a lot to do with the creation of this film was awesome and sick passion for food, it was rude and unnecessary. 2: There is a kind of soundtrack to the background of the film, which seems to be there all the time, and by the way, I felt for a few days after watching this garbage, I believe that they have something going on in the subconscious track. Either that, or it was just a bad traumatisingly or both. Many times throughout the film, you can say, the writer and the director does not have much experience or talent. And do not even ask about the acting.
