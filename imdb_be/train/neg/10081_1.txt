I read some comments about the film, and I can only assume that some people are easily entertained. This film is nothing. It's so bad it is written, directed and acted, it just makes an impression. The characters speak in clich√©s focused dialogue and the situation is completely implausible. While that might make it old-fashioned and fun, it's not because everything is so lifeless film becomes dull. It's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman who is struggling with their sexuality, but then it either has not been resolved by the studio Execs, to give the history of some real life relishes or has no cojones. This film could go in as time enyclopedia bad Lifetime TV movie.
