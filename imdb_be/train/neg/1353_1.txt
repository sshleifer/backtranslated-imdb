What is it? it jumble of bizarre recurring motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, the swastika and frankly racist music, among others) is not limited no narrative or plot or character development. All this struck me as bashful "freak show" and I do not mean only unusual casting decisions. It looks like a bad acid trip, far beyond any level of drug use could be attributed to Hunter S. Thompson and William Burroughs. The only movie that I can compare it to Eraserhead (my second least favorite movie of all time), which was intentionally much more depressing, but I still found it to be? a complete waste of my time. It's one thing to give me a look at the inner workings of the mind of others - even by someone else is a chemically altered consciousness - but quite another to just throw strange visuals me purely for the sake of a fad.
