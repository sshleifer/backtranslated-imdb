Honestly, if anyone has a brain, there is not one positive thing <br /> <br /> talk about this film, what so ever. <br /> <br /> I lost $ 1 rent it. I would laugh at Will Smith saying, "If you have a dream, you gotta protect it." <br /> <br /> All actors must be bored and there was no fame at the time. Even Matthew Mack Conahay * however you spell it * was better than all the actors in this film, where he played a psycho in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this film, and there is something good to tell you the IQ, should be very low with such a bad taste in movies, it's painful. Thank you ... and the truth is, it was said! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from suffering. <br /> <br /> Get The Devil's Rejects, is now a classic.
