Just unnatural plagiarism infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote", something quite strange that it is poorly written junk lasted eight years. I am sure that most people who watched this shit unentertaining were in their sixties and seventies, and only set up because they did not have anything better, or just thought his star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who had just had a decent career in the 1960s, never had a lot of actors of all (by his own admission), and he was too old to play doctor when the series began in 1993 looks very old as a result of many years of chain smoking and drinking. His mediocre real life son Barry, wooden actor, who is rarely in anything that does not involve his father, his son plays in the series.
