Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you squint, the light falls on the subject just-so. But the core of precision entirely compensation for the dull, spotty and inconsistent story, piles of cardboard dialogue and unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters of a characterization; uncomfortable patterns that range from "mysterious and noble" American Indians through to the "stuffy but sadistic" a British officer. Miserable and shameful execution of an exciting period in American history. I want my money back.
