I came out about 6 movies all my life. It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I do not know how I sat through an hour of it. I must have been in a coma that night. I saw it in the theater when it was released 8 years ago. I could not even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must be really influenced me to waste my time commenting on it today. Yech! Vomiting! Barf!
