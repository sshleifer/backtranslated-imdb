It is not just that it's a bad film; it is not only that four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers in the film; and it's not just that terrible scenario. It's just that ... this movie sucks ... big time. These people spend money in horrible scenarios. This should make the criticism of Mexican society, but we are tired of this kind of films. It is assumed that funny profanity? I do not understand. Mexican cinema in big trouble, if any kind of movie is going to continue to play (and writing and production) <br /> <br /> Please do not think that such films are well received in Mexico. We hate them, and they do not represent us.
