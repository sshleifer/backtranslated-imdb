Too bad. Very, very bad. As a guy who is trying to do, be or - at least - to sniff catering table on the set, I believe that it is difficult to criticize the non-party who actually got the film made of any kind. However, this movie ... oh dear. <br /> <br /> Realizing Frightworld not intended to be anything more than a crude operation (honorable thing in itself), and try to make it conform to a dominant standard is a mistake. And, to be fair, it's more interesting than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not by much. So I will not try to critics, just let me ask you to throw some observations. <br /> <br /> 1) If the blood is the point of the movie, not you should be able to see it? <, Br /> <br /> 2) If you have rolled three sound men make at least one knows how to operate the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) in a horror movie maniac your host to be worse than the Smurf doll's hard I know, but really ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are a lot of talented videographers in district Buffalo / Rochester, most of you can hire really cheap. Get someone who knows how to frame the scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other interesting programs does not mean that he has to do it every two seconds. <, Br /> <br /> 6) Kudos for the girls to take their peak, but next time, get the girl, tops, we want to have removed. <br /> <br /> 7) Edit to help tell a story or set the mood. At least in this kind of editing the film must sell blood gore gags. Chainsaw suddenly appears in the character stomach is not terrible, it's messy. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things. Not all the action was bad. Jack was very good, and I loved Acid when she began to resist. There are some nice pictures, unfortunately, she was thrown on the screen, without rhyme or reason. "Acid PoptartÂ» is a name that deserves a better movie. I like the courage to Frightworld too. The next time, now that they have some kind of a film under their belts, I hope they are all connected to strive for something better than Coleman Francis. Update at least Ed Wood.
