Disney? What happened? I really want the film was created in the 60s, the book was. And I could really deal with cheap special effects to save the budget for more precise adaptation ..... I am glad that, maybe someone can affect read books but ....., The people with red eyes are interchangeable like this? And that volcanic upheaval? Where it was in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I have heard that there is a European version of the film. I am sure that I could have this ID. I can only imagine that he could be closer to the real story than this poor adaptation. This film should be marked with an X.
