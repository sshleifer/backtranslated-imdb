This guy is pretty good, but in no way they're doing it the type that Outsmarts adults and can rip experienced thieves at every turn. No, it is not so old, because he is a child with serious emotional problems. A good couple looking to adopt to get a rather duped into taking it and while the husband a little more willing to give it a chance of mother to child is not. Through a strange character, Michael Richards and always annoying Gilbert Gottfried, and you are pretty bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there. I actually prefer the continuation of this movie, I like the fact that they brought back another Yasbek more likeable character, as there is a one to many characters in this film are thoroughly unpleasant as this. Even a child rather annoying first in this, and they're kind of chill it in the future too. The plot is simple enough, though, as the parents are going to take this baby, they think it's great the way the hostel is throwing a party as they leave, they soon realize that they themselves are a bit mischievous. Add to that the little varmints get in contact with any convicted. Not sure that this character, I thought at first that this was to be his real father or something. Not all that well, but I will choose it in front of that Culkin child any day of the week.
