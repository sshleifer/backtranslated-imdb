I do not often go out of my way to comment, but for this I had to, just to warn anyone who might think that watching it they see a comedy. It does not come close. While the premise of (changes in color / sex / all) is bad enough (and it was done better, many times) the actual conversion of two black men in two white women, one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen. It would be bad enough if all that was required was to change the scenario of white chicks. However, the Wayans brothers have to disguise themselves two specific white women. You guessed it, they are not completely. I saw a transvestite no makeup to make more convincing than the two women make the best special effects and make-up people that Hollywood can provide. Its appalling. Add to the mix as a basketball player built building, terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course, and the film gets a new personal low. And I like bad movies! Avoid like the plague.
