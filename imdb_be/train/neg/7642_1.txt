Everything just seems to be raving about the subject, and do not really notice how the film was made. Deaf, dumb guy cool loser wins - it's good, cricket great aspect, but the film as a whole, on average. I think it could be done much better than this. <br /> <br /> The plot is too predictable movie that is not based on real life events. I am sure that the film could be made more interesting. The songs simply stuffed it, and I had to just forward the scene where the same will be shown from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good cast, though. Watchable.
