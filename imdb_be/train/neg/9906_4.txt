After reading the reviews, it was obvious that all of this work Intellectualized. How very boring. Oh, how about the good old days, and there was nothing like that. Of all the comments no one expressed any emotion in this work or any other. <br /> <br /> I grew up only after the end of the steam era, and this cinematic gem with Dan'l Boone graced the Saturday afternoon matinees, It was the annual film, which went around and stuffed seat with chatter, bark, farting, giggling, snot monster, as I was, I am. And it was a cinema filler at the time. Almost as great as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb states that every critical analysis contains something about the plot. The problem is that it was rather a template. Here it goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) collects friends and goes to win these evil people. Hooray! <br /> <br /> All of us children found that site before we plunked down our block to see it. It was just about the storyline of each Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers movie ever made. If you take the time to go back and review each and every film - just do not ask for surprises <br /> <br /> We have to remember the context of time .. There was not a little TV. Nor for children. It was a school. I was outdoors. There were toy guns. Cyber ​​lot of time. And it is time to age just collapsed. But such films as provided entertainment, and filled the representation of young whippersnappers. Even the girls got into it. <br /> <br /> This movie was fun. And it is just as pointless as anything produced today. It was a goal originally be propaganda. But quickly came to be children of a movie. <br /> <br /> Our fathers have experienced the real thing. And it will not be until Sam Peckinpah ten years later, who finally handed out red spray fake blood in a realistic and rich amounts. Nia until his directorship did someone dies slowly, with great pain and bang. By Peckinpah war and gun battles were quite bloodless affair. Thanks to Sam. <br /> <br /> In order to see the film there was little or no blood, adults did not mind. They would not survive, I think. A lot of guts spraying crushing plant life. So this film was all glory, and none of the mountain. Gung Ho is suitable for children, then. <br /> <br /> You will find that I have appointed four in this ranking. Why would I do that? Well. This is a terrible movie. No matter how much I love him. I love this movie, because he has brought one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But this is not all that good in the film in terms of quality. Basically Gung Ho transitted become a love story for children. <br /> <br /> When people watch it. Of course. I'm not saying to stay away. Realistically however. The plot is simple. Symbols shallow? they shallows. You can love a bad movie.
