Eleven "big" filmmakers, eleven pieces of debris. Eleven minutes each pure boredom, sophistry, indulgence, pampering. Treats for all peoples. Youssef Chahine Egyptian gives "Hip hip Hooray!" For terorism in his amateur segment. Across the Green Line we have Amos Gitai Israel, using its eleven minutes to show an act of terrorism and focus on the dash speaker. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico focused on the twin towers, but seemed to have forgotten to include his camera. Sean Penn is not knowing that there was no building in the shade for 9-11 Shopping Center. Japan Imamura oblivious to it all. Claude Lelouch focus on trivial and clichés of love. Ken Loach UK focus on Chile. Etc. etc.
