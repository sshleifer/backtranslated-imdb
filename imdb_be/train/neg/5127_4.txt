This film had a huge star in it, but had a very good shot, filled with wonderful actors who support and Gene Tierney, before she became a star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardiner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwick, you would expect more from a film than it actually delivered. Most of it, I suspect that this is because of the script a second year as the director Henry Hathaway was competent and well-established people at the helm. <br /> <br /> The film is in East Africa WWII- -Just before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while the fascist subversive elements trying to stir up the locals. One of the white men in the film hypocrites - work for the destruction of the British Empire! But cute Tierney, playing the daughter of the Sultan (!), This is to help save the day for a good Alla "UK. <br /> <br /> The American filmmakers have long sided with the Empire, and the 1930s and 40s saw a great imperial films. At the present time, with altered senses, the notion of seeing happy black natives die Queen and country sounds ridiculous - and it would be difficult to implement for both sides! However, on the day, this propaganda piece was effective in drumming support for the British - even if seen today, the film suffers from a long-winded and silly script injection. One bright point in the film is the final confrontation between George Sanders and enemy agent. Too bad after such a powerful scene of the film just seemed to go on and on - to lose some of its punch.
