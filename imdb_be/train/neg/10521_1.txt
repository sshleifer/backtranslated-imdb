This film is a terrible waste of time. Although this is only a half hour long, he feels somewhere close to 4. I have never seen the film move so slowly and without purpose. This is also a "horror" film, which takes a lot of time in the daytime. My friend and I laughed insane amount of time we will probably have to be scared. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know why such a terrible film was released in very many countries. It can not be that high demand. <br /> <br /> supermodel Nicole Patty must follow the modeling, because even though she's beautiful, she's lost her accent so many times in the film, half the time she is British and half the time she was an American.
