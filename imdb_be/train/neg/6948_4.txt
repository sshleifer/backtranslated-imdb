Interesting idea (four African-American woman crushed under the heel of the shoe company will take revenge by robbing banks) devastated terribly slow direction of F. Gary Gray and painful scenario (Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full unintentional funny moments. Instead of delivering a pointed comment about the role of urban women who are trying to stay afloat in a world where people are brutally abuse and humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow concepts operatic tragedy. It is a melodrama in the worst case. Gray his actors to linger on each line tired and lazy editing of John Carter refuses slack, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the stunned faces of the performers. And they were stunned: even actors like Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox has raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth, and as an actress, she was a great rapper), they need a more robust hand than Gray to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Stay away.
