The first film is very good. This is one very bad. <br /> <br /> Recycles much footage (including the opening credits and end of the header) of the criminally insane. New footage shot on video, really stick out as poorly made. Scenes do not have proper lighting, the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible, there is even a video glitches as the picture rolling and so on. <br /> <br /> As with all bad for, basically he just repeats the story of the first. Ethel kills anyone who shares her living space, often for reasons related to their interfering with the food she wants. <br /> <br /> At least, this is just extra on the DVD for the first, which also includes a film of the same satanic Black Wedding director. It is a pity that does not include the death of Nurse movies, though.
