The film, a universal output Protelco-MLC, is a sad statement of the theory of the destruction of the molecular structure of an object, capturing him in a cell, as a "clean energy", and then send it back to set a "target area". There is no explanation as to why necessary, but professor Paul Steiner (played pothole-bullied actor Bryant Khalid, «Devil Doll») believes that it is something to select it, and his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen) lives. < br /> <br /> during the experiment before mentioned Dutch scientist «Lembach» (Gordon Heinz), ez a car is not due to sabotage, so he "projected" his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp), to take revenge. Of course, she screws up and he goes out looking like a "pork roast" with power Electrocute people. <br /> <br /> With this found strength, he manages to spare some Cockney idiot guard named lats (Derrick de Marney) and his laboratory boss, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). It is also able to penetrate into the pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat as well. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, despite the attempts of Hill and Mitchell, to help him, the clown is destroying his equipment himself. In general, it is meaningless movie without a message at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, one of the most depressing color film you'll ever see.
