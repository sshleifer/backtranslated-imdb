I remember how my parents did not understand Saturday Night Live, when I was 15. In addition, they do not understand rock and roll and more. Now that I am approaching their age, I still remember, and I find that I understand many of the things that my kids love. But it's pathetic. I can not say I saw any Sarah for a few appearances here and there, with the exception of. They were reasonable. I did not see anything special. But this show is just so far below what I was expecting from her. IMDb tweak made it sound like potential. So, just for that, I started watching the first episode. I turned it off halfway through. Everything else is better than it is. Jokes, which are designed for 5-year-old presented at the expected program for adults. Well, Sarah, this is an adult internally moved to turn you. I just can not believe that someone actually sponsored this insult comedy. Only good thing I can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes, deposited here, keeping the other shows from this embarrassment.
