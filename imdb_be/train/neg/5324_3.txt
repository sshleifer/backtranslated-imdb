Vovochka your everyday bully against the power of cinema. Little Johnny, the protagonist, has branded early as a bad influence on the children who are in the area. With words of wisdom from several adult he meets along the way, he finds a change in his mischievous way hard, but worthy of doing. Personally, I found the actor who played Little Johnny too annoying to sympathize, but the change of the tone of the film would allow himself to feel the emotional struggles Little Johnny is, if he wants to be good, but bad things still happen. This fight makes the film a little different than the other films of the same genre, it's a small flavor that I had in mind. In general, I do not care for the movie, although it is most likely intended for a younger audience.
