Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloane was a master with this film. He had a sheen to the production of the film with actors who could not act. In addition, he decided to write a script based on some bad acid trip gone wrong serriously. Put it together, you end up with a film that sucks more than the composition filled with suction cups and vacuum cleaners. This film was very painful. Pain is caused is approximately equal to the pain caused by the presence of your genitals are cut with a spoon, and then with the entire wound, covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
