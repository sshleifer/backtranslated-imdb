My resume one line should explain it all, but I'll go for it. <br /> <br /> From the get-go, this film seemed like overdone soap opera, and that's all I can comment on, there were some interesting scenes, such as "large", have fallen in the middle of the film, but wait, what's that? Earthquake * * choking, wait a minute! This is Dante's Peak! Well, part of it butchered and hit. I can not believe how bad this film was made, "borrowing" the scene of the other, better movies. Interestingly, the director thought that the audience is stupid enough to believe there are large wooded mountain-esque backdrops in downtown Los Angeles, ala Dante's Peak. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget Bond Wanna-be Nash in the movie and go for the real thing (again, someone from the peak coincidence Dante.) <br /> <br />
