I just evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids from 14 to 22 put on DVD Â«Titanic 'on a fantastic display state of a home entertainment type of transaction Article mega. Only two of them have actually seen it before. But all that they had seen the moment Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them believe that they have seen the film. Soon after began the epic, they began to get restless, some are left asking others - "call us when there is an iceberg" An hour and a half in a movie, just two girls, who had seen the film before, were still there . They began to shout: iceberg, an iceberg. Stampede ensued, they all went back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat with his mouth open, releasing a long-Ohs and outputs. Thus, just as I was thinking that if the film first burst onto the scene. What is it? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink, but what about the rest of it. Dr. Zivagho, for example, had the same running time, but think how much there is in this movie in that same time period. In "Titanic", Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the face and arms, presumably the cream in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they must enter the weapons and shooting at the ship, which is going to sink. Real drowning here cinema standards. All efforts focus on special effects and the opening of the week ends. The film went on to become the highest grossing film of all time, so that I know?
