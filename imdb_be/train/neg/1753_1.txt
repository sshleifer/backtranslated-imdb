writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer to have had a profound impact on my life as a Christian, and I'm looking forward to watching this movie and learn more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film was fragmented ... it did not give any background on his life or historical context, and nothing about it works great (except for a brief, passing reference to "price of discipleship" colleagues in the beginning of the film.) Instead, we see that he enjoys jazz (apparently, in the United States) and is resting with his friends before he decides to return to Germany. Apparently to show his human side. Okay, I'm ready for a dramatic part. Part of where he stands because of their faith. Instead, in order to emphasize that we have acted very bad affair with 17-year-old schoolgirl. Whether or not that actually took place, it should not be a big part of the film. Now ... I am still waiting for a dramatic part, or some narration explaining that his work was all about ... or something to make us know a little bit about the greatness of this man. drum roll ..... ..... waiting .... waiting ..... ZIP. Nada. This is a film that gives a "Christian film" a bad name. All they had to create a structure for the film to follow, with some background ... even some voice-overs, or flashbacks to his preaching of his works .. . some stories about who he is and where he was, but no ... this is what we got. Hardly fitting for a hero of faith.
