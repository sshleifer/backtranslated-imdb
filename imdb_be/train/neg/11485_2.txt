Siren Siren is prohibited based on 2 Playstation 2 (as many 2s) games. Like most video game turned movie, I would say that the majority does not translate to a different environment very well. And it is for that, too painful. <br /> <br /> There are quite a prologue that explains and establishes the preconditions for the history and the mysterious island where the writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (June Nishiyama) come in motion. Farmers do not look too friendly, and fairly quickly, the sound of the siren gives advice on the island to stay indoors after the siren starts wailing. <br /> <br /> Of course, and slowly things start to go bump, and our brothers and sisters go on beating around the bush mission to discover what is happening on this island with amazing unfriendly inhabitants. But in fact, you will not have to worry about what is happening, as folklore and fairy tales throw to convolute the story even more. What was really pushing it to a bad comedy are inadvertently misplaced his out-of-the-norm moments that just drew pathetic chuckles at his stupidity, yet he did not explain much later. It is one thing trying to come up and present something reasonable, but another thing to do it convincingly and with loopholes covered <br /> <br /> Despite this, with a clock frequency of up to 90 minutes. - I think it's a horror film phenomenon is, that as the execution time of the test - give it that feels almost two hours with its slow build-up, to say what he wants. Things start to lift towards the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case of too little too late. <br /> <br /> What saves the film, he changed tack and his revelation at the end. Again, this is a common device used to try to pick up a seemingly simple horror film to something a little extra in the hopes of wowing audiences. It turned out very well, but leaves an unpleasant aftertaste, as you will feel cheated a little. There are two ways to turn make you feel - it is either to build a movie to a memorable level, or provide you with this feeling of hockey. Unfortunately Forbidden Siren belonged more to last <br /> <br /> Grace is his cinema with his use of light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be that obvious. - it's still not worth the time, so it is better to avoid it.
