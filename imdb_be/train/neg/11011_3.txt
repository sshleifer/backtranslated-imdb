A series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day. Not as mind numbingly awful, as they say, «Freddy Got Fingered" or «Lost Reality", but it is by no means the approval, in any case, feeling or form. Features worst rhyme clown ever. Any thing, if it is not offensive to anyone but the most prudish and politically correct. It also has the worst song parodies EVER put on film, the worst incarnation of Arnold EVER (not only put on the worst film, worst literally). I have no idea why Karen Black, Michael Clarke Duncan, or slash to stay in this (reason I watched it in the first place) The only thing that was mildly amusing Dickman. In conclusion, I would't recommend this movie to anyone, but the people who make their mission in life to get it in the Bottom 250 on this website, are void. Do something tangible to you a person lives. In addition, if it is true, Scientalogy church hates him, he can not be all bad <br /> <br /> My Class .: D
