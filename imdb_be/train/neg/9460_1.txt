This film made me upset! When I think about the Cat in the Hat. Im thinking Cat in the Hat books. You know, one of a number of years because parents are reading in thier children. Well, I, however, that this film will be very similar to! But to my surprise, there was nothing like a book! InstEd it's more like the young adult film humor. In one part of the cat is talking to garden (hoe) cat talking to him, as his hoe (Agin-adult humor). naming his car so I though it was a bit untastful to film children. a rating you will find: soft Cude humor and some double entenders. I think that in general, it means that the adult humor. I would like to return this film! Wali showcase said that they do not because the film opened. If you are thinking of buying this, I believe that perhaps rent before you buy.
