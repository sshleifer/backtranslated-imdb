the only thing that often pops up in my head as I write this review, I'll never get that hour and a half ago !!! to show that I'm not just blowing air, I will compare the film with other films of the trilogy of the cube (the cube and hypercube)! cube was not great, but it was the original, and that made for some technical flaws! hypercube as a continuation of lost the advantage of originality, but it came out looking pretty sharp and I even liked beter than the cube (the story was better)! Cube Zero but compared to its predecessors is really not worth shit! the complete absence of a good FX, very f * ck * d up the script and just plain old bad actions do not go well together! Example: at all times during the movie, I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... going to happen, and then it will happen, so it's not very original either! My advice: do not lose that half hour I lost !!!!!!!! oh, and I hope that this film crashes and burns !!!!!!!
