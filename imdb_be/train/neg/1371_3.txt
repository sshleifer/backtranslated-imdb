I can not understand how anyone can get the budget for the film is bad. It's like a TV station desperately for anything, anything at all. They are buried under a pile of snow, electricity is constantly blinking on and off, but magically have the background light that remains constant. Where is all this (fake) light come from? That's all that stupid disputes between the characters. They seem more interested in complaining to each other than to try to invent ways to survive. It tries to create a feeling of emergency and helping people. But because it's such a bad directing and acting, you do not fix your Florence Nightingale with this movement, I'm sorry. I subscribe to the negative feedback, and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever.
