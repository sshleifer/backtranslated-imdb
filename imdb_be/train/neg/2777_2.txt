Unfortunately, it was a show on Star Movies here in Thailand for the last week or so. This is complete nonsense action. According to another member, this film is a good example of "how not to act. I have not seen the movie so badly acted for a long time. The actors (you can call them" actors "?) Is completely flat and deliver their lines with enthusiasm dead dog. I would say that in order to really understand how bad acting, you'd see a movie ... but it would be like torture. <br /> <br /> I cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines and the remainder of the cast with their accent (or fake invention) equally disgusting. Another actress with padroble th British accent was pretty, yes, but good lord was her accent terrible. Combine that with her (lack of) action, and you have a hardship. It should not just say anything, and I could take it as a beautiful girl. Oh, we just got to the scene where the leading lady lover says:.. "? I actually" after being forced out of her crying scenes are ridiculous No, actually, I just laughed <br /> <br /> a lot. and art director offer some saving grace of the movie. Some of the sets are colorful and some scenes are pretty good (minus the actors). <br /> <br /> The old magic potion lady? What?! Another participant noted, "modern" love song that was in the movie. Totally unsuitable for the part of the period, established about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was considered "big-budget" in Thailand during their production. I would seriously upset if I was the producer of this film. Just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) film. <br /> <br /> I would give King Maker 1 out of 10, but the costumes and scenery make the save the film from such a rating. 2 of 10.
