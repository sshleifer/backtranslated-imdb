Boy oh boy, oh my gosh gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing in the film was fun with Bluescreen effects used to create the mother "invisibility". They looked like they were filmed on a cheap video, and it looks completely unrealistic, and not even in a good sense of where it's so funny that you will end up loving the movies ... <br /> <br /> I'm not to end likes this movie. Accepted «Steadicam» shots were really helpless as well. I mean, hey, if they had a low budget flick, it's okay. You can still make a great movie with a low budget. But, bad movies and low budget and effects. This makes for a bad combination. In this case, this is bound combo created craptastic film "The Invisible Mom." If you have kids, and your kids do not have a taste, perhaps they will not sleep through it all.
