There are a lot of comments that have already been written say exactly how I feel about this movie so Ill keep it short <br /> <br /> Â«Grinch" I thought it was fine. - Jim Carrey is really talented physical comedian, as well as being a universal smart actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughter, being annoying. I loved him very much in his "Waynes World" and "I Married Ax murderers" days - but I never loved Austin Powers and "Cat in the Hat" has just finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible - Gag were terrible! unsuitable for children, not only in the adult content, but also in the fact that some of them were so surprised by them is not someone for 50 years! The plot was dirty, dirty, dirty! Its a shame really, because the kids were very nice, as was the "mother". They probably could have chosen a better villain than Alec Baldwin. - but he could have pulled it off if it were not for Myers ugly, revolting acted portrayal of Cat <br /> <br /> I mean - did Myers even look at the script? There was one written? The rest of the actors seemed to be one - but the cat just seemed elated by his <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would note that the sets and props were amazing !!!! But, unfortunately, they can not save this movie <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Seuss. - the man was a genius! Dont ruin his reputation by adapting its work in such a lazy, dirty way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
