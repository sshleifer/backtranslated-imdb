Everyone does what they later regret. What they want, they can complain to the drugs or other people's possessions. The fact that, though, it seems reasonable at the time, later reveals itself engraved invitation to misery and endless accusations nonsense. <br /> <br /> For some people, that the signing of the new notes for a Hummer, for others this gathering to a hitchhiking slaughter, for others it is still sending your bank account information, third-millionaires in the world mysteriously strapped for cash. <br /> <br /> for me it was a movie. <br /> <br /> D-War: Dragon Wars in retrospect, I should have known how to clean and thoroughly reworked this film will be from his stuttered and repeated names. But with my willing suspension of disbelief intact and naive belief that results from cool looking poster in the lobby, I really wanted this film to work. Unfortunately, by the time the old man in a pawnshop explained the whole backstory, fifteen minutes into the picture, I had a sudden revelation that sink, which comes from the knowledge of each point of the story is still an invisible film. And worse :. I knew how much each point will all suck <br /> <br /> Let me very clear here, in English there is not enough shade and depth of field of the ultimate evil in order to properly describe how bad the film really is. <br /> <br /> As for knowing all the turns of the film, I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla movies, whose scale of this one is not worth it to fill, it is convenient to germinate once the sub-themes each time the protagonists are a threat to the ghost of a constructive dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was infected hair, gorgeous shoots and concentrated deposits of poorly explained sums. <br /> <br /> This movie, what would happen if you gave accesses the powerful Morphing Power Rangers protect the national budget. . And a lot of alcoholic beverages <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain <br /> <br /> Imagine that you could get a hold of all the cool-looking set of details of successful fighters of the last decade .: First take stretchable says amphibians Army with Star Wars Episode One Prozac and remove them until they are ready to club Navy Seals. <br /> <br /> Next, take a close approximation of Keira Knightley and Tom Cruise (You can even call him Ethan as "subtle" hint at the Mission: Impossible franchise.) and give them a lot of noir storytelling, so that no one confused, trying to adhere to the depth wading pool their thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally, add the raspy voice of the villain in a pointed armor worthy of the Lord of the Rings yardsale and a pair of giant cobra, angry that their scenes are removed from the latest edition of King Kong, and put them all in any order in modern day Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Now run to the pharmacy to find something for your sudden migraine. When you return, puree these ingredients, while some forget a hint of originality does not dissolve into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve as a semi-gelatinous. <br /> <br /> At several points in the course of this, I found that I say out loud, "Stop making a bad movie" and intruding into tears. <br /> <br /> To call it a B-movie will give him an undeserved promotion. After summer school, and a lot of physical therapy, can possibly go for the C level of the film, if you would like to sleep through most of them. <br /> <br /> in short, if you've or find themselves with money and brain cells to burn, and the need to punish myself for the disgusting, unspoken sins against humanity, Dragon Wars m well just be the movie for you.
