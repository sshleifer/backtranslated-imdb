This film is a joke. I mean "ha-ha" funny anecdote. Why? Because only redeeming thing about it was I laugh at the sheer absurdity of wanton, senseless plot and hardcore action. Wow! <br /> <br /> In this film, there are so many unanswered questions ... for example; why these women have become zombies and how? Why are there four black women, zombies "wipers" and what is their purpose? So when 6 people make up zombie "nation"? And smeared black eye mascara "scary" to anyone, anywhere? Even 2 years <br /> <br /> And finally; Why this film was made at all? Why? Why? Why? No answer? That's what I thought <br /> <br /> The channel demand they are actually issued the comment after the synopsis of the film. We apologize in advance for this film Â»LOL At least they had the decency to do it a lot.!
