I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to see how I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of his early films. <br /> <br /> The film is about a girl (played by a young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who moves from New York to Los Angeles to get over her recent loss problem. Short after moving to a guy who falls in love with it, it becomes obvious that it is an evil twin = double that haunts her. <br /> <br /> The film is quite poor and bad. And the dialogues and action makes the film really is not worth seeing. To summarize it is just something for the fans of Drew Barrymore.
