This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen. I was actually expecting a bad film, but I was surprised to believe or not. The storyline is a traditional, all clichées included. <br /> <br /> dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when otherwise half of the descent actors try to make it sound real. Photography is not too good, the music is so malplacée it really made me angry, the actors do not even try, Altho script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people who have been in force for 30 years, and the so-called action scenes actually possible not lack of "action" itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why these types of bad movies keep coming, who finances this shit? Where screening? And why on earth actors to take on this mission impossible scenario? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood movie in this genre, even without striving to reach theaters, but even their Straight To Video stuff is actually manages to look professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can not do anything positive about it, except the name, which explains what everyone says, I feel consuming 2:00 of my life.
