I read John Everingham in the story years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking that it was a great movie to make. And it probably would have been Michael Landon never got their hands on. As I understand it, Landon was one of the worst players on the ground, and his art has licensed the way from the top, like the massacre of his book series "Little House" is proof. Actions due to the lack of a better word, it's disgusting, sloppy script, and there is a larger manure Landon than should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This film reflects Everingema story as much as "Little House On The PrairieÂ» reflects the books was "based" on. It's just one more car to show Landons monstrous hair.
