Prom Night 2 is a horror film kami, but prom is better and it's a movie about how Queen Mary Lou Prom in 1957 killed her boyfriend and returned 30 years later to revenge.The best actor in this film, and Michael Ironside movie stars and other actors and actresses are OK, Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon You, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I) .i have some good scenes Gore as when Mary Lou kills the girl who is trying to hide in his locker at crushing lockers together and as one of the students on the computer, and Mary Lou electrocutes his death.Over all these QA / good horror film, and my rating of 4 out of 10.
