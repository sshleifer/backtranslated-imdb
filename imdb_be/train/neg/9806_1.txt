I can not for the life of me explain the popularity of the children's television show, Power Rangers is all. <br /> <br /> I never understood why the unsuspecting children love the show, first of all, because the characters seem to be idiotic, and not have to worry about at all. <br /> <br /> costumes looks quite disgusting as colorful spandex that people wear to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> what the purpose of the show, in any case, but also for the children to learn how to fight, to solve their problems? What a terrible hairstyles and clothes on the show anyway? Not to mention this show still plays on cable television, only to make money, to teach children how to deal with each other, if they do not agree with a particular problem. <br /> <br /> There's a much better entertainment for today's children, I hope they are not as trusting as children of the 1990s, who watched the show. <br /> <br /> Yes, and that homo erotic tension between the red and green ranger anyway?
