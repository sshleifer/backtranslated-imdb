Let's just say it in simple words so that even the creators of this film may have a chance to understand: This is a very stupid movie with dumber script lame animation, and a story that is about as original as thumbtacks. Do not worry - if you do not need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally handicapped adults or children very slow. They can laugh, especially if they are from their medicines. There's a special kind of icon in the movie that's funny - not just the filmmakers seem to think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with the nonsense that are close to zero effort, but they did not even bother to break sweat insert gag here and there, that an adult may find amusing. The film, to be honest, ticks me royally. Ashamed of stooping so low.
