Want to know the secret of making slasher set in the fitness center work? Just cushion film with beautiful ladies in a super tight workout clothes and have them bump and grind the floor as they are a gentleman club. That's what the makers of this terrible slasher done and that little trick I kept watching until the end. This is the worst slasher I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to change the channel, they add one more scene with training the girls, and I would stay. The slasher killer workout falls into each category I can think of. As a showcase for beautiful girls design, it is a success. Strong recommendation to avoid, if the thought of half of the film is not a big T & the show appeals to you.
