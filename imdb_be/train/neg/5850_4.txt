Nelly Shipman tried to land lead to the pursuit of the final in the "Back to God's Country" last year, and it failed miserably. This time, she's doing better, although it seems pointless. "Something new" is unlikely to have a site that is outside the chase. There is a short space, establishing character (co-skipper and friend) to have to save the girl (played by Shipman), then nothing but exciting, incredible pursuit there. Of course, he plays like a hour Advertisement Maxwell Sedan, but the entire movie congruously funny. It does not seem that she has learned a lot from last minute rescue D.W. movies Griffith and his parody of Mack Sennett and other comedians that she simulation. <br /> <br /> One of the attractions is that Shipman writes and directs himself in a film as the author of the film's narrative, which has the writer (Shipman again), although it does nothing as its protagonist more clever or humorous with it, despite the fact that she was trying. Again, others have pioneered a joke writer intertitles as Anita Loos with «Wild and woolly" or Francis Marion "The folly maiden" (both 1917). At least Shipman gives the impression that it does not take itself seriously or movie - and neither do I. «Something New", despite his assertion is a template.
