You know how sometimes you can see a crappy movie with friends and laughing all the shortcomings of the film? Well, it was for nothing. I bought a DVD in Tower Records, because it was like $ 3.00, and I heard that it is a movie that you could laugh. It is in fact nothing missing miserably. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends have been asking me to turn it off. About 45 minutes later, they asked me to. An hour later we compromised to fast forward to the end so that we could see as a conflict (and because we are watching all the time for Matt Walsh) has been resolved. Seriously, do not watch this movie. This goes beyond painful.
