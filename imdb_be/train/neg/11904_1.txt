The end of violence and, of course, the million dollar hotel hint at the idea of ​​Wenders lost his vision, his ability to tell compelling stories through the moving image card. Land of Plenty seals the coffin, I'm afraid, being very prosaic obviously sentimental and cliché'd film. The characters are completely equal and stereotypic, writing, story and direction is amateurish at best. For the first time in a long time, I was looking up to the end of the film, so that I could get in my life. War nonsense uncle, patriotic abstract, looking up into the sky at the end ... it's all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic, hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some strong magic on screen. What happened? Days of experiments, which receives letters and interesting possibilities of shooting long behind him, I'm afraid. Let us hope that it once again ... finds its inspiration in the Toronto Film Festival, where I saw the film, Wenders was there to introduce it. It is not enough humility, he offered us: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know that you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid that he can not be more wrong .. .
