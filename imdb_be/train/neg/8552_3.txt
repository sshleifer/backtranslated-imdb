... just look at the bad character Robert Webber (great performance, again!), Who is trying to fight a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists. Everything in this film seems a bit wrong. The biggest mistake, in my opinion, is an attempt to give the effect of a solid basis in reality at the beginning of the 1980s (a fundamental difference between this movement and much more fantastic, ironic and, therefore, out of time Die Hard). History emerges as an unsuccessful attempt to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas, as though commando shouts ?? upside down "all the good guys do it all the bad guys is not so that they can make noise spur of the moment (with a clear conscience), that the main character does not get mowed down gas masked commandos, although he wears the same clothes, and carries a gun with their arsenal just seems unlikely and make it difficult to take the film seriously. and it just so happens that he is trying to be more than just fun. not to talk about the toilet-mirror signal episode ... <br /> <br /> I do not mind criticism of the pacifist movement, as a shield for the villains, and disputes between peaceful and sedentary fanatics, even led the authorities in this film. But political commentary rather lame and inspiration. This is unfortunate because, as the film features an early performance of Judy Davis. She plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive research on this subject ?? ". Anyway, its cutting performance is higher than the other, and somehow I feel that the film left her.
