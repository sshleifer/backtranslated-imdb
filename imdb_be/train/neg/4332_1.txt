This film is a poor attempt to make the original fans feel full. One thing that people forget the fact that the reason why the original has won this recognition are strictly to do with the fact that he was supposed to make you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the toilet. I'm not a negative type of guy, but a person who acts in this flick Sun .... No comments yet. The plot was a poor reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante, and I wish I had two hours of my time and my money is spent on this film. I still love the original and will do everything possible not to allow the film to destroy my opinion about it.
