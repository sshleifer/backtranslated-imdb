Columbo movies went downhill over the years, this year may have reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes as terrible in this film. As usual in this series, reports the crime scene are unheard because credibility is never enough. Brenda Vaccaro chews scenery and pulls the face of mime and Andrew Stevens is quite flimsy womanizer. (His weak, though, was a hoot!) The script was numbers and delivery condescending. They were never to bring Columbo in the nineties, just left us all with one or two happy memories reasonable portions, better script and sharp characterizations.
