Jean Seberg was not one iota of acting talent. Like all of her movies, "the Bonjour Tristesse" suffers not from her appearance (although it may be the first of those modern women who joyfully Tom Wolfe, accurately describes as "boys with breasts": publicists, of course, to use the word "perfidious"), but it is difficult to suffer from a dull, monotonous, which kills SEBERG voice in. In all his films, when he had to play angry, Seberg played with roughly audible, distracting, gasping, panting between her monotonous buzzing verbalization. . Oh <br /> <br /> Preminger adaptation of breath minor, fantasy soap opera story of Francoise Sagan distinctive only for its superb cinematography - but then it is difficult to fear photogenic French Riviera, and, perhaps, appropriate for him, but, of course, not innovative, use black and white for the present day scenes, of which monotonically SEBERG story brings us to the broke back to color the past. <br /> <br /> Juliette Greco has a short time as a nightclub singer in black and white spotlight, bringing in a smoky voice Dietrichesque harsh existential title song lyric. This moment is now, in retrospect, more than a little Drole. Except, of course, if you are French - especially if you are French "68-er" longing for the glory days of the barricades roundabout Sorbonne - and your children a revolt to save a lifetime sinecure, which rot and emasculated France's economy: if you still believe in Sartre and Foucault, and all such secret, irrelevant theorists <br /> <br /> David Niven is the most difficult part, you have to play with enough gusto aging hedonists, which has to understand that life ISN ». t all about the concept of teen saga hip, cool, Swingin ', "with copain!" Dad. Deborah Kerr delivers his usual masterly professional presence, convincingly plays a woman who is suffering unjustly vicious snot-nosed teenager SEBERG jealousy (suits shallow teen fantasy saga classic themes "can be only one queen bee in the hive"); in fact, Kerr owns only big and memorable screen moment <br /> <br /> this film Dialogue unnatural - I agree with the previous reviewer who said that it sounds to be "badly translated as" in French on '. combine unnatural was much dimmer intolerable monotonous SEBERG and you can save this valium another night Above all clumsily synchronized post-production dubbing voice, in many respects, it is obvious, and therefore, much more than annoying:. it especially true for dubbing Demongeot because it it spoils an otherwise very pleasant dumb blonde performance <br /> Hunky Geoffrey Horne gets the short end of the stick here <br /.> - a very handsome young man, who also suffered from a less than perfect, uncinematic voice, which, when paired with the drone SEBERG in gives unconvincing scenes puppy love. (Horne was, well, just adequate in "the Bridge on the river Kwai", perhaps because its end rests on those big movies pro William Holden and Jack Hawkins instead be unsupported on sadly untalented Seberg). <, Br /> <br /> as a result of «Bonjour Tristesse» pretty to look at, but it's shallow, immature soap: a thin paste with foam.
