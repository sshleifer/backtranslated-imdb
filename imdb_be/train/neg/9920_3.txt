I love music and I love the Clash music Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of this. But I left the theater without knowing a lot more about Joe than I did after reading the entries in Wikipedia. The movie never really gets through to the man, his thoughts and feelings. What they did was to gather some material that they had shaky blurry video and interview some people about Joe Strummer at the stake. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all, and that the director just wanted them in the movie to have a few more celebrities say, "Oh, he was such an inspiration to us all." Like It or Johnny Depp (which they seemed to have asked that his pirate costume for the benefit of its current success in the Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director could not even wait until the body was not cold before he jumped to sell their version of "the greatest punk and hippie at heart" who ever lived, sanctifying the people, not knowing enough about it. <, Br /> <br /> Of course, being a fan, I loved seeing the image of the group, listening to stories of the songs and such, but in the end I felt what was left, as a portrait of Joe Strummer could easily have been said in the 60 -90 minutes . <br /> <br /> Go see a movie, if you are a fan, otherwise it is better to listen to music or even better Clash undeservedly unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development, before his death, the melting of all his rich influence with a strange sound.
