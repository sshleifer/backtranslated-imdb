Dr. Seuss will surely be angry right now, when he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how the film production can take the classic story and turn it into a meaningless pile of goop. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, is a big mistake! Myers argues that he can not act in this film. It acts as a prissy girl show with thousands of tricks up his sleeve. Children in this film all right, somewhere between the lines is boring and annoying. History as well as the original with a couple of tweaks and, like most films based on other stories, never touch up with the original story! Bringing in an evil neighbor Quinn was a bad idea. He's a stupid bastard, that would never get anywhere in life.This film as rejected comics from the newspaper, if you think about it. The film is sure does look tacky! Of course, there are jokes for adults, how, where cuts of cat tail and leave the censor before he said a naughty word, mildly funny. At least the Grinch was a tinder, and the film was really good! This movie is a cartoon piece of snot with bright colors and poor mediocre acting. Mike Myers was even in the film actually? And one more thing, the fish. What's wrong with this stupid fish! The first time you see it, it is the actual fish. The next time you see him, he is animated and talking. But it looks like a piece of rubber animated game test! This movie is a general hastened to ruin. A good joke, a bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised he even had good jokes, like a water park ride a joke, it was good. So please, if you have the choice to watch Grinch instead of this mess.
