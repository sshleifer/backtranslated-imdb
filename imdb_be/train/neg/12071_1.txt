Awful ... just awful. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen some pretty bad paintings for many years. Sound sucks the same picture quality, the direction that act ... etc, etc. The only good shoots (which means funny, because they're so bad) are the special effects. Overall, there are about 5 minutes worthy of laughter. The rest of the wave gives brain damage.
