Vietnam vet decides to take the backwater town run amok, and any one who steps on your way avoided (including women). Released in theaters shortly before «A Star Is Born», which turned his career around, this action drama mishmash starring Kris Kristofferson wildly faulty, thoughtless and mean-spirited. Filmed in Simi Valley, California, the results are really indecent, of the cattle stamps and senseless violence does most of the script directed by George Armitage. Armitage has collected the most interesting «70s, cast for his film, including in January, Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and, in a few, Loni Anderson; However, in the center of it all is Kristofferson, who are rude and rough everywhere. He deserves points I believe to be completely unsympathetic drive in a thriller, but the bad vibes (and funny climax) coats the entire project, as the ugly stains. * 1/2 ****
