I happened to find this movie on the shelf under the "new releases" and found the idea of ​​hip-hop zombie flick is too interesting to pass up. This is how it was put up on the field, anyway, and I thought, 'What a great idea! "Plus there is" Welcome to Oakland "sign on the cover too. How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part lasted only as long as the opening theme. No hip-hop music or hip-hop culture has a big role in the movie. Living in Auckland alone, I know that there are many beginner hip hop artists out there, so this low-budget flick, there was no excuse not to have a decent soundtrack. Any number of struggling artists would jump at the opportunity to contribute to this film. Quiroz Brothers Why not take advantage of this, is beyond me. <br /> <br /> After the film was rolling, it was quite a typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and Latino. You may think that this will put a unique slant on the movie ... but it is not. Anyway, the vision Quiroz Brothers "urban culture" is reduced to the accompanying shootings and dropping F-bombs on each line in the film. Using rapid-fire word "to fuck" is probably the most distinctive features of this film; were single line containing the word three or four times, and no rows containing it at least once. I do not neglect the battle of the movie, but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the authors (also Quiroz Brothers), and the script was generally very poor. <, Br /> <br /> film was generally disappointing. It would be interesting to see, really "urban culture" zombie movie, but "Hood of the Living Dead" does not deliver in this regard. Characters in the film could just as easily have been white or popsicle or something else. There was no clear taste for cinema. This is just another low-budget film mediocre with bad acting, lousy letter amateur direction, soft film, low-cost soundtrack, and nothing at all to recommend it.
