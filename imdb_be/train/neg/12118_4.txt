In 1972, after his wife left to go their own way, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a good-natured, long hair, beautiful, statuesque beauty queen on the charts to fill the void in Elvis' life. If Elvis divorce became final, Linda was already in place, how to live with a friend, and hitchhiked to 1976. <br /> <br /> This is the legendary singer gaudy look at their love affair and communication. Linda selflessly tending to the needs and desires of her lover. And even putting up with his swallowing handfuls of medication and introducing her to his love affair with Valium. Sometimes this film a harsh and dark heart; very unsightly view of "the King" and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely awful as Elvis. For the actions of the handle is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist lacks the classiness of Linda, but does the job very well. Supporting cast includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee, and Rick Lenz. Watching it twice is more than enough for me, but do not let this review stop you from checking it. For most fans of Elvis that I consulted, it is not a privileged view.
