Positively awful George Sanders car, where he goes by the thief king police. <br /> <br /> While Sanders was a wonderful character actor, he was not, of course, not a leading man, and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> this is absolutely the bullshit. Gene Lockhart did provide some comic until the time of anger led him to fire a gun as a result of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-star Carole Landis committed suicide in real life. After creating a film as sad as it is, it's not shocking. <br /> <br /> Average attractive Hass really nothing here.
