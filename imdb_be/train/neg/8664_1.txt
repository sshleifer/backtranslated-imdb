It's just a joke from the movie, they've lost me already on the scene opening (Spoilerwarning) dangerous creature kills another creature in the cage, it is watching a scientist who works there on the screen, and I think it does, but let in the cage to check things out , the OMG, how dumb do these people think authors have come Thats the same as jumping into an aquarium with great white shark, because he ate his gold fish ... pretty useless, and even more, I'm not stupid .And talk about the cast, because they are not worth the effort. why do not they fired the guy who wrote that as soon as a mystery to me ..... And it's a kind of numbness continues the whole movie. Only good thing where the OIG that better then average for this sort of low-budget films. <br /> <br /> If these interesting things do not bother you to see, but keep in mind, if your IQ above 60, you probably hate.
