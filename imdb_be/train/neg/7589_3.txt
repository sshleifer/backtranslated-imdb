What do you expect when there is no script to begin with, and therefore, anything that the director can work. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin good actors, they just do not have anything to say or something to respond. Even an earthquake was quite poor. And I do not know how accurate the film follows the romance, but two of them Jewish girl appears out of nowhere just to show that Arthur has a pleasant, warm heart, but some stereotypes entirely amount to anything. And he even hides Camilla in the desert, rather than her back to the memo for a good Catholic burial, where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Helpless. And many L.A. was funny graphic created. Anything good? A window in his apartment a real sense, the curtains, the sounds of the wind. And Donaldson is always great. He was of the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, depending on what it was.
