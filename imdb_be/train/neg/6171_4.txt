Well. it was not a surprise. Many people will tell you that it is a mountain. but they all say «shiztz» This film is very slow. <br /> <br /> He begins to have some bloody scenes, but I found them kind of weak with some guy who makes a concoction not feel any pain, he calls him "my son." You can also skip 40 minutes of the film and get to eyeball the scene, which was surprisingly impressive and dreary. there are some really stupid in this scene. and they duplicate of hits and slaps with silly fake popping sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. keep looking gore dogs. <br /> <br /> check it out if you want, like 20-10 minutes of the end of the scene, which still is not that amazing and has a random scene guy tries to rape his mother .. yes it is weird .
