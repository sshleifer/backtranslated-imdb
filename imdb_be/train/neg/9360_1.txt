My rating for this shit: 1/10 1 only for maintenance. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another film that makes no sense. Clearly, it seems that to create a good script for a movie or TV almost impossible. <br /> <br /> While it's easy to understand why politicians do not tell the truth, they are one of the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make movies so pathetic. <br /> <br /> We have to believe that to take people for idiots. Perhaps this was the reason to believe, as 99% of the crap movies. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenario. <br /> <br /> When you look at the price we give Oscar, we can better understand why we continue to make films more ridiculous than the other. <br /> <br /> And as strange as it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to this s ** t, press the Super button Fast Forward (at least, 20X).
