The expedition led by Captain Brown hard worker (Mark Dana) goes to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to the previous expedition. They meet a mysterious beautiful Simira (Tsiva Rodan), connecting them. Soon, they find themselves faced with the drinking of blood mummies ... and only Simira, seems to know what's going on. <br /> <br /> real snoozer. I caught it on TV late at night, when I was about 10. He put me to sleep! Seeing him again after all these years, I can understand why. It is sedentary, mummy did not and is not up to 40 minutes (and it only takes 66 minutes!), Range from bad (Dana) to very poor (George N Sea) and there is no violence or blood can be found. This film focuses more on hysteria second speed (with silly love triangle) than horror. <br /> <br /> It rates three stars, because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays it right, there are some good performances from Diane Brewster, this brief scene and the mummy attack (all three of them) are not bad . They are not scared just a little horrifying. However, this film is very bad. Sure-fire cure for insomnia.
