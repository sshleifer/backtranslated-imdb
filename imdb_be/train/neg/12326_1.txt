Woman (Christel) seduces 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but this is due to some silly story or something. <br /> <br /> Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. Does anyone realize this film makes the world of child molestation? I believe that this is normal, because it is a teenager - if we had one with a man seduces a teenage girl would be (rightly) to be outrageous. Sorry, but this was done, the boy does not justify it. It still hurts. I understand that Brown was age (he was actually 18 years, if it was done), but he looks 15. I just find it disturbing that some people think it is OK. <br /> <br /> The plot towards action sucks (Kristel beautiful --but can not act ,. Brown easily one I've ever seen the worst child actors) and the constant nudity gets sad and not even remotely erotic <br / > <br /> I've seen this nonsense in the theater back in 1981, I was 19 and my 14-year-old cousin (who could easily pass for 18 years). He wanted to see it - I did not, but I decided, what the hell? We have received, and I actually bought tickets to the three teenagers who were obviously underage. My cousin thought was sad and three other children left midway! Let me make this clear - Three teenagers left the film with tones of female nudity! This should give you an idea of ​​how bad it is. I am surprised that it has ever produced. A 1 all the way.
