Man, it's getting a lot of good reviews in a book review. Frankly, I found it very slow and ugly from the start. I kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam, but this did not happen. This film is highly overrated. <br /> <br /> not Shakespeare, with the Synod of English, has not turned to me, anyway, so it might just be me. There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film, because they show Ronald Colman plays the role of Othello <br /> <br /> In the good moments of the film include -. Thanks to the updated print - some decent cinematography and young, slim and attractive Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's just too boring, too much repetition in some scenes, to see again. In addition, we all know that most of the actors are nut cases, anyway, but kudos to Hollywood to showcase it here, in this story.
