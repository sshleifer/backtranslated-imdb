I see what people are writing about how great this movie was. It was awful! The acting was subpar at best. He made a lot of money, because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in theaters because Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I would like to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, it was running through the minds of many people; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone understand that some people do not even get on the ship, because there was a fire on board, before it even took off? No, not because of anything you see a rich girl falls on the poor boy, and he paints her naked (so corny stuff at least you tilt, the movie was stupid?). <br /> <br /> I cried during one scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that filled the ship. It looked like the pool water! I think this film has made all this money, and they could not even make the water of the ocean looks real? incredibly ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh band played on while the ship sank .. It's ridiculous. It was the worst film to Pearl Harbor entirely surpassed him in "Nothing to do with reality" department.
