I just saw this movie last night. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see him only because of the Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel like I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend that this is the last time we go to watch a movie just because some actor / actress in it. I hope he's a lot of lessons, because I had trouble keeping her in a chair. How can I, as I had paid already, I would like to see an end, at least, only in the hope that something good would make, but I do not hold my breath, and fortunately so, because I would be the victim of a film in the same way . <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film, it is black and white. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as its registrars, and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the poor among them were really, really bad. Says clich√©s and operation of a typical American phobia. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere action was good as usual, but the blonde who should replace him Wishy was diluted at best. Quite unconvincing to work. <br /> <br /> The film tries to use a popular theme and gives it a low-cost, dramatic and sensational twist, that is simply unrealistic. They just used the sexual crimes as a reason to indulge in cheap violent acts of killing, vigilante beating, rape and torture - something that seems almost gifts. They even have a wolf attack on humans in the film - how low you can get <br /> <br /> I collect the film is not released in the United States and will go straight to DVD .. That was it had to stay in other countries, and because Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show. Believe me, without Gere, the film is not worth even a series of B-movies.
