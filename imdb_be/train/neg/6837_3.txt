As a rule, I do not like movies revenge .... PERIOD. But double strike has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise. You see, the DI has the effect, precision, exotic places (ie. Hong Kong), skirmish strange, and martial arts enough to satisfy your thirst impressive fighting. Like all where you click, that is, the villains you would like to throw out of the window plate glass on the top floor of 40-storey building! However, double strike has none of the sensations of shit that inhibits the plot and elitist, racist and poisonous social stereotypes, breaking into "an eye for an eye" and "Death Wish 2". <br /> <br /> But in the plot department Double Impact is transparent, Sarah wrapping. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a mob hit squad linked to other families with money problems, or at least that's what I thought. An explanation of why the boys said in a French accent a lousy one. It was not a watery story that made this movie bad, but the use of clich√©d lines and moves from other movies (from Lethal Weapon in The Princess Bride) actually made it worse. But, nevertheless, double strike is still watchable. But why is this shitty movies, as it is the villains (eg, greedy British guy who killed Chad and Alex parents and a lethal lesbian ginger chicken) you would like to hate every fiber of your being?
