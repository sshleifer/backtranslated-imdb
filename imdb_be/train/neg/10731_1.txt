The film is basically the history of Russian prostitutes return to her home village in sister / friend's funeral. There are a few other minor subplots that can actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully utilized. The core of the film the funeral, wake, and then the debate over the future of cron community that make the doll and sell them to buy vodka, but now missing an artist who made their dolls on the market. Apparently, the film unedited. hooker journey from the city to the village painfully endless train ride and a tramp through the mud. Maybe this should impress us with the enormity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, such as it is, populated by a legion of widows and one man, the wife of the dead girl. Continuing puppet business is problematic for all parties, and in the end, it seems impossible. Most of the film was shot with a handheld camera, which can cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers that subtitles do not include songs and laments of the crowns. Do not go to this movie, if you do not speak Russian.
