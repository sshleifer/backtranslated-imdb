Well, I like the gore in this film - it genuingly unsetteling. Anyone who's been to the dentist will know why. The story is actually not so bad, motivation character Burns makes much more sense than most horror movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse acting, directing, script, etc., but at the end of the day it's still a bad horror movie. So it boils down to, if you like that sort of thing or not. I tried to see the sequel, but it was exactly, exactly the same as the movie. Just keep in mind, if you like people getting tortured by a dentist, then this movie is for you!
