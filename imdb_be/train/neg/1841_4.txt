This could be seen in different ways. This movie sucks, it is good or it is just amazing. The third one, probably explains this film better. He has a strange topic and just has an amazing story. Who else, but Christopher Walken will play it, no matter how bad, or even average, how good he can be. <br /> <br /> The action was what one would expect, especially with Ben Stiller. Jack Black, I've always loved, so that you know what you get from it, but it's not bad. Christopher Walken is always away from the wall. He was always nice to not have to look, no matter how bad the film. Comedy wise it is somewhat ridiculous. This, of course, means that it has its moments (albeit very little), but can get a bit over the top here and there, which makes me feel like a movie just desperate for a laugh, but certainly not in a good way . <br /> <br /> guide was average as well. Barry Levinson directed slightly overestimated and did not really do a good job here. This film, it seemed that it was a lot more potential, and he did not do a lot to get to it. Just very average and does not give as much effort was put into making this film. <br /> <br /> The writing is the key to good comedy. Obviously, this means that the writing was not possible here. At best, it is below average. Considering it has its moments, it was not too bad. It's never a good thing to say about the film, though. <br /> <br /> If not, Christopher Walken, and this is a stupid funny ending, I would give it a lower rating. He was always quite a character in his films. Stil is simply exhausted strange film with amazing characters that do not really go anywhere. Not really terrible, but I would not recommend it, though, because it is a very forgettable film.
