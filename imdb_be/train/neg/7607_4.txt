- If the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over as long and is determined by the city cleaning. Not everyone in the city, however, pleased with what she was doing. If the sheriff orders curfew in the city, the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires a hitman to take care of the sheriff. There is no way the owner of the interior could have known that the sheriff and the killer will love <br /> <br /> -. Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have quite an interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There's a good movie around here trying to get out. In more skilled hands, or with a big budget, Shooter can be entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie <br /> <br /> - There are just so many things wrong with the film :. The supporting cast, with no acting ability, stilted and unnatural dialogue, as well as kits that look like a lot. But the biggest culprit is the editing. I was amazed at how many times the scene will begin with the actors (and horses for that matter), obviously waiting for Corman to yell "Action". The best scene of the two riders on horses just standing next to the building. Suddenly, they take off and come racing around the corner, as they were riding hard for a few miles. Or take the example of people who are seemingly transported themselves through the city. We see a man enter the building, and a second later appear across town to sit on a horse <br /> <br /> -. It's not as if Korman did not have some decent actors to work with. While none were big stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Allison Hayes was able to turn in a good performance. But, Gunslinger, they do not give a lot of work with <br /> <br /> -. Now I have seen how MST3K and not-MST3K version of the film. I would highly recommend going the route MST3K.
