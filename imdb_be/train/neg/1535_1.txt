I do not think you can get much worse than that. Put together bad actors, fake limbs and three silly stories, and what do you get? This B-rate meaningless excuse for the film. <br /> <br /> The first story shows just the poor quality of the video and the acting just very poorly, especially when you bring in 25-year-old posing as a grandmother and grandmother bun usually beat by ear. In addition, a person, that's fine, but she is quite ugly. "You look great!" NO! Werewolf in this was the best one of all three, I would say, but it still is not impressive, as it was all bad suit. Face of a woman later was enough for Halloween, but for a decent werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you go through the worse it gets. There are two lesbians in the next, someone entirely backward it inappropriate. The whole "I want to be a werewolf, too," "How could you do this to me?" It was silly to say. You asked him now to get over it! The werewolf will not even talk about ... your rat! <br /> <br /> third one does not make any sense ... almost forty-five minutes of running and sad story make this history and the entire switch things still do not make it interesting. Sad! <br /> <br /> Music, Yes, bad ... who I could not hear some part of it was silly. Pets effects were either rats or pigs as it was foolish. They could not use the sounds of a lion? Guess NO GOOD movies use. Well, I = If you enjoy B-price is good for you. I got this movie, because I am an avid fan werewolf and I will be buying any werewolf movie and watch it more than once, but that's just me. If you prefer good, do not waste your money. I beg you!
