"Confidential" part was designed to piggyback on the popular appeal of lurid magazine of the same name, while working racket theme related to the headline of the day congressional investigations. However, despite the A-Class B-movie actors and some good ideas of the script, the film stretches along for several minutes 73. This production of cheap-jack all the way. What do I need to off-set the poor production values ​​for a view, especially from the uninspired filmmaker Sidney Salkow. Several shots daylight location, for example, would help facilitate the continuity studio boring sets. Stylish pilot as Anthony Mann could do something with a thick ear material, but Salkow treats it as a regular salary exercises. Too bad that the typical low-key style of Brian Keith does not work here, meeting as soon as wooden and lethargic, while a cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. passes over the top as a wild-eyed drunk. It is obvious that Salkow is the director without any actor. But you have to hand it to this small number of daring Beverly Garland, who sees her role with characteristic enthusiasm and dedication. It is a pity that it does not respond. My advice-- miss it if you are not integral funny girl, who do nothing else but to overturn the whiskey in the straitjacket of a typical 50-vogue.
