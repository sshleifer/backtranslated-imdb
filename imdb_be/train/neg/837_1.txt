I have seen and loved the first two lots, actually. Especially, the second is not just an attempt to make another one as good as the first. And it is a story that stands alone. You do not know the first film. I liked that in the film "Free Willy", too. <br /> <br /> But the third ..., here is absolutely useless! I tried it with my friend because we both liked the first two. We decided to stay after a good half an hour. The film is good, there are funny parts in it well. But why? Timon and Pumbaa are funny creatures in the first two films. That Lion King 1 1/2 to me: hard trying to get even more out of the first film than it was already, plus tell the story from their point of view. But why? I would really like to know. You know, the idea of ​​the two of them sitting in a movie theater watching the first, very nice. But what happens after basically not necessary. I think many people loved Timon and Pumbaa, and so I am actually. However, many parts were really built with an attempt to be funny for me. Not coincidentally, most of them were not funny, at least for me. Btw. it was a movie about anyway? Was it a) of Timon and Pumba, or b) an attempt to get more enjoyment from the first film? I tend to choose the option to, and I am very disappointed about it <br /> <br /> If you would like to see similar stories :. "The story behind the xy", you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. It's really funny and not try to get more out of "Hamlet", that is.
