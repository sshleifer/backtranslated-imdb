This is one of those movies that are interesting to look at from a scientific point of view than from the entertainment point of view. I do the ratings are based on how much I enjoyed the movie, or entertaining, so I give it a 4. If I had to rate it as a training film, though, would be to get 10. <br /> <br /> He shot in a very interesting way, as a pseudo-silent film with elements of sound effect and reality. It is meant to convey the obscure memory and fragmentation of the mind, and it is interesting in this regard. <br /> <br /> However, the film has many elements to it disgusting that I did not find all that interesting. They basically just disturbing. It has some very interesting pictures, too, and some interesting concepts, but some of the character of relations (especially between mother and son) are quite alarming. <br /> <br /> In general, this film will either appeal to you or not. For me it was interesting from a scientific point of view, but it was not good to watch, and I probably will not go back to him a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10, if you are looking for entertainment. 10/10 from the scientific point of view.
