It is exciting to terrible movie. It makes so little sense that it begins to make an appearance amazing inner logic of its own. Well, it would if it were not not keep rushing off side oil until eventually floundered under the weight of his own indecision. The film can not make up your mind whether it is a straight forward "Man Turns Monster" Flick (as well as all the 1950 "Incredible verb liner ING MANÂ» movie) or awful big business conspiracy theory movie, or a mystical afterlife contact history, or ... or what? Choose. It's just a mess. Grotesquely over the top and shooting in all directions, leaving loose ends flapping everywhere. It was as if Toba Hooper David Lynch took a pill. Unfortunately, he did not take enough.
