Anyone who thinks that this film has not been evaluated for its comic genius should have smoking with two Stoners in the film. This film is not underestimated ... it's a bad film. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparisons between this film and the Naked Gun or plane, since the latter two films are well-written and funny. Class Reunion is none of these things. The sad thing is that there was a potential (a good cast, good story lines), but the good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that were supposed to be funny come off more annoying than funny. In Stoner guys vampire blind ... NOT FUNNY. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> National Lampoon made some really good movies (Animal House, vacation), but this is not one of them. Of course, I expected more from John Hughes.
