In short, this movie was sad. It lacked life and sparks. The big problem with the two wires. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry at all. He was bored and irritated. <br /> <br /> visuals are interesting, but they did not enhance the scene. In any case, as a rule, visual effects, to separate the audience from what is happening on the screen. None of the action sequences did not feel real, and thus the film can not create any real drama or sense of danger. <br /> <br /> The film had potential, but he needs the best script, the best acting and best director. I kept thinking during the film, you know, the film will have to work when Harrison Ford was Sky Captain, Karen Allen Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to critical offer for this film. Criticism, I think, praised the film because they want to * like it, and want it to succeed, even if it is not on so many different levels.
