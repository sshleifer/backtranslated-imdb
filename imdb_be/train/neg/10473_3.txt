I went to see Omega Code with a group of other Christians for a total of about 15 people. We have all been waiting for, a good chunk of the Christian movie. What we got was excruciatingly painful, stretched, and rather dull attempt to film. He has a good looking production values, but also has bad acting, weak script with lousy dialogue, and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes, we all knew that this would be a long night. We all hated it, and some people in our group put this film as I gave more cheese than "Anaconda". None of us could believe that the film lasted less than 2 hours. Flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can not keep this bad, bad movie. I would give it a 3 out of 10, and that a high rating only because I was shooting disgusting "film" Werewolf (1996) on the night before I saw this movie.
