What is this shit? My little cousin took it, obviously, for too girly DVD art and the name ... I decided to watch it with her so she does not get bored, and I'm sure that he was shocked by the terrible quality. <br /> <br /> The first action was awful. They seem like an amateur reading off Key Card actresses. Delivery subpar and very formulaic. cuts scenes were terrible .. it looks like they took it right out of the storyboard, if there was one. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the jokes and stereotypes they were not original or played well at the World again, very formulaic. I can not count the times I have been able to predict the next anecdote. I got a few giggles, while spending outrageously "thin" sexual innuendo. Cat, Beaver patch Hung Wong? .. c'mon! .. Just stay away from this movie. It's not pretty, it's not funny, it's not even funny, stupid. It's just a silly silly. It's like a children's film programmer unwanted sexual innuendo, vulgarity and violence raise the rating of the MPAA. Stay away. <br /> <br /> «Would you like to ride on a yacht?» <br /> <br /> «This is what they call it now?" <br /> <br /> »you would have to go Dinh «<br /> <br />" Oh, I think I have blood on my chair! "<br /> <br /> Poor played, sir.
