1985 six-hour Italian mini-series of Franco Rossi of Quo Vadis is a very curious beast, creating an absolutely convincing Roman world a shot at actually mod (very few blows, no big Cityscapes), but to play the drama down so much in favor of hints of classic literature and history that history continually gets lost in the background. <br /> <br /> shift structure (most of episode one is played by voice from the letters), and the lack of narrative urgency makes a full six-hour version at the same time demanding and undemanding, and of course, all too often uninvolving, but he has something going for it. Two key strengths Petronius characteristic (in gratitude christened Frederic Forrest, whose own voice is almost certainly flatten his dialogue) as a man who has been looking for an astute corner to survive court life, he did not able to experience emotions and Brandauer unique take Nero as a wannabe actor whose every movement and action is calculated as his "audience" gets it. Elsewhere, Max von Sydow appears briefly in a few episodes, were rewarded with the most spectacular and really moving stage show here that he meets the child as he tries to leave Rome. This is the kind of thing the show could do with more, but it seems too often to smooth out all the emotional potential that inspires or exciting moment under his relentlessly restrained direction. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Francesco Quinn makes strikingly anonymous hero, blending with the walls going up and less like a Roman officer, than this quiet, slightly goofy, but harmless guy who works in the same office as you, who never speaks a lot to the party office - you know who you think is called Dave or something like that. Budget constraints are very visible once his Lions Meet the Battle of Christians and Ursus bull restrained so strongly that he simply passes over you before the show abruptly loses interest only, and suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> not a trip I particularly recommend, I'm afraid, but if you stand on it, this is not without small rewards.
