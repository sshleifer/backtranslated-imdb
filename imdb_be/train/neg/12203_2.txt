I think that this time, John Rambo to move on with my life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series does not age and Rambo is no longer a soldier, but deliberate murder. Since that time he appears on screen someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be, and to be honest, I'm tired of Hollywood, making it seem like it was. This is not the worst of films about Vietnam, that honor goes to John Wayne Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo carry about 50 cal Machine Gun, taking on what seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus very many Russians, it is an insult to watch. Worse yet Rambos cheese at the end of it ... please !! Oh yeah, I heard that they do another one ...
