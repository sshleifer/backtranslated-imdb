Not to be confused with the above average supernatural thriller "hour." The sight was a big bore of the movie for me, not providing consistent action, a pair of critics promised on his back. It seemed to me that everything was Halfassing, and only there to make some quick cash, because it was very much like a TV movie. Caretaker rehash of some of the best films like «In The Line Of Fire» it has no originality in it, and watch the Michael Douglas to run, I felt stupid interesting in my opinion. The main problem again is invalid, it should be poor rate. I often distracted, trying to watch this movie, despite how long run remained, more than once. Not only miscasting with Eva Longoria, who was unable to convince worth a lick. <br /> <br /> performances. Michael Douglas, as a rule, a reliable actor, here, obviously, going through the motions. He was not convinced, as a man on the run, or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger, was also excluded. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here it is not only good, nothing more than that. He tries to come across as rude, but could be softer, then something else, and to be honest, it does not seem that interested. Eva Longoria Parker mediocre. It is not convincing in his role, and it was pure eye candy. Kim Basinger is quite scary as 1st lady. She looks bored to tears, and its role is cast aside, more than anything else. Martin Donovan has a big role in the end, but not enough to make a difference for me. <br /> <br /> The bottom line. Caretaker yet another political thriller, I'm bored to tears. He's too old, too tired, and most importantly the lack of effort sucks. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
