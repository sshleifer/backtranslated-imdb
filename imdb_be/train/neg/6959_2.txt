I went to see it a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that the movie ... for the wrong reasons. This film has to be funny, it's not, no laughter in the theater (perhaps for jos√© Garcia and Gerard Depardieu), and it's a sad, sad, sad. It was even hard sometimes to understand what they say. They just talk fast and not to open them is enough for us to understand. I was with a friend, and more than 4 or 5 times, I found myself saying after the line that was supposed to be funny "that he said," and I am French. I do not want to say that, given the the fact that I think good movies made here, but I apologize in advance for all the foreigners who go to watch a movie (if ever shown outside of France). <br /> <br /> We are "deeply sorry again that cr @ p. 2/10
