I can count (one side) of the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is not one of them. <br /> <br /> The endless chase scene, dull dialogue, and terrible gaps in the continuity of the film made in an excellent choice for ridicule on MST3K. <br /> <br /> This is the only way I could look at it ...
