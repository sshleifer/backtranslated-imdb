This movie is terrible. You really do not need to continue reading this review. If you plan to watch it, suffice it to say - no (if you do not learn how to do a good movie) <br /> <br /> To act is terrible ... serious amateur hour .. Throughout the film I I thought it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find that it was actually him! A new low, even for him !! <br /> <br /> The story is horrible. People who argue that it is an original or a good, probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standards of Hollywood action clicks, it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see !!! Go for a run, and not - at least you will not feel like to kill himself.
