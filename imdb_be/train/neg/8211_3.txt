I read the book "7 Years in Tibet" by Heinrich Harrer and was fascinated by it. I immediately grabbed the DVD and started watching a movie. I remember the first time I saw him back in 98, I kind of liked it. well, now I have watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based. and I soon realized how wrong it was all said: <br /> <br />, as they enter the Lhasa people begin to poke their tongues from their mouths and Thewlis and Pete had the impression that his way of saying hello in Tibet, so they welcome back ... in the book Harrer explains that inserting the tongue is a sign of absolute obedience and loyalty in Tibet, and they can do it in front of the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for the two Europeans! not only mothers, but even the Dalai Lama himself wore glasses in public. in the book Harrer remembers that no one in Tibet was not wearing glasses at the time (sorry forgot the reason, but it is explained in the book, too) .the young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone, and nobody could see! and what that Mao Zedong counterpart, destructive mandala before the young "living Buddha" ?? childr ... and individual Harrer and Aufschnaiter Tibetan clothes are not European designer suits! Why are so many events that actually occurred are excluded from history, just to fill the time with a fictional love interest (female tailors ...), it does not matter? as well as the entire history of harrers son, Rolf. not a word is mentioned about him or any member of the family in the book Harrer. but it was good for me, because "7 Years in Tibet" is not a book about human harrers. its about Tibet. I am very disappointed with this "accommodation" with the famous book. I bet Heinrich Harrer was also ... 3 stars, only for the movies.
