Siskel and Ebert were terrific on this show if you agree with them or not, because of a real conflict of their individual professional opinions generated. Roeper took the show down a notch or two, because it is not really a film critic because he replaced the caustic for the self-confident. Now that Ben Lyons comes on I feel like I'm watching "Teen NewsÂ» - you know that children's news show, arranged by children for children? Manckiewitz not much better. It is obvious that they found only a steady diet of mainstream films throughout his life. The idea that these two rank amateurs have nothing of interest or consequence to say about movies ludicrous. If they consider non-formula film, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they just believe it "misleading". Wait - I think I understand ... ABC owned by Disney ... Disney make films for children. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper have contributed to independent film and were amazed or disappeared only with more production studio budget - what a surprise: two guy loves big studio hack, and only manage to tolerate a few indie. Plus, everyone knows, the age group of TV advertisers sought. The obvious nepotism icing on the cake. In some alternate universe, these guys are qualified as film critics?
