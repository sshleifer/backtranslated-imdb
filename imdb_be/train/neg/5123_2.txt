Interestingly, 90% of high-vote surveys consists of all "accidental * username *" with "United States" (without state pride ??), who all said more or less the exact same thing, with exactly the same grammatical style all with the same total absence of taste in the film. I would like to delve further into this suspicious trends, but, unfortunately, this is a review of the film, not the reviews. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I, as a Christian and a true avid movie fan. This means that I have seen a lot of movies, from good to bad, and can sincerely assert that Facing the Giants, in fact, not a good film. She has good intentions, but are not able to meet the many (if any) of the basic standards that I associate with the quality of experience filmgoing <br /> <br /> The Acting :. Basically Terrible, edible at best. Upon hearing that the majority of them, apparently, volunteers did not surprise me <br /> <br /> The dialogue :. Awkward, cheesy script comes off as a long version of a bad skit you see made in Sunday school or youth group function. The Rave Review Robots aside in the absence of "meaningless words", but the harsh truth is that these words are part of the real world, and a complete lack of sensitivity. Let's just say, on average, Ol Â»head coach in the state championship game will have much more to say than" OH NO! "When things do not go his way <br /> <br /> The plot :. oddly predictable. It was noted that the film "is not a Hollywood stamp", and yet this is how it was pulled directly from Creation losers Sports Movies For Dummies (including compulsory quasi-romantic plot to give) and just Christian-theme coat of paint slapped on it. I do not lie or bragging when I say that it was almost all the basic details in the plot and the story immediately tied to their creation. Only those who have never seen a decent sports movies in general, their life will be emotionally mixed history presented here <br /> <br /> p zhysorski / editing :. He was also a model almost exactly after the birth UNDERDOG sports movie template. However, the acting side, there were many notable discrepancies, so at least facing the Giants technically competent <br /> <br /> Ask messages :. Jesus, and He will forgive all your wishes. part of me was hoping that this film will end eventually team defeat to really emphasize the whole "If we lose, we praise you" part, because in the real world, you will fail in one way or another time, and it's good to be in ready for this. But in the world Facing the Giants, if you fail, obviously somebody screwed up or deception. Another interesting question, which is that when the eagle came across the other team, which was a religion? Will they get caught in an endless cycle of great games and a last-minute rescues, or the universe would just explode? <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: For the hardcore KHPA Parents crowd lamenting Hollywood vices Facing the Giant will be another mediocre-at-best Christian films keep on the podium as the preferred model for the modern film industry. For all others, the effects will vary from the boredom of a burning desire to see something else. And a warning: Any attempt to show this non-Christians do not lead to the treatment, but ridicule. I give it two stars, one by one scene that had me rolling my eyes, and the other for the main technical skill on a low budget.
