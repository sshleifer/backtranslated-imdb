Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a bunch of Mr. Moto movies. However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio has "jumped the shark", so to speak. This phrase indicates that the TV show was his prime and executives responsible for the decision to revive the show, radically changing the formula. For example, «The Brady Bunch» they presented an annoying "Cousin Oliver" and "Family Ties", they introduced a freak child who has grown for six years only one season! With movies Moto, they jumped the shark by introducing comic, because they thought that these smart films need to be re-embossed. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played annoying Wrestler. And in this film is the character Archibald Featherstone. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic ever, you kept in the hope someone (preferably Moto) would have killed him just to shut it !! Despite the fact that he has to work for the famous Scotland Yard, it shows all the intelligence and ingenuity of the brain is damaged turnip. Again and again, his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre looks frustrated as he stands and looks the jester "act". It's so bad that it really destroys what could be one of the best motorcycle movies thanks to a clever plot. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the crown of the Queen of Sheba is detected in the first stage. Moto, now more international police than immoral, it originally was on hand to protect the valuable item from theft. In a great twist, a few thieves trying to steal the crown all independently from each other. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is watchable, but also ample evidence that a series of Moto was to end here. With WWII approaching, movies could not survive much longer in any case, as with pretty Japanese protagonist simply would not have been adopted in the United States or in neighboring countries.
