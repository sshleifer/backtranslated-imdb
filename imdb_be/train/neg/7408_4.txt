I'm not sure exactly why I clicked "contains spoiler," because, frankly, not enough explanation ever given in the film to know enough about what is supposed to be going to ruin it. <br /> <br /> visually it basically delivers. Well, except for some 80 minutes throwback rubber masks of monsters. I will say now, before you look at it, I have never seen, Lordi group knew nothing about them bar which they won the Eurovision Song Contest. Apparently the monsters in this case are members of a group, to a large extent in their stage characters. Anything. Anyway, I do not know what it is at the time of viewing. I just thought that the monsters / demons were mostly terrain. Just about. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that there are half a coherent explanation of what we see on the screen, but it may actually be better off not knowing. This is probably really was incredibly lame think about it. Action keeps it rolled quite a few good enough to keep the audience entertained basically, even if half the fun factor was joking about the WTF, it is assumed that there is in this movie for sure. <br /> <br /> I gave him four mainly because I got a good laugh out of it, and also after that, as he explains pretty much anything. It must have been my mood, but I discovered that Halley's funny for some reason. Then I watch the film online and find that nobody knows what the hell, it should be about. It amused me on, and lifted my account additional point half to 4/10. <br /> <br /> This is not scary or particularly coherent, but it's very nice visually and acoustically. In general, far from necessary, but watchable. Do not expect too much and do not expect it to make any sense, and it can entertain you when you are in the right mood.
