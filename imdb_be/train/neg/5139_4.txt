Many horror fans seem to love the Scarecrow, so I'm not very popular, saying that I found it quite boring. The idea of ​​it was interesting, but it seems to drag so much. I think that the main problem lies in the fact that it is all in the dark. Sometimes horror, set in the dark can work (for example, Humongous), but the Scarecrow in the dark throughout the film. A lot of time it is difficult to understand what is really going on, and although some of the shots of the scarecrows were awful, most of them it was difficult to even see. If you used a little more lighting, perhaps it could have been better. <br /> <br /> There's not a lot of films with the participation of killers stuffed as far as I know, except for Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend more Scarecrows any day.
