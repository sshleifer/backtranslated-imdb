It has a great name, but then you will not get more than their money's worth, is actually the first 30-40mins from the movie, you might find it kind of funny, but after that the story goes from one side to the other with no particular reason, and you just can not understand what happens until action is not. <br /> <br /> all the same manufacturer (Roberto Angel Salcedo) calls it an actor, but I do not think so, it can not be called anything but replays !! .... period. A small child who plays his son has absolutely no sense to act, and I think that it was just a favor he had done or something, because he had not the slightest idea what he was doing. <br /> <br /> For some reason, making the casting they thought they could do a comic casting it, but they did not !! and sometimes tasteless cheap humor him so bad, I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> But I hope it's as bad as it gets. In order to get people to accept the DVD, with a good taste of the public, they will offer a meal with them, that might work. <br /> <br /> Mack
