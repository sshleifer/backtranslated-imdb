Skippy to "family ties" plays Eddie, a wussy "metallic" nerd who gets teased. When his favorite wussy «metal" singer Sammy Teck dies, he throws hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall. But when he later gets unreleased recordings, which keeps the spirit of his dead "metal" idol. He first gets involved with the idea of ​​revenge, but he did not want to take it, how does Sammy. What it is really not so far as its main victims just seems to go to the hospital. This film is completely ridiculous and has about as much to do with the real metal, says, «Rock Star». Well, maybe a little bit more than this piece of junk, but you get my point. And how can you be rooting for a guy who plays with Skippy "family ties" I do not have a clue. Cameo Gene Simmons in order, and Ozzy Osbourne achieves coherence, I applaud him for it, but if not, skip this one <br /> <br /> My rating: D. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless topless EXTRA at pool party
