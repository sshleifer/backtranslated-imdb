How is it possible that a movie this bad can be done. Bad actions. Bad script. Just difficult all around. This is only one bad clich√© after another. <br /> <br /> This movie actually has some big name stars in it. Unfortunately, they are singers, not actors. <br /> <br /> This film made hardly any money out of good reasons. Attractive black cowboy movies simply do not exist. It's a shame that they do not have a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> This movie actually has some big name stars in it.
