The rest of the incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars. Action is weak and sad, the story is even weaker. Spectators are asked to believe in a totally implausible and frequently ridiculous storyline and gave nothing in return for their goodwill. Not only is the film script and bad acting it severely lacking in all technical areas of film production. Staging does nothing to help the credibility of the action. Effects quite unoriginal and flat. Lighting and overall continuity inexcusably awful; even compared to the movies with one-tenth of the budget. However, all this would not have any significance in the fact that millions of families, no doubt, take the film for it's great and it's religious inclinations; and who can blame them. However, unfortunately, they will have to take the third speed of amateur cinema.
