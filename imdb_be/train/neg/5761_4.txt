Hollywood does it again. A lot of money, no creativity. I'm sure the writers were on something else than oxygen when they wrote it. Based on the previews, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you're not on the latest pop culture silly, then you will miss most of the silly humor in this film. Why waste your time. You can sit on a log, doing nothing, and more fun than the movie provides. <br /> <br />
