This film features a suitable assessment and not a bad performance by David Muir Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show along with most of the actors and the "special effects", that is a low-budget film. There's nothing in this film that you could not find in other mad scientist, the horror / comedy, or low-budget films. Nha specifically for any nude scenes or anything bad movie lovers lovers. This film is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phyllis dealers have nothing to admire as well. If you're wondering how I really can find it, you will realize the truth of one line summaries.
