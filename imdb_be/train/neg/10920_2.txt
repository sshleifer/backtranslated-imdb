This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with another comment that said that the special effects were okay. I found them very bad: he simply was not realistic, and they were so fake, it just distracts from the real stories <br /> <br /> It is possible that the distraction is the reason that I do not fully understand story .. Archaeologists looking for the "set". They did not bother to say that establish what is so special about it. It also makes clear why they are looking for it in California, while the introduction of the film takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, it takes effort to actually go into the wilderness. Home - an ancient ceremony - it looks like it was filmed in a studio instead of the desert <br /> <br /> The action level was constant throughout the film, the sun rises and falls, the sun menopause .. It made the movie look like short, and it of course, a professional for this particular movie.
