Let me start by saying that I really like Grable, especially with the "Down Argentine Way", but by the time she got around this catastrophe, she also received a "round" and open the whole movie was embarrassing. With Douglas Fairbanks starred Jnr (which was supposed to be pretty desperate) story was bad, the color is good, and the film is too long. He had some old backup in it, Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner, to try to stimulate interest, but without success. The score was bitter, and I must say that not one memorable melody anyway .... as I am a fan of Miss Grable, I always wanted to, I have never seen it!
