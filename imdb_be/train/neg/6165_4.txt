Allen is in the country (which he hates going in real life), and has a weekend with his friends - who are usually successful types of white middle-class bellyaching, which show in many of his films <br /> <br /> I. both usually find something to entertain in Woody Allen comedies, but then it really falls completely flat on his face. Even the one-liners seem to have left him. Indeed there is no plot (bar bits and pieces of cod Shakespeare) - but Allen seems to use the place to a half-mystical air that just makes thing even more brainless and immature <br /> <br /. > It just does not work on any level, and it's just a giant hole. The best thing about this movie (except for the end credits goes up), that the bad reviews seem to make him wake up and realize that simply throwing together a hastily script and fill your mates it does for fun.
