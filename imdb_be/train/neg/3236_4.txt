I recently watched the first film guinea pig experiment was the devil, and I must admit that he was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film is always included in any list of "nasty" movies, and perhaps I expected more, because the hype. The truth is, though, I did not appreciate it. <br /> <br /> If I watched it thinking, opening the text to be true ( "I found this tape ..."), I could have a little worried, thinking that it is real. Even without the benefit of knowing that it is not real, though, I think I would have worked, it really was not. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the girls reaction to what is done to it just is not what they should be. It should scream like a banshee pain. The fact that it does not mean that this is obviously not realistic. I would not want to see it, if it were real, but if it were more convincing in its action, the film will be more worrying <br /> <br /> And then there is the famous scene :. Nothing affected me at all until a scalpel in his hand. Hot oil, larvae and insides just do not bother me. I'm not saying that I was "hard"; just that I was not able to suspend your disbelief, in part due to inactivity. <br /> <br /> girl scalpel startled me a bit, but a hammer in his hand just made a hand to watch the rubber. And the final scene with the eye again, grimacing a little, but nothing else. I did not want to look away, and neither did I feel sick. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the film is more than twenty years, or maybe I'm just exhausted. However, I have not found this movie at all alarming. <br /> <br /> This kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop, like a modern art installation and as an exercise in the liberation of the characters, history, etc., and leaving only the torture he works on some levels. In an alarming piece of film, though, it does not work, at least for me. <br /> <br /> I watched Guinea Pig with my wife, which is in the "it's just a movie," bent, and she wondered what all the fuss was about. We need to discuss why I watch these movies, and has reasons are numerous, but include the desire to be affected by the film. She said she does not think that any movie can be so compelling to break it and to challenge me to do just that. I played it with a fire extinguisher scene irreversible and she was really broken. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that I have a point, except that we were both more concerned about scenes of the horror genre in the Sun film than any film so far in outlining alarming.
