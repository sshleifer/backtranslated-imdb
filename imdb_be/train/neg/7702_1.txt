I am a black man living in predominantly Black city. That being said, I have some serious concerns about the work of Tyler Perry. I understand that some people out there feel the need to praise him because he is black and is trying to portray a positive image of the culture. But honestly, I think that it was Perry White, the film would have the NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson throughout his ass. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this movie one hell of a party recently, and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil. Symbols poorly written and acted. The jokes are so bad, I really have to say something supposed to be funny. I just want to break this big pile of sh-t down. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The character may have some appeal, but no more. If the only thing she ever seems to be doing smack around children and adults threatened with violence, it is less than useless. It is not needed. <br /> <br /> The situation with his wife grinding fiance was horsesh-t. If the woman was so scared to death of her husband, why would she try to run away when he was asleep in bed. There would be no more sense for her to leave, when he was at work. Anyway, the characters in this arc are so annoying and overbearing, I was hoping that he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticks, if he did not. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are two doves. The bus driver asks a woman by a wave of her when he makes his rounds. I could not believe it. I really could not believe it when she agreed to go further with it. But what takes the cake is that the adult was reduced to throwing stones at the window and sending notes, as a ten-year-old castration of mega bitch. I do not use that term easily, but this woman had only two modes. Morose victim and psycho mom. No matter which of these two sides is shown, however, there was one constant. The bus driver was not going to get any. He even married her without sampling the goods - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there's the family reunion scene. Here we have the mother load, which includes understanding incestual taboo, ground to grind, no shirt, too musclebound, b-ball, as well as the great taste of Angela May. If these kids dragged their examples outside and called a meeting, I was wrong to wish that the oldest of them demanded of a heart attack. All it all goes to the reunion in a ridiculously easy to separate groups and then they ring a bell. If they do, all drop what they are doing and head on over to the stern talk as well, just like a pack of dogs Pavlov - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the film. In it we see abusive fiance get him manhandled old victim, and all-around bad actress. There is a impromptu wedding, where black men dressed as angels and hanging from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to see this far, except for testing the threshold of pain, there is hope that the second villain of the story gets her ass handed to her as well. Guess what, it did not happen. Instead, Perry takes testicularly challenge go out and play it safe, the end of the film a tone of forgiveness - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm sure that if this day, I could write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways of settling this film. Do not even get me started on the rest of the Tyler Perry movies. I just want to say that it is. In my opinion, as a black man, D. W. Legacy Griffith lives. The irony is that he makes it through the black man who is praised for the fact that the birth of the nation made by selling us down the river. I just want to Perry's films were dudes, so I could push them in nuts. Thanks a lot, dude !! What are you going to follow this up with a 2009 comedy about rape and savage beating of slaves in colonial America?
