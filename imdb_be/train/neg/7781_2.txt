Tough guys, sexy women, a lot of the mat, and the most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of the polluted lake. One might think that the "monster" is fun ... but it's not, actually. This star Tony Eisley and John Carradine, however, and in my book, that makes it worth seeing at least once. In an interview with «Fangoria» in 1987, Eisley said that Herbert Lines sent most of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who only sent a staff with his children Andrea and Glen (which feature a character named Andrea and Glen, especially creative place) - I get full credit. Given how terrible the end result was, Strings, probably glad he was not charged! "Monster" is the appearance in the mid to late seventies TV movie, so I would leave it in the background every so often. How fun it falls flat on his face, but as a reminder of another era and extinct type of film, it is very effective. The only thing that is missing is a car chase.
