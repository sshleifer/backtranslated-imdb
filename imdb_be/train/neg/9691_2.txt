This small hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic story about the scheme jealous young women to drive from each other by her father and his fiancée. Is it incest or just watch daughter's eyes with electro complex? What is the difference? All the characters, to Anna (Deborah Kerr), except are meaningless and disgusting. Seberg poor (I agree with "the boys with breasts" comment from a previous review). Plot plodded. This material was predictable enough for about 30 minutes of the film, which is, unfortunately, dragged a half hours! If you want to see more dresses and values ​​on the Riviera, I recommend the "To Catch a Thief" - where you'll get extra bonuses in the fascinating stories and cute characters. <br /> <br /> I love the movies for me to entertain. I personally do not care where the film is set. Regardless of time and place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some nice characters. It does not hurt when I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives, as a rule, a good performance, and so does David Niven in the despicable role <br /> <br /> «2» rating solely for Kerr and Niven, and cinema. - the rich color of the scene and murky, foreboding black and white scene. Unfortunately, a great movie in the world can not save a bad story with not-nice characters. pig's ear is still pig's ear. Thus, watching this mess was a major waste of my time.
