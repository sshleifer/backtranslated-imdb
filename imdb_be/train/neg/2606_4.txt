Drew Barrymore plays a young Holly Gooding, who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and totally destroys his life, claiming that its "double" or the evil twin, it is to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This silly horror kind of hard to take seriously, even if the filmmakers and actors themselves seem to be serious. "Double" confused, with some unpleasant dumb dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will notice that the character's name Drew drawn from the role of Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and this character's name is a play on the name of Newbern famous author Patricia Highsmith (he's actually trying to rewrite " B "as a horror film, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I believe that he deserves credit for not quite your typical horror movie. - I mean, the writer / director Avi Nesher, seems to really care about their characters, and it gives the film more than the standard plot chopper rate <br /> <br /> After a silly villain explains -The all-up audience confrontation, the film continues to pose a disgusting, because there is a climax that must be seen to be believed. This film certainly does not skimp on the gore. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Drew kills his mother in this. No, I'm not kidding. Jade Barrymore is nearby only started to violently kill. <br /> <br /> Drew always watchable and very sexy in it. Newbern comes off as a nice-full, the "good" kind of guy. But the culmination of the film should be a scene with Sally Kellerman, attractive veteran who is very professional in her one scene as a former nun, who started phone sex (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> the film mostly junk, but pretty funny at the sleazy, squalid little level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
