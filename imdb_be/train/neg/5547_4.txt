Zombie Riot (2 Outta 5 stars) No, this is not a long-lost ancestors of the classic George A. Romero zombie movie. This low-budget trash in 1936, which probably seemed very cool spectators during ... but it seems awfully routine these days. There is actually a very good scene at the beginning of a soldier firing a pistol at the approaching horde of zombie soldiers ... and a close-up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. The effect looks hopelessly false these days, but in 1936 I am sure that he had the audience gasping. History comes to finding the secret mind control ... allegedly to create an invincible army of zombies ... but later, as a means for one character to win the woman he loves. The film is just for an hour, but it moves at a snail's pace, so it seems, full, believe me! There's really not much to recommend it ... you can get some entertainment from the fake studio shots of the stars "plunge" through "the swamp." The ending is interesting ... so I would say that the film is worth seeing at least once. More than likely, you'll see it as an optional feature on some cheap "4 movies on 1 DVDÂ» compilation at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's worth the money ...
