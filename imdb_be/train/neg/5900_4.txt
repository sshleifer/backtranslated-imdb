Young and attractive Japanese get back to the wrong side of a curse, this time includes mobile phones. Different people will die before an angry spirit behind all of this is not unearthed, so basically, if you've seen over the last 2 Japanese horror movies, you can build this film in the dark with their hands tied. <br /> <br /> The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike behind the camera. Until now, I was more impressed with his low-key works as a city of lost souls, however, as one missed call lasted I missed it more known envelope extrusion Dead or living or excessive pseudo-Cronenberg Audition style. Despite many of his films, in fact empty, at least, they have advantages such as they are, or at least something to keep your attention, like Tadanobu Asano pranced in brilliant costumes, pretending to be Johnny Depp. There is not that one missed call; there is only very little credit: acting is bland and average is not very small (nothing, in all honesty) in the way of scares or suspense, and in those places, it's just downright sad <br /> <br /> Yet less. There are moments where Miike in the glacier, as a sense of humor can be traced through the soft mercantilism; primarily with a copy of the TV show of intent to the shooting death of one of the damned things, and TV programmer more concerned about his grades than the lives of girls. But other than that there is no reason to believe that Miike behind the camera; primarily his usual visual flair vanished without a trace (including his famous Mountain), although it is likely he just does not have any enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One Missed Call is not offensively bad. It's just depressing average. <br /> <br /> Miike obviously loves directing. With its huge annual output is obvious that he will not be 100% concerned about all his projects. But even with this in mind, One Missed Call felt that he was just paying bills.
