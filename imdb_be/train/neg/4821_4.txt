Feature film (it lists as being based on history, although it has a "documented" credit) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of Canada to try to find Bigfoot. (They want to grab one, and then attach the tracking device). His many scientific fetish mixed that really dumb film people heap, wandering in the desert. There are some attempts to create tension and fear, but to be absolutely honest there is nothing here worth seeing outside of some great looking shots interior. This is the perfect definition of exploitation of the film, he promises you so much, look at the snow man, but in fact it delivers very little. Only recommended for insomnia
