This movie was mostly Velvet Goldmine, when the authors of the five parties took possession of it and made it a movie tanker. The film lacks that Velvet Goldmine was what was good acting, writing, and basically everything else. The film had some of the worst writing I've seen from the Wild Wild West. It will certainly need to be interesting. I know VH 1 became a household name for them behind the music shows. which is much better than all of this, that would work, if it was for a musical episode, but there was no feel flat on his face.
