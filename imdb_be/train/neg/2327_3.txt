This motion picture is straight out of the dark dungeon Full Moon Entertainment. This production company got fame and fortune in the first half of the 90s, producing a very bad horror movies and cheese. The most famous disaster in their ouvre are "subspecies», «Seedpeople» and «trancer". None of them is not recommended, and no doctor Mordrid, actually. Hyperactive director Charles Group has the right company for your movie. Dr. Mordrid surprisingly dull and cheesy and almost a sense of humor. I saw him only because stars Jeffrey Combs. I have learned that it can have some drawbacks if you are a fan of his. For every good film, it seems that he did 5 the worst of them. In any case, the story of a battle between two ancient sorcerers. One good one who is here from 150 years to protect people (Jeffrey, how Dr.Mordrid) and one treacherous called wild. He wants to destroy all forms of human life, for some reason, I had forgotten. Combs receive their orders from the master. This "guy", there is only a pair of eyes in space. Very very cheesy, that is! Every once and a while blinding lightflash displayed on the screen, but it is about a single form of special effects, this film has received. All this is just a piece of whining and nagging and when two wizards finally face each other, it is more, before you know it ... I would have expected the wicked wizard, at least a little to resist, but nooooooo .. .. Some scenes, you can really find some originality and creativity (as in a lecture example Jeffrey about the influence of the moon on the criminals), and if you really pay attention, you may even find some very small but pleasant aspects (eg, crows called Edgar Allen) but overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and perhaps he is a superhero in my eyes ... but it is certain that it is not necessary to put on a silly Mayo for this.
