I made this film to see Amber Benson, although after reading the box, I thought it sounded like a good story ..... but the first problem was that there really was not a story ... in actually it had a story but it made absolutely no sense. Sun The second problem was not created for these characters ... yes I got that they all went to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of the film, you realize that they have nothing to do and do not like each other ... so why do they continue to get together. Defect number 3 ... a director, though, long pauses and hard shots the camera was unknown (especially with a typical uncertainty of music dubbed in) ... he was sadly mistaken. It was painful to watch, amazing actress, Amber Benson as a waste time trying to bring it back to life .... my only hope is money, she did here was put towards the production of your own movie.
