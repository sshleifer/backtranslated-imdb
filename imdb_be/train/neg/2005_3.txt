Not that I was very surprised .... movies never as good as the books that they are descended from. I can not wait to see this movie, because it's one of my favorite books, even though I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they have deviated from the story line of the book too much, and the version of the film does not tell you how horrible this house really was. The ending was different, too. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible because of some very bad cosmetic surgery. The action was unremarkable at best. Perhaps when the theatrical version was made in such a way that they should not be so much of a lifetime "for the TV movie" field, it would be better film. If you've seen the film, which I highly recommend you to find the book and read it. I doubt you'll be disappointed, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.
