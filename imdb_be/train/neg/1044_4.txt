"Youth Victor Vargas" is one of those light, family movies that you can see and do crossword NY Times at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for tacos and Corona, you do not have to "Pause" button on the DVD. Just let roll, because you will not have anything really important is missing. Many twists, turns, or voltage. It's actually not an ethnic film is a film about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to Latino. They could be of any ethnic group. He made very little difference. I saw it all the zillions of times. Just plug in a Jewish family, an Italian family, black family, or an Irish family. Simply accents and names were different. If Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton was Presbyterians, the film would have been a total snooze. <br /> <br /> It's funny that criticism here could not get the right locale. Some said that it was the Spanish Harlem. Some Bronx, Brooklyn and the other. As a lifelong resident of New York, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family had never met with anyone other than other Latinos. They lived in an isolated / isolated small enclave. Some interactions with non-Hispanics may have created some excitement, interest, or stress. Remember, West Side Story? <br /> <br /> And now often criticized for cinema. I do not know if it was my TV or what, but all the internal staff looked very ORANGE me. Appropriate, furniture, and people were ORANGE. What's that supposed to mean? And the square. really looked closely enough for me. Someone here mentioned that the old APP / function rooms were very large. Well, maybe 50 years ago. Homeowners did it to break a big mark on the 2 or 3 very small and squeeze as many immigrants as they can in them. <br /> <br /> And another annoying thing .... This is the second family film that I have seen, and criticized this week that showed adolescent "jerk." Whether it is a private sexual act need eyes? Please, have pity on me! What these filmmakers? <br /> <br /> So the "Victor Vargas" a nice little movie. It was nice for a change to see young Latino actor, given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did. But the authors let them, giving them a flat, unspectacular script to work with. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the button "fast forward."
