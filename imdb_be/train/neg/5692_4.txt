Dissapointing thriller with an interesting premise: young Mafia would have to be a killer (Chandler) should demonstrate their boss, he's a good man for the service that he went to California to take some lessons with a very famous professional killer (Beluschi). First and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee), it is quite surprising to all of them. But it is easy target? The film goes on and on this basis on the basic idea, but the result is just a bad routine; even strange twist at the end does not save the film. Good performance Chandler. I give it four (4).
