Please note that I have not seen this movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my town is smaller and does not wear it. However, I really want to say something about it. I'm actually doing research for the University for the title of Richard Morris Bucke character and would like to point out that the person they are based the main character was actually a completely different !!! Hollywood people's ideas and artistic license, which is issued, the real Dr. Bucke fully endorsed hysterectomy to cure insanity in women, and would never practiced anything, as a liberal, as presented in the film. I think it's funny to see the variety of film critics who write for the legal newspapers, who say that this film has some historical basis! The only real fact, I see it is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please do not waste your time on a film with such disregard to the horror that these women experienced at the hands of a doctor who is now famous film industry.
