this film has it all; clever camera work, reminiscent of Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone, tight action with the "heat" of explosive action movie Jerry Bruckheimer, witty dialogue with Tarantino script and epic feeling say, "godfather" <br /> <br /> Judge Reinhold character It reflects the fiery temperememt, but also shows the real emotional depth and intensity. his work reminds me of the way Robert De Niro in Raging Bull Lamotte. <br /> <br /> scene is truly breathtaking, and not as the Bullitt movie has portrayed a high octane number, but stylish car scene. Special effects to push the boundries of technology and film production within them. Independance day set the standard that this film is clearly soups, and significantly surpassed. <br /> <br /> In general, a lot of action from its list of actors (like Oscar night party invitation list!), stylish seat, gripping action, and a tight script.
