I tried to watch this stuff in the movie, when I was five years old; I've never been the same. Filled to the brim with drug-induced images that stink of the common delusion of your average shelter resident, is a "movie", despite its colorful appearance, not for people, especially children. <br /> <br /> It starts innocently enough with a bad boy who destroys his drum classmate of (wait for it) with his head through it; Yes, putting his head through it. But fear not, my friends! He quickly consoled him chirping flutes, which oddly enough, I'll give you, but still acceptable <br /> <br /> THEN :. The film turns into a combination of the Wizard of Oz and where the monsters live, but loses all "warm and imprecise" aspects of any of these two books. <br /> <br /> So, it's a seven-foot yellow cousin Barney, friend of the poor boy, and lowers it even deeper into despair. <, Br /> <br /> and to add a nice array of monstrous that carnivorous boat, a former friend of the motley crew limped grandfather clocks and doped up "dragon" is added to the mixture of chaos. <, Br /> <br /> most comforting figure in the midst of this chaos, the villain, aptly dubbed «Witchiepoo» (?). Of course, she has problems on their own, what with the obvious plastic mask narrows her expression to deal with a broom, whose gas level always seemed, at the lowest level in the most inopportune moments. As a result, one of her favorite activities was a nose dive into the pond that separates the earth from her Pufnstuf degenerate, degraded housing (I do not know where I would like to live). <, Br /> <br /> In general, this movie is terrible ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a film that has similar effects on the audience as The Exorcist, then this one is for you. Enjoy.
