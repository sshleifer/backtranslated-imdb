Bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies of violence against women. He was shot by two police officers, and then he rose again from the grave for some satanic ritual ceremonial molded wicked heresy. Women Hunt continues this zombie-demon. Donated baby back from the grave and wants maniac dead again, but only with the help of the police it came to pass ... <br /> <br /> 65-minute bloody mess of zombies ... Horny, -babies dolls, S & M, and damaged twisted police repented heretics seekers to Jesus Christ and three screens of text at the end of the film telling us that in the end there was a policeman who survived (yes, we need to know!) ... Two decent disemboweling boom can not save situation. I've seen the worst horror flicks, but this one was pretty bad too. It is recommended only for diehard fans of the genre is very stubborn.
