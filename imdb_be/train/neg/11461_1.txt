Please do not waste watch this film of +/- 2 hours of your life - just not. Especially if someone is lucky that slumbers away from you. Damn cheek, if you ask me. I was expecting something to happen - he never did. I'm not one of those people who stop to look at the part of the way through the movie. I always see it through. What a huge mistake. Do yourself a favor and go out and paint the wall and watch it dry - far more interesting. Please do not waste watch this film of +/- 2 hours of your life - just not.
