Possible SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The Spy Who Shagged Me is muchly overpriced and over hyped sequel. International Man of Mystery came right out of the blue. It was the lone star that few have heard. But it was awesome original, had a difficult enough humor and humor, always in good taste, and had a brilliant hue. The Spy Who Shagged Me was much more commercially advertised and hyped about. <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit, the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was very funny, but it is only after watching it two or three times, you see all shortcomings. The acting was good, but Heather Graham can not act. Her performance does not seem very convincing, and it was not as good as Liz Hurley was the first. Those characters who flourished in the first, (Scott Evil, number 2, etc.) are thrown into the background, hear and do not get a lot of stand-alone scenes. The film is packed with Kama. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated the fact that they completely ignored some of the scenes in the Imam. When they killed Vanessa at the beginning and were sat Vasily that he knew she fembot together. What's the point in that? They killed the No. 2 in the first, and now they return it with no explanation at all. It must be a spy-parody, I do not think that any of the characters even keep a gun in the film. It just goes down the path further and further from the point. <br /> <br /> The new characters are extremely undesirable. All Mini-Me `make fun of my size," the joke gets old very quickly. Fat Bastard is just an excuse for the gross output of humor. In total there are about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or warm up by the Imam. <br /> <br /> If it was the first film in the series, I would probably be easier on him. But the series began on a note of dry wit, and then plummeted to the level of gross-out humor. So I say, just watch this movie if you have not seen its predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me one final disappointment.
