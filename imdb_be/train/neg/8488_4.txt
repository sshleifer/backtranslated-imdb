Encompassing a virtual reality, the potential of computers, connection to the past, which continues to struggle to express their identity in limiting society, as well as exciting Ada Byron Lovelace portrayed in a fun Tilda Swinton, the film was supposed to be great. But it's lousy, terrible if you consider the potential! Action - aside from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - veers from tolerable to brutal. Construction of uncomfortable, to say the least - a modern day programmer blunt one-note character, but half of the film is used to set its character, and then, when he finally is Hell, is to tell about the events of his life, not to present an attractive story (Swinton almost pulls it off, though). You never quite know her as a real person, just icons of history grad student paper. <br /> <br /> digital effects, such as a digital dog and bird, ugly and distracting, believing that it was 1997, not 1985, and finally, the script simply bad. Poor, often pretentious dialogue - especially fights between the programmer and her boyfriend, which made me squirm - cold and distant characters, and zero attempts to create a sense of wonder. Programmer successful contact with a man in the past! Amazing! But this is unlikely, it seems, does not surprise anyone, but her boyfriend says, "Well, be careful." (Although we do not give a clue, either then or later, why it can be dangerous, and he never gives up, really dangerous) <br /> <br /> in addition, despite the fact about computers and Ada Lovelace and her love of mathematics, it is not clear, none of the participants with the script was any knowledge of mathematics and computers -. any links to these themes come across as a complete fetish that defies any suspension of disbelief <br /> <br /> a scene near the end. movie, pretty good, a monologue by Tilda Swinton expressing their sorrow in the fragility of life, but her joy in this life. Shrill, passionate and insightful, he seems to have fallen from another film. <br /> <br /> So I'm disappointed in this film, because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult film. If you find the subject interesting case, you can rent it, but be warned. See Orlando after another, much better study of gender roles in the history of a great performance Tilda Swinton <br /> <br /> *** spoiler / question: *. * <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Hell asks that her memories are not preserved (that I thought that the best scene in the film). But then the modern programmer seems to be doing it anyway, passing the memories in her little girl (hence the film's title). Am I correct that the programmer violated wish Hell, not even fighting for it? Or is it another point of confusing storyline that I distorted?
