I have to agree with the very first comment: this movie sucks really, really hard. Despite the very large B-list actor, cover of the film (for those who do not watch it on Comedy Central for the day of the week, which probably is the only exposition of this movie ever) tries to put the blame on Dangerfield but in fact it's just the salary for each was, was a comedian from the 80s. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr.? Check. The voice of Lisa Simpson? Now it can be said that the maximum acceleration was not it only a terrible film: double check. And so many, many others. <br /> <br /> himself boring about this film is that it was so lazily written already telling jokes. Nothing about this film outside of its existence is not funny. You better watch paint dry. This, of course, straight to video curettage-The-Bottom of the barrel things that still believe in the old adage video: throw the old time stars on the cover, and you get the money back off lease Considering days of video is changing, I think it one of the last examples of garbage extinguishing. <br /> <br /> Common use of the film, if you're having trouble falling asleep. This will get you there.
