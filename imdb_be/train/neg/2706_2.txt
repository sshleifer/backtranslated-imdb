Yes, people are racists. People even racist in college. This is a good time, and the problem of racism is seen many times before in countless movies. What distinguishes higher education, apart from the pack is that it deals with the problem of racism in the most clumsy and predictable as possible, oh yes, it is in college too. <br /> <br /> This film is dedicated to the problem of racism like Frankenstein has to deal with most issues, he has a head a few times in tough and sluggish manner. Most of the characters cartoon, dimensional, cartoons (lesbian feminist, angry black man) that react to the situation, so sharp and predictable as possible. Rather than challenge the stereotypes the film is overpopulated with them. Angry black people feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (One feminist even holds a sign that reads: ". Dead men do not rape" See what I mean) I do not want to give anything away, but in this movie, when someone seems shifty loners or date they rapist is likely to behave exactly as you expect them to. Changes characters go through it seems obvious to everyone except the people in the film. Large twist in the plot is dependent on whether or not enforced neo will act as violent neo. I think you just have to watch to find out what happens. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with this film, that he should be "gritty" and "impartial", but they do Nazi bad guys. I agree Nazi evil, but this is my point of view. Everyone thinks that the Nazis were bad; we are not breaking any new ground here. The Nazis have been portrayed as villains, starting with the 1930s. The film does not call into question any points of view or to make a bold statement. He's just concerned with, we all know that, in an awkward, after-school special, how, how. Being anti-rape, anti-racism, anti-fascist, and not exactly taking a tough stance on the contentious issue. <br /> <br /> Higher Education predictably, cartoon, and the word stupid. Avoid at all costs.
