It's hard to believe people actually like this dreck! I really think that children can enjoy it, but for me it is a kind of child movie parents can not bear to sit through. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and perhaps the worst child actor of all time. I will give the director of the responsibility for a child, but it was really painful to watch. Now I feel embarrassed for her, having people know that it was her. When she sang the Star Spangled Banner I had to turn the sound off - then I came here and found that they did so because she received the Star Search. I've always felt Belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his beautiful, unfortunately, he missed his brother, and that shit shows why. Zero stars.
