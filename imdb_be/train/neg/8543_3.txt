I confess, I had to fast forward through this suffering badly DVD in about 30 minutes - nothing happens and everything is already described the "plot." But has anyone mentioned the opening scene - a butcher knife stabbed through the wig and it is planted on the grass in the front yard! I believe that bratty kid did it, put it never explained. Really trippy opening. <br /> <br /> I want it to be better written and thoughtful film, because we were when quite abnormal, and a film that has no meaning, it is not "smart" movie, it's just poorly executed film. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see the cleaned up version, and if there are missing frames, I wanted to see if it helps. Otherwise, this is a strange little movie, which is best if rapidly crossed!
