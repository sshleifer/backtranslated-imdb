Shortly after watching this film, I questioned the mental capacity of each actor and actress, who accepted the role. Elisabeth Shue is commendable actress, why would it take such an opportunity to overestimate? I must give credit where credit is due, though. Some moments in the film are quite unpredictable and transfixing, but they are unlikely to make up for a vicious fighter Kevin Bacon's character tendencies, Sebastian Kane. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman, has a form of self-esteem for the account.
