Spoilers in this review is offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama should know that our hero, Lady Barbara Skelton gets raped and shot in the end. And not a moment too soon. I would throw myself on the screen, but I was afraid I'd hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original one thousand nine hundred forty-three new, titled "Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton" (I think that people are waiting for "t whine about spoilers then), was written by a woman, the English navy apron that was either troubled or cynical or both. Her heroine devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, Nothing Else Matters. But other things do matter, for example, the fact that the immediate and the only answer lady Barbara when someone gets in its way is a murder. She kills three men in five attempts. Serial fatal, it has a case of antisocial personality disorder, which should be landed her in any orgy or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays it as a narcissistic vamp, wearing so much makeup that I thought of her as Joan Rivers Restoration era (or the restoration era Joan Rivers, ha!). However, Lady B. exciting for all three major male characters-- Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, all of them do a good job, as does Patricia Roc. Of course, all three proponents to implement in the short term, that psychotic bitch Barbara, but the story keeps them in orbit, until one of them finally makes the gun her down - by accident, that means either irony or just desserts. Given the dramatic death scene of boom lifting chamber through the window and the heavens, I believe that we are called Fenya her death. But it is the first dead body, we do not care.
