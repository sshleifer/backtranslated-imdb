I saw this movie the other night. I can not even express how much this movie sucks. Drafting, voice, even claymation. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like watching 24 hours of C-Span for comedy. It just does not work. It literally falls flat around each spot is possible. <br /> <br /> In addition, the animation film is very poor quality. I know that this is a film made by one person, but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap, maybe he could at least make 1 second in the amount of ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This show may take the cake is the worst film of all time. Slave. It really was that bad. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh, stay away from this abomination. My advice: do not buy it, or look it up on the matter. Will your brain than you.
