What is most surprising about this semi-musical set in 1920s Berlin is amazing cinematography and editing. This top of the line from the First National in these departments. History moderately attractive and similar to the other two subjects Miller films (solar, Sally), which employs girl courting a rich boy and his family's displeasure, complications and final clinch. All four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the movie, and we go for long without further musical buoyancy. Miller sings the part with the children and I Think reprises BECAUSE OF YOU. There is also never to be blue, and although you are not the first. <br /> <br /> Miller is very attractive and beautiful, very reminiscent of Irene Dunne in the order and delivery. Sadly she is not dancing, as its forte. Sally is her best film, with this final as the second and affluent solar a much inferior runner. Her life was tragically cut short sinus infections to the days when hospitals and antibiotics have made such a tragedy can be prevented. It is worth visiting these films, although Ziegfeld see the top star of the twenties.
