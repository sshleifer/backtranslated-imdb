Believe me, this is one lowered the movie you want to avoid, and this is a huge fan of Denzel Washington. Frustrating part is that it is 1/3 of a great film. The first part of this film does an exceptional job of creating characters and a new relationship between Creasy and a woman, which he paid to protect. Trailers for this film, everyone remembers that she was kidnapped. Thus, I do not give anything when I say that the film degenerates into almost unwatchable mess after she is kidnapped. Whatever the director is trying to achieve, all he manages to do it makes the audience literally sick. Fast, frantic and jerky cuts go over the next half-hour, as the crisis hunts down a criminal. These cuts are so unnatural and sickening that all they do is to shake you out of the story. I am sure that the director thought it was a disturbing way to present a story meant changing the nature of crisis and meant that the other film was supposed to go. Well, he was right. The film, which was followed by a complete and satisfactory shit. The result of which is a depressing ending, which destroys even the quality of the first forty minutes of the film.
