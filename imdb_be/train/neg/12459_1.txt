Considering how much money in the budget for this film, one would expect more of this story as a whole. This can be quite possibly the most useless film I've ever watched. There has been no real progress in anything. Character development is minimal. The site promotion can be. Enjoyment, no. I'm not sure that the items were even trying to do. If you want to see a movie where the terrorists like the good guys, the American CIA bomb everything that is not consistent with our thoughts, all capitalists are corrupt, and you want to see something similar to the storyboard promotion accompanied by death, there is art. For those of us who understand that it does not take to kill a good guy to make a point, we will adhere to other films. Overall, it was a terrible attempt at cover-style plot-da-man-has-to think of the film "Ocean's 11", because not only you do not know what's going on, no one who made the film did anything. Home Alone 3 was better cinematic piece.
