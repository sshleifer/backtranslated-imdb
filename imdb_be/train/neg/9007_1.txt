This film is some of the worst shit I've ever seen. I literally got a sharp pain in his head while watching this film. CGI was terrible, and the story was just a waste of ink. character Dean Cain was Mr-Super-intuitive-I-can-figure out something, but he could not seem to work properly your own helicopter. The biggest problem was the split of the camera screen. I felt like I was watching the Brady Bunch or something, but not different people in boxes, just close the window and the different views on the same. I can only understand that the actors really need the money, because this movie is not worth the film was shot at.
