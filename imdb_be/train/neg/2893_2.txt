What should it be? Remake Fisher King? Why do we care about the character Sandler? With slow, dreary, boring, someone gives-a-damn-about-this-movie people !!! Just painful to sit through, I turned it off before it was finished. It is so obvious that Cheadle in need of assistance as well as Sandler; As I have already said, you can say «Fisher King»? And as psychotic sign function in their daily lives? We should not think that deep down, I think. Why Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to escalate into violence on him? If they were such good friends as they move away from each other? If Cheadle and in control, why he continues to seek the advice of psychoanalyst on the street? We never talked. That's why Fisher King was a better film on so many levels, and why it simply sucks. Almost 8 out of 10, the average score? I do not agree. At all. Even top films were lucky to get such a high grade point average, and this shit does not deserve to be in the same universe with them.
