Another early film by Alfred Hitchcock, who seems to have been made with the contractual obligations. As Juno and Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock had little interest in the film. There's almost no style or trade him at all. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young couple who come into some money and go on a cruise, which is proving to be a test of their marriage. Emily gets a chance for a new life with a good heart, a wealthy man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband. It may seem more plausible when Fred were not made to be completely independent, pompous ass, who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman. The pair finishes to stay together, but the film has no real reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction, with a couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry really gives a very exciting job as a faithful wife to her husband wrong. That's all you can say it.
