Just the fact that the cover is a picture of how the old B-movies should give you a warning about the quality of the film. This, however, is not a B-movie. It's D-Movie! <br /> <br /> There are no well-known actors and animals - WOW - this is the worst data of animation ever made in the past two decades. <br /> <br /> You will hardly ever see SCAAARY saber-toothed shown on the front cover. You just hear people screaming, bleeding and dying, and you sometimes see your teeth or tiger paw. This is because a fan! Maybee worth a look, simply because it is so bad. Give one and say, "This is the best movie I've ever seen, and wait for their response," He, he. <br /> <br /> The film is weak to give him Spoiler Alert! THIS SPOILER.
