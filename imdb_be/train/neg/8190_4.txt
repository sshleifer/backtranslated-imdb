My opinion: Tired Christmas comedy formula. Laughter tired and talent behind it seems to be too. <br /> <br /> I love the holidays as much as the next guy (even if I often bad case of holiday blues), but I think it is just to be a dumping ground for a handful of holiday comedies, which would be bad movies on any day of the year, but that does not make them any less painful for the season. As if we already had enough Santa Claus movies (three and * Gulp * still counting), who wants to watch a movie about his brother? In the plot, which would have been at home with Santa Claus Disney franchise (save sometimes crude humor and Santa "Small» Helper wearing a short skirt), FRED CLAUS this one-joke premise that lasts for 116 minutes. Of course, Jolly Ol »Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? <br /> <br /> It's a shame really. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could make it an enjoyable Christmas comedy that is likely to melt away with the snow, but it would be much better than that. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we were led to believe that he is really the long-lost brother, never aging Sant (Paul Giamatti), who invites his brother a good visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) does not want, and worse, an expert efficiency (Kevin Spacey) came a close eye on Santa Claus, and so close to closing. Hah! And guess who plays the mother of the Santa! Kathy Bates, of course. Elizabeth Banks Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins, one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays the girlfriend of Fred! SI do not know if I praise casting or beat it. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they gave too little to work with. <br /> <br /> As for the humor, the best, Fred Claus could come up with Santa's brother as his complete opposite, and some jokes about the DJ elf. I must admit I had a few giggles with Fred to attend group counseling for the brothers celebrities (where he joined Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the giggles begin and end. To make matters worse, the film even succumbs to sentimentality, which, presumably, to make us "feel good" and give us a lesson about "what really is Christmas." . It is obvious that there is Christmas in Hollywood is becoming as big a part of our residual Christmas shopping money as they can <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 5.
