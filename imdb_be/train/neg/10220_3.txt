First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. Promising discovery ambushes a cavalry of Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long melancholy middle part, with Candice Bergen completely miscast and Â«Soldier Blue", traveling together to achieve security in the garrison army. Bergen Miss spewing forth inappropriate four-letter word every time she opens her mouth, and looks as if she just stepped out of the 1970 Jack Nicholson movie. I mean, it supports zero interest, zero-plausibility. The third and final section includes a completely gratuitous killing of an Indian village. It's so obvious, exaggerated, to lie on the anti-war propaganda that comes just as long outrageous and unnatural. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why do not you actually watch the movie you are commenting on, and the chirping of your liberal delusions. This is not a political site, to review the movie. - MERK
