Ziab la ta'kol al Lachema is awful movie.This only superposition of scenes without a clear link.Acting also very bad, despite having a good actor like Ezzat El allayli. But something really amazing in this film, talking about sexuality, women's emancipation, nude scenes are rare in Arab cinema, even in this day. I really congratulate the director and actor for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that led me to vote this film as a horrible one, not only the script and action, but also the lack prfessionalism. This film is similar to the amateur one.We can see a lot of errors on the screen. If you want good Arab film Ziab la ta'kol al Lam one recommended.But, if you want to promote censorship of films in the Arab world see it and make your friends and your family to do the same.
