This film was suitable but it could be much better. There are some terrible moments, but not enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again. There are some scenes you can rewind and not to miss anything. The biggest drawback is that it's so predictable, and this is the reason why I rate it so low. It is watchable but nothing is no longer expected.
