Not that I do not like children's films, but it was sentimental with some redeeming qualities. M.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stewart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be surprisingly funny, but did not give a chance to this movie. Winked sugar-coated sugar and hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years. Watch Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead. 3/10
