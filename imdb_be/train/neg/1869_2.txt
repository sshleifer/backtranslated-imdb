Veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei at it again with this erotic thriller, which clearly echoes 8mm Joel Schumacher. But, as expected, Mattei made his film on a tiny budget - so that it already looks unclear when he recently released <br /> <br /> After her daughter gets kidnapped, mother enters the dark world of underground pornography because. the kidnappers belong to an international organization, which direct Snuff as long as exclusive clients pay well. The search for her daughter, not only is the mother of all of Europe, but also in prostitution. She goes to bed with some of the guys to get her keys. When she finally reaches the exposure to snuff organization under the leadership of the mysterious Dr. Hades, it becomes the greatest danger. <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about it, even if he starts promising. The problem is that the film is not so messy or explicitly, as one might expect from the director who made films such as BLADE February. SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!) Is neither sufficiently bloody and does not contain any amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention. The plot is not that special either, except, perhaps, a surprising number of different locations throughout Europe. The ending is very disappointing. Act is not very beautiful or for Anita Auer, who plays Dr. Hades except she looks and acts very badly. You do not want to meet her, as in a dark alley (or your bedroom, for that matter). <br /> <br /> In general, SNUFF TRAP only appeals to collectors Bruno Mattei films. But it's good to see the man back again steering: It was his first thriller since 1994 Giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
