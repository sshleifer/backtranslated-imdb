This film is exactly what you get when you do more than stretch their abilities, it is like a man who just went out there driving test and then adjusting them in Formula 1 Grand Prix (not I can add that the United States Grand as one might pull out due to brisk tire and you might just win), that is, how far this film falls. Now do not take this the wrong way, I like B-Movies, about half of my collection consists of a B-movie, but I do not think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film. <, Br /> <br /> First of stories (for B-Movie) is not so bad, it has potential is there to make the B-Movie brand, did not say on Friday 13th potential, but potential nonetheless. But what really lets the film down is not acting on a second, I think, everything, it's like watching QVC, except bearer on QVC, tend to have more severe sunburn. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to say that I've seen worse movies, but I can not.
