I remember watching the ATTACK, when it first came out and caught it again recently. Sci Fi Channel ran worse, but not much. Shameless rip-off of Jurassic Park, ATTACK substitutes SABERTOOTH cats to dinosaurs. And they are at liberty, devouring as many extras as possible. CGI is very bad, and the plan of prosthetic heads cats laughable. We get some baked blood, which helps a bit. Wait until you see how mad scientist who started all this mess gets it. Other than Robert Carradine, which has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Perhaps, it was shot in Fiji. Nice work if you can get it. It reminds me of all those low-budget STVs monsters that were popular in the 80s and 90s years.
