Wow! Only in the movies is a ridiculously awful could inspire such "actress." I mean, where to start? Indescibably reverse song? Pia Zadora non-expression throughout the film? The fact that, in spite of the set in Los Angeles, also known as the "land of the couch" EVERY man (and woman!) The fawning himself to sleep with Pia Zadora, by any means far-fetched? Or how about the fact that everyone in the film entirely unsympathetic, because they are either mind numbingly stupid (Pia) or clearly despicable sleazeball (everyone else)? And given that the film was written by the real "writers (Variety), this indicates a shocking lack of understanding of the film-making industry (who the hell would get carried away and kissed to the writer?) <br /> <br /> but it (unintentionally) funny how hell, though. "Break" scene alone will have you giggling, and after watching the climate "I'm not the only one who had to **** her way to the top" scene in "Reward" (everything is done in the usual suitable level actors we expect from such quality thespians like Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear Pia actually re that speech if she "won" its Golden globe. appropriate, and that would totally make my day. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you are a bad fan, Tashi camp, to give it another try the sticky film.
