About halfway through, I realized that I do not care about these characters is less; However, I was watching a little more anyway. Unfortunately, I came back the next day and finished it. I should not worry <br /> <br /> If you know anything * about the film in advance, you know that the main character will crash alive. - and the title gives a pretty good idea of ​​what will happen after that - he's going to get on the phone and call people about it! It was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (another bad plane crash Flick). <br /> <br /> I know it's an old movie, and acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today. But even by those standards, the action was uncomfortable. They were not heroes, they are stereotypes. I suspect that this film was, above all, an attempt to Bette Davis to help the career of her husband (Gary Merrill). To no avail - but I have seen oaks show real emotion than he <br /> <br /> Davis plays a happy cripple (ie, non-glamorous role) is probably seen as sharp and bold. career move. It was not. It was just boring. It was a kind of Tiny Tim in the movie, which makes Trask (character Merrill) to see the truth about love and forgiveness (even though it was less glamorous than Tiny Tim), calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband just died. <br /> <br /> in the final scene, where cod calls his wife back in Iowa, to reconcile, was so affected and again acted on both ends of the telephone line, I almost cringed. I had to remind myself that these people actually paid for what they do in this film. <br /> <br /> I've noticed a lot of people seem to like this movie. If you find that uplifting, it's great. But to be honest, I just found it to be bad. There are a lot of old movies from the golden age of Hollywood, which was much better written and acted.
