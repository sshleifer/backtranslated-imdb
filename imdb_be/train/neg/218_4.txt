*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story sounds good, and if you read the novel, you probably expect a deep and intense film that might offer some insight to some of the interesting and little-known human relations. <, Br /> <br /> However, the script tries to do this, the director tries to do this, but the main cast fails miserably. Mary's actions are so dry that there are no feelings at all, its most powerful moments seem almost ridiculous. Sometimes she seems to be nervous because of the camera. Its just really feeling the scene towards the end where she gets dumped by her friend. <br /> <br /> John seems to be even more intense than Mary, and even worse, it does not seem natural at all. Maria had to do, even if it was artificially pushes to be obvious, but it was due to her character and got some confidence. And what is worse, we have no idea about her, where she came from, how she got involved in a lesbian relationship, how relations develop? We just get some bits from their parents and their relationship just seems to be "to be" out there: it has a content and and the end, but a beginning. Just as her partner, Maria, it is only once the scene, which is really touching, the scene where she throws Maria Kiki character. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this movie (except the hostess, great acting there), which was able to prove some acting talent. He has to his character and it suits him. Only once or twice, he seems to stumble (the scene in eating his parents, he is trying to be obvious when it was not necessary at all). <br /> <br /> I love this story, Tudor Cyril normally there, the hostess actually acts and Puya says a couple of lines to the style, but it does not save the film. Too bad, the whole setup was a huge potential and the Romanian film industry could be used a film on this subject. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister, it seems more credible than NO- NO NO background-feeling (well, speaking of Mary interludes are a good attempt in this direction) lesbian relationships Mari and John. I am very sorry to spend money for a ticket, I would have preferred watching it from the comfort of my room.
