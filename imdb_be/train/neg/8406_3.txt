Memorable line from short-term show. After watching the episode, which was introduced this line of my eye fraternity flag football team began to use the line to break our huddle on offense. Instead Ready / break our quarterback said the football team and the rest of the answer you bet! A fun way to break the huddle, it was our opponents scratching their heads, how few of them watched the show. With this unique line item was added to our season that I will never forget. We had the best season of my time in college this year, and to a large extent, this was due to the fun that we had with this line. The show was pretty much a bitch, but she lives in the memory of 1977 Pi Kappa Phi eye flag football team in West Virginia.
