Only ferrous separation - and please do not ask for more details - young maidens can keep rapidly deteriorating body and mind of his wife crazy old amateur gardener in a fresh and young. Yes, like most people, except those who participated in medical research, virgins rarely give willingly my isolation, Dr. Lorenz (Bel Lugosi) arranges for them to be kidnapped and retained. He will make removing himself. <br /> <br /> What's the big cheese ball room for the film low budget horror. If the disappearance of the corpse turns out to be Havarti horror as simple Limburzher leaves an interesting aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting almost horrible for the actors, who are lucky enough to be playing crazy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played the Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome), with the exception of; its rabid beast from his brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for hair virgins; manic mother of two (Minerva Erekal); crazy wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin and, of course, the mad doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks down the doctor because of the strange orchid of peculiar sweet smell, which was carry victims. If the doctor and his wife Pat are invited to stay for the night, the raging storm breaks out immediately. This key tells us some raging violence is going to break into. Since it is well known that in Hollywood at that time all the unmarried young women were virgins, Pat may have some nasty surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, laboratory crust, which holds almost dead virgin basement mausoleum, and then, a direct threat to their own glandular secretions Patricia. If it survives, what story she would give her editor. <br /> <br /> If you try this wet piece of moldy Velveeta (why not? I do not above), do not judge Bela Lugosi in the company he keeps here. He had an enormous influence on Dracula (1931), but my favorite film of his is The Black Cat (1934). According to Dr. Vitas Werdegast he sad, ironic man protects his two young friends. When he finally takes a scalpel Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and starts to tear a person alive, ah, well, it's a great scene.
