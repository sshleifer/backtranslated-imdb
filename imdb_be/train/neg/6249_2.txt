(D # 97) <br /> <br /> There is one good thing about this poor man's Pokemon (to do that you will): the opening theme. It has to be the coolest theme music any sloppy dubbed Japanese-made-for-consumers-oh-I-mean-square in It supporters anime TV show. Unfortunately, it was necessary to add some shows after the opening theme. And they just could not come up with something more interesting than people arguing loudly about whose cards are better than other people's cards. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately, I can not imagine why any children would sit through the show, where the dialogue written thousands of monkeys for five minutes, it takes 98% of the work time. <br /> <br /> «My Uber-fantastic creature Doomsday final destruction will take your pathetic Pyramid Diamond animals in one stroke! Do not you see that you have no chance to win this battle, you fool! HAHAHAHHAHHAHA! »<br /> <br />" Oh, yeah? Well, watch it! I'm going to use my Destruction Force Delta Times Pie Card, which destroys all of your power Munchers and makes your Uber-fantastic Doomsday being destroyed in the final destruction all meaning an attack useless! I'm sure you did not see that one coming! »<br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all they ever do in this show, to talk. while B shows another shitty childhood, I look, and it is a commercial phenomenon Pokemon (every soccer mom's corn), at least had the courtesy monsters hertz it every once in a while, "Yu-Gi-Oh" is a simple, quiet words Clockwork Orange review by Roger Ebert, "Talky ordinary and boring." Not to mention the long-winded (I understand that I am a hypocrite is considering a proposal I just wrote). <br /> <br /> The show goes on forever. I do not know, there is a plot, and static monsters do not have any character from Pokemon. Even if not in comparison with my FAVE cartoon as a child this show sucks. This unintentionally funny, but not funny, it's worth a look. Goodbye, goodbye, sleep tight, dream wet dreams.
