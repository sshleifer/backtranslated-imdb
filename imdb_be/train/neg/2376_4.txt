George Brent reporter sent to interview the heiress. She supposedly heir cream fortune. He interviewed her on a yacht. They fall in love with each other in bathing suits. <br /> <br /> It turns out (quite early), it is not an heir. She is part of an advertising campaign for a cold cream. <br /> <br /> The film is worth the ups and downs of their romance. <br /> <br /> supporting cast does little to buoy him. Davis and Brent bear picture. Although it is fairly predictable, it is also quite interesting. This is far from her best. But, especially in view of its lack of clarity in her work, it is not one of its worst ever.
