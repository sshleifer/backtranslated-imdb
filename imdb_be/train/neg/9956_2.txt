I made a special effort to see this film and was completely disappointed with the result. On paper, the script seems to hope, and the choice of actors leaves one with hope - I liked the Pacino in Scent of a Woman and saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French films and other 70/80. But I forgot an important part of the dialogue can play in the film, and in this film they are absolute rubbish .....! Location filming was also attractive, but bad, pretentious and forced dialogue after all these down to the south of the zero level. In addition to this, I am very allergic to light motor sport and I do not find any interest in the sport. Even insipid dialogues «Love Story» were better than those in this film (and this is saying something !!). I really expected better from this film and was very disappointed that it was lowered so much.
