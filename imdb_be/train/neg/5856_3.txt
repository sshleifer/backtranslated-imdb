T. Rama Rao did some very beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to have a director who can not sing with the changing times, the style and fashion. He is stuck with the same old-fashioned cinema style. <br /> <br /> The actors are not bad, not good either. Anil Kapoor usually operates a convincing two of his role as a father and his son, but the script flaws often makes him look ridiculous and pathetic. Rekha well, but then - it is always good, and there is nothing greater than these. She is doing everything possible that it receives, but she always does it. In conclusion, nothing special at all. Rabbi in order, which means normal, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This film is melodramatic, sometimes silly. Maybe it's a delayed film? Well, even then it will still be lower than normal. The script is horrible, the film exaggerated, and the story goes nowhere. It feels like a film shot in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older style as the 1950's. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend if you're not a big fan of one of the starring actors.
