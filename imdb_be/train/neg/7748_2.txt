This film was very bad. Sci-fi, as a rule, my favorite channel, so I look at all the original movies that play on it. I really do not know when this movie could be called original. Starting zoo / theme park on a remote island sounds very familiar. What was that, oh yeah, Jurassic Park. But it has SABERTOOTH tigers instead. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a few stereotypical college kids on the island to do some sort of treasure hunt. One of them eventually die a horrible death rather with some of the worst effects that I have seen. The blood is very similar to ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to do so many Fang tigers as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already fled and tourists gather around food, or people invited to the island to see the Tigers first-hand. Again, it sounds like Jurassic Park. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000lb saber tooth, which was crawling on the front legs kill the mad scientist with dental statue of sorts, once compressed and passes through the neck, guys. Funniest death I saw on TV. <br /> <br /> The acting is very cheesy, horrible special effects. Tigers CG could almost pass for clay models, and even some of the sounds were excluded. For example, if one of the college students trying to escape, he uses an ax to break down the door, the ax is at the door and about 2 seconds, you will hear a sound. This film was very bad. Cheese death was pretty funny, though.
