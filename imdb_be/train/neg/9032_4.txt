I never understood the appeal of Garbo. She always comes across in her films as delayed, is not all that inviting, and that annoying voice that would have killed the section of the tube. She was also very limited actress Gloria Swanson is much better left silent. In his last film, her performance is very average and even questionable. She tries her best, but it all came to nothing because the script is even worse than its actions. <br /> <br /> And is not that eccentric romcom never believable and does not get off the ground (even if Melvyn Douglas manages to take off in the ski scene, which is really just a fun thing here). <br /> <br /> It was the potential, but the script is not almost every department spend every actor in it. Douglas and Garbo was quite good chemistry together, but this one is not even a spot on the Nina, which I found to be extremely overrated.
