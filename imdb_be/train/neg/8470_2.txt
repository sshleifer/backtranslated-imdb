I watch a lot of horror (or at least they try to be), and it should be good, if not the second-worst film I've ever had to make myself try to sit. I never knew the depth Masacism, until I rented this piece of moldy cheese, covered in latex used contraceptives. I am a lover of Julian Sanz, but it's worse than we would have hoped for it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was very promising, and I was intrigued ... for the first minute and a half while the titles and I've yet to see what the pain was like first hand. Perhaps there are some viewers out there who are taking advantage of this and can point me in the right direction, but then again I do not know those viewers who understand, unless my memory, especially when we had to turn the video off, and it's just not done our supervision (we had to make an exception, obviously). <br /> <br /> If it were to remake, I'd give him a chance, as long as they were not more than 1% of the original included. That's all.
