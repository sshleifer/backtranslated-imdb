"Meatball Machine" to be one of the most difficult of funny, awful and over-exaggeration of horror films of science fiction that I have ever come across. It is about good vs. evil, and the transition to adulthood fairy tales in order to please the bloody, sloppy and humorous context. Due to the fact that violence is not a particularly disgusting and it does not make you squirm, but gratuitous bloodletting and nudity rushes freely. Performances for Issyam Takahashi Tezuka and the Torah is the worst I've seen, if this was not enough, that is also aimed at unheard director called Judas Yamaguchi. This film is simply all that bad to the bone!, A must see for every B-movie freak !!! Just ...: enjoy and rare gem.
