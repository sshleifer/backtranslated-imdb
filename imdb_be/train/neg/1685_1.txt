All children between the ages of 14-16 years old want to see this movie (even though you only allowed 18). They have heard it is a very scary movie, and they feel so cool when they watched it. I feel very sad children can not see what a good movie and a bad movie. It was one of the worst movies I've seen in months. Every scene that you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. And the end? This open end ... why? Because it is impossible to come up with a decent en such a stupid story. This movie just did to you are scared, and if you are a little intelligent and know some of the music, you know exactly when you will be frightened. <br /> <br /> When the film was finished, I turned to my friend and said (a bit loud) it, it's a waste of money, some stupid kid looked at me strangely. That day I could make Oscar a home video of my goldfish, if I use the right marketing.
