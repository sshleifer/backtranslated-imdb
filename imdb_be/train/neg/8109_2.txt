*** Contains spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I do not like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found it surprisingly dull and rather superficially done, regardless of the importance and depth of the topics: Bearing in mind that in the end we have to die, how we should approach life? The "easy" way to Thomas; in the "hard" way as Torez; or we need to find ways to not have to face this question as Sabina? How important is the certainty in the relationship? How many professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much should we be involved in the political and social problems of our country <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have not read the novel, Kundera, but after the next movie I let down, of course, will be ?: I want to understand if history was destroyed by the film version (my opinion), or if it was boring from the start. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with most of the positive comments that have defined the film as a masterpiece. I just do not see why. What I see a lot of drawbacks, and a sample of them follows. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you, and it is very difficult to understand what motivates them in their decision-making. <br /> <br /> 2) "secondary" characters are just there to fill the gaps, but they do not add anything to the story, and you wonder if they are really needed. <br /> <br /> 3) I did not like, as Thomas was the epitome. Nothing is good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not a man, in a sense. But if his self-confidence is not possible, and he realizes that he is dependent on others and emotionally connected with someone, I have not found an explanation of trust. <br /> <br /> 4) It is very unlikely that the artist, Sabina can afford it a way of life in a communist country in 1968, on top of that the three main characters are all very successful in their profession, which sounds strange to me. a) how Tereza can be easily such a good photographer? b) how they can do it well in the country lacks all the economic incentives that tend to motivate people to achieve success? <br /> <br /> 5) Fake accents of English spoken by the actors are ridiculous. And I do not even own language. In addition, in a letter that Sabina receives while in the United States in the Czech language, which I found very inconsistent <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised the film that Prague was beautifully rendered :. I think that most of the film was shot on location, so it is not difficult to give the film a sense of Eastern Europe, and in view of the inner beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the ending kind of trivial. Tereza and Tomas finally happy in the countryside, away from the temptations of "Metropolitan", far from the social struggles of their fellow citizens live, cut off from his professional life, to die in a car accident. But they die after they realized that they are happy, actually. So what? If they died miserable is the message of the film were different? I do not think so. I thought it was some kind of cheap trick to please the audience. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the film, which is unbearably light as a director portrayed characters. You see them for nearly three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. You do not empathize, do not belong to him, you left it in your couch watching the sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated "stop the music in the restaurant scene" (which some of the comments praised a lot.) Why Sabina received such a strong reaction? Why Franz agrees with her? I do not really see the point. The only you know that Sabina has a very bad temper and a rather strong personality. that's all. what is special and unique about it? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me show advertise there two scenes, which I liked a lot (which is why I gave him two). <br /> <br /> «Naked women Photoshoot», where envy, jealousy, and the unreliability of Sabina Torez and beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> On the other scenes there is one, representing the study after the occupation of Prague Russian. Tereza photo taken for the world to know about what is happening in Prague, is used to identify people who take part in the riots. I found it quite original and the feeling of despair and guilt Teresa beautifully painted. <br /> <br /> and finally, there is a small probability that the film was deliberately "designed" so that " Tomas type "going like this and" those Teresa »Sat irayutstsa hate. If this is true (I doubt it, though), then my comment to be revised drastically.
