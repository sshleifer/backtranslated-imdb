I gave it 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because open-ended stories, and left unexplained, and because of the sickening scenes someone eats in a very bad way, plus the scene of rotting corpses. <br /> <br /> Neither the above to be shown in a graphic manner. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film, such as it relates to three freely interconnect stories, none of which concluded satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> hunter, played by Bruce Dern, a symbol that connects all three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have Dylan McDermott, looking darn good as wanted criminals flee to Mexico to avoid both the law and the mercenary as he rides through the border town and see a sad face saloon girl playing Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> Then we have one of Hemingway girls, not sure which one is playing his wife in the western desert border, which is to see a neighbor, an attractive redhead, we soon realized already in the barren little too long. <br /> <br /> the conclusion of the film returns to the hunter, and what happens to him, with the final scene in the movie is being completely rational understanding.
