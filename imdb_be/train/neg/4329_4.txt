I will never forget, mind and most original holiday comedy movie! The lines are to walk and the events in this film is outstanding! However, this European vacation sequel is a major let down. <br /> <br /> In this sequel Griswalds win a European vacation on a game show. The problem is that many of the jokes in the film a little more than mild, "ha ha" laugh. For example, a flight attendant on the plane asked Clark, "You want your circle in the Can?" Clark is responsible therefore, "No, I have it right here." It's really about the only line that is funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> humor holidays in Europe is tense. As if the authors have borrowed all the jokes from the first film, he tried to re-hash of the script that has been done before, and hoped for a funny slap-stick chase scene sequence to the end of the picture just to kill time. <, Br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the natural comic honors Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie and original children who played Rusty and Audrey from the first film as well, nowhere to be found. Their replacement is not funny, it can not act, and just watch as they go through the motions most of the time. There are also some crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny, they are in bad taste. <br /> <br /> Griswald had to stay in Wally world. A place that made them a legend! Nha join them in this European terrible adventure. Spectators have to re-watch the original film release instead! You'll be glad you did.
