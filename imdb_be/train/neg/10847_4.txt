Version director cut, which was the one I saw was a very long time for this type of film. Nearly two hours is too long. If you have a choice, of course, goes for cut-nya Directors. <br /> <br /> The main plot is almost does not absorb at all, the film is the bulk of multiple murder scenes, which are connected, but the feeling that they are shown only in order to fill the film with splatterish violence. Connect Sun showed to the last part, and the lack of context annoys me long before I was there. <br /> <br /> In the horror film that does not work. You will never get the desired feel for the characters because of the mediocre action and general location (symbol represented by 15 minutes a character is dead). This photo forte lies in the lap part.
