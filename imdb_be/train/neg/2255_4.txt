Is this movie was stupid? Yes. He helped the depth of the film? No. Character development? No. The plot twists? No. It's just a film about a highly fictionalized Springer show. It shows the length that some people will go to get their mugs on TV. Hagan did a great job as a mom Jaime Pressly in. Jaime is .... well ... gorgeous! This film is not so much to do to be a "breakthrough" film, rather it was designed to live in the trailer park (I live in a trailer park and our personal as in the film), where everyone sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant different guys, and all the guys drive a rusty 66 Ford pickups (an exaggeration, of course, but this is the picture one sees when you mention «Trailer Park»). Some people are more analysis films (case-in-point: Star Trek freaks). I watch movies exclusively for entertainment value; It is noted that the girl dressed in another shirt in another scene (read "inconsistencies" a little bit about the shirt Kony. It may be better? Of course. But it was funny as hell.
