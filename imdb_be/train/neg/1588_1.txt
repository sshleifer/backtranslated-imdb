It was the worst movie I have ever seen Billy Zane. I understand that this film was primarily for demonstration of new players who have done very well for beginners, but most of all, the film was not plausible. <br /> <br /> With all the shooting, do you think that the police intervened. Even coins have been a mistake on Sean was stupid. Way Sean realizes the coin is a mistake, it was unreal. <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was slapped together quickly. Poor performance. Get the best writer. <br /> <br /> The countdown to anything out of sync until the end. It took more time to fight. And what a coincidence that every time Billy was going to blow Sean, he would have been out of bullets. Once I believe, but not twice. <br /> <br /> In fact, the character of Billy was stupid. It was so stupid when Shawn kicks him in the end. It was like a comedy. Too bad! Too bad! Too bad!
