I love movies about the morally corrupt characters, but it was too much. Action was not great, but it was not a real problem. The question was sinking feeling that I was in the pit of my stomach about 20 minutes in the film. These symbols were hollow. They had almost no depth, and the little that they would have done it was dedicated to brutality reflected to each other under the guise of friendship. The study of the darker sides of the character set can be fun, but you have to give these characters are real people or are they just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard and picture they gave just ugly.
