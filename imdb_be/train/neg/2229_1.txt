Maybe it's not fair, because I only made it about half way through the movie. One of the few films that I really was not able to watch because of lameness. <br /> <br /> action awful, terrible camera work, plot funny and the whole film is simply unrealistic and cheesy. For example - during the transaction coke, coke is stored in bulk in a portfolio - I'm no expert, but I think that people tend to put it in the bag <br /> <br /> They use the same silly sound effect. every time the punch is thrown (this is on top of that "crunching" sound "and they use toy guns in a matched sound effects. <br /> <br /> worst movie ever.
