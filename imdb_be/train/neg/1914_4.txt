AINT is bad, but it AINT well. it's just interesting. <br /> <br /> as a comedy, which it should be, it's terrible. not many laughs at everything, as every joke in the film has been done a million times. <br /> <br /> it's a shame as all the actors in the film are usually great, but none of them really do. and the ending sucks.
