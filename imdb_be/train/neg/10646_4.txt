The last of the Weissmuller Tarzan films and a good thing, too, since it is easily the worst of the 12 films he has done for 16 years. Many mermaids are not presented here as either a beautiful island woman trying to escape the clutches of his people, who worshiped God and try to get her to be his bride. She finds Tarzan and Jane, who are trying to protect her. George Zucco ~ d is present as a potentially criminal priest, but not used to its full advantage. Also on hand and worth mentioning is extremely annoying guitarist / vocalist who goes into song every so often. Even the "big" Robert Florey can not help it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
