I rented it by mistake. I thought, after a cursory inspection of the box, it is a journey through time / science-fiction story. Instead, it is a "Christian" history, and I believe, is fairly typical example. If you sell to a message that you probably will not notice the awkwardness of the story / actions / etc., But I thought it was quite painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was worried about re-writing history in this story. He paints in 1890 as a kind of paradise of family values ​​and morals (the character is stunned that 5% of marriages end in divorce!) But it turns out very ugly side of this "highly moral" society (rigid racial, sexual, and social discrimination was widespread, for example) . And at some point the hero complains owner of clothing store about things that do not sound all that different from the complaints of some Iranian leaders on women's apparel styles (as reported in a recent WSJ) />. <br /> <br Overall, I thought, I believe that this is the kind of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing, and it is certainly useful ...
