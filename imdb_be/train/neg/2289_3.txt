Unfortunately, Marry Harron decided to make a fictional account of the life of Betty Paige to go along with their own problems with men. As is typical of all his work, all the main male character is portrayed as a weak, clumsy, or twisted. To add to her fiction, she projects the ideas and issues that do not correspond to reality, at the Bettie Page. Bettie did not leave a business because she thought it was morally wrong or have religious issues (though it has become revived later on in life, through the influence of her husband- Minister 3). She left him because she was in the late 30s, her acting career did not go anywhere, and she felt that she was losing her looks. Hints of molestation and rape unproven and denied in their own words and Bettie are attempts directed to claim that any woman who did what she did Bettie should have been the victims of men. Harron not indicate that Bettie designed their own clothes almost all of its runners (not passed her "sick" fetishists). Harron also unable to make a point, bath Yeager, who did a lot of photo shoots with famous Betty, also made a lot of "naughty" he fires Betty was not morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> only salvation is Gretchen Mol looks very similar to the Betty. Otherwise, there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest in their lives, and the people in it.
