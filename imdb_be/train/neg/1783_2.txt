There's no spoilers here ... Because there is no plot to ruin. MÃ¤dchen Amick is living proof that a person can make life entirely acting-- talent required. The only bright spot some really good one-liners delivered very beautiful Alice Krige, but then again, it is Alice Krige. Her soft dreamy voice gives only a hint of how dangerously tempting, these strange creatures can be. It is plausible terrible in this otherwise incredible story. How did they get her consent to this project remains a mystery. The writer had to medications, when they presented this scenario. She has a serious continuity problems, superficial stereotypical character, horror formula writing, and simply does not hold any sense what-so ever. Creatures, while they have a neat skill as there is a "dull", so researched the question of where they come from and what they had. <br /> <br /> Or do not waste time on it.
