First of all, when I saw the trailer for Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on the Disney Channel, will do martial arts, and I was fine with that ... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly constructed, the film could not realated to anyone, the fight was unrealistic and sucked ... along with the plot. If you really think about this wannabe Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a girl who is a descendant of the other soldiers who were women, she wants to ignore her vocation and wants to be homecoming queen, the observer, it is a mistake for her to prepare for the big to fight against some ancient evil. The idea just is not all that the original film a waste of time.
