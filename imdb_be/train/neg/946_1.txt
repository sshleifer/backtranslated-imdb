Why is this show so popular? That's for me why people like it. I think this is one of the worst comedies there. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I tried a few times to see it and I can not make it through the entire episode. <br /> <br /> First of all, acting is terrible. All this replay to the point where it's annoying to watch. They say, unnatural voice, use unnatural tone, and body language have unnatural. I've seen better acting in a kindergarten school games. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's not funny. Lots dull. They are not creative, intellectual, or FUNNY. If you do not have a funny sitcom ?? Why am I not laughing? <br /> <br /> And, finally, that the seventies about this? This is about as authentic seventies as «Happy Days» was the fifties. <br /> <br /> He is and what with Ashton Kutcher? Who threw this incompetent wimp? And now he makes movies ?? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think that is a quality television, it bothers me.
