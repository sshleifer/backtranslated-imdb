I have to be that one guy in America that do not like this movie. I believe that it's just not my style or something, I just do not understand what's so interesting about it, it was * just entertainment, not to mention one of the greatest achievements in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> It's about a guy who came from nothing, and goes on to become a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe the entire movie, and this is my feeling about the whole film. Contrary to what many people think, just because a film about the mafia / drug trafficking / criminal groups does not automatically make it a great movie, do not forget a good story.
