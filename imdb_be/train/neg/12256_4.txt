Oh God, I should have seen it when I was only 11 or twelve, (do not ask how) Maybe I was young, but I was not stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad film, inverse, bulk, unscary and very silly. I've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I've seen the best performances in the school play, and I've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, not paying attention to children, tapping on the glass. <br /> <br /> The story is set in northern Australia. A few ambitious young people who are trying to develop a new water sport, surfing in shark-filled with water. It soon becomes apparent that something more dangerous in the water. Once they know that they are receiving assistance in the Grizzly middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill the beast to avenge his family uptake. <br /> <br /> I think I saw one crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst of which is its continuation. Blood Surf to be the second worst film of the crocodile, I think, with the primitive and crocodile tail close behind. <br /> <br /> The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures there, resulting in more than a hundred injured or killed every year. Movies like Blood Surf however spoil not only the image of these creatures in February, but a good hour and a half life of the viewer. If you really want to see it, to avoid blood Surf.
