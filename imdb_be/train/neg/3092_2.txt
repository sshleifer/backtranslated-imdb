If films like Gremlins Ghoulies rip off, the Hobgoblins falls to a new low tearing trash like Ghoulies. This little animated furbies there is some scheme to fulfill fantasies (which include mainly sexual dreams groteque characters - the joy), but what does this have to do business, we can only guess, except to the director to indulge his curly tendency to sensuality, they show it down to the 8th circle of hell, one suspects. There's no real plot - just "Goblin - kill!" And the feeble attempts of humor and an easy attempt to excite audiences.
