*** It contains many, many spoilers, nothing matters, so everything is so obviously apparent *** <br /> <br /> Oh, my God, where do I start? Well, that's - this is the first time I came home from the movies, and said: "I have to get on IMDb and write a review about it now it's my civic duty.". Such viciousness of this film. <br /> <br /> * to begin a retreat * But let me say one thing before you begin. I'm not some Harvard-art major film-noir sausage (in fact, I went to college at the other end. Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, one where the actual reasonable people who do not have rich daddies and trust funds are that should put me right in the idiot-who-would-manic love comics movies census group, and still I hated this film ...). I prefer to view the highbrow cinema art, which includes Die hards, Bond flicks, clerks and the grail. I want to Titanic never sank, not so much for the lives lost, but in a way we would not have been subjected to this heap of dung film. And the single and the only reason I'm going to look defiant French feature film, if there is a young and often exposed Emmanuelle Beart in it. I even gave the maximum acceleration of one of his precious few 10s here on IMDb, for God's sake. So I, as shallow as they come, so I do not criticize this film, because I'm looking for some kind of standard for cinematic excellence - this is because the Power stinks like three-week dead goat. * End of digression * <br /> <br /> Well, there's so much harm here, that I should try to classify it. Here it goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the compelling reasons why a man would want to see the movie to see a lot of hot JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted). I think that between this and "Finding Nemo," the latest film was sexier. You know that red dress she is wearing is advertised in every freaking ad you see? You see it in it twice - once at the beginning, when at the end. Bummer. As for the rest, it basically looks like that Morrissey would look as if he was a woman - a lot of plump and black clothes. This brings me to an incredible range of JGar expression shows in her actions - from the "chubby" all paths "inflated and cry." My God, you'd think that she was forced to date Ben Affleck or something horrible like that. Uh, wait ... <br /> <br /> The bad guys / GAL: They show about the same range of expression and acting ability, which you would expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least close to the execution JGar, it does not cost too much. One role of the guy has to stand up and be a huge, strange to stand there and things get out of it, and the role of women is to stand and breathe and / or kissing. They manage to pull off these incredible feats. The main bad guy is the hardest role of all - he must simultaneously a) are angry and b) are Asian. He does an excellent job on this. I think it was the fifth bad guy / gal, but my brain begins to block the part of the film in self-defense. <br /> <br /> plot twists! This film is about the same surprises as speaking at the Democratic National Convention. Let's just put it this way - my wife, who has only been in the US for six months, and says only a small number of English - whispered to me that, when she first appeared in JG platform, and I swear to God, I'm not making this up: " it is to go into the house to kill the girl and her father, too .. "and that even before his father appeared on the screen. Now my wife is not a fool, but she did not care for her Mensa gifts, either, and it had no impact or Daredevil comics genre. And she chose this in .00015 seconds without pushing, without notice. Such blatant evidence of this film. <br /> <br /> Rarely-KO-Videla stupidity! OK, so the big guy in the movie. He can take chestful shake a shotgun and shot, as the pile, and it can take a vicious blow to the chest Electra and simply bend the metal (or melt it - or something - more leg protection in, the glory of God). But JG jumping on his head, and it explodes? Achilles chump? GOOD! This stupefying dullness of the film. <br /> <br /> Ack. I'm starting to feel brain hemorrhage is going on, so I have to stop. But you have been warned. If you have intentionally cut their own tires, to prevent yourself from going to see this movie, do it. And if Armageddon comes, please let it be> before <it comes out on DVD.
