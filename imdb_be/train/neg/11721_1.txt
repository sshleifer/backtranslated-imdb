This movie was terrible. COMPLETELY unrealistic scenario has been written to take place in the real world, editing and lighting effects are worse than many of the first projects in film school. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie for those who: A) know any details about the police or the world of covert operations. B) know any details about the filming or evaluation. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to the average or below average intelligence, I think it would be nice if I was stupid. If you need to see this movie on the full consciousness, I highly recommend a kind of intoxication <br /> <br /> This is the total amount of waste that is not enough production capacity.
