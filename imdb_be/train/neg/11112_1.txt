Wow, how bad it can get. It was seriously ill. Not in terms of gore - which is mainly the CGI was ludicrous - but the actor, the atmosphere and the direction <br /> <br /> The story was terrible. - nature of the ground lead of the arc was a total joke. For several nights intrusive wine Jones, it starts to become "ghost" to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend. Um ... all of New York photographers is kidding, suggestible and weak? His character development was absolutely no justification or show whatsoever - and at the end you will laugh out loud in a completely predictable, and utterly absurd twist his character takes <br /> <br /> gory moments were obviously easy. weakness, low self esteemed effort to move to a modern MTV style wagon gore - all CGI, the blood is not even real emotions at all. These pieces were unintentionally funny - and distract their identity - stupid angles, etc. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is committing a crime blowing another potential idea. What could be the atmosphere (until the stupid monsters at the end) is not spoiled in favor of "self-conscious look at me'style directing. This movie was not made for, and the audience - it was made for the resume - deeply selfish motive.
