Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Starring: Harry Graham, Anne-Marie Johnson, Paul Khosla <br /> <br /> Overview: Stewart Gordon that we normally associate with an extremely bloody horror films, such as Re-Animator, because Dagon, and Castle Freak, took a little detour here and did a little sci-fi film. I emphasize the word "little" because it is a very low budget flick, and this is its main weakness. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the future. A world where superpowers (in accordance with this film is the United States and Russia), the Duke of these differences there is no full-scale world war ... but fighting gladiator fights in style with giant robots. Our hero Achilles to go against the evil robot Russian fighter named Alexander. Many cheap stop-motion animation is worth. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is awesome, I think. Large nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots? Interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly, if appropriate budget is available. Unfortunately, that could be funny film ends with another great challenge for the director. <br /> <br /> I was a child loved this film, and I think if you want some fun with this film, you will "have to go back to a small child mode to have fun with it. I showed the film to some of my friends, and as the film progressed, there is another, where, as a "what the hell is this piece of shit Frank?" And I, as well, this film is a sci-fi one of my favorite directors Stuart Gordon? "But as the film progressed to the template area, I almost felt like press stop and not having them go through this torture. I could go through it, because I loved this movie as a child, and there is still a bit of nostalgia attached to his watch. But the rest was all just is not going to get it. <br /> <br /> I myself realized that the film ISN Â»t really that good. in the first place. a movie about giant robots pushing the hell out of each other. And in order to achieve this in a credible manner, you would have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, expensive effects that would help us audience to suspend disbelief. But unfortunately, this being a small-scale film, from a small scale company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after the creation of this film!) Effects only help us giggle and laugh at them. Heck, even some of the sets and the wardrobe looks incomplete or half-assed. <br /> <br /> OK provided as soon as you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animations and miniatures well you can sort to give in the film, and even enjoy a big robot pushing the hell out of each other. There are some scenes where the robots are fighting, who are born cool, and made me go, "That's why I loved thid movie!" But everyone knows and some crappy effect will lead you directly to this little protective cocoon you were trying to hide. And boom, your back to the realization of this film just does not live up to his room. <br /> <br /> And Heres another thing that is bothering me a little bit about the movie. This film is basically a film for children. You know, giant robots duking it out? Stop motion animation? Hello? But this movie dialogue was a lot of sexual innuendo, and violence becomes a little bloody. So I kept asking myself this film children or not? After a while, I just came to the conclusion that most of the children it was a film with adult feelings that really is not a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who do not feel that some of the children's naive charm of watching two robots fighting each other, and if you do not have a nostalgic connection with this film (I) is well Id offer you stay away from this. GORDONS great director, but this film he did, just do not do it for me. . Well, at least not right now, I'm full grown adult <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 of 5
