I am surprised with some of the reviews of this film. The only place that seems to be telling the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is terrible. The plot is extremely lazy. It's not terrible, either. People out there who think that, because the stars Gellar is somehow like The Grudge have to forget about it. This film is more like Dark Water, with the exception of the fact that more predictable and slow moving than that. I was very disappointed with this film. It did not scare me, or I'm interested in something. Let's face it, this type of plot hacked to death at this stage, for example, the dead, trying to connect with a live - Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones who write original horror films are now the Japanese and Koreans. The films that come out of Hollywood, as this is a cynical exercise to make money without the slightest respect for the viewer. They are just being churned out
