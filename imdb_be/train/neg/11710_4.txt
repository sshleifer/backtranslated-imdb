There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not connected with one of the stars or the producer: Actress Nicole Hiltz. It shows in this slow moving and wildly improbable story of revenge. Directed by Simon Gornick, movie stars like Joyce Heyzer deceived wife who decides to take revenge on her husband CHEATIN '. Yes, but not by conventional means. It plans a total guerrilla war and enlists bad girl Nicole Hiltz as her weapon of choice. She wants to Nicol (Tuesday) to get closer to its former (beautiful but dull Stephan Jenkins, who must follow the music) to confuse him and ruin his life. David DeLuise well in his few short moments, and former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison is given virtually nothing to do but surly. Hiltz, on the other hand, comes off at different times, such as sexual and playful, evil and cunning. It also works with vulnerable and "maybe a little psychotic" good. It is also quite hot (although there are no naughty bits are not shown) so that you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy, it is directed. But the performance of some kind of wasted in this film, which simply was not nervous or interesting enough to recommend.
