The film looks super on paper. Romantic comedy in which a mad lover gets involved in smuggling thriller should be universal cross of gold, especially with these wonderful actors romcomic. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid Kezdan just giving their two stars too much rope, although they properly go and hang himself. Adam Brooks' script may be to blame, but you would expect better from Kevin Kline with A Fish Called Wanda. Instead, two ping-pong from one another and hardly a burgeoning romance never reconciled satisfactorily due to either of them in France and dashing around. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno co-stars politely as police-to--a heart, and I think, wishes he was a star-to-part. Keep in mind, he continued to do the remake of the Pink Panther (S!), So that perhaps he was okay with that ... 3/10
