Unpleasant, formulaic thriller young couple is doing a study on the rough terrain of the most notorious places America's murder by becoming a partner of the near road a young woman and her friend growls - which is the actual crazy. Arty and alienation, the film alternates between tones Pouty pseudo-irony and stupid splendor. Beautifully made, perhaps, but ultimately ridiculous. Brad Pitt's performance as a low-rent killer is godawful. * From ****
