I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on the story of Bernard Malamud. It is basically a story about a possible buyout of racial bias and non-fulfillment of a life based on mistrust. <br /> <br /> Black Jewish angel sent to help the struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. If Maurice Mishkin (Mostel) will only believe in angels (Belifont), his wife Fanny (Kaminsky) will be restored. The problem lies in the fact that Maurice basically abandoned the life and simply refuses to believe that the angel Belafonte. <br /> <br /> If he thinks Fanny improves, but in the end, he had doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly. It would be very nice if there was a translation into English in the last scene, when dying Fanny says Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who successfully led the Miss Kaminski in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's "store on Main Street," directs this film as well. Kaminska decreases in the film basically sex scenes, and her kindness in his speech does not really passes desperate situation that it faces. she holds a call for Ruthie, their daughter, who did not listen to them, marrying the Jewish religion. For most of the film, she does not understand the appearance of the Angel in his apartment . <br /> <br /> scene in the pharmacy muddled and a scene where a friend collab Angels Belafonte standing in his apartment, memorable but too short. <br /> <br /> We do not know why Belafonte is at risk, and why he died. <br /> <br /> Those watching this film should have been leave the theater in a state of depression and despair.
