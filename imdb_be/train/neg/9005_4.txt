If a foreigner, Jurassic Park, and countless other films Sci Fi Horror your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar, and you get this one down. The film begins in jolly old England around 1100ad, and then goes on today in California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new head of security and military adviser to the scientific laboratory 400 feet underground. He comes (Carver also a helicopter pilot) with leading uchenymom and we soon learn that this is the cloning lab and they have something to clone again extracted. Whether it is a dinosaur or something? As above films, all hell loose and our heroes are beginning to get shot. Special effects on the monsters are pretty good for a "straight to video" movies and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for. But forget the rest of the group, how do we know why we've never seen them before. Again, do not go to high expectations, and you'll be fine.
