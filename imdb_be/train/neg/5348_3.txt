Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to sacrifice his troubled shrinkage / expansion of the machine in the Smithsonian Institution, he and his wife Diana (Eve Gordon) get ready for the weekend away from his son Adam (Bug Hall). Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patti (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jennie (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteer to take care of Adam, while his parents are away, but as luck would have it (and the name of will lead you to wait), adult accidentally zapped reducing the beam Wayne. As the children run amok, their miniature people have to deal with horrible huge insects, wrinkles on the carpet that look like canyons and other threats to them. It was bad, like most of the direct to video sequels are, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves was kind of ridiculous. I had to laugh at this movie, "roach" Stuart Pankin and bullies parties were even more ridiculous, look at your own risk!
