Jimmy Dean could not have been more absurd unnatural or unpolished. Hysterical, when viewed through the eyes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I appreciate as a 10 I mean, the kind of obesity, corn-fed pigs trouncing around Malta should be enough to send you to vomit, if you make it that far in the film . It's ugly, hysterical farce should be placed with such «Booty Call», «Pumpkinhead», «Swarm», and "The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh." -Gulp- film, as it proves that sometimes the actors, writers, producers, etc. receive for their mortgage, or get beaten to insanity. It begs the question, "who was stupid enough to fund a whale?" But then, if common sense prevailed and «Final Justice» has never been, we would not have had a wonderful parody of voice-over in «Mystery Science Theater 3000" !
