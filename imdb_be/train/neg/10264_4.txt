The head of the general family of New York, Jane Gail (as Mary Burton), working with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as the Barton Scrap) in «Candy Store, Smyrner in." After Ms. Grandin stolen dealers buying and selling of women as slaves prostituted, Ms. Gail and her policeman boyfriend Matt Moore (Larry Burke) must rescue charity threatening young woman. <br /> <br /> «Traffic in Souls" has a reputation that is difficult to maintain - it is not amazingly well done, and it's nothing unique about that young woman "charity" faces sex-traders shows. Maybe it can be supported in the form of films related to the subject at greater length than usual (claimed to be ten drums, originally). Scenes accommodation New York are the main attraction, after all these years. Pan prisoners behind bars remembered, because nothing seems to be able to make the camera move. <br /> <br /> **** Movement Souls (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gayle, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
