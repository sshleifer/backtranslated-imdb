Spoilers ahead - at your own caution <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that when Harry learns the identity of the three blackmailers -. With relative ease - it continues to settle in their demands. And then the whole scene with his wife was abducted, he decided to connect your classic car to blow up (with the money in it), which makes us take a fairly high jump logic. <br /> <br /> Thus, so he wanted to make his case with Chinyami from the public eye in connection with the involvement of his wife now DA. I understand that, but why not hire someone to slap these droppings around a bit, or even kill them as soon as he put it, there was no actual blackmail evidence (eg, body Cini in?) It was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2 / 3 therefrom. Then, as if falling apart.
