I just saw this movie at the local television station (TV8 in "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio), I had never heard of this movie, and decided to see. <br /> <br /> I do not know the thesaurus that can even come close to helping me to describe how bad this film really is. a horrible scenario. Action, but one of the two exceptions, does not make sense, since there is nothing in this material, which deserves any real effort. <br /> <br /> It looks like a bunch of little ideas, a relic from the different writing sessions that where thrown into a blender. It's not just funny. "Parody" aspect strained at best. Some links where it is almost out of date (even at the time of its release). Not surprisingly, I never heard about it, it's very bad, worse than anything Saturday Night Live, MAD TV, or even put out fresh flowers in their worst days. <br /> <br /> If you see on TV, it is a perfect example of how not to make a film. Whatever you do not spend CENT. <br /> <br /> Adam
