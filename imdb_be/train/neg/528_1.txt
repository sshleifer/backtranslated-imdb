I never expected the film adaptation follow too closely to the novel (especially the half, as the evening), but when I saw that the author of the book by Susan Minot, was a writer and executive producer of the film, I thought that the evening would be a good adaptation. <br /> <br /> If you like this book, do not bother with this film. . This is so far from the book that the two can hardly bear no resemblance to each other <br /> <br /> Here are our heroes are totally different: the bride in love Harris. Harris is the son of the housekeeper. Buddy drunk in love with Anne and / or Harris. I do not think that one character made it out of the book to the screen; Oh, it's just getting worse with each passing moment. <br /> <br /> And, in fact, do we not learn from the Bridges of Madison County, that the reduction of the history that we are called to be captured, to the scenes of our heroes' adult children with juvenile and nasty battle, simply does not work on the film? This film is a disaster. Skip it.
