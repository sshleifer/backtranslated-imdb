I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy was the best movie ever <br /> <br /> HN <br /> <br /> monster similar to the villain of the Power Rangers, .. and is roughly the same range of rubber-like motion. It can be good, if the manufacturers were not as proud of their design as they seem. That is, for a guy in a big rubber suit as an action flick / SciFi / horror that could benefit from some secret shark gets a lot of screen time. Of course, this is usually shaky and unstable. I think you have to assume that it is so terrible that even the guy frills camera. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to the person who is going eaten, the camera moves to a shark. The camera returns to the person who is going eaten, but now they are screaming and armless. And so on. <br /> <br /> costumes bad acting is poor, and the special effects are sub-par, but writing a lot worse. Things happen by accident, so that more people can eat, or so something could explode. So let me tell you, the people who made this film definitely go with more explosions = better thinking. Characters shoot cars and there is a huge explosion. They shoot the helicopters have a powerful explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, whatever, they all explode, so much so that even the fucking shark explodes in the end. <br /> <br /> By the way, I do not care, like a crazy person, I find it hard to believe that someone would think of trying to make a giant half man, half shark sex with a woman to make fancy sharks people children is a good idea. That is, if this person is not a mad scientist in the film. <br /> <br /> The bad news is that the film is so random (and at times, boring), even its harmful sun really enough to spend a long human interest. It may be good to MST3K with friends, but in the past that if you happen to catch this bad boy, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
