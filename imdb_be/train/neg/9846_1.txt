You might be tempted to make this film because Peter Sellers is in it. It would be a mistake. This is one of the most pointless movies ever made. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, but it is not nothing funny in this movie. Even the film industry found it was very weak and the film does not even try to promote it. Its amazing that he ever put on video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what the contract called the seller to be in this movie. I also wonder why the people responsible for this film was allowed to continue to do other bad movies. Of course, this film is a waste of money used to create it, and waste of someone's time to view it. Of course, there are high school students who would be able to write / create a film that is as a plot.
