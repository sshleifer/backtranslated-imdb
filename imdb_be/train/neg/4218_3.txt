This is not one of the reviews about the poor special effects or technology, or seen, the questions only dorkiest people can relate to, and an overview on the stories that most of us are really interested. <, Br /> <br /> story about a combination of World War II, Allied and German members of the Navy, and two civilians (the hero and heroine), who thrust together on a German U-boat and the wind in the wild land of the dinosaurs. <, Br /> <br /> manipulation is not so bad by the standards of a movie, and we know from the story that realism is not going to be high. What kind of movies like this need credible and charming characters, along with some semblance of reason in action. <br /> <br /> In this film lacks both. For the full-length film, only 6 characters are shown at any time, and 3 of them hardly looked. McClure hero is outside the "normal" and does not make sense in any era. <br /> <br /> The woman seems to be looking for an answer to the riddle of the land of the dinosaurs they entered, but the puzzle is not so much a mystery, and we could care less. <br /> <br /> a lot of failures in the film, which was better, even for its time.
