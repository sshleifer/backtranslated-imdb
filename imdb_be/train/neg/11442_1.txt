It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Terrible acts not funny, and just boring. <br /> <br /> I can only assume these 10 out of 10 fav. constantly comments movies are actually the actors in disguise. <br /> <br /> The DCO that run on the film Wednesday, I'm sure it is listed on this page It certainly felt like an eternity <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a heavy task, attempt sit through that awful movie. <br /> <br /> else <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, as I did on this
