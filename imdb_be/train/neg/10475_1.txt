I am a youth pastor's wife, and we have some young people to see this movie. We then spent an hour trying to explain it to them. They did not get it, and I did not enjoy it. It is based on the concept that runs through all three major religions of the world (The Bible Code, and the Code of the Torah in the Qur'an), and so it is doubtful to be laughable. This is not a step forward for the Christians in the arts, it is a step forward for those who believe, we check our brains at the door.
