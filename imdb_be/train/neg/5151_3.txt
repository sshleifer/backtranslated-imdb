I thought it was a great idea, but, boy, it was poorly executed. We get an idea of ​​how complex and difficult the backroom operations of the show is, but almost no specifics of any of them does not work. Manufacturers do not seem to find any way to tell a story or give the audience "through the line." (Which is not to say that they did not try, but having stagehands linked synopsis Ring cycle in the narrative of the program does not do anything to tell us work is physically opera installation.) <br /> <br /> we see a lot of things going on, but say little about what it is that people are doing and why. There is little sense of who is who, and how the various production departments fit and work together. For example, a few times we hear about the problem some - one is waiting to see the problem and its consequences, and / or how it gets resolved. But in general, just cut something else instead, the filmmakers (usually quite general shots of people who push things or speak in suits.) <br /> <br /> In general, the film ends up feeling more than a pastiche of images that you would see work under the trailing titles show, not something worth watching for its own merits.
