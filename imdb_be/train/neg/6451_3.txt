«Steve» (Chris Hoffman) gathers a group of high school for a reunion at the site of the cabin, where his twin brother Wes disappeared. While they are there, reptile creature in human form (reminded me a lot of Gillmanom of creatures from the Black Lagoon) is waiting in the desert by choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one. Biker, Ellen Ripley type time woman teases, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker she practices experiments, and also serves as a place of safety items on a bloody rampage. Kat knows more than she says (she also suffered the loss of a child), but there is another new twist most of the groups do not have any idea about. This creature can not be just more human than they realize..and this former identity can shed some light on the deception only one other person in hiding after the death of Wes. Kat holds the key to many mysteries that reveal how the group remains in the cab. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, most of the film remains on the side of being who jumps in the air, while we see a hazy screen, when we look through the eyes. The film has melodramatics Dawson Creek type that often prevent real tension that is necessary to build in a little monster movie. The direction is very soft to a relatively dull experience, rather than to cause scares. Acting more life less and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (FOG remake) can only be a lure for this film.
