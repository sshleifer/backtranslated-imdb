Yesterday I watched this movie and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh basically had to wear this uncomfortable unlikely scenario for five hours (or how long it was actually). From the beginning, every element of the film is incredible. This film made me giggle a few times, but they were mostly out of shock that the director / writer actually expected us to believe that many convoluted trace elements that are trying to collect this film together. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is gray (Graham), and her problems with intimacy. Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly WAY too much in common. <br /> <br /> An interesting, intriguing. However, instead of having to unravel the story into something believable and tasty, the director continues to Gray in these ridiculous twists and turns that will never make any sense. Being an LGBT individual, this film seemed to repeat that all heterosexuals think we are going in the coming-out process. (I'll be offended if eccentric writer.) If it was not for the sweet chemistry between Graham and coffee (which, incidentally, was understandably forced), I would give it negative stars 3.
