I found a documentary called the Fast, cheap and out of control, to be quite interesting documentary. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each of these people has been extremely involved in their work, showing an obvious love and delight for their work. <br /> <br /> Sadly, I have to say that there must be subjects in which these people have worked / studied, they were interesting for five minutes, after which it becomes dull and solid entirely too long. <br /> <br /> The video was filmed in a very creative way, though. I really liked the movie for one thing with a voice replicates over the other. She played very well, and also coincided nicely with the music.
