Reasons to see this knock off ... uh ... a tribute to the great film titled Se7en: - This is while your channel surfing and there is nothing else on. - Someone has to pay you to watch it <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and pop in a DVD for Se7en, remove it, upload it to ITunes or put it in Netflix Ki and miss .. Flock flock completely the same story with a few changes. In addition, editing only brings with Se7en and actually end up taking you out of the story several times. The worst thing one is likely to fly over the desert helicopter arrows, with the sounds of people banging people on the radio, except that no police helicopters flying over his head in this <br /> <br /> The result :. I call this a blatant knock. If you want to be good, you can call it a tribute film to go ahead, but somehow go watch Se7en.
