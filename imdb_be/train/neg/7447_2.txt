I first read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! This is a classic historical novel set in the 1600s, when the west of the country in a few days' journey from London and the rule of law has been much more difficult to enforce. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes a few liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing, in my opinion. The values ​​of operating and production in order, but as the story was busy was awful. Why television devices make it? Why do they think that the thousands of fans of the book would like them to change the story ??? One of the greatest mysteries of life !!! BBC did an excellent version that was on television on Christmas Day in the early 1990s, that I'm still trying to track down a copy! Take my advice, read a book and do not bother with this version of the void!
