Sometimes I rest my head and think about why movies about killer sharks and / or crocodiles still get to do these days. They have done these clumsy "Jaws» -copies to 70, it's not like they get more well-liked. The idea is still exactly the same. Thus, we have an animal that begins to kill people. First, he takes down several supporting characters, it begins to attack the protagonist is usually played on a couple of worthlessness for someone who used to be a little more well-known, which is usually played by a specialist, except. One of the main characters tend to die before the others kill the animal in any way, as a rule, with the explosion. Then, we usually get the last shot, where we see that the animal is still alive, or laid eggs, etc. etc. «Krocodylus» basically uses the same overused idea, and does absolutely nothing to create even a little bit of variation. Aside from the fact that the "expert" is the captain of this one embodiment, in the event that your standards are quite low. Funny that he played Duncan Regehr, though, like it absolutely Zorro.Hell before I give him bonus points for that.
