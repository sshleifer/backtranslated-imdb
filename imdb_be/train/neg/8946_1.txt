I think that the boom and the lighting was very poor. When I watched it the first time I thought it was the old version (1956). If I really knew the true year of the film I was shocked. I did not know that there may be such a bad film made recently. That's really all I wanted to say. This film was not a good story, though, you can not miss anything, if you just read a novel that George wrote Orwelll. All I really want to say has already been said except this: I can not believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations.I gave the film one (terrible), because I felt that it it was very poorly made. Well, that's all. this long
