Blockbuster movies filmed party last night, and it was the first one I saw (it was late on a Saturday night, like "the horror film to correct») ... <br /> <br /> Wow, it was awful, almost as dramatically ... Silly story chopper type, I really thought that films like Scream ended; amateur actors who bring clichéd »and insipid dialogue that hard to believe actually printed and read the page; Gore and scenes that are not carried away (especially if it happens in the movie is bad scenario). <br /> <br /> But I always thought no one film is not 100% percent useless. Here are a few good things I can say about this mess: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: love this actress. She is the only member of the cast, reflecting any acting talent whatsoever. The only reason I ventured to rent it because her name was on the front cover. It justifies its presence in this dreck with professionalism, despite the fact that she looks stunned by the fact that it behaves in such an idiotic story <br /> <br /> # 2 unintentionally Hilarity :. This kind of film I remember seeing back when they were still Grindhouse theaters across the country, and they used to turn shit like this as the third film in the triple bill with some prestige thriller film which was finally makes it way to the hinterland. Unfortunately, in this age, direct to video, most viewers are forced to endure the turkey alone now without the communal experience of being part of a mockery of the audience and throwing things on the screen, because the film is so scary. This results aimed at <br /> <br /> # 3 porn star trying to act: Mainly on hand, because manufacturers do not need to persuade or beg them to undress for extended sex scenes, but it is a compromise usually means that they actually get to speak a few lines, which should advance the story (except for «Ooh Yeah baby" or "harder!"). And, proudly, they deliver qualified to look stupid trying to act. I almost rule Ginger Lynn Allen of the group, where her character was not supposed to be an Irish mother, and she really tries sometimes to emphasize that just keeps the smile comes. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to look at the positive in all experiences, and that's what I took from that cesspool aka "Evil Breed"
