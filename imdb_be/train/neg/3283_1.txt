Well, we all love Daisy Dukes, but with this cast. Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing about this country girl and Daisy Sun ditzy! Uncle Jesse is probably the closest one to resemble the original. Burt can not hurt, but I never noticed Boss Hog be so high. It was part of the humor Boss Hog was its size. Perhaps they even try someone like Danny DeVito?!? Okay, now get it dusted Jessica Simpson did anyone look at her husband? He meets Luke Duke to tee !!!!!! Clergy, these manufacturers do not look at the appearance of the old actors. Screen so have never been present at Dukes !! This made the film by turning away from the start. I give a huge thumbs down.
