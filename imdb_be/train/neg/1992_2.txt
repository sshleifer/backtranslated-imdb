Do not let the name fool you this film, in fact Jake Speed ​​character, quite possibly, lazy action hero ever known in the film. When the rate of Jake saves virgin girls from the evil mad that he was often not the case, he was seriously relaxing. Perhaps this adds to its charm, but in my view, action hero is not intended to "cool" every time he gets a chance. In addition, unlike other brave heroes who, as a rule, have a great list of talent, this person does not have one, of course, if you do not call sleep talent. Anyway, this film basically useless, writing sub-par and the action, if there are some very lame. (Machine guns jeep they were not bad, but that's about it) So if you're in the mood to watch a movie, which is a cure for insomnia, this piece is perfect for you - this is the hero who not only puts himself sleep, but its audience.
