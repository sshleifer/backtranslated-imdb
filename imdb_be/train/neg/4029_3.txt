History The idea of ​​a lost missile is not bad, but unfortunately, the story is really tedious to the middle and abuse footage, as well as the bad effects to sink the film at an unsatisfactory level. <, Br /> <br /> The film begins with a rocket toward the Earth. In a panic, because it is about to hit the Earth, the Soviet Union was able to deflect the object. This is not necessarily a good thing, however, as it seems to be an unmanned vehicle has vapor trail, which destroys everything in its path, and the ship is now in low orbit over the planet. In other words, with each pass it does, the death strip as follows - one that could potentially kill us all !! Thus, it is good to US scientists (led by a very young and barely known by Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us - and especially to save New York, which is located in the immediate flight path! Unfortunately, they are not able to save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can not say whether this is a big loss), but thanks to good old American know-how, they can eventually destroy the harbinger of destruction !! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the story idea is not bad and quite original. But, so many of the old clip of fighter planes and the guys manning the radar areas are a little older, and it seemed as padding. Overall, a decent, but hardly inspired the film that extreme fans of the genre might like - everyone else to see it on your own risk.
