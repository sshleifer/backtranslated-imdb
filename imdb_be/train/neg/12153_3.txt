Feeding the masses was just another movie trying to make some money off of the zombie craze that is happening around, mostly due to the popularity of films such as Land Of The Dead and the series Resident Evil. <br /> <br /> It starts at the television station, which is guarded by the military, and have reported that the virus Lazarus (zombies) are close to the location and the city will soon be free to do their business again. The problem is that it is completely wrong. Zombie working furiously, and only a small minority of people know. Among them, the Torch (William Garberina), the camera man, Gray (Rachael Morris), a leading anchor woman (who, for whatever reason, Shelly playlist on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military convoy. Torch Gray and against the lies of the people, and the station is currently in charge of the Secret Service (or any other public body), and they are much censorship. <br /> <br /> This film gives itself a pat on the back cover on the box saying: "We believe that the masses are fed at a higher level than any of the three" Dead "films of George A. Rombero.Â» The source of this quote lost trust me. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this movie is BAD. I do not mean bad as I was expecting more (I obviously was, though), but I mean bad that I could not find any redeeming qualities in the film at all. Actions in all parts, either made or too wooden. Does anyone remember his lines or they read off Key cards? I can not even think about what the best part of the film was a better actor / actress. There actually was not. If I had to give the nod to someone, I would say Roger, a military convoy was, perhaps, the most interesting character, but it does not actually say. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to convey, even though the box cover looks pretty good (this is what initially attracted me to the movies). 3/10
