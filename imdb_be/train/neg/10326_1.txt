Once again, the Canadian television outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unviewed after the premiere episode. <br /> <br /> The last time I remember the comedy had to cause a reaction in the business we call laughter. How ridiculous it is to beat the stereotype of all white people who think that all Muslims are terrorists? Well, maybe a joke just stick it to the masses. But not 30 minutes. This is called the beating a dead horse. SNL would even know to give up after the commercial break. <br /> <br /> In addition, let's conflict in these scenarios. Will she or will not she serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast for Ramadan? If Ramadan to begin? Ohhhhh Emy this stuff here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! What characters? They are all expressions of cardboard without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to another. This is the point of comedy situation. We need to have a strong, interesting, dynamic characters, so we constantly addresses to the TV every week. We need to care about these characters to worry about what kind of trouble they're going to get next week. If I had never seen these characters, it will be too early. Fortunately, I can not remember their names (note the CBC - it's not a very good sign). <br /> <br /> And the cast is so fresh. It is more a problem in the foundry than actors. None of these people actually embody the characters they play. They just seem to act their part, as if they were working on the film of the week. Soaps require actors who live and breathe the character - to make us fall in love with them - wherever they are inseparable from character to portray. Watch any American comedy, and you will see how easy it is identified by symbols. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the actors seem to consider this project as if it could be a platform for bigger and better things, instead of one big symbol of life, for which they will spend the next 8 years drawing. This level of lack of interest in the characters and the show project. But to be honest, given the concept of lame and horrible letter, there is not much for the actors to do, but they say that their line and try not to crash into any furniture. As another commentator noted, it seems a television movie, not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And in directing or lack there of! What can I say, Canada has so much talent, to look at what makes the Comedy Channel of Puppets kills and punched Up. Look at the Trailer Park Boys (not the reason the film was bitten by a large dog helium). Look at any American show to see the potential of our talent, as well as where many of our stars to go to find a decent job. <br /> <br /> Give CBC credit, they know exactly how to build publicity for non-events, Remember, "The One"? No - well, do not even try to find out some names of characters on the show, because it's sure to go the way of the dodo <br /> <br /> Let's hope for a full-scale strike ACTRA so that nothing like this. CEB goes out for a good long time.
