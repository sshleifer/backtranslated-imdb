This Italian film sex-horror begins very similar to soft core porn and turns into a mystery that has several many loose ends to be good, that and the fact that it's pretty boring just makes the film unwatchable quite to my taste, the only thing really worth seeing are the many boobs are distributed throughout the film. History is a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring women to his castle, where he continues to take them into prison, to go crazy, and it would kill them. They show nudity, but they never show the murder at this point in the film. Then the guy is a good red head at the party, and continues to do with her and marry her. He has a thing for red heads, you can see how his beloved ex-wife Evelyn one too, she too died under circumstances that were not business audience of viewers. After many Talky murder scenes begin to happen with the participation of snakes, foxes and the like. At this point it is easy enough to find out who is responsible for the murder and the motive is that you have a meaningless end where all the wraps are not so nice. This film is just not working for me, he left me with many questions and the last third of the film simply did not have boobs first two-thirds of the movie. Explaining the death of Evelyn would help the film, as it were a final, where Evelyn did rise from the grave. Of course the title is not quite misleading, as it seems to leave the grave, but not under its own power. Blood is very easy for the most part, as there is a scene with the foxes and the scene at the end with quite a bit of blood, too. I just thought that for the most part of this film was a bit boring.
