Now this movie is not going to scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two major causes and one less good, it is for three reasons, not <br /> <br /> The first reason for this. interesting special effects. I found them very interesting and exciting few. To see the hair growing on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was terrible, especially if they are involved in a ménage à trois. <br /> <br /> Of interest is the fact that this Marsha Hunt is the famous "Brown Sugar" from the Rolling Stones songs, and that she was in the infamous nude scene in London, part of the rock musical Hair . <br /> <br /> In addition, special effects, there were two other points of note in this film, and they were bred several times during the end credits. I've lost count, but I swear that Sybil Danning drew these items to us in the credits again for at least a dozen, and perhaps more. Theyu been the most distinctive feature of the film.
