I went to see this movie with my 17 y.o. daughter. I insisted that we go to a matinee show, and not because I'm a cheapskate, but just a feeling I had. In the spirit of NASCAR, it's a dream to sponser. So blatant advertising, it almost qualifies as an info-mercial, if it were not for the so-called action. Keeping traditions, Herbie franchise continues its cheesy storylines, the car only "vehicle" (no pun intended) for this cornball motion pictures. Herbie earlier installments (although cheesy, a) was carried out over a significant time, making them a bit easier to digest. Ms. Lohan, who reigns drama queen Disney has little acting ability. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would participate in such a project. Only the snack bar was a plagiarism!
