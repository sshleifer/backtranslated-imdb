So do not even think about renting this from stores because it's one hell of a bad movie. You might think that JJ Abrams wrote the film. In general, the rat flushed down the toilet, and somehow has to get back. Supporters absolutely terrible "Shrek" might enjoy, but supporters of the "Wallace & Gromit" are likely to turn away in disgust. Also, why do not they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation ?? For the film Aardman ?? !! Obviously, Aardman skipped while they allow Dreamworks do it all. Wrong, wrong, wrong !!! Almost every character is terrible, besides quaint Man frog, which is just for the movie villain. But everything else about the film dull, dull, dull !!! I almost fell asleep wistfully watch this movie. No, wait, actually, I fall asleep with longing to watch this movie. It's just awful. But, fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek."
