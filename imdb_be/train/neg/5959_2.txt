Spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words can guarantee you a terrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. BRAIN fits these words perfectly. Scary scenario idiotic action and fun special effects make this a must for every fan BAD movie. Horror fun. postproduction team looks she gave up. What makes the brain excitement in the second half, he was actually trying to be nice! Maybe a little ingenuity and consistency, except that this is a joke? <br /> <br /> This is the Christmas season. Mother and daughter killed by one of the funniest looking villains ever. One day later, a rebel teenager gets into enough trouble that he is sent to a psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If a police officer Â«s head chopped off and someone else's blood on it and a bloody ax told you some of the children did it, who would you believe? What starts as a funny turns tedious towards the end, when the brain is trying to be serious. A child can not be frightened by a scary moment. BRAIN too ridiculous notion to try to be sandy. Research Institute of Psychological larger plants! Our ugly villain and his cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst I've seen action. Viewer opinion strongly recommended.
