Ghost. Remake, of course. The original was a terrible psychological thriller, and one that has improved with time. By comparison, the 1999 remake of this classic. There's no character development here, just cartoons (whore authoritative brain, "I'll get us out of here," well done, oh so sensitive bibliophile). But, seeing as how it has bet on the special effects, which are the "star", I believe that the characters you can empathize is a secondary issue. Unfortunately, ridiculous effects. Meow cherubs, elastic door annoying dead children, who can not speak properly ... and stupid juicy ending that makes it darnedest to, to give you a new age enema butterflies and rainbows. Ill take my Skittles verbally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I loved you with «The Cowboys». Enough.
