* Spoilers and extreme bashing ahead * <br /> <br /> If this is the show first started, I found it bearable and fun. Fairly OddParents was a cartoon that kids and adults love. He also had high ratings, along with Spongebob. But he began to fall due next crap that Butch Hartman and his team shoved the show. <br /> <br /> First of all, the toilet humor is not all that funny. You can easily pull off a quick laugh from the small Kiddie to belch, but it's pretty much just the audience who will laugh at this cliche joke. Next there is a kiddie fun. Lol, we can see people in their underwear, and we can see people dressing up in clothes. LOLOLOL !!! I just can not stop laughing at this cheerful luck! Somebody help me! But, this show certainly will not suck that bad if it were not stereotypes. You have seen how the team reflected the Aussie? They saw them as nothing more than a kangaroo loving, boomerang throwing simpletons who live in the hot desert. But now ... Is a coup de grace Why is this show really sucks the loudest of them all ... Excessive jokes !!! The show is constantly pulling the same jokes (most of them unfunny), thinking it as a great thing ever! Cosmo mostly one to blame. I hated the way they continued to mention the «Super Toilet» (which also has a combination of kiddish humor in it as well) and Cosmo panic. And who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every parent would be damned in Dimmsdale use this one e-mail address episode? You know, the one in which each of the parents (not paying attention to other parents say it) will speak EXACTLY the same sentence before breaking in your child's room? Yes, it can be a first-class humor for some people, but this is purely a s *** others. <br /> <br /> If I'm not mistaken, I think Butch Hartman said something about the termination of the show. Thank God! All around my area says that's, like, funny Nickelodeon show ever. I just can not agree with this ?? I think this is just another pile of horse manure that we have in our station cartoon every day, only worse.
