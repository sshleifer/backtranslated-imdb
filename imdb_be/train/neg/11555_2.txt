Big Chopper movie - too bad it was the producer, and not part of the script. The main plot summary - a man with a fetish red is inviting such a woman in his apartment only to go to some fancy coma and continues in the near future, in their varying degrees of success. Just cutting the crew behind the scenes have to think that the film was classified as I did and cut the heck out of the film. Nothing is flowing, you get lost, which the redhead he at the time (it is turned off, that one before ??), and most of the time it looks like the camera man was cut down and restored the shooting, when he woke up. Not that I blame him, I cut down 2-3 times and had to rewind and recover, to try to recover what little story that really exists. Warning, if you see the end DO NOT attempt to connect it with anything that happens before - you just get the aneurysm. Not worth the time, effort, or God forbid money. The only reason to get 2 instead of 1 - a slim chance that the hacking occurred between the release of the movie version and terrible that I have observed.
