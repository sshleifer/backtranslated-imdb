This film has made it one of my top 10 most scary movies. Horrible. <br /> <br /> There have been continuous minutes where there was not a struggle with a particular monster. There were not any chances for the development of any kind, they were too busy running from one goal to another. I had no emotional attachment (except for the big bad machine, which wanted to destroy them) <br /> <br /> The scenes were clearly stolen from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The Phantom of the scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yodami, OBEE One and Vader. <br /> <br />> Spider car in the beginning was just as Frodo attacks spider in the Return of the King. (Elijah Wood is a victim in both films) and wait for it ...... hypnotizes (stinger) and wraps its prey them ..... Well hello ???? <br /> <br />> A whole machine compared with men theme was Matrix..or Terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are a few examples, but why waste time? And will somebody tell me what happened to the Nazis?!?! ???? Nazi <br /> <br /> There was a minor storyline ran to juvenile detention. The film could not decide if it was a child or an adult movie cinema and not a lot either. <br /> <br /> Just awful. Real disappointment, to say the least. Save your money.
