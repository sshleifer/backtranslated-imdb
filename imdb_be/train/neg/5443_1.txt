Sorry, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director is not able to put it together. There's a lot of action, a lot of promises, but it comes off phony. The director did not do their job. Promising action off inaccurate. So much seems to be managed in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "RageÂ» (DirecTV lends it in 1996) is simply not worth the time to watch it. Another director would have done better.
