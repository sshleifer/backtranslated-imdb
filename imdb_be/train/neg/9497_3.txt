you have a strong stomach. Holden was actually 55 years old on the set, but looked about 70 years old and he only lived for 8 years. Once Holden said. "I'm more than twice your age," Well, try triple grandfather! "Old enough to be your father" theme, they were shooting for not working. Giving pensioners sometimes wind up with legal teens. More power to them, but that does not mean that I want to watch it. It is not a matter of judgment, but the digestive tract. I love the food, where it belongs. Lenz's fun to watch and 70s cars, clothes, furniture, etc. make it worth when it comes to late night cable, and you want to see something, to collapse on the bed. It would be nice to see another blonde Lenz, who put the guitar, get more scenes. Attractive, spacious ... Who was this chick? I'm going to try and learn.
