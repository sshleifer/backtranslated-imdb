I enjoyed the feeling of opening a few minutes, but the 20-minute meeting in the I was abundant applying fast-forward button. Too many shots Stuart (Michael Zelniker), going from room to room, down the corridor, through the door and down the street, and the same number of shots of his brooding and intricate. He gave me the impression that the story was originally conceived as a short (20-30 minutes), and then drawn in particular as a labor of love between the director and the star grieve Zelniker (together they wrote the script). <, Br /> <br /> It may be more interesting, if any of the characters to say something that I have not heard before, said in many other films, or if the ending was not - disappointing - one I predicted three minutes a film (atypical for independent / smaller studios). At least his heart was in the right place - this is not your standard Hollywood template manipulative nonsense.
