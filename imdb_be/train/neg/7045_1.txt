This must be the worst, and I mean worst biker movie ever made! And that says a lot because the line is long ugly types and smells! <br /> <br /> At the moment, at least, we know what happened with ginger after she was rescued from Gilligan's Island! Scared looking Tina Louise (she was probably afraid someone will see this mess!) Is a stranded motorist who suffers the most repellent motorcycle gang in the history of cinema. But do not worry fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a hick town doctor comes to the rescue! Pow! Grind! Boom! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> Only the good points of this "bomb" some lovely women, some ridiculous fight scenes, and still "sexy" Tina Louise!
