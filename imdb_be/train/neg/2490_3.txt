What a sad spectacle of these fellows do television, running hours on his career stumbled on a little rusty carcass of the ship - the boat can be more appropriate. All production feels cheap and shabby, and it did not help the "great name" star, who barely capable of spitting out a few lines, which he gave in a reliable fashion. <br /> <br /> As soon as possible to make supporting the growth of the above cast material; they are clearly looking at the clock here. Came from the scene, he receives a salary, go home and try to forget about it <br /> <br /> It's not particularly badly scripted or filmed. there is no real Clangers, it's just a very soothing, and shot in a very limited quantity of compressed sets with a small cast of extras. Walk a little strange; previous embarrassingly romantic sub-plot only begins after starting the main action, which makes it feel like it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Maiden Voyage scores a couple points for being killed properly, and to be fun to play "spot the bit parters Kiwi"; most of the cast are graduates or Shortland Street, Xena: Warrior Princess. The saddest thing about this production is that this film is likely to be their big break.
