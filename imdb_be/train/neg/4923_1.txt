This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen. This film has nothing positive about it. Some of you people really like this movie! I saw a lot of films about Dracula and I liked everything I saw, but when I saw this film, I said to myself: "What the hell is this?" What a stupid movie. Now they have Dracula to become what he is because he is a Judas. For those of you who do not know who Judas betraying Jesus Christ, and then felt guilty, he hanged himself. You must be kidding. This is the most stupid reason I've ever heard, why Dracula became angry. Who asked for the reason anyway? What part of sh ** this film. Who ever came up with this sorry excuse for a film must be defeated. Even Dracula terrible. If you've ever seen the movie, you would not even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! It assumed the name to impress me? Do not waste your time and money on this garbage.
