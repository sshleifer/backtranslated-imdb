Oh yeah the 1980s, the time of Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and many other action stars that are hiding in the remote jungles of demolished commies. While I can not believe how movies like Rambo, missing and rare courage (and who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) To make money at the box office, they `turgid effect of buckwheat with festivals rather of putting the agenda right day wing and they have dated very badly. TROMA`S WAR is a tongue in cheek take on this type of film, but you`ll have to ask themselves whether they really need to substitute in the first place? Of course not. TROMA`S WAR lacks any difficulty - even though it makes the point that there is no `no real difference between the right-wing tyrants and the left wing of them - and sometimes feels more like a g-class film, you send up. Maybe it?
