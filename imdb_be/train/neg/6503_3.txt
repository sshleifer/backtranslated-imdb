Hopkins really succeed in this attempt, as a screenwriter and director, gives us the feeling that we do not know absolutely no one in the film. However, perhaps this is the problem. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously sophisticated and taken from very deep inside, but it is so indifferent. There are no signs. We never know who is who, thus, there is no investment on our part. <br /> <br /> This can be a screenwriter to mix with their characters. This? Maybe. By this I do not mean that the Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean that there is no message. Film Hopkins experiment. At first glance, one could make the case that we are talking about would-be writer, who at the very moment of his meeting with destiny, realizes that life came, and / or success of blind chance, he will be thrown in the "air flow" collision between two points in time, dreams, thoughts and reality. Nevertheless, it is unremitting Cerebral that leaves no room for any hint of emotion, even the tiny, pretty rudimentary degree allows us to communicate with their characters. <br /> <br /> I do not think the waitress and bright school shaky, machinegun-speed camera-work and editing is separated me, but thinking about the film I began to realize that it was a lot to do with it. There are so many films in the past decade, in which the reduction or camera movement has sound effects, and other weathering deterioration of technical gadgets. I think in this case it was justified in that its aim was to create an impressionistic responsiveness dreams. Nevertheless, I knew almost nothing about Slipstream while watching, and I went out the same way. And I just do not care, because Hopkins has made no effort to make us care. There are interactive movies, and there are movies that are sitting in a rocking chair and knit, is not aware of your presence. Slipstream is the latest.
