I have a copy of it on VHS, I think they (television network) should play in each year for the next twenty years. So we do not forget that it was and that we remember not to make the same mistakes again. How to put some people in the director's chair, where they do not belong. This film Rappin 'like vaudeville musical, for those who can not sing or act. This film is just as much fun as trying to teach a "blind" to ride on a city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood (Peebles) has just been released from prison, and he went back to the old neighborhood. Employee time all-in-need a good offense, of course. John heads back to the old street and the dog meets children and old women of his peers homeys, as they dance and sing all along the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it, if I was a sentimental, or if in fact someone was smoking pot drug prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. In any case, it's bad directed, scripted, acted and even has made (I never thought I was that) satire of life in the ghetto with "Hud". Although, I think that part of the redemptive history through the fight sequences wannabe bands and dances, his friends take care of their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from the torn down and cleaned. <br /> <br /> Forget Sonny spoon, Mario could win the Oscar for that, compared with this Rap. Well, if you're going to have a desire to laugh yourself silly, and three-quarters of confused, be sure to drink first. <br /> <br /> And please look responsibly. (No stars, better luck next time!)
