If you think about the revelations that the main character in the "Bubble" comes to an end in the film, I think the last few years, "The Machinist," with Christian Bale. The only difference between these two films literal physical weight characters. <br /> <br /> understated, but it is a realistic portrayal of small town life. The name is a cause for contemplation. Maybe we, the viewers are those «Bubble», as we do not give out in thin films of 90 minutes running time. The audience response was often smug and deliberate, clearly showing how detached people can see any thread of humanity in the signs of a stranger to himself. These characters are the people who are called by those who put George Bush back into office for a second term. <br /> <br /> It is sobering to consider as reality TV has spoiled our sense of reality when watching the audience jump legs to exit as soon as the credits role. This film has its advantages and is worth considering the fact that he does not speak directly.
