I'm not a big fan of slapstick puppet, but I think they are an interesting story. I recently tried to test material from each era puppet, but a chance to see Joe shorts do not seem so easy; it's the only one I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some say that quality problems with Joe era shorts definitely not the fault of Joe, and I suspect that this is so. Joe as a performer by far the worst thing about it. The fact that bothers me the most about this was mentioned in another comment: pitting boys against other third violates all comedy-team / Stooges ethos. Perhaps the style of Joe was perceived, by those responsible, as is not really appropriate in - although there was no real external conflicts between him and the other - and this was their way of working around it <br /> <br. /> What about the names of some other shorts end Stooges? Defined by a lack of creativity going on there; that such a thing cause or the effect of drying up the market shorts?
