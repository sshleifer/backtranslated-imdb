I saw it on TV at night ?? or, more precisely, I clicked on another channel every so often to watch commercials, if I could not stand to watch it anymore. It was bad. In fact, really bad. Not "so bad it's good" just flat out bad. How do you get funding? Who would have thought that a good idea? my friend actor listened and said he was not good enough to play the bad guy, but I think they meant was "to save himself and escape from this steaming pile of @ # $%." I bet that the rest the cast was given the opportunity. To be fair the action was difficult to judge because of the terrible fake American climbing. The shooting was dullllllllllll. Action was uncomfortable and unnatural. The dialogue was pointless. Until now, the saddest thing was the ship. In real life pair Interislander is battered boat and on film entirely cleaned well. Instead of trying very unsuccessfully, to make it look like a new crew ship with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusty polls, I'm not kidding, they could modify the script to explain or even to celebrate wretchedness. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Do not watch this movie, even in jest.
