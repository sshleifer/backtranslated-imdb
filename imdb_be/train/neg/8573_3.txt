I do not like Sean Penn's direction very much, and this early work, the Indian runner, is no exception. The film does not have a core, it is tinged with some redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness, in all honesty that infects much of the work of Penn, his last work, even more than before. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole party seems to produce a fundamentally banal product, supposedly in some fidelity honesty, but ultimately be for the most part, glorified wrestling matches and morality, almost as if Hallmark card has developed a line of greeting the Hell's Angels, and make me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a great film. incumbent Viggo Mortensen is much, much more plausible than it is here that funny Vice, which he did with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The film is dead is pointless, and it seems that this exercise, a number of methods, more than a story. Kudos to Charles Bronson, but who proves that he can act. And I wanted more character Sandy Dennis. Lousy 3 out of 10 for this shit The Indian Runner.
