[I've seen this film once later on public television stations, so I do not know if it's on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the «Baby Burlesks» (sic), that Shirley Temple did in the early 1930s. Hard to believe that someone would let their daughter is in this picturesque little film, which today can only assume this side of "child pornography". <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple stars in the cast, which is likely to have an average age of 5. They were in diapers, and in the lounge, which serves milk instead of alcohol. "Cash" in the form of candy. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays a "femme fatale» sashays to the bar and talks with the soldiers who make suggestive comments about it (!). But Shirley is not necessary to actually their lollipops / cash because her purse full of those other "people." <br /> <br /> At the same time a little black boy makes suggestive dance at a nearby table (!). <, Br /> <br /> strange film. ,, kids, using a colorful dialogue plays the role of adults in the cabin. Who came up with this material in any way?
