After watching «The Bodyguard» last night, I was compelled to write a review about it. <br /> <br /> This can be a pretty decent film if it were not for the terrible camera-work. It was annoying beyond. The angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the fight sequences. The plan was even creepy. <br /> <br /> The story of Sonny Chiba was hired as a bodyguard, who are ready to bring it to the top of the drug ring. He walked over to Leigh Judy, who never enough straight from Chiba. Lee participated in the drug ring is deeper than thought Chiba, as the Mob and other gang of thugs are after her. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, and despite the horrible dubbing, it might be a good movie. Taking into account the best direction and editing, I'm sure it would be a classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it's more like another cheesy 70's action movie <br /> <br />. Note: The opening sequence has a quotation mark «Pulp Fiction» fans, and then continues karate school in Times Square, which is in the has nothing to do with the rest of the film <br /> <br /> Rating :. 4 of 10
