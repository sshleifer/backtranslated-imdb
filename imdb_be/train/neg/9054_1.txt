If you hate animals accents, you will hate this movie. And to make it worse, you see, Patrick Swayze, trying to be a redneck. I really can not stand accents cattle. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good in Sling Blade, but it is annoying in this film. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How hickish this film can get? The storyline was stupid. I'm usually not intentional films, but I could not stand this film. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see a sharpened blade. <br /> <br /> My mom found this film for $ 5.95 at Wal-Mart ... numbers ... I think I'll wrap it up and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. It may just be that I can not stand animals accents usual, or that I can not stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe when Patrick Swayze was not in it. I did not laugh once in a movie. I laugh at something silly usual. If they showed Someones fingers get broken, I would have laughed. the fingers of people getting smashed accidentally always make me laugh.
