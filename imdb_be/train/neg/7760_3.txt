In the Fiji Islands, the greedy and unscrupulous owner Valalola Primal Park Resort invites investors and guests at the opening side of his compound, which consists of the hotel and the zoo in order to find partners for its opening. If a bunch of college smalltime thieves puts the virus in the security system, to participate in a scavenger hunt, the greatest attractions of the zoo ?? sabretoothes from prehistory developed with the DNA found in the fossil ?? escape, killing the owner and a security guard for fun. <br /> <br /> incredibly lame and cheap "saber-toothed Attack" is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. Symbols terrible and not funny or nice, and the history of the terrible Jurassik Park rip-off with poor collection of clichés. Basically, all the lines and situations, poor and stupid, but the winner when the guard explains that sabretoothes are bulimia and how to kill for pleasure. .
