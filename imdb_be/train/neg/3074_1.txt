Even for cocaine permeated the 1980s is poor. I do not understand why anyone would want to spend celluloid, time, effort, money and brain cells audience to make such a mess. If you are going to do a comedy, make it funny. If you want to remove the debris, as it is keep it to yourself. If you are going to release it as a joke, like this: DO NOT !!! I mean, it was a joke right? Someone please tell me that it was a joke. Please.
