the lowest score possible is a star? it's a shame. in fact, I'm going to lobby for IMDb for "zero star" option. give this movie one star even gives too much. I'm the only one who noticed microphones hanging over the head of the bunker at the station? and action, or should I say lack of it? apparently, the talent was not a factor when the casting director came to the city. my little sister elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion. and these fake Irish accents were like nails on a chalkboard. the only thing that could make this film would have been worse ... oh, wait, no, no, this is as bad as it can get.
