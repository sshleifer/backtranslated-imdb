I love Seth Green. His appearances on the show, that 70 years is always worth watching, but last night, I felt the show needed to redesigned. Four single young men inherited an apartment in New York, most of us will die. Grandma was the heir to have a space in the first place. So I felt the need for realism was withdrawn. Anyway, the story of four best friends who get this apartment was not believable. I would have been thrilled when they had to move into one of their parents, which could provide a great sense of humor and dysfunctional about the show set up. There did not seem to be a lot of humor in it. I just watch, because it falls before My Name is Earl on winning Thursday night. I think they have to go back, scrap the series, and start all over again. We need more families involved in the series. How about Seth and his friends go to their stupid parents in the suburbs after a fire burns in their place down. They could Dabney Coleman play father and Estabrook, play a dysfunctional mother and brother and sister. The list of features with someone like Seth Green and endless chain blow it.
