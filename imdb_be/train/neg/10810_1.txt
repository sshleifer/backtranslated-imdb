There's only one thing I have to say about this film - a scene where Shaq is in the music along with the nature of Francis Capra about wanting to be gin; never seen this movie. The history of terrible, horrible acting (c'mon, it's Shaq!), And I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy (equally scary) twice before you ever saw the movie.
