As it is a rip-off with the "Be There" ever be so loved? People say that this is proof that a decent, honest man can succeed, despite the lack of intelligence. They are wrong. The film is proof that success is: I hope that your friend has invested all his money at Apple, and Atari; I hope that your shrimp boat is the only one in the sea, when the storm breaks; hope you do not die from the shock when you are, fortunately, was shot in the buttocks, and not in the back; I hope that you will not get AIDS from his wife. This film is also politically reactionary - all who rebel against social conventions lose their legs, doing drugs, beat his girlfriend, or die young. Furthermore, product placement in the film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. Emotionally manipulative film, which is very, very empty.
