The film is a little disappointing, I would say, I was the stilted acting, anyway. In many cases, I just could not feel that facial expressions correspond to words spoken or the intention of the scene. Angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should make the audience believe that he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). It does not happen here. <br /> <br /> The comment about writers Assuming that you already know the characters tended. They do things and say things that come out of nowhere: the character of Andrew accuses his parents to send signals to each other at dinner; then it explodes and runs out, telling his father: "Do not touch me, you f ***!". Maybe if we had seen the prequel, we would know where everything that comes in, but not a prequel, so we are a little at sea as to the cause! <br /> <br /> One odd, bizarre thing that Andrew does it go to the old stone quarry, sit on the edge overlooking the "stagnant water" below; Then he reaches into his pocket jeans and retrieves a pack of cigarettes and lights one. He did the same thing three times in the course of the film; I think we should see it as a tortured Oktoikh loneliness and anger? Maybe once, but three times? It may even four times, I lost count <br /> <br /> To be honest, that is the fact that he recently learned that he was adopted. it occurs very early in the film, so it does not make sense any dramatic changes, it can be subjected to because of this discovery. It is not clear when exactly why it is so bitter, or, if we are talking about something else. <br /> <br /> I think it's kind of Lynchian feelings for the film, but the director must be the first time really trying to scale such a mountain so early in his career?
