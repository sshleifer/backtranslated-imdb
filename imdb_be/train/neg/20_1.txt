This movie was terrible. At first, I just read the short story, and looked good, so I watched it. The acting was terrible. it was almost like an actor camera shy. all seemed fake. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .. I watched it at least 20 times .... <br /> <br /> plot was also crap. the authors are probably sleep deprived when they came to the lines. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it's a good kind of bad movie. one that you keep only watch to see how much worse it can get, so that later you can tell other people how you can not believe how terrible the film was. <br /> <br /> I think that everyone should look at it, so that we could better appreciate the other, real, movies.
