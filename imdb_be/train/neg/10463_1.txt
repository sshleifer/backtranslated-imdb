This movie was so promising. I was very excited about this film. In the end, it was ridiculous, at best, painful at worst. Acting style ran the gamut from really, really flat (angels, wife and daughter) for animation (character Casper). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to convey information to the audience instead of the real people who are trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the place on the "error." It's pretty much an insult to the audience's ability to understand things. In defense of this scene, however, he got the biggest laugh of the film. I read that they have spent a lot of money to travel to various overseas locations. It is a pity that they did not use it. I do not feel like I was transported to an exotic location. Anybody can insert footage of the Colosseum in Rome. But to end on a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I liked the graphics, which were reflected in the decoding machines. It is my opinion (and that is all, that is) that if Schmaltz ratio would be much much lower, and ACTION ratio would be significantly increased, this movie would have been good.
