Why? Because only one reason, there has never been a magic scene in any movie, what Anne Margrethe singing «Bye Bye Birdie» at the opening. She repeats it again in the final, and (in a different mood!). And perfectly. Remove it and see. Even if it is all that you see. You will agree, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> All of the original was so good it just does not need a remake, I'm sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave creditable performances, as well as Secrets and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version had to give their "all", but it's like trying to improve the "Casablanca" - it simply can not be done! It is even annoying to find yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to evaluate the alteration, and it just does not hold, through no fault of the actors.
