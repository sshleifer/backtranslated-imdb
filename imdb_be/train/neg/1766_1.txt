Baldwin really stooped down to make such films. The script, music, almost everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Sound FX does not sound real, they stick out too much (technical devices, etc.) when they are trying to make a movie about things like this, at least, try to get real with it drop those extra beeps and bleeps, because these devices do not really make loud noises like this. Natural sounds like footsteps and such do not exist, which gives it empty, as the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The direction seems to be normal for such a low-budget film (I certainly hope that this low-budget production), although this seems to be pretty amateurish at times. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem empty and false, they just do not cast this film very well. I assumed would be that it would be a better idea to make Baldwin to speak some Spanish, you make Spanish actors speak in English when we all know that they have a language that is more vivid and alive, so the performance of the actors could be affected largely, if used odd language. I mean, can finally someone understood how silly it sounds to make international actors speak in English with a bad accent? It had long since buried the corpse in the production of the film. The film crew had ever heard of the subtitles? This film once again managed to reflect European police as lazy and corrupt, society is vulnerable and helpless. I mean, when the plot goes again like "Interpol can not make a nest, so let's call the American one, to bring down this international syndicate" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures treads on the same path as Colombia before it, just to make films for the hell of it. I would imagine that they have a self-esteem too. Buyers need to buy every dirty title only because Sony releases something good few times a year? Maybe they should have used the same team as someone who makes Di Que Si - Say I Do. He spoke in Spanish, and Paz Vega Santi Millan and do a decent job of keeping the film afloat. It looks and sounds much better! Let the Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
