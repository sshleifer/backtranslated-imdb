As a supporter of a horror movie, I try to see all the important news of the genre, especially those that are the product of my home movies. And I can say that "The Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" in Russian his title) is one of the weakest among them the film. Firstly, it is not terrible, even a small child, he walks so slowly and predictably, that there is no room for a real horror. Frankly, it's bad at all points :. From blunt story (I do not know why Russian producers / director decided to turn the classic story of the Ukrainian witchcraft in some lame and absurd modern America thriller I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer ?? it does not excite a little) and work Threatening actors and cheese. All participants, including leading Valery Nikolaev and Eugenia Hook, which are well known in Russia look like a wooden doll or something like that, and it seems to me that they did not even bother to play at all, only spoke their English lines without expression. And in the end, I do not understand why they were shooting this film in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong turn. At least they could throw some American or British actor for the leading parts to make it look more convincing. The same can be said about the so-called "small American town of origin", which were shot in Estonia, and look like this. The only positive thing that I found in "The Power of Fear" is the visual effects. They are not perfect, but pretty good for a Russian film. And the music in the order, at least, it does not irritate me. That's why I give it two stars. In general, if you want to see a good horror movie ?? do not waste time and money on this sad film. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror, I would advise you to find a copy of "Wii or evil spirit." It really is a stunning film based on the same novel as "The Power of Fear", but much, much better.
