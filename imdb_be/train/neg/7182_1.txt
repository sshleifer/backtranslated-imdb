I could not recommend a Christmas movie more than a useless piece of nonsense (believe me, there is required a double negatives - it's so bad). This film has been in trouble with the opening credits, when it became clear that the writer was the same person as a songwriter. Musical numbers all too long, and none of them are any good ( "Thanks a lot" has a decent tone, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I would love to carry a chain worn Scrooge in a strange sequence of hell movie than sit through an insult movie musicals again. <br /> <br /> the only interesting part of this movie (wholly unintended by the way) includes Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. dressed in white powder stupid suit, Guinness tog reared through his scene in what was or attempt to make it appear as if it is floating as a pr view, or show his utter contempt of the order to be in this terrible movie. Albert Finney, meanwhile, combines the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton, to create his hopelessly disgusting character Quasimodo / Scrooge. Scrooge Finney is so disgusting man, it's hard to believe its transformation. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this abomination of filmmaking at all costs.
