Johnny and Jeremy vampires of some sort. Minus the fangs, of course. They are dark, bitter substance of nothing better to do than to spread their own suffering. Through its charms (namely, a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively), they lure desperate souls that they continue to torment and torture. This is more or less based on this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> This is not a mixture of black humor that I can easily sign up, partly because it bothers me to introduce the audience to the introduction of the sleazy, the protagonist. I really enjoyed, however, the sound and the melody rapid fire (and, presumably, a very witty) comments. I was very impressed by the strong acting of the cast, particularly THELIS David's; Only the character of Jeremy seemed too two-dimensional. Photos and music as dramatic and grim, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What's really not about me "naked" (and the main reason I will never recommend it to anyone), so it is not a time, it seems, is misogyny like a way to express their sorrow. In other words, in a world that sucks so bad that the difference, if one inflicts some pain on the girls, do not you? To suggest (as some of them on this site) that Johnny is not so bad person because he is not as rough on the girls, like Jeremy, it seems quite absurd to me. They are both terrible, unpleasant people. And they are particularly passionate about hurting a woman every time they get a chance. One could argue that Johnny finally gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass. But still, his sadistic behavior Jeremy regarded to some extent as a laughing matter. And I could be wrong, but I believe that most people who absolutely love this film also find this aspect of the film's darkly comic.
