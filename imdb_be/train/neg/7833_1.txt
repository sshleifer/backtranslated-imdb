I just saw the third week of Nightmares Stephen Korolev and fantastic mini-series; I mean, I've seen six episodes so far. I must say that these stories are very weak. I read Stephen King Skeleton Crew, a collection of his short stories, which was published in the reverse way. I remember most of the stories were on average poor, but there was one that was really good, if not outstanding. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say that just because this mini-series from the collection of stories by Stephen King does not mean that it will be good. In fact, if his previous collection of short stories of any indication, most of this mini-series will be an average of a meager. <br /> <br /> In defense of Stephen King, I do not read these new stories. Maybe they are good as the stories in the book and can not be easily adapted to television, or maybe it was the wine writers in an attempt to write an interesting scenario. Who knows. In addition, these short stories may have been made specifically for this mini-series, but not for printing purpose. Maybe it can be a problem. If Stephen King presented these stories buckwheat editor, I am sure that the editor should immediately told him to make it more interesting, because as it is, it's just boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear from all this is that the problem is related to the history / script rather than the actors and actresses, because this mini-series has some great people working on it. <br /> <br /> Seeing this mini-series really makes me appreciate the old Â«Twilight Zone" series. Each series was only half an hour, but it was compelling and riveting. I do not understand why this series can not perform such feat. I am sure that this mini-series was a lot of money to make a good mini-series, but unfortunately, something should not be pressed. <br /> <br /> for example, it was this week two episodes of the show. The first involves a horror story writer who buys a picture painted by the artist, who committed suicide. pachy writer th to see the changes in the film, he goes home. Feeling awkward, he throws out this picture, but it continues to appear next to it. In addition, the portrait of a man in this picture is killing people, and to kill him. (I do not even I will mention the second episode of this week with the participation of criminals and their prey, because it was even sadder than this episode!) <br /> <br /> this is an interesting premise, and so the story has to be good, but after watching this, I I was upset because there were too many gaps in history, as well as foreign material, it has been shown, that did nothing to help the story. After the last stage, I still have more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini-series, but it was too aggravating because of the bad history / script. If this were a movie, I would recommend that people have to wait for movies to come out on cable or such. I would not recommend that he rented at your local video store. However, given that it's on TNT, in the cable channel, I would say, if you have not seen it already, try for one week. If you do not like it this week, then you will not like the previous series, nor things to come, as they all have the same boring rice.
