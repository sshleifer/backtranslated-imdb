This movie was exactly what I expected, not great but not too bad. In my opinion PG13 movies not scary enough, so I already knew what I was going to be bored throughout the film. Of course, there were terrible things that happen in a hotel room, but not all, that we have not already seen. I believe that it does not like, because I thought that there were too many twists and turns occur; he had aged and repetitions. I do not understand, when all things Cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not. There's no explanation for any of the events that occurred. The movie just drags on, and when it finally comes to an end, you want to keep going, because you still waiting around for someone to tell you that the entire movie was about. What I did like was the special effects. In addition, there was a lot of fun from it. Maybe its just me, but I thought it was below average.
