If you really have to watch this movie, because your girlfriend in a romantic mood, even if it's a boy. But prepare yourself, leaving your hp when it comes to radio. <br /> <br /> After watching a good movie as Arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what they come up again in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but no one seems to work hard on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment. The fact that this is a "global" world, it seems, does not come in the minds of those who make movies in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as "Made in Indonesia" with the scent of the west, they get along with him. <br /> <br /> Well, the story is good to start with. And he could develop into a good movie. But the director did not think that the music needs first live music or at the very least, a good play, and secondly good choreography? In this film, playing so bad that it makes you want to cry right in the movie. Every word you hear the following second through actors who sing or play, and it is very annoying while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The choreography, as if they were planning to make a film about the morning gymnastics, but in the end, I thought it would be good to turn it into a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. It is unlikely you will see the dancing, they jump up and down, throw your legs in the air, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there is a happy ending .... But if you can convince your girlfriend that good candlelight dinner is much more romantic does it!
