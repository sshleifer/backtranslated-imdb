Some things need to be clarified. Picture Mark Ferris Sun Mark Ferris, who starred in the film. I know that, because he was my dad. Please remove this picture. In addition, Mark Ferris was a writer, at least one of them. I tried to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It was a year, and if someone can point me in the direction of receiving a copy, that would be great. The film was not so bad, and trying to compare it to today's world of Star Wars, and other high-tech SCI FI-x is futile. When you look, just enjoy it for rediculousness and humor he has. Lighting for the next movie snob and enjoy some less creative and innovative films.
