William Cooke and Paul Talbot Director Shares / writes the credit for this exciting low-budget film about three boys camping in the woods with his horror magazines. His feet propped up the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth ... and scroungy town tramp named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... with leather fame) wanders over and sell four stories of gore in exchange for food and a warm fire. <br /> <br /> One old tale with new tire «The Hook», two teenagers on lover's lane attacked by a crazed killer with a hook for a hand. Another story has several tokers, which need to score some weed. They stumble upon a guy who knows a guy who has some great s # @ t. As they smoke a couple of bags full of their skin starts to turn gray and green, before it falls off and bladder. One of the best stories of the unfortunate man was returning home for Christmas that can not wait until his mother fucking and enjoys talking to his nephew and niece of Satan Claus. Fourth Campfire Tale avid sailor who washes ashore upset an empty treasure chest and ends in the sea chase zombies. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, campfire tales get the point across and really could have been much worse. A little corny, but it is interesting to observe the possible sailor story, except. Act for obvious reasons did not award worthy. Cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, J. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Drain, David AVIN and Paul Kaufman.
