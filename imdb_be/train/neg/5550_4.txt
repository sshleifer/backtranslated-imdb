You understand that you are watching the show at the Taj for eight years, is not it? I could understand the initial curiosity to see an unfamiliar co-exist on the island, but do you think that after seeing the untidy, stinking-ladened characters pushed around through the brush with an egg on a spoon over a half a decade would be enough to get you to do something a little more original (and interesting ). <br /> <br /> I'm not even talking about reality shows, which for the record I find doubtful. It's just hard to suspend disbelief, "Boucher Bill" is the rat, when the entire crew of producers and camera people located in the air-conditioned improvised bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno with Moxy. <br /> <br /> What recourse here? I do not care about them or their tortuous life. I just do not understand. But if you find yourself carried away hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you turn off the TV and just take a trip to your local bus station, where you can see a person as their true habitat. They call them homeless, and for free, you can sit back and marvel at their uncanny ability to extract different cigarette litter from a variety of waste containers, eventually hitting the "pay dirt" and fashioned homemade Dr. Frankenstein-styled cancer -stick, constantly asked people to change for the meal, when the stench of "Aqua VelvaÂ» on their breath enough to suggest the opposite. And the best part? Just like Survivor, every week one of the "Letters" on the "island" of tribal members when they unceremoniously expelled the local office at the Scarecrow without medication state full of schizophrenic kicks into gear! Now, it's fun!
