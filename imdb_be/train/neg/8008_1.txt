For Daniel Auteuil, 'Queen Margot' was much better. For Anastasia Kinski, 'Paris, Texas was much better. The biggest disappointment was from Chris Menges ( `cross and` A World Apart" can not even be compared with that) and Goran Bregovic to use version of the same musical theme from` Queen Margot "for this film (Attention to the end of the film ). If this was an American pop movie, I would not be surprised at all; but for the European film with more independent actors and the director, such a general approach on child abuse, without first understanding a very simple and frustration. There are bad guys who are abducted and sold underage people. There are those poor kids who hate the people who sell them and wait to be rescued by someone. And finally, there is the fact that a great hero who kills all the bad guys and save these poor kids from the bad guys. Each character is displayed in simple black and white: good versus evil. In addition, from the start, I could see how this story will end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I believe that the complex issue of sexual abuse and pedophilia is far more complicated than how it is portrayed in the film is not very original. I think that this film was not alarming, but it is very disappointing.
