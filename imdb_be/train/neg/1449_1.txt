Firstly, before you read any further, you should understand that I am not a neo-Nazi, I'm just trying to properly understand Hitler, to be sure that no one, as it takes power again. <br /> <br /> I saw this series and found it awful. I mean, well, it's interesting, but is it really? I searched for answers and found: absolutely not. First of all, Hitler was not angry at all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even if he is a child. Second, Hitler never wanted to abuse her daughter, in fact, it is very likely that Hitler, in fact, was cheerful and fought all his life to crush this mystery. Thirdly, people will hate me, but it's true: Hitler was charming. Do you think he was able to get to power, when he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. This is a general point I found in an interview with the people who live near or far away from it (of course, not the Jews). <br /> <br /> The series was terrible, because if you think that Hitler was just an evil monster, ugly, and, of course, not charming at all, you are wrong. If you think that you will allow people like him to take power in the country, and you do not want this. If you really understand how Hitler was able to get into power, and stop thinking that it was just awful, you'll be able to find a dangerous political as he (of course, I remember that it was selected) and to terminate the subject, before it is too late. <, Br /> <br /> Life is important for the protection, this series is just terrible, to show us the truth, we are still seeing Hitler so that another will occur just as the first did.
