I was so disgusted with this film, I felt obligated to warn the others. This film has no story or plot hint of purpose. The film begins after the standard "allows you to be scared," the intro movie, which is now everyone watching the film gets used. Thus, we can ignore completely the beginning. Soon we met with the main actress and from that point it becomes clear that you are just wasting your hard earned and it would be better to look static. (If you have not seen the white noise - CZK) duty disgrace and they should all go back to traveling pantomime, where they came from. Having said that, even the best actors in the world will fight to make this film to remotely observe in the state. Their poor performances only contribute to disasters. Senseless violence, and what I can only assume that this word is another stoned "eccentric" writer, who probably considers himself an artist, brought to the film, which will test your patience. It was not until my boyfriend observer turned to me and said: "We watched it for 45 minutes," I realized that this film is as thin and tasteless, like a cup of tea without the tea bag. It is obvious that something is missing, and unfortunately, there was no audience. Rather than suggest that the film is not enough, let me tell you that it has: Dumb Blonde (surprise surprise), victims of a bad monster-guy thing, about 2 minutes from the main story line, which stretched for hours, days, weeks, months ... and credits. <br /> <br /> If you want the rainbow? Well, a bit cheeky blonde, looking at some of the scenes, but expects to want to see her face torn down for the rest of the movie!
