It was really the worst film I've ever seen. Vartan hot, but who is this woman? And it looks absolutely awful through the entire film, the hair is so bad! They speak in a monotone voice like is Nij chemistry. DVD Cover is not even remotely close to what the film actually is. In fact, very sad. I had to fast-forward through some of them, because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know how I am on earth, who would have thought, is it good? hhaha they literally just like to talk and to say "yes", and there is no passion at all. I could not tell at all that they were in love. I'm sorry, but it was the most boring excuse for a movie, I think I've ever seen.
