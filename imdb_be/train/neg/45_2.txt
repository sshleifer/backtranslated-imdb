As the number of video nasty things I have seen is exhausted, this little pile of debris appeared on my "rent" list when I saw what it was. <br /> <br /> The room includes a fashion model or something had been abducted and taken to the jungle, to be held ransom to the motley fools. Some other sucker gets hired to return it and get a bag of money to use as a bargaining chip, though, when he returns with the girl and all the money he receives a significant reduction. He brought the helicopter and the pilot with him, and wow what a pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Of course, they are all quite terrible and recycling will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby there is a cannibal cult which flesheating living god wanders through the forest, as a person looking for King Kong tribeswomen devastate and devour. Now, this guy is just a naked guy with some of the worst-ever make-up, ping-pong for the eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and moans are everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself ducking many of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention an almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, although there is one particular scene, about one second long, where the god is attacking her and pulls her gut, but it's not a factor redeems gore fans. In addition, Jess Franco goes beyond the conventional T and A and B show a long close-up of female genital mutilation, and, unfortunately, the man as well. Thus, if you want a "fair" in terms of operation, you got it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this to anyone trash. It's not even a good bad movie. It's just awful bland rubbish that only video Nasty fan is likely to view and even when you make your way through the list, leave it to the last. If we look first, you can get an idea that this is the norm for the list, which of course is not true.
