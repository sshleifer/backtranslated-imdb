My brother is an avid DVD collector. He glanced at the cover (two models in the toilets) and had to add it to your collection. I stayed with him to see what turned out to be probably the most cringeable film (I use this term loosely), I felt compelled to sit. I did not dare make eye contact with my brother, it is quite certain that he had to curse the receipt in his fist. The biggest name in the whole film, Michael Clarke Duncan, who appears in one scene, that "director" decided to show all double (about four total) throughout the film. In fact, the whole movie is largely worth the suit. The fact that the DVD contained deleted footage was a shock. (I went to bed without watching it, however). So it is not surprising at all, I found this CD without case for TV in about a week.
