As a rule, any movie with Sylvester Stallone, as a rule, will suck ass. Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception. The only film, Sylvester Stallone were that were good were Rocky and First Blood. This film is extreamly unrealistic and sad. It has action, but not a very good effect. I did not like to watch, and I would never look at it again. No wonder why he won the Razzie Worst Picture. I would give it a 3/10, the only reason why he was 3 because he had a few good action, but not good enough.
