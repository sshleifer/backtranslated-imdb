Pretty average SciFi movie. The site has been more or less obvious from the outset. Although the action was good enough, the writing seemed very banal, using ideas from the many movies <br /> <br /> The main plot :. Scientists working on the study of deep space fighter rescue platform from falling into the red dwarf star, which they were orbitting. On board they found a stasis pod, which coincides problems at the very moment. After 2 or 3 minutes a man waking up in the pod, you realize that he is a complete psycho. Something that completely escapes the 3 men crew of the research vessel ... <br /> <br /> After that, it becomes a rip off any other movie starring a psychotic madman terrorizing innocent victims, as a whole, I think it was better than the rate of 2 subject of intelligence, which I do not believe that a good movie too. <br /> <br /> not a good movie, get a foreigner, and watch that again. <br /> <br />
