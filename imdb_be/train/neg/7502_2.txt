I've always loved films of Spike Lee, but this one was a waste of 2 1/2 hours. I was expecting more of Sam Son, and instead got a film that seemed to have very little in common with the 1977 serial murders. A talking dog was laughable (you know that you are in trouble when the entire movie patrons laughed inappropriately). The whole movie seemed very inconsistent and not very interesting. The sex scenes were completely irrelevent to the plot. I am not against sex in the movie, but it must have some point (unless it is a XXX film). In general, we were very disappointed in this Spike Lee's effort !!
