With a name like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!", Who is going to wait for this thing to be a) bad sci-fi movie or b) comedy pokes fun at bad sci-fi movies. This should be a combination of both, with a dose of spoof splashed. Unfortunately, it falls flat very quickly. <br /> <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, I understand that, but you "must once again think it's funny, right? I found a few jokes or situations were funny (what side Boke telephone conversation, Russian Olympic spy steroid eat cereal, Superman walking on Lois, etc.). "The attack of the killer tomatoes" aspires to become a cult classic, but it does not make it. Cult classic film, which is so different, that only a select group of people understand (or similar description). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" can be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, so that's why he does not qualify as a cult film. <br /> <br /> There is a good actress whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. It is a thin, gangling reporter, but has an endearing personality, loves to replay, and is a natural comedian. Unfortunately, it is placed on the poor use here. <br /> <br /> «Attack of the killer tomatoes" is not as funny as, say, «Amazon Women on the Moon" or «Kentucky Fried Movie», but it does have some fun moments, so I still recommend to watch it once. Do not cut out the director, he has breaks producer of the film and some of the alleged "lost" in duplicated frames to simulate an African dialect (it can be found in English on the tape is sold).
