It sorriest collection of cliches strung together in a straight line, with no noticeable area or any decent way of acting I've seen in a long time. Canibalising scenes from Star Wars, Reign of the Fire, Godzilla, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, he went all out war on the viewer intelligence. Does this film was good? This is not a movie at all! <br /> <br /> Even if it does not go so low as to be really funny and achieve cult status as a comedy, the film does offer some laughs. The trick is to place the copied scene in the context of the original films. Gandalf can be ridiculous to speak Korean, looking for basilisk snake gay, if you compare it with the kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun to switch back and forth between Sauron and Zhazha-Bing, or as it was called. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: any pleasure of this film is totally dependent on the state of intoxication and presenting the audience, rather than the director / writers. It is a shame, Shim!
