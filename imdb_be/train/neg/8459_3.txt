Some very interesting camera work and the story with great potential. But it never comes together as something more than a student's thesis in film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. Fist, there is not a single likeable character, not even a criminal, we could admire his / her audacity. Secondly, all actions are horrible - even veteran Willem Dafoe. Ham is so abundant here, you feel like you're at a picnic - but one of those miserable company picnics staff, where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat half-baked and hot dog throw <br /> <br /> All right, I'm being a little rough on the young director, who could still go location - .. As I said, the camera work is pretty good <br /> <br /> but I feel cheated - an advertisement for the movie suggests that we get to observe how the "modern western" and DVD packaging are my pictures on it, offering it so - but in fact no one is connected to the film-making seems to know that this kind of film they have to do <br /> <br /> this betrayal that hurts. but even without it, the fact remains that we do not love these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the plot is hopelessly confused, and ultimately, we just do not care. <br /> <br /> I took it with DVD-player about halfway through. but the rental store would not give me my money. <br /> <br /> Now, it really hurts.
