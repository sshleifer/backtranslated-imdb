I had to watch it at school. And to sum up ... <br /> <br /> mediocre actors, mediocre script and mediocre director. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of time. Do not even watch a movie. Do not disturb. You'll be so disappointed. My teacher said that it had to be good. How wrong she was. She even slept a little. movie actors were just bad. Best actor there was old, and that's not saying much. It has a terrible story with awful characters. So unreal, and I can honestly say that there was no point. The script was objective and confusing. There were points in the film, when I furrowed my eyebrows and said, "What?". There were also just too many loose ties and plot holes. It was absolutely horrible.
