I commented on this when he made his debut for the first time and gave him a "thumbs up in the middle of" review by noting that I would give him the benefit of the doubt is only the first episode. I saw a total of six episodes is now up to this point in June 2006 and throughout the life of Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation, this show is full of shit <br /> <br /> It happened to him .. All . Passing only a lousy animation and design, history is ridiculously complicated and no character development or a clear interest on the part of the authors of this dreck give any substance in any story. <br /> <br /> And, for God's sake .. .o is it just me, or joker in every episode ?? Is Gotham, that a large part of the justice system a revolving door? Or, again, it's just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort in other scoundrels (see "no character development," above). <br /> <br /> Worse still, each Joker tale same 3-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker people gases. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker sets Gas entire city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was one episode, I saw that it was not the story of Joker. The name escapes me, but villain that disgusting Cluemaster ... «brain Thank knock" episode of the quiz. It was only the worst Batman story I've ever seen, I heard or read. Yes, worse than "I've got Batman in my basement.» <br /> <br /> I can not say that I feel that this show, because it's probably against the ToS, but it starts with " B »and rhymes with« fastardization ». Thank God for existence Tim / Dini / etc. Epoch Bat entertainment days ago from Fox and children Sat. Things are good, and I should have known it, simply could not go on forever, unfortunately.
