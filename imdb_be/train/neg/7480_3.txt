We all know that when we have a bad day at the office, is not it? Well, it's Neil Simon comedy looks at it, if you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office. Sometimes, it's just not worth it to go, you know what I mean? And, sometimes, it's just not worth doing anything if it had been done earlier, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better, too. <br /> <br /> This is not what a lousy comedian Steve Martin or inappropriate role as harried and stressed advertising Exec; quite the contrary, on both counts. And it does not mean that Goldie Hawn equally inept either; Her work has been consistently good, if not great, since I first saw it on TV, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In-1960s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that it's not about the unfortunate couple at all: it's really about New York, and why everyone should come to New York to live and love their lives away in marriage happiness ?? like ?? in the largest city in the world. Now, if you are a New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Look, 1970 The film is still a great comedy that really explore everything that can go wrong if you go somewhere and included the majority of situations and gags that you can imagine what can happen to you in a foreign environment. This version of the 1999 unfortunately goes unrequited involved specifically for audiences in these days, that is waiting or wants to see the excess. For example, not content with the star attraction of key players, has a cameo (a relatively long and) by Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York, as we all know. What ?? Sawing Giuliani for president even then? Worse ?? walking talking advertising on children's face in New York. <br /> <br /> And then we have John Cleese, reprising his role as Basil Fawlty ?? but this time, as the Harz as a drag queen ?? once again bullying the hotel staff, sycophantically sucking up to wealthy clients and generally make yourself look like an idiot he is, in this role. And in the process, doing great damage to the memory Fawlty Towers, arguably the best British comedy series, bar none ... <br /> <br /> Why was this 1999 film made? In the 1970s, New York was a dying city, in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So, if done in 1970, it was a city you've seen: a dark, dark, dark, disturbing, and not a place that persecuted it is time to finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke (as it was then, pollution and all ) By 1999, things got better gloss back, New York was a prosperous, it was Big Apple, ready to bite off, if you had the courage to ... <br /> <br /> So, naturally, the couple in second coming to find that courage within himself and finally join the fabulous fight to continue the American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Thus, this film is really comical, but not for the reasons that producers may have provided. As far as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in the comedy, the film is a parody of a lot better than one made with great Jack Lemmon. If you've seen the last one, then just do not bother with it.
