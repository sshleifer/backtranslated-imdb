this movie was definitely the worst film I've seen in my life, and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I do not like the way the movie was filmed. all unknown actors, and it looks as if a bunch of friends got together and decided to shoot his own movie. but it's horrible. I've never seen the worst film. the story is so fake, and I just found out that it took a very long time to get to the end of the film. There was no plot, it looked as if it was not planned before they started shooting. story is too strange. I do not like how slowly it took to get to the point of the film. there was no sense even on the set of this film. If you plan to watch this movie, it is not necessary. you're just wasting your time.
