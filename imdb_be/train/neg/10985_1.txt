I do not know what Margaret Atwood thinks that this film to have the same name as her book. I've always been a big fan of the robber bride and was so excited to find out there was a movie in the works. I know that the translation of the book into a movie is not perfect, but this movie was the worst. women's names are correct and some prehistory right, but that's about it. I feel that I have lost most of their time trying to make it through this film. This really should be a mini-series, to tell the story the way it was written. <br /> <br /> actors for Rose, Tony Harris and Zeny have been well chosen, although I was skeptical at first about Mary -Louise Parker. I just wish they had a better script to work, because it really has nothing to do with the book at all.
