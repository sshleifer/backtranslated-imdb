This film is so bad that it hurts. The car does 30 miles per hour when he should go ... 100 gear lever, which is delayed (in the park!) The nurse who goes in for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on his shoulder ... not any of 2 morons take the damn phone? There's nothing to trust this shit. I would be ashamed to be seen in a film like this!
