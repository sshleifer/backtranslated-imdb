Slasher film, made in the early 80s, has a curse on it, which is those who are trying to end his turn dead. Years later, a group of film students tried to finish the film - also raise the films, the curse of death. Great idea for the film, but, unfortunately, «Cut» is just another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia was not the world's best track record when it comes to horror. "Razorback" (1984) was, and hopeless as it was «Holwing III» (1987), which was half-American film in any way. As for our foray into comedy horror "Body Melt" (1993) is best left forgotten. The problem with the "Cut" is that the producers are trying to create a reasonable satire horror a la "Scream" (1996), but have no idea about the genre or what makes it work. And although it sounds strange, I say it's about a slasher, but that the "Cut" is not really enough of a "heart." of course, it is worth the basic "rules" set out " scream ", but he does not want to play with the formula, instead he goes to a cardboard copy of the earlier. <br /> <br /> The killer, Scarman, probably one of the saddest and un charismatic villains in the history of horror movies. His endless barrage of awkward, lame one-liners to dialogue porn seem like Shakespeare. The cast never seems to be that they are fully involved and see how they just waiting for the shoot to be longer so that they can collect checks payment and feel of the film, he deliberately tries to be terrible;. more like an episode of "neighbors" or "Heartbreak High" by the way, these efforts MTV style, hyper-cinema during "research" sequence just look lame, dated and ridiculous. . <br /> <br /> If Australia never gets a chance to make a horror again (which I hope we still have), perhaps we should take a letter from the (1979) books about «Mad Max». Instead of trying to copy the US, we should try to look at its own genre.
