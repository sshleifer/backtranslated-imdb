As often happens, the spectacular and explosive Trailers Asian films to add to no more than a vague history. It seems unleashed (which was great) Dog Bite Dog tells where they rise as ferocious wild dogs that carry out the orders of his master. The main characters, emotionally undeveloped, amoral killer who is associated with the police officer in the equally unstable, far from common heroes and villains, we often see. In fact, in the end, you lose track of who you have to empathize, not able to feel even the slightest emotion for all of the men ?? whether it was a failure of the Director or, perhaps emphasizing the message he is trying to say it's up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability, by half a point the way it spills down to the tedious stories of survival and revenge. Uncertainty, which was evident on the ground soon disappeared because of the extremely inconsistent score, which battered potentially effective story. And in the end, you are left feeling that all that detailed background information and self-analysis of the main characters had something very much needed. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the transition in the history from the point A to point B was quite unusual compared to American films ?? so those who are not familiar with Asian films and tired of Hollywood predictability should check it out. <br /> <br /> The white balance seemed off for most of the film. It was like looking at the pictures shot on the fluorescence, when he was supposed to be set to tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but he strained his eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie also liked to play tricks on you ?? interesting build-up gave me hope for a slow-moving story, until it was diverted on a low budget, low-speed chase scene. And just when you think you are going to get no response indie ending with a mixture of Shakespearean tragedy, you know that is not the end at all, but rather a shift in the stupid country music installation of peace and tranquility. <, Br /> <br /> Throw in some bad due to the overwhelming stage, the repayment time suddenly returned to savagery and back the other way Asians delighted with bodily fluids and a terrible score, which did not correspond to the film, and you get a medium soft Asian thriller . <br /> <br /> I just do not understand why every fight scene overlapped with clips roaring lions ?? I thought they were supposed to symbolize a dog? After all, in the end, we are reminded of the real killer, who is still lurking among us ?? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
