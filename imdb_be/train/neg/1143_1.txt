Even 20+ years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst film I've ever managed to sit through. Ninja silence Scandinavian enter the scene, fire their guns offensively noisy sub-machine license, and then leave quietly. Wow, how do we find these invisible silent killer? Just follow the sleeves and smoking! Painfully bad dialogue (or it has been brilliant and just translated a bad thing?), But not Asian in the field of view in a cast, and unusual only 3 Asians among the crew of stuntmen. Funny plot, acting largely does not exist - then again, the ninja can not act! Save yourself - do not look at all costs!
