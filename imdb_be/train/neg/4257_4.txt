«Dracula II: Ascension» is the story of a group of medical students who come through Dracula.When body is a mysterious stranger and offers students a $ 30000000, to collect the body and steal its blood for auction, the offer, they can hardly refuse .Soon students also is ruthlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the Vatican «Dracula II: Ascension»! it's a little interesting horror film that has a lot flaws.The dimensional characters and the action is quite average.There Gore some nice effects like really cool double decapitation scene, but lacked the violence in my liking.The film quickly becomes boring and forgotten, and there is absolutely no suspense.So, if you like the modern vampire click bet look.I prefer atmospheric vampire chillers from the '60s and early' 70s, as "Lips of blood," "bride of Dracula" or "Lemora: story child about the supernatural, "to name just a few.4 10.
