I love bad films. I like to shoot bad films with friends and relax on their duration. Then there is the repugnant movies like this. Redline is not just a bad movie, but a clear sign that maybe the US film industry should like, for the sake of the audience, at least proofread the script to finance the film. <br /> <br /> If the stereotype took a shit, this film will emerge from this. The plot is unbearable, and the action all around the clown. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin is, perhaps, the worst chemicals on the screen I've seen in quite a while, and even individually, they must be isolated from humanity and beatings with a bag of oranges as long as they do not change their profession street vendors (a single that they can legitimately claim ). In addition, as Macfadyen convincing to make this film so far beyond me that I can not even think of the analogy. I am a staunch supporter of him, but it made me ask. <br /> <br /> In summary. Several people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you are more people than me), so that it turns into violence (I think). Film as Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, that is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue is not suitable for human ears. This film is essentially one big car commercial for the first half, and promiscuous fighter for the rest, to avoid any and all costs. <br /> <br /> I would like to find one positive aspect of this film, and I think, lies in the fact that in the end credits to make a roll. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if it was you sing these two songs in the film, you hack, and I hope that the ravages of old age you are. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you are really looking to make the movie funny experience, listen to the lyrics to the amazing Nadia Bjorlin in.
