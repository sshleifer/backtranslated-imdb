I have a 5-minute rule (sometimes I leave leway 10). If the film is not well in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it probably will not be ever better. I still have to test any film that has proven to refute this theory. Dan in Real Life, of course, is no exception. I watched this and thought of turkey; wow, this is not funny, not touching each other, but not boring, and I do not like any of the characters at all. <br /> <br /> A Tale advice columnist / widower raising three young daughters, who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend. I believe that the subtitle is "columnist advice that could use advice"? I do not know. Dans character in no way struck me as someone who is qualified to give advice. I believe that is the irony? I do not know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their children in some Anual family retreat, which seems to be very sweet, and the potential food for a good comedy, the plot lines ... no one has ever come out. The central story is basically how he loves this woman, but he can not have her. Anyone with a pulse will understand that eventually he will get it, but you have to suffer painfully not funny, vulgar, lifetime movie network dialogue "killers of love" to get to the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> This is really one of the worst films I have ever seen.
