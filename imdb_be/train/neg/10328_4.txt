I think the show was pretty good notion to work. But the execution was poor. The script and poor acting is bad. There were a lot of problems that could have portrayed in the best side, as a protest against gay marriage or find a cemetery. The show can not be correctly termed as a sitcom, as it lacks humor failure. I have to say that this show was just successfully put the life of the Muslim community to some degree. <br /> <br /> So far, the second season is worse than the first. I had hopes high on this show, but I was kind of disappointed. However, I appreciate the CBC for putting this concept to the audience. In any case, I wish you good luck in the future.
