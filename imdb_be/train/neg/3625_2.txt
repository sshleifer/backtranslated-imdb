This is a film that belongs firmly in the 50s. It is very strange that the American Film Institute chose this together for the 100 best American films of all time. I have seen almost all the films on this list, and this one is by far the most disappointing one. Musical numbers (and there are many, many of them) is very long and sad, and have absolutely nothing to do with this story. The end of the film is terribly over-long ballet, which is the next stage of course, has no real relationship to the history of film. I must admit that it is very well done, the music is all right, and dancing are done with the highest professional standards - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the film <br /> <br />. the protagonist of the film is extremely childlish and unsympathetic and behave unpolite way. His mental age is about 14. If you want to see a good musical, made on the "golden age" of musicals, go and see "Singing in the Rain."
