I signed up just to comment on how awful this movie is stupid. In addition, plagiarism or ordered Air Force One, or any other type of terrorist history, it is a film that makes you grateful to see the film, which can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actor when they are given such a stupid clich√©-ridden script to work with. It's bad enough when you moan once in a movie, if you are faced with an insult to the intellect, but if you find yourself moaning again and again, you have to conclude that the director is also not the brightest bulb in the movie business or are producers for a decision to bring this story to the screen in the first place. Mainly low rent actors you can forgive for this task, because they are likely to have appeared to get the money and exposure, not something to be a part of this joke-within-a-film is going to make them any awards or recognition. This could end up confusing them for being such a bad opinion as to take part in such a loser. I do not see the point in summarizing the plot or even to give any examples to prove his case, in order to do so, it would be cruel and unusual punishment, that no one involved in the crash could not stand. As well as the study of well-made movies can inspire you how to make a good, expertly put-together of art and beauty, the only thing you can learn from watching this freak is what not to do, and what does not work ! Keep in mind.
