Kirsten Dunst is very overrated as an actress. You can tell it is always just "acting." I like Izzard, though. The story is very sad. The viewer has no real connections with the characters, not knowing who really sympathize, or even care about. Slow, stupid movie, with some laughs but small and not very funny, anyway. area is not attractive or alarming to say the least. you can see every part of the rotation of a mile. What's this movie supposed to be? Comedy? Drama? What's the difference? you will not be the end of the film .
