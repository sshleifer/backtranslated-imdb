It's just saying, the worst movie I have ever seen. It ranges from how to 2+ hours, and the box art was completely misleading. My friends and I rented it because we thought it would be a poor 300. You know, laugh and make fun. No. There's nothing funny about this film, only pain. Then, the film begins, and they speak some other language. We think, "Oh it's a start. But no, the film plummets from there and becomes more like a super boring book you should have read in elementary school, where nothing happens in a matter of hours, and battle scenes to compete with 2 children fighting in the playground. Lower the operator, and this film belongs in the trash compactor. Movies like this will lead to the world, we see Wall-E, which, incidentally, was a good movie.
