First of all, let's something right here: a) I'm an anime fan has always been actually (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer all the time in day care). b) I like a few B-movies, because they're fun. c) I like Godzilla movies- much. <br /> <br /> Moving on, if the film first comes on, it seems that this will be your usual B-movie, right up to the FX crappy, but sudden- BOOM! Anime is going on! This is when the film goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY down. <br /> <br /> The animation is very bad and cheap, even worse than what I remember from the SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie, I "strongly" I remember when a group of children running from the school ... and it's the same kids over and over again! FX terrible, too; dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation unorganized, dialogue and voice (especially the English dub, which I watched) was disgusting and I begged my father to take a tape from the DVD / VHS-player; The only thing that kept me survive with cracked jokes and commentaries, like robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to just enjoy this movie and experience it at the same time. <br /> <br /> Damn, I plan to show this other fellow otaku my friend for Halloween B- movie night. Because it's stupid, really painful to watch and unintentionally funny and at the same time, I give this film 3/10, an improvement over the 0.5 / 10 Originally I was going to give. <br /> <br /> (according to my classification scale: 3/10 is pretty much like the sad and bad, how much fun, how to count to three, if you do not find a way to make fun of him, he will be just as much fun as count to 15.).
