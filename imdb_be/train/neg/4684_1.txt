This film is an insult to ALL divers. It was stupid. It turned out that it was written in the apes. The action was absurd. If this is the opinion of most of the fleet of people, I'm paying for our defense. This movie was terrible. I put it under the "Voyage to the bottom of the sea", as far as movies go underwater. Gene Hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap. Denzel Washington must be high. Not only in the story it makes sense. And the ending. For rebels to be rewarded for his crime? Hollywood will only think about the garbage. If you have not realized it yet, I do not like. And if it was not for all professional comments, I would not bother to publish.
