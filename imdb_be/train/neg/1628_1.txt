Without a doubt one of the most uncomfortable productions of the 1970s, GAOTS, it seems, really, really want something important. The tragic truth is that it is so totally useless at every level, that one can not help but laugh. Reaching desperately for the earthy elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, the day the city pair in the desert ... they walk along a shady path, allthewhile broadcast as large letters Berkeley coffee clatch. Almost every line of dialogue tarradiddle comes here deafening bad ( "I feel that life itself is made up of as many small bays like this pomegranate .... but it is so beautiful?") After what seems like an eternity absolutely nothing happens (well ... well ... we were treated to some nudity and cool mild sex scene), there is finally a very disappointing confrontation with a pair of Â«Nam vets who make nature scene and performing some pretty tough folk ballads with acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> At present, all the eventful and interesting happens in the whole movie. I thought the picture of Larry Buchanan "Strawberries Need Rain" was a weak example of respect for Bergman. "Golden Apples" every bit as bad, but a continuous random verbiage she is doing it memorably awful. 1/10
