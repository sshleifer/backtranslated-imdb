This film takes what would be a good idea, mummified in 2000 the old witch and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry out. They are going to stay with her uncle and Nan. Uncle discovered in 2000 the old witch preserved in the peat. He revives her, and it takes the form of Nora. It can not be killed, usually, (the more the pity). Nora, however, works the way to do it. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror movie that was done on the cheap. It is a sprawling mess. I have to wonder why anyone would want to do such a bad film. I'm tempted to learn magic to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> avoid at all costs
