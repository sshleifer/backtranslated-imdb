"Web" is an example of the many examples of films that show a strong, sometimes specific performance and high scores, but unfortunately, fragmented and sharply slowed down in the muddy storyline and very little to interest the audience. It Widmark stars as a doctor who works in a psychiatric hospital, life is in despair because of family problems, and quite absurd and overworked conflict, which actually seems like no big deal at all. <br /> <br /> The plot is absurd, Its time for the institution to get new curtains for the windows of the library. An old woman wants to have her put curtains on them, but many patients want to do their own. And somehow it's funny and crazy inadvertently conflict breaks out to the point where lives are in danger, and the family start to fall apart. It's more like a conflict that would take place between very young children. <br /> <br /> The interrogation of the plot logic and whether it can really happen so massive that asks if real, would like crazy to buy it. Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong in action. The cast is made up of the following WIDMARK other great actors, many of them Academy Award nominees and winners. And there are sometimes point in the film, which works brilliantly, but it always excludes the silly story about the window curtains. Unfortunately, too much of a curse draperies and therefore, the film slows down. Many takes long and is made from one point of view of the camera, following the slow pacing and lack of interest in view. <br /> <br /> In a brief analysis of the "web" is not recognized film and it becomes obvious why the audience basically, as soon as the story comes into focus, it makes quite quickly. It just really does not sound like a lot of fun to watch, and I'll tell you that it's not very fun to watch.
