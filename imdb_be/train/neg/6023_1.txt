It reminds me of when I was reborn believer who had become a minister. I never thought that I would be a minister or even graduate from high school, because I was pretty sure I would have taken up to heaven for what ever happen. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a pile of garbage. I'm an atheist, and it just proves that "once saved always saved" doctorine, that Christians tell us, no more real than the elves. If this were true, why I'm leaving after many years, the future devout born-again believer? Yes, I was really saved. I prayed that stupid sinners prayer from the heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians were to read the Bible, they will see that their god thinks, rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities in the order in accordance with it. They may be surprised to learn that there where there is the word "Rapture" is mentioned.
