Incoherent confusion with gratingly deafening soundtrack, "Soul Survivors" is the latest entry in the "who died, and who live" genre of horror films. Two teenage couple, Sean and the ticket office and Matt and Annabel, preparing to go to different colleges, but before they rasstanutstsa to break, Thanksgiving Day, they visited one last shot at a rave-style party at some burnt church on a proposal from a shame slutty Annabel (Dushku, another faith, another vampire Slayer). Unmotivated terrible guys are starting to pay too much attention to Cass (generic Seyzhmiller) for reasons that are never explained, and by the time the quartet to leave the party. Riding in the SUV them, they are persecuted, and then passed on unfounded awful guys who quickly and inexplicably make intentional 180 in the middle of the highway, causing a nasty accident and as SUV flips embankment and plunged into the river. Shaun dies (or is he?), And Cassie spends the rest of the film to cope with loneliness and guilt (she was behind the wheel), if it does not have a ghost of Sean or chasing those unmotivated terrible guys. Much inexplicable inconsistency stands as a mental state Cassie degenerates further, until we reach a predictable conclusion. So who died and who is alive? After ninety minutes of purgatory, who really cares?
