Maybe I'm the date, or just do not know what Elektra, both in current publications ... But Electra, I read, was far more manipulative and always seem to have a plan. It is usually used by another to make it dirty work, and more often than not some double cross was involved. Just when you think you have all understood that it is to fool the eye and gets her way. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty weak in dialogue, especially acting entirely convincing, and the action has been spotty. I'm really looking for something more along the lines of the book of Frank Miller's "Electro killer." What is much darker than anything in this film. <br /> <br /> Special effect when cool, it was interesting at times, but more often than not the story and the plot has been slow or illogical. Tha's hand is not threatened enough, and Elektra was not enough ..... cynical. She's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story, I just do not care, anyway.
