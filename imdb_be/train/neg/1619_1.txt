At the beginning of the film, beautiful pictures and foxes scenes were amazing. However, this story has been so slow and boring. And then the girl begins to domesticate the fox, which leads to the tragic events. We live in the woods, and often see foxes. One thing that someone has to know that you leave the wild animals to be wild and enjoy them from afar. This film sets a terrible example for the children who will be watching this, in an attempt to make a wild creature as a pet. I do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be. Even after the terrible events of the main fox, the little girl still wants to play with the sets. Nya or she learns her lesson? There are other scenes involving wild animals Lisova, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children to watch this movie. What a disappointment this film was. And what a terrible story he tells. The final narrated dialogue was stupid enough, by the time my wife and I screamed at the TV! I absolutely hated this movie, and would never recommend it to anyone!
