This film is really stupid! I saw it as a 11-year-old, and even then I thought it was pretty funny! I would only recommend this film for children under the age of 12 years, I do not really care about it, but I think the answers to some very good questions, that children should be aware of, such as: 1) or buy money happiness? 2) of things, I think they will not approve Should I lie (to my parents)? 3) or the money to buy the friendship? 4) Is money everything? 5) I do not tell my parents, when someone is trying to hurt me? Of course, it is very unrealistic situation, but I think that if parents discuss these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video, as well as to show / to frighten their children, that is has the potential to get you hurt .
