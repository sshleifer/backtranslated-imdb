Oh, I've heard so many good things about this movie. I went to see it with my best friend (she's a woman, I'm a man). Now, please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream. After the first couple of dozen "undressed", we both felt very strange combination of stupidity and boredom. We laughed (at him, not with him), we dozed (and it would be better to stay in bed), we were sure we spent money for nothing. And we did. Story was incoherent, and the characters are a group of people, which can not be cared for. Waste of money, waste of celluloid. This film does not deserve one out of ten people, but this is the lowest available. I'm not sure why this film has a reputation for what he does to be perfect; I do not recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste and intelligence.
