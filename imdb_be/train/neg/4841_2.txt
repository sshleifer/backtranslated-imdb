REALLY ??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see the light of reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This is a big pity, granular, clich√©. I would burst out laughing, and a lot, but on a date with an ex-military guy. I could not hide another answer, the longing. Yes, I think my date, flat line, "good old boy" liked. It's not a compliment. I know that the actor wants to work .... fine for others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful tease Ralph. I vote in the 2 only because Ralph looked so stunning. But I must admit myself, Ralph, how could you? And why ?? <br /> <br /> I'm going to go look at the end of the Affair, to heal and recover now .... C1
