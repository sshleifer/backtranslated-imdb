I'm just very disappointed "Surviving the soul." It's not even worth comment in this forum. The script is very poor, as well as all the "action" and for our entertainment he has a meaningless story. <br /> <br /> Please do not lay up for yourselves a favor! Be a real "Survivor" ... Do not waste your time on this piece of crap! Someday you'll thank me!
