Although many of the elements that would later become a permanent and much more convincing is in this series, The Gathering pace slowly, make a few inadequate and confusing story. Worse, the characteristic in the premiere episode of the poor. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to ignore these problems, I remember, who is almost turned me on that soon escalated into an exciting series.
