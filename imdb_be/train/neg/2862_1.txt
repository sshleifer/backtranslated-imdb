Someone should send this guy back Uli Lommel in MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him that he knew how to make a movie? NOBODY can just make movies these days? In the past, he always requires talent before anyone could make a film. After watching this movie lame BOC and others he did, it seems quite obvious that the poor guy is about the same as the movie business does, like me. In fact, I think that even I could do better than the movies Uli LAME-ALL. This film has absolutely nothing to do with BKAM killer, except the names of the victims and killers. That's it. Where is this guy get a great idea of ​​what CRAs people killed rodents and all other irrelevant crap that in the film? This is a classic example of someone who is trying to entice people to see their film based on the concept of "BTK" because of the fame he has achieved. Absolutely helpless. The only serial killer movie that I would consider worse than that lame "Dahmer" movie. This child was smoking so many cigarettes that made me sick. The one who made that one should be shot.
