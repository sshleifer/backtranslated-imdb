I have to say that I hated this movie. I do not want to say that because of Gerard Butler in it. About half an hour of boring conversations, I wish all those who really care about the story, I began to quickly redirect to Jerry scenes. I really do not know the ending, I was that bored him. If Jerry was not in it, I will probably ever do one of two things: to sleep or shut it down, but Jerry bright light of this film, as he and most of his early films. If you're a fan of Jerry do not worry, he's so charming and valuable, as it always is, but if you really want to watch a movie on the subject, success, because you will need it, or is it a lot of coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's only because the casting director had the sense to put Gerry in this movie, despite the fact that they do not have the slightest idea how to spell it name!
