My father is a fan of the Columbia, and I have always loved the show. I always express his contempt for show and tell him how bad it is. But he is not watching it nonetheless.

I attribute this to the fact that this is the beginning of the series, and no one knew where to go with him. this episode mainly focused on the perpetrator of the crime investigation instead of Columbo, as many later episodes will do.
