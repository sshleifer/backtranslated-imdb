Stewart Moss star as a scientist who is on a business trip with his wife and only one gets the feeling that he was chosen for this role because of its ability to roll his eyes back in your head ... imagine casting for this .. "you can ... no, it is not so, thank you, next! ". Anyway, he was bitten by a bat, then he or changes in some bat creature and killing people .... or he does not. Because no one else sees his amazing transformation, but he seems to think that it changes, because his wedding ring pops off when his hands turned into claws, etc. To its credit, the film pretends to abstain from it or just nuts, or is he really turning into something almost until the very end. It has some good places & kind of decent atmosphere at times, but, unfortunately, none of this can compensate for some lame story and surprisingly bad actions. Kind of fun in the "so bad it's good" way, but leans more towards just bad. 4 10.
