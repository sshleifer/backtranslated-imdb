Indeed there is no reason to treat it much further because of a few very bright and bias in the application error. <br /> <br /> A perfect example is when filmmakers claim 'Saul' or Paul Tarusa (writing to the Hebrews, he says) does not have the slightest idea, Jesus is or was a person, this statement or deliberately wrong, he blames others is presenting, or he did not know what to say, "The Bible." <br /> <br /> First, we can examine its misleading statement about the Jews 8.4; he shows a quote, "If Jesus was on earth, he would not be a priest," so here it establishes an ignorant and unlearned audience to accept his false premise .. why? He is doing what most so-called Bible believing people he accuses to do the same .. That takes things out of context <br /> <br /> Verse one of the Hebrews 8 1 .. "Now of the things that we talked about is the sum: we have such an high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the majesty in the heavens "above context clearly speaks about Jesus who was on earth and ascended into heaven after his alleged resurrection. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the way the director wants the audience to take it out of the context of Scripture. Here he offers a framework that "Paul did not know about the human Jesus, but only one in the" sky "<br /> <br /> follow? <br /> <br /> allows you to see when the director honest; Heb 7, 14. "It is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood." <br /> <br /> Heh, Sun director just to quote the writer to the Hebrews are trying to show the writer of this book has no knowledge of "man Jesus"? it is likely, anyway, Paul did not write Hebrews, but I will not go into that here, but the director says Paul did, and this premise point given here. <br /> <br /> do not like this film maker does a decent point in some areas, what he does, but he is hired in the same blind prejudice of religion bashing on it. After he is involved in this tactic, in my opinion, it loses its credibility as a religion he chooses, and the film is no longer a documentary and a personal opinion and bias cinematographer, no more, no less.
