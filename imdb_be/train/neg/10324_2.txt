Little Mosque is one of the saddest CBC comedy I have ever seen. They have a way of creating a simple programming comedy they can for the oldest most easily offended viewers to CBC for mean 85-year-old farmer in Saskatchewan. Jokes all so predictable and deadly lame I can not believe it. The performances are very exaggerated and over acted, but I do not blame the actors, as these types of one-dimensional stereotypical characters, probably, is what CBC asked for and demanded. Pretty lame show with bad jokes, they tried to present as a "controversial" well this is less controversial than the other sad CBC comedy as Hour 22 minutes, Royal Canadian Air farce and Rick Mercer Report.
