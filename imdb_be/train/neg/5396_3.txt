I read a comment that you do not watch this movie if you are looking for manufacturing Shakespearean dialogue. It is true, unfortunately, because all mixed dialogue, this wonderful game contains, has been cut and replaced with the songs. I read the play, and recently was lucky enough to see this is done, it remains one of my favorite of Shakespeare's comedies, but this film seems to take everything that I like it off. Princess, though, no doubt, is doing what it has been directed to do, it was not the royal posture, and all the girls seemed to lose their minds of their characters - also depends on the ill-considered cuts, which are not only selected female character sparse dialogue, but comments taken out of context - it was a little unnerving to hear Duchess proclaim "We have a wise girl to tease our lovers so!" If there was not sarcastic at all. The Indian news across the tape also disrupted the flow and took a lot of great scenes, as they showed the information in the scenes after them, and were contemporary phrasing. In conclusion, a great game, has destroyed the concept of odd and unreasonable cuts. Kenneth, I used to love what you do. What were you thinking?
