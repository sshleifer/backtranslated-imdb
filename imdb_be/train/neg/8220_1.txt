Less than 10 minutes into the movie I wanted it to end, as it was painful. All of this "horror" film was about a group was whining bitch do stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Do not let the positive reviews fool you, as it is really a terrible movie, and you really do not have to watch. <br /> <br /> movie plot had the potential to be something great, but it just does not happen. A group of five "teen" girls on the way home one night, when they find themselves pursued by a mad female driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes into the movie, and the characters have already debated and it does not stop. All of us within 90 minutes of a bunch of girls whine, cry, yell, "Action", and trample. None of the dialogue is not even remotely interesting, so you can not know exactly what these characters or enjoy them. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, and I was shocked to learn that these characters were teenagers. None of these women did not look a day to 20 years, and one of them is easily viewed, as it was almost 30 years old. At least, the people who look at the age. None of them did not give even remotely worthy performances, and just seemed that they were chosen from the street, or were members of the director without any acting ability. "Actress", who played the killer overdid it, but it at least shows that the other girls did not -. Little talent <br /> <br /> The characters do not help things, because these girls are a bunch of whiny, stupid bitches. That's all I can say about them, and it did not help that they all survived. When should I go into details, in one scene, the girls chased the killers and have their car knocked down a lot. One girl hurt herself and whining about it ... the four of them did not wear a seat belt ... What are you waiting for? One of your friends brutally attacked by a killer ... and you just happened to be convenient "too sick" to help? Whatever. <br /> <br /> Filming absolutely terrible. I do not care if this film had a budget of peanut size, filming was terrible, and it was like a pirated version of the film. The cameraman was obviously in the car with the girls, pressed to the window, where a number of times and blurry camera shook and brushed up against the "actresses" was terrible. Furthermore, it was grainy, and sometimes you can not hear what the characters say (not that this was something worth listening to). <br /> <br /> Presumably the killer car in the film (which supposedly was, even though we only heard of the accident) is actually a car director in real life. Not surprisingly, they do not show the car did not get hit! This film is so cheap that they can not even show car gets a little scratched up. Oh, I must mention the soundtrack too ... if that's what it was. It was awful ... dull one another, and then the hard rock the next. <br /> <br /> In the end, Five Across The Eyes just feels like a bad home movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls who scream and argue for 90 minutes. It does not help if the script is terrible, it scares / voltage / uncertainty and (hardly even any gusset do for him) is not acting and terrible picture quality and images are appalling. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible low-budget film. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
