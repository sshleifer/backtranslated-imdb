The only reason I could see 101 Dalmatians was his candidates for the original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less than impressed with this film. In this sequel, Cruella DEVIL (the way Glenn Close pulls this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behavior. She loves all kind of animals and blocks all their fur off. From this point, we just have to wait until it begins to have crises. Quite quickly she does and tries to make the best coat fashion world, of course, for myself and from the beautiful Dalmatian fur. Besides Glenn Close, I found all throwing pretty silly, but from the eyes of a child funny. That's fair enough, as her target market, I believe, children under 12 years old A good entertainment for children and families, but did not do much for me. * Since *****
