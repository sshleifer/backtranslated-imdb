Well, what is it?! I found the character Nicholson small and very unfortunately uninteresting. Anjelica Huston character merges its power. And Kathleen Turner Sun dirty whore nothing good. It's not that I "do not understand." This does not mean that I do not think some of the ideas that could lead to something more. This film is nothing other than the concepts that we have to take these ideas and this is what the film has going for it. It Nicholson falls Turner absurd, but then again, it is designed to be so. This, however, does not surprise me how.) It's funny, or b.) ... even remotely interesting !!! It was a waste of my time, so do not let the hype get the best of you ... it's a waste of time! With all that being said, the opening sequence of the church is quite beautiful ...
