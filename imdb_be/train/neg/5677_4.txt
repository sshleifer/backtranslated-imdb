The "seed" torture porn ... there is no doubt. But, oddly enough, Uwe Boll wrote, produced and directed the movie a more polished than any other he has done in recent years. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch a movie Boll, I feel that some pages of the script should be missing. There are enormous gaps in the story and dialogue. Of course, nothing does not make sense, either. Films more surreal in this regard. <br /> <br /> ***** ***** SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Why six police officers who are arresting Seed share and go their separate ways when they fall into the darkened living in Unlike the real police, who would enter and clean the house in pairs or in threes? Why did not the police ever use their radio? As the body breaks down so quickly, a process that usually takes many months? (I know that this time of filming ... but the seed will never be able to stay on schedule to kill people if it is always waiting around the previous victim to the collapse at the point indicated.) How did the seed gets to wear a bib-overalls and masks, while he waits on death row instead of the usual prison uniforms? How to Seed enter the maximum security prison, a walk around the cell block, and then go out again without stopping or even noticed? If about 80 people (according to some newspaper articles featured in the film) were killed, why is there only one investigator? Why investigator suddenly decided that he should go look for Seed Seed in the house, where he was initially arrested and where he killed his victim? (Did not he think to do this before?) Why is a police detective is his solo, without a backup and even letting dispatch to know what he was doing and where he was headed? <br /> <br /> This is especially frustrating when Boll obviously goes away of his way to make sure that we understand why the electric chair is not working properly. He spends a few minutes on the screen to set it up, he could spend it doing other aspects of the film, at least a little more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> In short, the film is simply as to serve as the basis for several teams scenes (perhaps Ball will think about them as his "vision") from a cruel death sticks, arrows in the head, execution of electric shock, and skin of live animals raised for their pelts. (Introductory Animal scenes that are really peel were unnecessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The centerpiece is undoubtedly bludgeoning death of a woman of middle-aged seed with an ax. It is obvious that a lot of time was spent on it, and very vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", but without the soundtrack of Steely Dan. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie? No. It is worth seeing? Only if you are a strong supporter of torture porn genre, or if you absolutely decided to see a sample of torture porn. As I said at the beginning of this review, despite the fact that this film is pretty disgusting, and may be sick at the points, it's really much more competent than most Boll movies. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. I can only hope that he progresses torture porn and still more in the «Postal» spirit.
