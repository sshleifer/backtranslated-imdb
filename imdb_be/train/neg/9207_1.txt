This film is sold for one dollar at Wal-Mart on DVD, so I do not feel that I lost anything for watching this film, with the exception of my time. I enjoyed acting of Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling), which was a very youthful appearance and gave an excellent performance considering it was a terrible scenario. The story is about students who have decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters, only in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling had problems in the past played the game in other colleges and advised his father to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic affair with her, and as soon as he starts to play the game, he ceases to make love to her, and acts as a monk. There are some scenes in the film, received running around the former World Trade Center, as well as in seeing the floor and roof area. It's pretty sad to see this part of the film, which died because of the evil in the world so many people. It's not a very good film, with the exception of Tom Hanks tries to keep the film above the level of sedimentation entertainment.
