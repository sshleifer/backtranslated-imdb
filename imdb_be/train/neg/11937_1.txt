Superhero movies almost always suck, and this is no exception. His only redemptive quality is the fact that the film could have been worse. I would put «Batman & Robin» and «steel» on this film, so yeah, it's that bad ... <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a black superhero, check "Blankman" it is not "sur 'serious' superhero movie, but at least its fun.
