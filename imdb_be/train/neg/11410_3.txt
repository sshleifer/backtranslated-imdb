Christopher Lambert annoying and frustrating in its portrayal of Gideon. This film could have been a classic Lambert performed as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and Dustin Hoffman as the Raymond Babbit in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. <br /> <br /> It is very bad because the storyline makes sense to us in life, that support performance Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were free. 3 of 10.
