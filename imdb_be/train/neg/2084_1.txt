if they gave me the opportunity to negative numbers I would like to use it. This film really was a god-awful. I went to the theater, expecting that it's terrible, and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the effect was painful. I wanted to get out, but my friend was driving, and wanted to get her money's worth, I think we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> The growing breasts, when the girls got their super strength, and change the color of the hair was just wrong. Izzard just seemed wrong for the part of a super villain, he went oddly weak and stupid. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came off as psychotic and wonder, as did (Luke Wilson), one of Matt Vaughn (Rhine Wilson.
