Tim Robbins strangely benign here cast in the garage mechanic in 1950, the first year of New Jersey, who falls for a perky blonde who is the niece of Albert Einstein! Despite the fact that he is on the screen most of the time, Robbins cancels the inner workings of his intense person and recedes into the background (it's easy to forget that he was even in the picture!). Kuskova romantic comedy with stunts that being Matthau plays Einstein (who does what he can with a caricature character conceived). Otherwise, it is even corny and sunny, directed rather sleepy on Skepisi that does not show heart, but there is no mind or brain. Meg Ryan, it is usually friendly and I chemistry between she and Robbins magically as affectionate sister and her older brother. ** from ****
