This early Pia Zadora car was moving well-known formula Harold Robbins: ambitious main character drowns in decline, pursuing the path to the top of some arbitrarily chosen, but the glamor of the world, in this case the film industry. But, despite the fact that this template to be fully predictable, the film manages at the same time be absolutely incredible. Zadora (call her inexperienced as an actress to be merciful) never convince as a screenwriter. One would expect, the film of the film solutions, to have a glimpse of their own industry and the creative process. But the script does not give her any of the qualities that make the characters interesting writers of movies: save, skill with words, love-hate relationship with their own creative abilities. Her character is a blank, as the donut hole. And this is just a taste of incompetence on display here. The cinema is so muddy that it is sometimes difficult to understand what is happening. And the scene never really stick together, so that everything seems to be a sequence of random moments in the bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
