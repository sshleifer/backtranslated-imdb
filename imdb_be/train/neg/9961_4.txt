Amelia and Michael married couple who take advantage of each other. Amelia has a longtime lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who does not satisfy him. Two of them fester infidelity, but they manage to connect with each other in the end. <br /> <br /> There's not much to it that short. The direction of straight forward and dramatically, which is good, sincere acting, but the story leaves little to be desired. Why, in fact, we care about these two people? It's a bit hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it is much more reduced and to find meaning in it (a welcome change of pace, if anything). <br /> <br /> I do not know that it's possible, I do not connect to these stories, because I never felt it. But I noticed that blocking these stories are generally the same, that is, it's time to talk to each other, avoiding eye contact, pretending dipped in magazines, etc. Good things about the short films is that they provide a little more space to try something different, and I would like to see a different take. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
