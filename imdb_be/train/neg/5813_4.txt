Tierney is a real tough guy, but this film is a misfire from the normal competent RKO undercuts its impact at every step. The script is about as believable as OJ Simpson at a dinner for ten Cmmandments. Just count incredibly companions car Tierney to swallow one other lame excuse for his evasive and violent actions. The old clich√© about it "only happens in the movies" is used here in excess. Then there's the guy who plays the guard who seemed to be wandering in a drunken Fields comedy, destroying threatening mood in the process. Static one-sets will not help, and neither does the apparent lack of a director pawl find material. Then add the last missing car chase as a representation and pay-offs, and the results are pretty flat. In fact, the movie only takes home station scenes, where the all-seeing police discover the hidden forces of the innocent attendants filling stations. It is a pity that his career Tieney never really gelled. I conclude that it was due mainly to the fact, as big tough guy out of the screen, both on and getting in a sloppy mess after another. His icy style and clarity of emotions remind me of the time Lee Marvin in his tough-guy better. In any case, this project could work as a radio play, but as a film noir with the promising title, it's frustrating.
