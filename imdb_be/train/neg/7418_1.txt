Oh God, what a terrible, terrible movie. Intended to be a comment on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in the reality show. Interstitials placed Jason Jones and Don McKellar most unpleasant part, written in a tone that might mean that reflective and insightful. Most likely, these moments of mind staggering, as they say on camera with dialogue written by someone with a love of insulting, condescending speech, shoved the "value" of the film down the throat. <br /> <br /> In addition viewers, point to potential filmmakers: Long takes and peaceful scenes are not equal art. Neither do the extreme corners or stretched to the absurd logic. <br /> <br /> If someone out there is interested in watching this film, please do not. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
