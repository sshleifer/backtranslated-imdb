This film is easily the worst of the series. Although New Line can simply look at the sale, they all know that the only reason this one made more money than the previous one was due to its 3D ends. It was not something that the 3D was well either, because it was the 50s 3D with red and blue lenses (anaglyph). It was just something that people wanted to see what it would look like. Also, this film was so badly done! Bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse direction. This film tries to nudge factor camp almost to the point of being, as an episode of «Looney Tunes». <br /> <br /> Seriously, not a horror audience, because it's corny and not terrible, not funny or amusing comedy for the crowd. Just mess with some really bad cameo, which is still trying to play the whole thing in the camp, and having it fall the way for what they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember that most of us who have been supporters of this series is just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it got. This is one of the movies that helped take the fear of the popularity and ride fad belief that the audience really wanted to laugh at the silly comedy than see a good and scary horror film.
