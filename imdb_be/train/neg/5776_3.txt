bad acting, bad Southern accents inconsistent cinematography terrible scenario ... <br /> <br /> I look forward to this film at the recent Film Festival and was so discouraged after seeing it. It contains quotes / Unquote name talent, but they do not deliver. Of course, the basis for this is the non-uniform and uninteresting story told. <br /> <br /> Do Not Disturb
