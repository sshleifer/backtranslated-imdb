Well, it's HORRIBLE only the first name. This film is a clich√©-ridden piece of junk. Describes how to install a high school comedy in a military training camp. It is a pity that I had to give it 1 star which he did not deserve <br /> <br /> It may contain spoilers :. <br /> <br /> Just about everything completely forced, unconvincing and unrealistic. HEPO (military police) will not come to you if you do not make their appearance, especially not on the wedding day. The actors were very confused at this stage, because the scene is not working as it was so very unlikely. You can feel it in their voices. Even if they were not such a bad actor, they could not save the scene. <br /> <br /> Next, the guy has to be carried out in her wedding dress. No, I did not have time to get it in the form of the first. Man, this is great cinema! I remember this scene for the rest of my life <br /> <br /> There is also a girl in the camp -. Exciting - one of'em even model, although in spite of the great - and steeper actress I've ever seen. I doubt that in Hollywood they would allow her to say one line in a B movie. <br /> <br /> Okay girls in the army! Now it gets fun. Girls even located on the same floor, so we can sneak into their room at night! In fact, they will be placed in another building on the quarter of a mile separated the two fences with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> There are tanks available, we can use for a fun trip in his spare time, of which we have many. No tanks are not locked and the ignition key inserted. Not one to notice the engine sounds, especially not at night. <br /> <br /> There are a bunch of sex scenes and links, and all below the waste line. We need those so sexually obsessed Germans enjoy the movie as well. Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film. Well done! <br /> <br /> One sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Of course, none of these objects are not always closed. Military procedures are sloppy as they can get. <br /> <br /> At the end of brainless flick, mafia hit men to avenge the poor man tries to shoot him! Because he left his bride! Of course, I buy that Italians that way - ligament wrestler (no). <br /> <br /> The bad guys are trying to do it in the open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Nya at night in a dark alley. Again, military training areas (where there is shooting with live ammunition) is open to the public, anyone is free to ride or walk there. There's no such thing as security guards or fees. <br /> <br /> act but a good captain is warned in time to launch a rocket into the car the Italians. Explosion knocks killers and furious bride down. No one at 40 feet at a distance does not hurt if the car to pieces. It's a comedy, remember. <br /> <br /> Good. It's a comedy, I got, and I can live with that. No need to realism. Filmmakers can easily get a way with it, if it's funny, Cleavage Party funny or entertaining, interesting and challenging. Unfortunately, it is not none of them. It's just uncomfortable. Plagiarism of mindless American comedies. Recently, at least professionally made, with no amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It's pretty boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who sit through the whole movie, as I unfortunately did. He.
