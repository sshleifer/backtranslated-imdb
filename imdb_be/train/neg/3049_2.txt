Why such a common name? Santa Claus ??? So fresh and unpredictable. Movies before trying to cash in on the holiday spirit, especially "Santa Claus will punish the Martians", at least, was interesting to watch because of the campiness to it, and all the footage is used ... for some reason that seemed happy to me. But this film only screws Christmas in the example, screws and the joy of all children. Santa lives in space? His enemy devil named Pitch? Santa gets help from the magician Merlin? How random it is? Well, as has been done in Mexico, some of you can understand the way the film was made. I had to admit, some of the effects were simply stupid at the time. It was a total cluster rabies! Although, in spite of all the trouble with the movie, it still feels like a Christmas movie. Good triumphs over evil, and Christmas is still playing the role of our hearts every good girl or boy in the world, or perhaps the universe, thanks to Santa Claus will punish Martian .. seen. So, I think you should give it a try, even if it's one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... but he should put a smile on your face on any given day.
