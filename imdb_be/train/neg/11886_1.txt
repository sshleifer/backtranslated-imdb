Watching Josh Kornbluta "act" in this film reminds me of my first TV production class, where "not funny" had a chance to prove how unfunny they actually were! <br /> <br /> obviously, the word that comes to mind when I try to synopsize this comedy impersonators. Babble jokes and telegraph. Delivery hurt badly. OH !!!!!!! Drawing up a dorkish. It looks like a show of Bob Saget. <br /> <br /> Watching this film is just as painful as watching for one and a half hours long Saturday Night Live skit (post Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hated this film and I want to get my money back !!!
