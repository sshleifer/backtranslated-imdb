I saw this movie recently in a film festival. This romantic unemployed person an ex-alcoholic who just got out of the Great Depression and one middle-aged woman who works at the employment service (INEM). I found that the story is very simple and full of clich√©s, taking the "social" theme of the film and convert it to a love comedy. The lead actor has done a good job, it certainly looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen entirely believable as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks very similar to the "high" standing woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays himself. It does this in all my films anyway. The whole mise en scene of the film was very poor. Photo is ugly and not good at using all the panoramic aspect ratio. Dialogue sounds very scripted and dull most of the time. Comic situations typical of Gomes Pereira, but in this case they are not ridiculous and poorly resolved. In my opinion, this movie is not worth watching. Only if you really like the previous films Pereira you can enjoy it a bit. Anyway, I left the theater, because I felt that I was losing time. Filmmaker was at the door. Interestingly, the director feels when he sees someone walking with one of his films, especially one that is made to please everyone.
