... because 99 out of 100 times, the manufacturers lied through his teeth (or someone else) to rent or buy them graciously * censored *. <br /> <br /> Shock-O-Rama Cinema proves the truth of this has once again with the release of "feeding the masses", and perhaps with good intentions, but utterly inept and gloomy entry into the zombie genre. Again, it is not only low-budget filmmaking, this is a very low-budget filmmaking bunch of people - I'm sorry, I know they have families who love them - never, never be in color in any significant way. This is one of baaaaaaaaaad mooin 'pitcher, people, and not just because it is cheap <br /> <br /> an ordinary act, but I do not blame the actors. they did not have the direction. They did not have any direction, because the script was polusyroem zombies fantasy without feeling real cinematic narrative. Features not thin, at best, not because of the weak dialogue and soporific direction. We have already mentioned that I have a script and direction pretty lame? They. There's no drama, no tension, no great moments of character, nothing. The whole premise of the state media suppression is spent on babble "commercial breaks" in the dramatic plot that defies rational analysis and embarrassing Shambles its absurd end. Syd Field would not be pleased. <br /> <br /> How can the government to suppress the truth virulence zombie epidemic, when the reality is evident all over the world? Why did they give it more than a quick try? In this day and age of the mobile phone with Wi-Fi cameras, they could possibly hope to achieve more than a day or so, in the best case? Now, when they lit the way of their own guilt but .... "Feeding the Masses" never explore such opportunities. Instead, it stops at the absurdity and poorly organized event digging for fun and / or values, praying his audience not nearly notice a complete lack of value of production of basic photographic equipment. Somebody paid in this film? I hope that the actors did, if only for the time wasted on the career dead ends like this; at least, technicians must rack up some legal experience. <br /> <br /> Even a zombie fans will find little to gain from the "Feeding the Messiah." gusset strange hand for non-budgeters his rank, and there are no distinctive or memorable set pieces effects. They're all eminently forgettable, actually. KNB is nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even as the Aussie stuff stillbirth "Undead" was miles ahead of "Feeding the Masses." Sorry, guys, back to the drawing board and take your marketing wrong with you.
