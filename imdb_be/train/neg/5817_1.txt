The most difficult thing in this film there is something positive about it. The characters were stereotypical "white trash", the movie "plot" was stunted from the start, and the worst feature of this film was the fact that there was already was so obviously out of the body doubles that was funny. Unfortunately, it was only funny thing in the movie. Ms. Jenkins, it would be better if in future she will refrain from using her life-story "entertain" people. It was just that bad. One positive aspect of this film (it has nothing to do with the quality of the lack of legal movie) is that my brother lecturing money for that bitch.
