The plot is so manipulative, counting entirely on the most uncredible and unimaginable decisions of adults in each and every decision on education. Children super, as the charm and shipping lines, but, as I say, the whole plot depends on each and every adult to be a complete idiot, and so in this case, it becomes more clear from their actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain the boy action total distrust). Why sweey charming little boys to take the child from the shore? As a child reach the shore and at the same time, the bill is not the last place to look? Why is happening in virtually every other place he was looking for in the 2 boys NEVER be informed instead of at the same time the child is not missing no one gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all this commotion? There's just no excuse to ask the audience to believe in it. Ask to believe that this will then make the court (even informally) too offensive to expose.
