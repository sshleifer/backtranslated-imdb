Deceptive cover, title, and very small print hidden power of prayer deceived me to rent this film. <br /> <br /> He started very well and got me out. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 it, the film started to throw things that have not been established and does not make sense. My first thought was: "This is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story." I ended up re-watch the film, thinking I missed something. <br /> <br /> By the time I reached the last 1/5 of the film, it was sad, irritable, RELIGION Thumping DIALOG that does not make sense, do not say anything, and annoying to listen to; I turned off the sound and made fast forward to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movement. <br /> <br /> Beware DVD-labeled felon Films and Path Level Productions. <br /> <br /> And I am a practicing Catholic.
