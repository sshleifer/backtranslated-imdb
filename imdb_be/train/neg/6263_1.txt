Henry Sala in "Nightmare weekend" rotten piece of sludge Troma.This is a minor, sloppy and silly low-budget horror film about some teenage girls who spend a weekend at the evil assistant professor mansion.The in luring girls in a bizarre scheme to perform disgusting experiments.Using brain implant it turns its victims and their dates into zombies. "Nightmare weekend" is a fully Braindead piece of garbage that has a lot of nudity and some cheese with dried blood, not to mention the ridiculous musical score.The acting is terrible and the script is quite a piece of shit incoherent.Why widespread beyond me .Avoid this as plague.1 10.
