His typical straight to DVD / TV-movie, including all the necessary ingredients for the horrible experience of the film: For actions WAS actors, steps on the scene, which remained unexplained, girl shows HER T * n (why god why ??), people do not They react to things as they would in real life. I will not even bore you with the details, it would take all night. Well, just one: if two people were killed in front of you as you walked down the street, one of the victims died almost in your hands, his blood streaming from his head wounds all over you, your first concern be; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face"? My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
