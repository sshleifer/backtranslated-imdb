Where is Michael Caine, when you need it? I have seen most of the MST3K many seasons, but it is rare to the first season of Flicka (Episdoe K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever. Three "StarÂ», Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace, and Burgess Meredith, struggle through the worst game ever cinema, which deliver a line that should have been written by a working group of secret Cheney-style, consisting of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit research and energy efficiency. It looks like it was filmed in almost complete darkness, perhaps on Super 8. Makes Run Logan look cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I can not imagine watching it without comment Crow and Servo, as it is unwatchable even with him. It is obvious that you need in Hollywood is a kind of 401K, which prevents the need for actors to take on the bad films like this in order to pay for health care. With his "right to pollute and control" theme, in the end, I was half expecting to see a cameo Charlton Heston, where he delivers his "cold dead hands" speech. Or, I could forgive you for it in 1989, but in 1981?
