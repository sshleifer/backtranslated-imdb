«Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that can happen is created by Chuck Jones classic characters. In «Loony Tunes» has a lot of spin and -offs different versions, some of them were good, others not so .Y «Loonatics» is the worst .The concepts of silly and derivative shows how the «Power Rangers» and «Teen Titans» , There was no resemblance to the original characters and stories are sad and poorly done. New design and animation ugly deplorable. This show just does not work .This terrible waste animation is a complete failure, and it should not be anything more than a bad joke. Lame! zero stars
