I would give this movie a zero out of ten, but I'll give it two. The first reason is that Shah Rukh Khan will appear in the film, which is not really the reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this film and makes cuddle with Kamal. I Love Rani a lot and there's a respect that she is a famous actress. That's why I never used it in the film kissing Kamal, but not a big problem. Anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film much, lets really talk about this film. Whether it is good or bad, I think it is quite a trash movie that made me yawn. I, being a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ review by clicking on my name, I have excellent taste. The film is not entertaining this one, and if it is assumed to be a hard-hitting film, why the morale in this film. Its biased film is not a true story and it stinks. Watching Kamal kiss the actress makes me sick, a person can not kiss properly anyway.
