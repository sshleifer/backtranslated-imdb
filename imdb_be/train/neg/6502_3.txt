Given the opportunity to write, direct and star in his own film, I would probably opt for something a robot woman with arms. Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make, perhaps, the most bizarre movie anyone has ever seen. "Slipstream" is a film that is so amazing that even David Lynch is likely to look at the person next to him and say, 'What's happening? ". <br /> <br /> This is a film where in one scene, a man crosses the road to the yellow car, facing right, who suddenly transforming into a pink car, facing left. This is a movie where two characters it is punctuated with occasional shots of people laughing and insects climbing up the walls. This is a film where the person begins to speak of «Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers» only for this particular movie actor suddenly found like myself (and then disappear into thin air). <br /> <br /> This is a film that addresses the need for a coherent plot to throw right out the window and use fifteen different changes while doing this, as well as the transition from black and white to color, seemingly for no reason at all. <br /> <br /> I must, however, pay tribute to Mr. Hopkins for his choice of actors in the film (some of which depict a few characters). All those involved in the rush to their roles, even though they probably do not have a clue about what they actually do. My favorite here was a thug Christian Slater in the hat, which was impressively menacing while murmuring nonsense and singing the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins has been quoted that he made this film as a joke, and it's probably the best way to sum up «Slipstream». This is a joke on the audience. You'll watch it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is going on and in the hope that the answer will come, only to discover that the answer is never actually does. That the culmination of this particular joke, only Anthony Hopkins never know. <br /> <br /> I mentioned earlier, David Lynch, and I'm a big fan of this particular director. I would assume that Anthony Hopkins shared my love like "Twin Peaks," "Blue Velvet" and «Lost Highway". However, "Slipstream" is not satisfied as any of Lynch films, despite the many imitation its methods (although I was surprised to find that no one talks back to «Slipstream»). It's too chaotic and randomly - another reviewer here said that this film version of Alzheimer's disease. Without a doubt, there is a small number who are able to look at it and make something out of it. Unfortunately for all of us, «Slipstream» quickly becomes frustrating and confusing experience, which was only made because of the participation of Hopkins. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
