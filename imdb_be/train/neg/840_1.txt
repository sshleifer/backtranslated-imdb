I totally agree with the last commentator, this may be the worst movie ever made .I also had to fast-forward for most of the film. Michael Madsen had to make this film as a favor someone.The image quality is grainy .and all the way through the little story is, it's just silly .I give this movie 1 out of 10, if I could give it a low rating, I would. Do not waste your time on this film, or you'll regret it.
