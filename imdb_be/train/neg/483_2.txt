I do not think that the French could make a bad film, but I was obviously very wrong. As mentioned earlier, this film mostly uses the symbol name as a starting point; his picture of her life and the person does not have little or nothing to do with real Zhentileskami. <br /> <br /> scenario awful - pretentious, stilted, and fresh - and rewriting the facts extremely offensive even in a genre that all too often makes his life, distorting rather than retelling, stories, along with some pretty decent set design, physical charms Valentina Cervi is the main asset of this film, and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this, too; they do not take the time to deliberate various "erotic" sequences that are relevant to tickle more than the plot or character development. Unfortunately, the call to see a pretty young girl in a state of sexual arousal feigned can not, withstand this film. Actions unremarkable, and evaluation is all too common, in spite of the interesting chord or two. Cinematography in order, and there are some beautiful colors, but there are some pretty funny sequence with the effects of lens distortion more suitable for the 1960s film FreakOut than costume drama. In any case, the script leaves the camera housing too often Artemisia body, and too rare at her paintings. <br /> <br /> All said and almost complete failure. This is not an intellectual or enough to be a serious film with taste, and it is too slow and pretentious work soft core pornography. Thus, the French may fail in the end!
