This might be a pathological fascinating look at the life of one of the most notorious serial killers in America, but, unfortunately, it is not even close. Terrible editing, direction, bad action, you name it. This film is just about 10 minutes of plot extended to 100. Single sacrificial quality of Bruce Davidson, as a father, but it is not enough to save this stinker. A 1 in 10.
