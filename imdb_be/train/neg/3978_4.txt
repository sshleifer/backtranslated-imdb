When in Rome definite improvement in Getting There. Getting There I found too predictable, contrived and slowly, and to this day I still think this is the worst the Olsen twins. However, at the time when the film is not terrible in Rome, this is not a big one either. If I had to sum up in one word, I would say, patency. This is good fun for teenagers, but I think that adults will not find a lot going on. <br /> <br /> When in Rome has its good points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, is actually quite decent actress, of course, very nice, as well. I admit, when I was 10 or so, I really liked them, and in general I like them so far. And I enjoyed some of his films, as a passport in Paris and New York minute. Therefore, for the purposes both of the girls do not do a bad job, that they are very attractive. Plus their clothes are to die for, and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking Rome. The soundtrack is not half bad. <br /> <br /> However, if the film is cleared in the story and the script. The script for the most part unchanged and has a hint of deja vu. The plot, as well as most of the films Mary Kate and Ashley are very predictable, and anyone who is familiar with the work of any other twins Olsen, find some pretty non-original elements to it. Most thin cardboard characters, and you will not know very much about them, and sometimes uneven pace. Unfortunately, the breathtaking scenery is spoiled pretty sloppy camerawork, which looked toward the time. <br /> <br /> In general, it has its good moments, and certainly watchable. However, for my taste, it is harmless and predictable fluff teenager. 4/10 Bethany Cox
