First of all, I, too, waited for another hero - a fantastic piece of art for the action genre. I only saw part of the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine that it's better than HoFD <br /> <br /> The main elements of the character found in HoFD :. Great scenery, stunning cinematography, and sincere action (I mean, if you can not understand a word they say, without subtitles, but you still care - it's good acting) <br /> <br /> what went wrong so? What begins with the political intrigue wanders into a love story. Worse, it's a soap opera as a love triangle. You have three characters, which, I think, fall in otherwise without good reason. This film is basically falling apart after the jailbreak (I slept for about forty minutes into it). It's almost as if they have changed the writer at this point. The rest of the film is about how the character "like the wind." Ick. Also, you really have to stretch the suspension of disbelief to believe action set pieces. It is not unique for the genre, but as the story is weak, you can not expect action, and then, when the struggle to take breaks, it actually was not so good. Start grabs you, but this film is simply running out of gas.
