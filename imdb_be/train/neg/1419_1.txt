This is a horrible little film - and, unfortunately, the company that made this short did several others. Short, in fact the idea of ​​a joke that was not funny to begin with, and it can also hurt you. This, of course, made me uncomfortable to watch very young children (most were about 2 years old) jumping about and pretending to be adults - in this case, dancehall girl and bar patrons number. It is a kind of humor that you might be forced to laugh with your own children, when they pretended to be adults, but I can not see those who want to see it - especially when very young Temple Shirley wearing a rather tight-fitting outfit and acts as a vamp !! And then, like other children behave as adults in some pretty adult situations. At the time, I'm sure they did not try to appeal to pedophiles, but when you look at it today, it's what comes to mind! Because of this, it is also a sad movie creeped me, and I hope never to see it again !! Rather strange and rather creepy.
