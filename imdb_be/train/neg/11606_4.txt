Decent enough with some classy imagery, however tiny budget complicates things. <br /> <br /> I also get the impression that they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic pervert pervert site things. <br /> <br /> If you like anime in particular, things like cyber city and the AD Police, it can on the street. <br /> <br /> but basically its a low budget matrix of cash, however, is not completely devoid of their own style. <br /> <br /> Big soundtrack of some unheard-grunge / punk / post-grunge bands. Worth checking out, if only for the soundtrack.
