I am a Christian. I have always been skeptical about the films made by Christians, however. As a rule, they are "know-nothings" when it comes to producing a movie. I admire alkalinity for to represent God and Jesus in a positive and honest on the screen. However, they have done abominable work it. The acting was terrible, and if someone is not familiar with the Bible, in a sense, could not understand what the film is trying to convey. Moreover, the film is badly made, but the people who have made it even had some of the facts wrong. However, this "criticism", and these facts are irrelevent to delve too deeply. In short, Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anyone, for comic every day grind the exception.
