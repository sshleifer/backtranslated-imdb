Anthology is always a risky business, and I think that these efforts should be praised. There's a lot of talent involved here. A lot of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy this film, based on the three issues that I had. <br /> <br /> First of all, the segments are incredibly different in tone and quality. And, unfortunately, some of them are in conflict with others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped me. As the seeds of good stories that will never be realized. I'm not talking about happy endings here (or even the end of a period), but rather, they do not have enough even basic development or even tight fitting that attract you. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I did not feel New York and its residents have been properly painted. <br /> <br /> The fact that you have stayed in the highbrow short films, which may still be of interest to some, but to leave the average viewer unsatisfied.
