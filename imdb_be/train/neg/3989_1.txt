Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are that reveals emotional scene between two people? If Flipper confronts his wronged wife in the locker room, the song is sung to the lyrical content as loud as in a dialogue, so that no one can hear no, spreading any emotional impact, perhaps, was the scene. Annabella scene as they beat her father with fists, a lamp, and then the belt was so grotesquely as absurd. This entire film cartoon, rampant prejudice against whites literally amazing. Discussion of black women after his wife Flipper to know that he cheated on her with a white woman - as if it was the discussion via the discussion of Oxford team is ridiculous. Rampant racism can be tolerated, but the soundtrack and sound mixing during this "film" too much. It was technically poorly made film. There's no understanding of the basic craft of filmmaking, audio track, editing, and desperate attempts of the great actors who are trying to keep the film afloat. I actually felt sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he took the role in this film - his appearance in this painful. This is the first movie that I saw the director, and it will be my last.
