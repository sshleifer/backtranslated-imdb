If a person who does not have Alzheimer's disease can not remember how many films he has made, he is probably the most prolific director in the world, after all. This man, Jesus Franco, the King of the so-called «Eurotrash». His 1980 flick Devil Hunter rushed like, transparent, stupid, lazy, and operating in the truest sense of the word (the name of the film to enter in error, for starters), just like any other film I saw Franco. It does sound pretty awful, and it's ... However, Franco has some incomparable sensuality, generous way from poorly outrageous, nudity and immoral and violent, and even with his stupid deshevomom editing, which is trying to build a more extreme haste with which all his films have been made. The combination of all these elements leads to you to ride his films, even while you're basically waiting for them until the end, because they are so very tiresome. <br /> <br /> The Devil Hunter almost incomprehensible for the first half hour. Steals strangers with a white woman who seems to be a model or a movie star sidebar with a bunch of native in South America. There's a lot of naked writhing, dancing and endless repetitive zoom-in on the ugly totem. You have to get used to the repetitive zoom-in technology and cutting back to the same shot about three times in succession immediately, since they are the main methods of Franco extension to the length of the film functions. <br /> <br /> monster that looks like a totem pole is actually kind of scary. He has the raw bug eyes, and his presence always signaled on the soundtrack cacophony of moaning, apparently recorded in the echo chamber. At the beginning of the play he chews on a native lady, tied to a tree, and it is difficult to understand what is really going on here, but I think he ate her belly (or her genitals, sweet Jesus!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the adventure begins right if studly guy and his freaked-out Vietnam vet friend sent to the island to restore the white girl from kidnappers. The strange behavior of the guy has the focus, which is dubbed, is a Brooklyn-half American, half English, and Liverpool all backward. All dialogue and dubbing funny and ridiculous, which makes for another layer of the film, which can in some way to keep your interest. <br /> <br /> Not too much really happens from now on, and it is pretty slow, studded with the odd little disturbance as rape. Foggy action concretized (ha ha!) Accra 360 degrees nakedness from the natives, and two women are, and even from the monster. The fact that he walks with his penis exposed brands Wrestling him unappetising prospect of a tough guy hero, but it must be done at some point, and it is gratifying to note that the director will draw genitalia on the camera. <br /> <br /> The best feature Devil Hunter is a shooting place. Franco can be very cheap to the structural and narrative aspects of filmmaking, but he did not wander around with sets. You get a real island, jungle, helicopters and mountain, all in widescreen. That's what's really cool experience in these days of bad CGI sets and backgrounds ads on edge. <br /> <br /> In the end, issues recommendations, which concerned this film seem controversial. If you are trying to view a video nasty, you have to look at it at some point and you'll be done as careful as I am. If you like to Franco, you'll be looking at it anyway. If you fall into any of the categories listed above, chances are you will never have with this film. Copies of it are not just lying around, and I could not recommend seeking it out. This Franco. Lazy, crazy Franco.
