And Oscar mostly under rated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Fry. Seriously, his name should be indicated with the same reverence as Karloff, Lugosi, and the price, and this film proves it. His character was one of the German 2 reasons I can give to see this movie. Dwight gave it a bit more than slightly perturbed mismatch attractive even worse behavior that led you in the hope of a big part whole movie. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the comic M. Eburne. Being in the medical profession itself, I give kudos to the expert performance Pity prone hypochondriac. While other "medical errors" did give a short laugh, especially if good examples of his fellow doctor doctors drugs ... "Well, it continues to give to the" Unfortunately, these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake at 3 seats attempts through it unbearably slow film. The plot is predictable only a few minor twisting. Shooting while pulling off a legitimate ghost atmosphere was more productive at what to me yawn. - Yes, you can use too much shade <br /> <br /> My advice - look at it once to see Fry and Eburne - but only when you do not sleep with a lot of caffeine.
