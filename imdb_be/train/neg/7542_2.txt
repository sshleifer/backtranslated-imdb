This movie is suppose to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man in search of the missing girl. Nevertheless, after 30 minutes in the movie, it turns into a funny, unreal stories with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine anyone not laughing when the cell accidentally Karate legs that blonde or if it "bears" punch that old lady. Lines, symbols and actions are done with all the bad start. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he made some terrible movies in this year; this being by far the worst one (so far ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch an intense story, gripping thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go rent the original. However, if you intend on watching it, be ready to laugh at some of the lines and the end of the scene, but do not take them seriously; that is the only way, you'll enjoy this movie.
