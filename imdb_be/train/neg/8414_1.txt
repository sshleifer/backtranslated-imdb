Yes. Surely, I have seen this movie years ago, when it came to the Supremes. <br /> <br /> Another redesigned story glitzed up Hollywood style, borrowing scenario the best film-making, he-in-music industry. <, Br /> <br /> Nothing original here. <br /> <br /> more makeup, glammier costumes and choreography = more money for the dubious "talentedÂ» Beyonce draw. <br /> <br /> If you are a throwback to the style, you need to assess the real group that fought (not digitized voice and Hollywood Empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce participation makes this hypocritical rubbish.
