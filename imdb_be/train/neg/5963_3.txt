The film begins with the performance of the practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress. His head is chopped off and buried separately from his body ... sounds like Â«The Thing, that would not die", is not it? Well, it's playing a little bit like that, but as soon as the body is reunited with his head, all the interesting and horrible deaths made and the film moves very slowly. I mean that the film is only 88 minutes long, and I kept thinking, "When will it end?" The characters in the film are idiots for the most part, and they pretty much deserved to die for what actually po- stupid. The villain is also very bad as he moves slowly and do you wonder how he manages to do something given that he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing to keep you looking after reconnecting the head is the fact that there are so many boobs flashing signals that you really start to lose. Nevertheless, I want to see a horror film, not soft core porn flick and as a horror film is a way to slow down the movement path of many slow segment be even more enjoyable. And do not read the back of the box, as he had done as they were flesh eating zombies are attacking the city, there is no ... only a small stage, where three or four zombies are attacking the house and so easily repelled, they are not a factor at all in the movie and the scene rather pointless. So, for the most part I'm talking, you should avoid this movie, if you come across it very cheap.
