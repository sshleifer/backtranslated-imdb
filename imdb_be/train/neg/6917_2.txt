Once again the same familiar story of a man (the author here), who sold his soul to the devil to have your most desired ambition in life: success. Unfunny script (we should "go home and write better"), funny lines in order to understand the "strong" message «Christmanish» (our only desire in life to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long court scene at the end, where the agent Hopkins beat the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt sexy entirely or evil in general) for all the bad things she has done in this unpleasant character. Nha bad effort on the part of the actors (Baldwin as a director, Cattrall in " sex and the city "role again Aykroyd with some funny lines in it bounded p ollie). PS Try also not as popular film from Greece under the name «Alloimono stous skills", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (the old to give his soul to the devil to regain his youth)
