All right. Who was it? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? You tripping on Ecstasy head pipes? There were so many of you. You did it to dare? Is this some kind of cult? Or Guy Ritchie himself to sign 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I'll talk about it. Just because you do not understand, the movie does not mean it's not great. Maybe you had a bad day at work, or you sit down to watch a movie after you've had an argument with his wife, and then not in the mood. Maybe there is a more fundamental stone block like you just do not have enough mental capacity or highly developed philosophical sense to engage with it. BUT. And it is very, very big but. Elephant-sized mega-but XXL, to end all Boots. <br /> <br /> Please do not confuse the difficulty of inconsistency, and please do not confuse the two hours of non-Squirter for an interesting film. In fact. You may think that you are very smart. You can even think of myself as more romantic figures: independent thinker advocates a masterpiece against the choir of sheep as skeptics. Please do not. You're embarrassing yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver waste each time. If you were thinking about when in a few minutes, you would recognize it too. It was a waste gypsum crew waste, of provisions, and, of course, a waste of valuable minutes (you can not get them back, you know) from those who are not lucky to sit through this incredible, unhappy mess <br /> <br / >. "No - wait," comes a voice in the darkness. "You just do not understand its nonlinear This means that the story does not go in a straight line This is actually a complex and delicate work with the filmmaker he solves difficult existential questions and in any case -..... They planned FIGHT CLUB, when he first I came out - not you hear -Because they could not cope with the complexity they eat humble pie now you hate Bet Lynch films also doncha «? ..? <br /> <br /> I hate to disappoint you, but I'm a big fan of Lynch. I rather like Memento, so the story told in an unconventional way, not necessarily to fill me with fear. Although I have studied only briefly a few years ago, I was very interested in philosophy. I do not not like Revolver for these reasons. I do not like, because it pretends to be a tangible, big-brained subjects, but deals with them in a superficial way insulting to be a clown. I'm not so much a chess player, but Richie idea about how chess works, it seems that a precocious four years. I do not like, because the characters, without exception, completely alienated me. "Aha!" Exclaimed apologist Richie. "The guy deftly tilting his hat Brecht!" Just maybe, you're right. I think it more likely that he simply can not write a decent script toffee. <br /> <br /> In comparison with Revolver Fight Club is really very instructive. Fight Club has an acid tongued, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. Revolver has a stale cookie reject sharpness that make your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great twist that makes you rethink everything that has happened. Revolver has, as far as I can tell, a few obscure corners that do not offer any pleasure, because ... well, they do not make sense. If you keep pulling the rug out from under people, they will eventually get you out of your home. Then they close the doors and windows. And they never let you down again. Ever. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie seems to suggest that, as a philosophical entails chanting small buzz-phrases. Basically, they say, but often they erupt on the screen with attribution. It's almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film especially remarkable is the way in which something strange may be married so neatly all the tired clichés of gangster in the world. In the end it so insignificant. You do not care about anything. You do not understand anything. You go home <br /> <br /> In fact, there was little I liked :. Alarmed by the killer, having a crisis of confidence. He's big. But I can not recommend you see the movie just to see it. He's only in it for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. It's terrible.
