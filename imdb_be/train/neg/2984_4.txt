I admit that the majority of this film was uninspired, but I still entertained. He has a great sense of the feverish energy, higher than the average music, and the women in the film vigorously defend ourselves, no prissies here. I can think of dozens of other films that were much worse, at least, this one was an intriguing story with some social commentary.They hint how the military deals with virus epidemics and destroy everything in sight, even if it means that the people you 're to be saving.Also, how dangerous military situation may be, as at this moment, democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to attempt to combine his previous work (zombies, beyond the gates of hell) in an attempt to somehow improve on them.He failed, but certainly not with a bang, as the number of people will have you think.I It has a soft spot for zombie movies, so I admit that I am somewhat biased when it comes to considering them.All I want to say that this movie is good for one time around, if it was not so much a decline in the creation of this film (Fulci quit smoking and Bruno (I can crack with the best of them), Mattei took over), that could be much better and focus ed.It going to stay in my collection, like a zombie swan song.One amazing Fulci note, that there is a scene in the zombie 3, the cemetery people actually ripped off, I could not believe it yourself, check it out, you will be surprised.
