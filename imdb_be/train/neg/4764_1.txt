86 minutes of my life wasted. I slept for the first time I tried to watch it, and I must say that I am not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a senseless plot acted in such a stilted and by force, and one can only assume that the actors were tough as the protagonist, the writer was allegedly in the film itself. <br /> <br /> All in this difficult adaptation outplayed. And if this is not the wooden acting as if you can see the teleprompter, and then he set that overlit and interferes with the completely unnecessary way, and dressed very nicely unimaginable degree, enough to put you all a farce. <br /> <br /> As to the alleged impact detective in disguise, any person who does not see that - yes the same as all the rest of this ludicrous plot - wired light-years ahead, check the vision immediately. <br /> <br /> The bad action, and two very decent actors, combined with the hyper-pampered Branagh overdirection trademark, enough to make you want to use real bullets, not space themselves. <br /> <br /> at the top of all this, there is absolutely ludicrous overtones homoerotica this is amplified by the end of this. All I can hope for is that it was a failure, that people should not try to emulate the level of a movie ever again.
