However, I saw this piece with an already very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a pretty mediocre composer parvenu whose incompetence is only exceeded by the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> It was the first cartoon that I saw, which was 100 per cent free of humor. It's rude, insulting, cattle and frankly anti-women. Thus, it is the creation of proper patient, but the average viewer is more likely to be put off by it. Not surprisingly, he was never shown in the cinema: It would never bombed BIG time <br /> <br /> I do not Consumption 6,5 MegaEuros were able to keep this a complete piece of crap !. ... Save your time and money!
