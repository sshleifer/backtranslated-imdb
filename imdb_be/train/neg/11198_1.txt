I should not even consider this film, because it is not really a horror film - and, therefore, does not deserve the attention of Dr. Cheese. At least it's not horror in the usual sense of the word. This, of course, a terrible position to waste your time watching this crap. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise when the clock showed that only 45 minutes have passed. Yes, it is true; tricks, the film b-o-r-e-g. <br /> <br /> «Order» had many shortcomings, not all of them are unique. In particular, it seems to me, the main problem with the "religious" sub-genre of horror films is the reluctance of Hollywood to engage Christianity on their own terms. It is possible to make a truly terrible films that are also Orthodox. Just ask Blatty. In fact, without the orthodoxy, films like this are just permissiveness buffet directors (usually stupid and illogical) fantasy. <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone made a movie ostensibly about, say, physics, but it was not only the basic laws of physics are not so, but claimed the whole story on their figures wrong, you will soon get tired as a result of the senseless plot. The same applies to such films. <br /> <br /> In other words, the "Order" (and many similar films before him) to come up with all the fabric material about the Catholic Church and the Christian faith and the attempt to build the story of these inventions. Not surprisingly, the story ends up being inconsistent and stupid. This film has the added charm of being interesting to see how your toenails growing. <br /> <br /> To avoid this steaming pile.
