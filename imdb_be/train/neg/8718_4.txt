The third installment of the trilogy "carnosaurs" has a bunch of Keystone Kops as military spies who try to kill two velociraptors and T-Rex. I give it 4 out of pure sympathy and my resemblance to a dinosaur. The film is by far the worst of the trilogy, it really can not be taken lightly. More important, however, to watch this movie, I can not help but notice some interesting parallels between the "carnosaurs" and "Trilogy XTRO". The first installment of the franchise in both dark and disturbing film that became a cult classic, the second is the «Alien» robbery, and the third is a tongue in cheek, almost a farce, which has (intentionally or not) a movie you rolling on the floor laughing . In addition, as the franchise "XTRO", all the films, "carnosaurs" completely unrelated to each other. They only they are called to drum up interest in the franchise "sequels", I think. Obviously, "carnosaurs" and "XTRO" have two different production groups at work here, but if you've seen all three films of the franchise both you find yourself referring back and forth between them.
