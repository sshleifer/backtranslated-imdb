Despite the overall pleasant story and expensive products one question, as the director can do so much bulky cultural mistakes. Where the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Nha payroll obvious. <br /> <br /> Japanese friend of mine actually laughed at some of the cultural absurdities she tracked unfold before her eyes. In a later conversation, she said, "Imagine a Finnish filmmaker makes a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War with blond Swedish actor as allied army and the French as the Confederates. Worse imagine dressing up the female role Scarlett O'Hara during a hoop skirt and a sports hoop absent 1950s hairstyles. maybe some people in Finland can not understand that the hoop skirt "no wrap" or recognize the bizarre hair Jane Mansfield, but in Atlanta, they would not believe his eyes or ears .... and be laughing in the aisles of a beautiful story ... and photos will be cursed. <br /> <br /> So ... Watch Memoirs of a Geisha were painful for those who are familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, the actual geisha or Japanese clothes, and that was the subject of the movie! Hollywood strange in his short-sighted vision of the film. They often receive a lot of money right thing, letting the details that really polished movies grace dramatically wrong. I thought, "The Last Samurai" was the crowning achievement of how bad could it be otherwise good film about Japan. Memoirs of a Geisha is dramatically better and worse at the same time.
