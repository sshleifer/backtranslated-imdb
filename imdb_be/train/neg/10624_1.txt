Otherwise, a good overview, loleralacartelort7890 says: "The truth is that the Americans use a secret alloy aluminum anti-radiation This is not something that is well known and the exact specifications of a secret and why it's a secret ... Well, why do they have to disclose it then ?? If they where in the space race with the Russian, then it would be very foolish to show that they had a new technology that could protect the crew from radiation. " This is completely wrong. There is not (and was) no "secret" in radiation protection in Apollo. Design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been available to the public. It uses light "cell" of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except for the window, of course) is covered with a heat shield made of phenolic resin is thicker on the bottom, which faces forward during reentry. These materials are actually * better * when you stop the type of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is best suited to stop the ionizing photons, X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> cosmic radiation is a particular problem * * long-term space flight due to the risk of large solar flares. But it just was not a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. Command module gave them a pretty good defense during their short (1/2 hour or so) passing through the Van Allen belts. All of them were carrying dosimeters so that we know exactly how much radiation each of them has received: no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. From 24 women, which fly to the moon (12 of which the landed), 18 are still alive. Only two have died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Svizhert (bone cancer). Others have died from heart attacks, pancreatitis (Roosa), as well as a traffic accident (Conrad). It's actually a very good statistics for a group of men, now in their late 70s (Shepard will be 86).
