Mensah constantly, fiercely, not like shouting «B ** h!" Women like to cry «N ** ger!" The black people, except it's worse. Remember, B word, unlike the N words is only a derogatory term that is still associated with the use of violence on a daily basis. "B ** h!" It is the last thing a woman can hear before they are raped, beaten or killed. This guy perpetuates violence by hate, using the language of violence. It looks like he may be a gay guy is trying to cover women-bashing, so that it will sound like a straight. And what about all Nazi white guys in their audience, giving Nazi salutes while their stupid little Bimbo white women whining tee xx on their side, obviously afraid to challenge this tidal wave of hate women. Or, hee hee. Mencia rate does not believe and does not support freedom of speech for them! Well, Carlos ?? You want women to have freedom of expression B ** CH-slap you like a loud and furious and boastful as you do, or do you think "free speech" only for men shitting on women ???
