I can not understand all the hype about this movie. Well, if you like cheap spray, you will love this film, but if you like a good story and good actors - not to look at it. Personally, I really did not like the actors in this film, it seems that they are hired directly from the street. The dialogues are completely flat and you'll always know what's coming next. The overall quality of the film is lacking in supposable very low budget. When we saw this film (I and 3 other people) we all had in mind that this film was made by some people that are needed for that, just to get their graduation in film school - with the least effort. Another issue that really reduces the whole experience is a bad cam (very shaking) and bad sound, the whole film seems, recored with a single microphone.
