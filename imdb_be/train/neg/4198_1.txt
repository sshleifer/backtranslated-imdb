I caught this movie on Cuban on the art house cinema club. This was shown, soon after the arbitration 1935 Silly Symphony cartoon, where the symphony island reconciled with the island of Jazz. That the recently deceased Ruben Gonzalez conveyor through the dynamics of the old cinema hall and a Cuban flag hangs from peeling stucco rocaille motifs, the scene was set for a celebration riproaring engaged filmmaking and synchronized sizzle on the small stuff with the Helms-Burton Act. But when the movie started. And peeling paint in the film gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on the screen. <br /> <br /> Subject Nada Mas promises a lot. Charles Stamper soggy envelope on the Cuban post office. Her only escape from the humdrum existence is completely steal letters and rewrite them, transforming the basic interpersonal grunt in BrontÃ«an breathing outbursts of emotion. Ki many shots photogenic Cubans gush of joy, sadness, self-pity, fear, and the like. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the simplicity of the narrative marred by endless excursions into film school artiness, Latin caricature Marx Brothers farce, and even - during a particularly destructive editing tricks -. celluloid creaking in the student's face spoiling the character <br /> <br /> dimensional characters enough. Cunda, the boss at the post office, it is sadly vamp-Nosferatu. Her accomplice dishonest, Concha, variously showing thumbs up, overhears and squeals. Cesar, the metalworker dolt and romantic interest, shows the hidden talent of writing, when Karl went to Miami. The chase scene (in a fun way fast forward) thrown in for good measure. All this would be fine in Mortadello and Philemon the comic, but in black and white zero-FX Flick with highbrow pretensions, um. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas is trying to ride the turnstile somewhere between "a nimble-heroine-matchmakes-strangers Amelie and" poetry, as a pro-redeemer "theme with the postman. Amelia, his character is an eccentric one white woman fights coming spinsterdom, trying to bring to life the magic of strangers. and as a postman, the film does not flinch from long solo poetry and the postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead. Unfortunately, Nada Mas can not capture the magnificent and transcendence or movie. <br /> <br / > There are two things that may deserve to watch this movie in night TV stupor. P ershy of them is opening overhead shot of Carla in the cap of the floor tiles, which cuts into the crossword puzzle she is working on the Second, to see Nada Mas cautionary example:. our post Buena Vista Social Club obsession with the Cuban artistic production often Blinker us in making any waste featuring bongos on track This film does not deserve a global release -. movies such as a waiting list and Guantanamera cover similar thematic territory much more successful.
