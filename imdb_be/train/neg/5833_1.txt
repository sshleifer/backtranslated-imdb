3lbs, obviously just very lenient program for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / moody deep physician. Unlike the House, he is absolutely not a person, and in contrast to the Gray's Anatomy brain surgery cases are't even interesting. This program must be installed in the leading center for cases Neurlogical - until there is nothing interesting or exciting happens! Not even the pathetic so-called "hostility" between him and rival adds nothing to the show and neither do these hallucinations. The pilot had a short glimpse into the society cites as his father - to take a nap! a sad and senseless. <br /> <br /> This show pants, have a glut of medical dramas around at the moment, and it does nothing to make it stand out as a special.
