The film begins with some scrolling text, which takes about five minutes. This gives a basic summary of what was going on. This could easily be done with the current, but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you filled with characters that you know a little about how to keep in mind that this is all that you learn about them. The plot begins to descend to the ground, and then falls through the whole movie. Not only is that a change in the story, but you can even ask yourself if your watching the same film. I've never played a video game, but I know people who have. From my understanding of how you played the game or not, this film does not get better. Save your money if you do not like to sleep in theaters.
