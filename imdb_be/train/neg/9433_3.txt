I bought frustrated because I was cheated on bloody picture on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the film just look at the back of the box. All the killings have been shown and I can honestly say that they look much better in a still frame, than they do in the movies. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let's look at the story. College management team girls at a rock concert (through deep, dark forests in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on film) to slide off the road. No visible damage is done to the car, but apparently it was enough to make one of the characters in a coma for the rest of the film (or maybe she read the script and was in a coma before filming). <, Br /> <br /> two remaining girls wake up in a large, isolated house. House, by the way, fabulous and manages more drama just by their presence, than any of the actors in the film. For some reason, however, the house has no roads that go to it. The only way you can get to the main road trips five miles through the woods. The girls spend the rest of the upset to sit listening to strange conversations between the old rich bitch (who looks like George Washington in the resistance) and her equally home, sexually repressed daughter. Girls, apparently in no hurry to return to this show in any case that they got more clothes than throwing the island of Gilligan for three o'clock tour. <br /> <br /> By the time when we, the audience, to get a scene of destruction, we are no longer worried. We want someone to be killed us just finish our suffering. Frustrated finally wraps up with a rather shocking ending that deserves to be in a much better film. It's almost as if the ending is one good idea in the film, was written first, and then the authors have tried to make the film, leading to it. <br /> <br /> Frustrated ultimately boring film with bad acting, mismanagement, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porn movie (sorry. I do not know where it came). You get an idea of ​​how bad this film during the opening credits, if for some reason that is never explained, the screen darkens for approximately two minutes, until the characters talk about what should be remembered. Do not waste your time. You just feel frustrated and want your time and money.
