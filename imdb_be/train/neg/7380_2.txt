I think the time has come for Segal to go quietly into the night. What I just saw does all it straight to video releases in the last few years to look his early 90s hits by comparison. <br /> <br /> secret biological laboratory makes a new kind of drug that jacks up the adrenaline system of the human to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. Once Segal should stop the infection or its end of the world ... or something. Segal also took a hit squads as jellybeans, every time I look, he commands a new face, so interesting it was difficult to follow the development of the character, and I know that Stephen athsma prevent him from screaming at the top of his lungs, but even so, why did he constantly voiced by people who do not sound anything like him? Normally films plot and sequence of actions can save him from being a waste of time, but it was not even close. As I said, it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and the stem thrust, rather than straight up fighting. The problem was not really scared, and looked out of place completely Segal, because infected people should have the velocity of light is the same 40-year-old 280 pounds Segal killed them all alone? I believe that the lone highlight of the film was the first 20 minutes, where recruits are asked Segal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
