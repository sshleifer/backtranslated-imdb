I am at this very moment the discussion, if I should even watch this "bullshit" from the movie. They had a very interesting idea, buried with film-making, and that was it. Until now, this strange medley has no real history. There are many buried, a wolf headed monster running amok, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors would be attacked by the wolf disguised as it may be. What I would have missed if I had a good feeling to get this nonsense is the pursuit of the gods, some really bad C.G.I., some incredibly stupid dialogue, worse C.G.I., and the hero fights a paper expression. In addition to the original idea, the film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. My mistake was to continue viewing. - MERK
