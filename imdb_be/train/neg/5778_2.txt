Okay, so I'm dying to see this movie. Stoked about the "who's who" in the land of terror, which in the film .... well, my friend rented it, bring it, and we started playing. It must be a comedy .... I do not even grinning a time until 40min mark. <br /> <br /> It has to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there are movies out there that cost NEAR absolutely nothing, and they are surprisingly (for me anyway). In addition, while watching this movie, I could not understand the similarity (ie theft) on the indie low budget film called "actress Apocalypse", read my review of it (it destroys this movie BTW). <, Br /> <br /> this movie ... it had the potential, he really did. It was the "star power" stolen plot (allows the film behind the scenes in the making of the film ... the IE ... "actress APOCALYPSEÂ» .... seriously, it angers me more and more I think about) ... it really could have been funny. Many, many jokes fall flat. It is acting in a manner that it is. But it did not funny, and the plot has been completely stolen. <br /> <br /> I give this the two, because there was SOOO terrible, but it's the only reason.
