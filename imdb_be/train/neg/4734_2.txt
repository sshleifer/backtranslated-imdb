Do you love a beautiful girl? Yes, me too. What's bad to say about beautiful girls / women? Nothing imo, so why would not I would give this film only two stars out of five, although he received the "talents" with Chiaki smoked and Aya Ue? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to watch the beautiful people, I would watch MTV or something, that's why. This film, the so-called fighter, however. So, by definition, do not even really need a story right? I do not agree 100%, but let's say, and to do so. So what does it do? 20 minutes of footage from Part 1 (I might be exaggerating a bit, but it felt like more than 20 minutes ...)? That would be "No". But then again, you never know, the people who watched part can not know what they ate for breakfast this morning, so hey, let's remind them ... hey, maybe to remind them even twice? Just to make sure that they will not forget ... at least until the credits roll, of course !!!! <br /> <br /> So forget about the history of the development of the character, the real emotions of the "action" (and no, I do not think that women in skirts to walk and / or struggle is responsible for the action!). .. what does that leave? Yes action scenes. Scenes are not bad, and that's the reason I gave the film 2 stars and not 1! I give this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... Do you have better things to do / watch, believe me ...
