Hmm ... Well, I think I get all shaky-camera, gorilla-style filming technique, but, unfortunately, I think the gorillas could have done better movie ... This thing was just a mess from the get go. Bad action, bad management, bad history and terrible cinematography. As this piece of trash was released, I'll never know, but it has also, unfortunately, I watched it. Filmed on location in the state of Tennessee in the director's team Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry Lloyd), «Five Across The Eyes» I believe that there should be similar to the type of the film "The Blair Witch Project," but falls short ... Well it nose dive off a cliff. I was actually embarrassed by the young woman, whom I'm sure have promised Hollywood stardom, but end up in this pile of manure. The dialogue is ridiculous, but actually aggravates you as you listen to it. How it should be a horror film is another mystery, because there is nothing even remotely scary about it, except that I was watching this ... Try this on for size: There are 5 of you and one of it, do the math and beat her ass ... «The End». Saddly he went on (and) for more than 95 minutes of mind-numbing nonsense ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free, and wanted my money back.
