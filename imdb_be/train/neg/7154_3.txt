This film has all the signs of too many cooks spoil the corner. Based on the autobiography Shielah Graham seems to have powers that could not be left alone. They could not decide if it was to be a story, or the story of Graham Fitzgerald, as well as how much they need to mitigate whoever's story it was. Thus, the film, which could be the story of two fascinating (the Fitzgerald) and famous (Ms. Graham) individuals becomes unintelligible dreary soap opera that tells us little about anything. In addition to this there is absolutely no time not to feel differently than for 1959. awkward scenes worth awkward stage, and we have no idea where we are in history or how long it takes. However - and it saved the film for me - Kerr never looked prettier, and Peck, as always, a very handsome man. They really do a nice, older couple, and I just want them to be the best material for the job. There is one scene does the job - Scott goes after Shielah while intoxicated, and to see that these two stars is usually refined knocking each other around a very disturbing and give a fleeting picture of what is happening in the relationship, such as theirs. In addition, a film of missed opportunities and does not reach far from the classic growth in other Wald soap production in 1950 (Peyton Place, the best).
