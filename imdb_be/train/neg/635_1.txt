Luise Rainer won an Oscar for his role in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, its role requires no. She said nothing and pale throughout the film. Luise character was a slave, that given the nature of married Paul Mooney (he did a fantastic job for its implementation). Located in the ancient Asia, both actors were Asians, but they were very convincing in their roles. I hope Paul Muni won an Oscar for his work, because it is something that Louise must have got her Oscar. She had to break the actress, one of the first steps in the method. It seems that Hollywood often does. Al Pacino has played Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise performance to be lackluster everywhere, and when she died, she did not change in terms of all the previous scenes. It has remained the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion, can be doubled. If her brilliant acting was so thin, I guess I have not seen him.
