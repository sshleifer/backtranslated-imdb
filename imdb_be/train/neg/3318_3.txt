How well Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right film for her ... too bad that it is completely out of the role. I have not read a book by Jane Austen, but I can not believe it's so superficial, and the characters are not much more than caricatures. It was not likely that the easy to cut a 2-hour show about 600 pages of the book, but I expected more than just see the old pieces of furniture and tea cups. I took a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who does not overstep the writing replays (a couple times).
