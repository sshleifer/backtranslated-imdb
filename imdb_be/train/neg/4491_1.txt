1/10, and only because I do not go below a valuation. <br /> <br /> skip this "film" and wait for the latest film from the "Trilogy", do not buy or rent it. trust me, you will not miss a thing. The architect does not bring any new information: _ (spoiler) _ was more Neo in front of him, he seems nr.6 or something. You might understand something like that from the first film: Agent Smith tells us the first matrix created does not work, because it was too full. Trinity died, and "love" Neo brought her back to where I've seen this before? Oh right role in the first film, where the opposite! the same as the action scene is nothing new with only a few opponents. The action scene (on 20+ ships) in the great battle that we have not seen (perhaps in the revolution?), Betrayed by someone (hmm, maybe the guy holding a knife who wanted to strike Neo?!), Who pushed the EGM button soon. <br /> <br /> All in all a shameless ploy to earn money (especially from the guys who went to see it more than once), which obviously worked like a charm.
