Another Die Hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains ?? How much more this god awful cheap (and bad) did rip off of the most popular fighters in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the there is still lurking out there? For the record (not that you care actually) is another one glaring rip nut combination, Under Siege 2 and Speed ​​with a complete set of clichés and predictability. <br /> <br /> non-descript villains usual choice of cardboard cut out a gun toting thugs who are sent by various means of promotion of the film, the hero, of course, an ex-cop or something that has a family and the attitude of the problem and, Of course, he brings with him to the party not only the usual emotional baggage, but also a corresponding piece of eye candy and his irritating son. <br /> <br /> alleged luxury cruise liner that runs between Florida and Mexico carefully described as a cross between the liner and the pair ?? it is somehow to explain how they seem, larking around on the ferry rusty cross channel ?? in New Zealand! Act as wooden as a deck, slide ,, the script that ships predictable villains completely inappropriate and the plot has holes in it, you can sail a boat through. <br /> <br /> It does not seem to be never ending tide of this kind of tearing directly into the garbage polluting the video late night TV and DVD slots deal Larry supermarkets everywhere (although this film is so bad that still see the DVD release yet, but give it time!) is there a chance of at least half decently done, half true, and most importantly original?!? No, I thought, the sun ?? ..
