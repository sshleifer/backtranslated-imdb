The only connection, this film is a horror that is terribly unentertaining. I would like to prick your finger with a rusty nail, than have to sit through it again. Even for the TV movie it is flat. Throw sad. The scenario is as exciting as a bowl of sand. As the two directors conspired to create such a personal film will be one of the biggest mysteries of the 20th century. There is only one scene even remotely worthy of inclusion in the Omen franchise, and he is shooting in slow motion and broke the expected return on investment. If you tend to see it, pop it, set the alarm for 90 minutes and get comfortable. If you're lucky, you'll doze off quickly, and the alarm will wake you up once the worst is over. Namely, this film.
