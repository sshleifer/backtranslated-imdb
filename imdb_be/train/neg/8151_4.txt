Leslie Sands unnatural game "Dead End" becomes a bad choice of vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, immediately after their joint success in "All About Eve". After the murder of her husband, treacherous woman visited by the best friend of her husband, who passes herself for her husband, as soon as others start to come into the house. Irving Rapper, one of the best directors Betty from its peak years, is unfortunately not able to pick up this ridiculous stuff that Davis curious aside and reserved to defiantly finals (where she, fortunately, pulls out all the stops). Production and support cast strictly second-speed; only Bette Davis Completists. * 1/2 ****
