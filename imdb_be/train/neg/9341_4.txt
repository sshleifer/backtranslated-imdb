This Hal Roach comedy short, harsh winter, it's ninety-nine in the "/ Our Gang Little Rascals» series and eleven radio stations. Bascally showcase for black comic Stepin Fetchit that gets special billing here, we see that he was going to his hut, where the gang hangs. Farina received a love letter from the post office for him and said Stepin to read it, because he can not read it during the day, when he goes to night school. It happens to his beloved in Tennessee, so now Farina must have their ears stuffed with cotton, as it is too hot for him to hear! In another room, Weezer translates instructions Mary Ann making toffee with radio, but because he continues to work back and forth to the kitchen, he misses SEGUE lady announcer to rice pudding and Spanish Tamale confusing Mary Ann with the addition of Tabasco and Lux!

Since all they are trying to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement of the various pipes and electrical outlets that mixes features variable Appliances' a phone that vacuum, a vacuum that rings and fridge, which plays music! End. What I have just described portends tortuous nature of the "Our Gang» short, who served as a pilot for a potential Stepin Fetchit short film series. It's good that he never took place, as a characteristic in Fetchit lazy nigger was funny only in small doses and is considered very offensive today. Many of the scenes I have just described is good for some laughs, the final sequence was so intricate that the results were just too blah for me. Thus, in general, hard winter curiosity worth seeing at least once. By the way, whose real name was Lincoln Theodore Stepina Perry.
