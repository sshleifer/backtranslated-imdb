For this review, a list of good points and bad points.I'll start with the bad <br /> <br /> Cons :. The choice of casting (especially Burt Reynolds, like Boss Hogg), acting from these poorly chosen to discard, the plot, the idea of ​​making a film in a modern day, direction, editing, soundtrack, and, above all, the idea of ​​creating a movie from the TV series, which was not that great to begin with, in spite of the popularity of this <br /> <br /> Good points :. Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ is it <br /> <br /> You can do it! here.In analogy scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke strut their way to Michael Weston as Enos, and asks the question, "Enos, where Boss Hogg and Roscoe?" in his misty Court, telling her where they are. she could just ask, "Enos, this is a good movie?", a red bikini have clouded his assessment, saying that, even if his mind, he would have said. "no, not really," As well as it looked in a bikini, it can was completely naked, and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film making.Stay of Hazzard!
