It was a terrible movie. Basically Jane March was half Korean North Korean spy Kim Jong Il sent to do something terrible to US troops in South Korea. She becomes a servant to US military families, they see it as a Korean, even if it looks more white (I think that the actress, or 1/4 or 1/8 of the South-East Asia, but not all Korean), and teenage boys of the household begins to hate her, and ends up sleeping with her. Way of Korea and the US military in Korea shows a completely insane. Of course, the writer and director is clearly the white people, who have never spent a day in Korea for this film and had no intention of showing any real understanding of life in Korea or the Korean or American soldiers, but simply trying to fulfill their pathetic Asiaphile fantasies without any due to the fact it is very unlikely that made the film. Anyone who has ever been in Korea will know that it is full of garbage. At the end of the North Korean spy honhyol girl dies in apparent "pay for their sins" way. Very bad film with a made-for-TV feel to it.
