I'm so happy and surprised that so much interest in this film! Jack Frost was my introduction to the tapes produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception, all of this company is engaged in pure crap! First, and very importantly, never ever watch this movie sober! Why would you? Unlike many other entertaingly bad films, this is one I feel bad it was done intentionally. I just can not get over how to forge a snowman, so it is always displayed for a short time, as it moves better! This film Waaaaaaaaaaay better than Michael Keaton piece of shit that was made becuz also be a good movie, and this version is as bad as it is.
