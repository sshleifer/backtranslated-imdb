Hearing about the prophetic masterpiece by George Orwell in my life, now I'm 37, but I never read the book, I'm confused as to what I had just seen. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as I'm sure most of them, but only through rumors and quotes. Without this limited knowledge, this film would not have been a complete mystery, and even with him, I still do not better educated about the history of 1984 than I was before I watched it. <br /> <br /> On the side. .. <br /> <br /> cinema strange, Hurt & Burton provides excellent performance and overall feel of the film's surprisingly dark and deserted. Prostitute scene was fantastic the dark part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Currently, reducing side, and there are many ... <br /> <br /> There is a war going on, (at least in as far as promotion is concerned), but why and to whom? Nothing is explained. There are several names bandied (Eurasia, etc.), but they mean nothing without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what he does? where he came from? where he works? why he is changing stories? why he was not on the front line? Why he does not eat the food in the dining room? What is a drink he drinks throughout the film? Why is he so weak and sick? Why had not he been brainwashed, just like everyone else? What's the matter with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little backstory would not be good, do not rub, it is important for those who, like me, who have not read the book. Without him, it's just confusing and hard to follow the art-house cinema, which always keeps you guessing what is really going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was dis articulated and poorly edited and constant chatter from the screens Big Brother striking dialogue in those places, which makes it even more difficult to work out what was going on. I understand that it may have been an artistic choice, but it is very annoying all the same. <br /> <br /> Also, I know that this has been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? It just seemed completely gratuitous and felt like it was thrown back to compensate for the absence of any section of the illumination. <br /> <br /> I personally can not stand the way Hollywood feels the need to explain the plot lines word for word these days. We are not all brainwashed simpletons, but it's a few steps too far the other way. I can only assume that it depends entirely on what you've read the book, because when this movie really is a "literal translation" I've seen a lot of people say, I would be very difficult to understand why 1984 has been proclaimed as it is a classic. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that it was light years ahead of it's time and largely predicted changes in our society today (maybe it was a kind of bible for the powers that be?), but many science-fiction novelists have done the same, leaving gaping holes in the storyline. <br /> <br /> I think I have to do what I had to do from the very beginning and to buy a copy of the book when I was to make any sense of it. <br /> <br /> In general, very disappointed in what I expect for many years to watch.
