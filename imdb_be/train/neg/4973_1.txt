I stopped for five minutes when, after Beowulf received a double blow, automatic crossbow with sights on it. Not only that, crossbows has a telescopic sight-seeing, but Beowulf Grendel hit in melee. Scary, wooden steps and eternal darkness that plagues all Sci-Fi original film did not help. I am having only got a few minutes before I felt my bile rise and decided to see I Love Lucy restarts instead, that really is all I have to say. But you can also just see that it's made for television and cinema to miss it right there. <br /> <br /> parody.
