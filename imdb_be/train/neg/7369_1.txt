I had a feeling that after the "Immersion", there would be better ... I was right. He must seek champagne money and not have to worry about the final product ... his voice gets repeatedly duplicated on a stranger who does not sound anything like him; Editing - good - just a class above the amateur. This is nothing more than a B or C-grade film with a sufficient amount of money to hire a couple of talented cameramen and «OK» sound designer. <br /> <br /> Like the previous poster said that the problems seem to appear in the post -Production (... voice dubbing, etc.) Too bad, cause the story is really good for SG Flick. <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG Flick, if he did not e-mails asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> It's too bad - I miss Lebrki ... <br /> <br /> --jimbo
