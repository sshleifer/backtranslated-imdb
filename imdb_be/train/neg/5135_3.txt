I think the stuffed are terrible, so it is a pity that this film does not make them any more. <br /> <br /> pile robbers make forced to parachute out of a plane in a huge field with scarecrows. One of them goes missing from production and therefore the rest to chase him down, at the same time throw themselves inexplicably angry scarecrows. Act unnatural and stuffed unimpressive (if they move). On the positive side, the director makes to get the suspension of static scarecrows. That being said Alfred Hitchcock, "The bomb under the table out, and it's amazing. We know that the bomb is under the table, but not when it will go away, and it is the unknown. "
