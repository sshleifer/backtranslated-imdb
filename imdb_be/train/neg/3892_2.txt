You want to watch a scary movie horror? Then stay away from it. There is not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough tape. Single malt, if you can manage it. <br /> <br /> If the previous comments were not enough to keep you from watching this film is sober, let me help. NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space orbit around Saturn. Really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West nosebleed. Things go downhill from there, and wackiness worth. <br /> <br /> I actually read the adaptation of the book, which was published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the film, and the book was terrible. At least some pretense is made in the direction of the unknown, and an explanation of events is drawn from the author's (rhymes with "gas"). <br /> <br /> Not to say that the film is completely unfounded. Rick Baker learned that he really should read the contract before signing the film, Jonathan Demme found that it is actually better suited to direct. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an episode of MST3K with this film, but it is, of course, edited quite a bit. Without necessarily flashing breasts, not even healing power of adhesive tape can save you. <br /> <br /> Please, just go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark, if you want to see a guy melts. Watch Space Cowboys, if you feel the need to see the astronauts. I can not in good conscience recommend this film to a sober film publicity.
