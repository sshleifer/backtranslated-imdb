Just finished watching American Pie Presents: Beta House, and I must say, it was such a garbage pile of crap. The first 3 American Pie were funny, the last 3 were a joke and should not have called American Pie. <br /> <br /> As you can understand from the title of the film, Beta House, about brotherhood, freshman, girls, and the most original of them all fall in love. Of course, a guy who has his way with chicks Stifler, who, along with his friends, trying to run another, seemingly impossible task. It was unreal and super fake. It's just very predictable and the story is so weak. Both sides of the college battle to see who gets it all (something like that) To summarize: Terrible acting + dull script + misuse of American Pie franchise = total waste of time! This film is unbearable. I give it two out of ten, although most of them were sucked in a lot of nudity and pretty girls like 2 funny scenes :)
