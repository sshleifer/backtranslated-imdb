Some wonder why there was not more than Mrs. Murphy movie afterwards. Whether it's because this film is completely blew snot. Disney they do not have the right studio to start this movie. POSSIBLE Touchstone (well, they belong to Disney, but it would be more mature). The film is also a child-ish, because there is no book in the series. Casting all wrong for the characters. Symbols do not act the way they do in the books. And why Tucker changed with a guy? He nasty girl in the books! Was it done to make the film appeal boys? Sheesh. And where PEWTER, gray cat? One of the funniest characters of the book is missing from this contamination. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but will allow Disney to undermine her work is not so. Animated film, perhaps the scapula artwork Don Bluth would suit better than Mrs. Murphy movie. Overall, I give it a 2 because, at least Disney made a film from a series of books under underestimated. But I want them to do better. In any case, I still have my books to entertain me.
