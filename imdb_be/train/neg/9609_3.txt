I started watching this movie, waiting for some sort of barely tolerable Hammer horror film imitators ... and I was not far away. There's a fair amount of flashes of gore, and they threw in a lot of nudity, but the second half of the film is somewhat ironic twist. Holy cow, they actually put some thought into the story, and not completely fall into the predictable thing one expected at the beginning. And I dare say some of the "gratuitous" nudity they were not so free after all, because it fits into the story and setting. <br /> <br /> Or do not get me wrong, it's still generally poor film, but as bad movies go, this shadow smarter than a really terrible scar as Mesa missing women and Robot Monster.
