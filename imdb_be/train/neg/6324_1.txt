I spent eight years of cinema in the 80s and 90s. It was by far the worst film I ever revealed to the public. The only thing that made it so bad that he was trying to put on airs to be a great, inspirational film. Even great Gregory Peck could not save this terrible piece of nonsense on much less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis, in an early role, not a horror movie, made it clear that she still has not learned to act (she is still trying, but it does not get much better). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, and that's a spoiler, the international nuclear disarmament will never happen because that makes children afraid to play little league baseball! Even the show on Nick and The Disney Channel is not so foolish as to try to make us believe that dreck. <br /> <br /> It's not worth the time you would spend it watching on cable television. Not worth the price of a movie rental; Your dollar is better spent on an additional package of popcorn to go with another film you have chosen (because it can only be better than that).
