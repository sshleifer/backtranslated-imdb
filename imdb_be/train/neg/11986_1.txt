What awful writing and acting. No personality. What, you can not make a good movie one character? Hmm, this was done in Castaway dialogue with yourself. <br /> <br /> So the child goes on a journey to see his father. Small, Jason takes the plane and the pilot has a heart attack and died in mid-flight. Thus, the child falls into the lake and survives. Then he runs, will survive in the desert, until he gets saved. <br /> <br /> At this time he is fighting the bear twice. The first time, when he fights him in the lake. The second time, when he makes the spear out of the branch and bear copies. Two shots of the fake blood spurting from his chest bear reminded me of the Monty Python "The Holy GrailÂ». <br /> <br /> In addition, the child decides to push a porcupine with predictable results. <br /> <br /> Gag.
