Since this picture belongs to the "pure entertainment" category of work and already has a lot of comments on it, I would like to present to address those related to the abuse of humor. We can see that the Wayans plays the role of the Joker in the film. Of course, by that time, he has been involved in the casting operation, it always acts as a small man-actor can change his usual dress, but is unlikely to change its appearance, and the second one can be an advantage, if it is necessary. However it is far from what I expected, I saw the image of a very disguise, pretending to expose the various aspects of life of a child by mistake in the forty-year-old offender. And funny happy ending. So what's the point? Many elements are mixed up, some of the main ones are the violence, sex and crime, including the history of poorly formed and to what extent, the lack of common sense: where Vanessa when prejudicial to the peace of their home and the life of her husband's pursuing? In addition, the diamond even more than the world's number 1 Cullinan! But the most disgusting face is a continuous effort to make up for the little man as the superman, showing his physical defects. And they call it humor. Diamond is valuable, hard and brittle; it can not be cut by any other pictures, but only be won hot goat blood. Thus, it is not a diamond, but pieces of debris.
