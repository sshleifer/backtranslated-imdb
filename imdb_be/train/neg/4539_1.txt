I've never seen anything as horrible as this film for quite some time. The film was boring, long, long and terrible story. Special Effects sucks like hell - it's like watching a movie in 1999. It is a waste of an hour and a half of my time. Matthew performance lodge was very bad. I saw it in the group of brothers to play Lt.Speirs, it was not so bad. In fact, it is not bad. But in this film, his acting was not convincing enough, it was very bad, and there was no chemistry between the rest of the crew either. In addition, his eyes seem empty as he does not feel it. This surprised me, really, because he was good at Brothers Orchestra. <br /> <br /> In any case, do not even bother to watch this film. This is a big, big waste of time. Even if you were to kill an hour or two, to get something to do other than watching this film. Trust me, you'll regret it!
