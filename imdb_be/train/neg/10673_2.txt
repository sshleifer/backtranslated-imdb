This film was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot was silly, all the way through. It reminded me very much of something is released for home video market in the 1980s. I'd give him one, but there were brief moments when you could see the actor really straining to make it worthwhile. I think that the worst thing that has been under water scene restrained dock. Underwater lighting, did not seem to come from it was not, and every time someone we had to worry about was close to exhausting the air, is the air tank is a kind of are. I would avoid it if there is nothing else on the shelf. Hello
