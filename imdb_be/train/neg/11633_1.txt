If I could I would give ZERO stars for this but, unfortunately, I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There's one scene I could laugh ... but the game does not make me laugh, too. So, if you are some sick people are slow, go to the local cinema to watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people here have already done. <br /> <br /> But for me ... in the film, where children are shot in order to achieve good taste of humor ... beyond the edge ... it was the third time I've wasted my time to watch a movie and it definitely Capsule my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I'm embarrassed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE Please keep it with the works of a great movie !!!!!
