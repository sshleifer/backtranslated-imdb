How can it be that many corrupt cops without one of them slips up? With enough police to launch a mini-war that includes weapons such as flamethrowers, you think they would be caught before someone writes for the weekly newspaper coupon overheard someone say "thank you" to the corrupt cop. <br /> <br /> You will never get your 90ish minutes ago. Life is too precious to make this film. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the big named actors who made the mistake of making this film. <br /> <br /> If you like Justin Timberlake, do not hesitate to make this film. He has a very important role in this, so that the fans could enjoy seeing it. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the majority of its supporters are young girls who may be excluded from the violence in this film.
