All I can say is that I am glad that I was knitting socks while watching a movie, I would be very angry at the waste of 2:00 of my life. Action was awful, the story was even worse. There were some scenes that were supposed to be serious, that my husband and I laughed out loud. I highly recommend this movie for people who want to make their own version of MST3K.
