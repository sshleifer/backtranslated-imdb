"What do we know we know?" Was one of the worst times I spent in the cinema. It was less a movie and more after-school special, but at the same time, nothing special at all. The attempt of the story in which they grounded their ideas completely helpless, almost everyone will tell you. Marlee Matlin in her underwear just should not have happened. I will not dwell on this. What I will reveal a criticism that many of them are not able to articulate. This film, while tedious, also suffered a huge flaw in the argument. It was terribly inconsistent, because he took such manipulative, to become the creator of your life, a manifestation of wealth, barefoot part of propaganda. Interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence. However, the film urges that we control our environment with our minds. It completely ignores that there are other people with minds that can be controlling us, which seems to be more true. Or at least a structure in which we are very limited, there are of us. Thus, the film was inappropriate solipsistic. Solipsism and interrelatedness just do not mix, if you are not God Almighty. If you do, you will be surprised (?!?) All the neat things that this film will show what you can do. If not, then you will be very disappointed, moron, or perhaps both. In addition, the name is so funny, I have a problem warning people not to see the movie because I feel retarded mentioning him by name. Shame on all involved.
