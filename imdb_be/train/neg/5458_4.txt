This film is a pathetic attempt, apparently, to justify the actions of Mary Anne Letourneau. To do this, they threw the 19-year-old Well, probably not "to do it." There was no way they could throw 12 or 13-year-old, as a boy, because love scenes would have collected all of the (if they are even allowed to do them) - as they should. Mary Ann's boyfriend was the age of my nephew, making it a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. Definition of a pedophile does not include the many children - all you need is one <br /> <br /> I do not really care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage .. She was responsible to his disciples that it is not live a. The reason is that she is bipolar, has rejected the diagnosis, and refused to take his medication. It is clear, then, that she does not think rationally. It is hoped that now she understands their actions. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Willie married and have two children together, I pray that she is on her medication and think clearly. <br /> <br /> All that aside, Penelope Ann Miller was absolutely convincing and perfect casting for the role.
