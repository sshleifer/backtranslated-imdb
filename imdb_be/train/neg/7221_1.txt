.... The reason this is CRAP! Kind of movie that makes you want to go and flog filmmakers and say, "Why?". Terrible camera work ... to count the times the camera tries to remain stable for one person and can not. Funny dialogue. Acting funny. It seems that they have captured a ghost town in the west, to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible. I'd bet $ 10 they used a home video camera to do this. Either that, or most operators were drunk. Indeed trailers are more interesting than the movie. If you ever want to spend the "worst film" Party, to bring this. Want more fun ... look at the wall.
