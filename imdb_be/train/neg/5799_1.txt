yesterday I was shooting this film mainly because of the pretty art and summaries, indicated on the back of the jacket. Once it pops into my DVD-player, I reviewed a little jacket, and even when I took the lid from a plastic viewer, I still could not read any of the production details about the film. This film has the right to Evil Jacket and had to find it by going to the Faith Films website to find out any connection with him here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> filming and special affects made in the film looked pretty good ... then read the line actor said. Oh, dear ... reading this actor sounded like a pimple face middle school athlete whose voice is able to change the height, and without any attempt to go beyond the line of the reading frame of the scenario. At first I thought that I had a bad disc with audio sync, then had to assume that it is a foreign film, because I could not read his jacket ... English dialogue dubbed. If they cast the right people for the dubbing of dialogue, this film may have been decent. I gave him a chance for about 20 minutes before removing it when I found a bad reader line is not going to kill off, but remain as a permanent basic instrument. Yes, this is bad! Jacket Cover art and made into a film are great, so give one star, but the star of minus 1,999,999 for rotten dialogue. I do not recommend this!
