The actors did a very good job playing their roles - especially my mother. However, as the movie progressed, I found that I was watching him more of their actions and not because I cared in the slightest degree for people. And, sometimes, I feel angry irresponsible and hands-off approach to parenting displayed again and again. Daughter is 17-year-old small Skank, the main goal in life litter-known people dancing and getting nyphette (complete with a large number of "booty shaking"). Son guy with low self-esteem, it seems very desperate for relationships and friends - so many that he throws a party drug at the end of the film. The couple, both sad, but rather than put energy into their callous attitude would prefer to look for new partner (even though his wife is taking bad as the man she "throws" happens to be gay --- OOPS!). I just felt that all the characters needed for the growth and had a difficult time to care for such minor spurts. I think the author's attempt to demonstrate full banality and unreasonable capitalist system. However, given that these characters are not typical for the average western family seems insincere.
