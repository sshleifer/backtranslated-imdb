This film had the potential to be worthy of a horror movie. The main character was well done, and I felt sorry for him, and there was a decent amount of history. HOWEVER, everything else sucks. Director, Emmanuel, very incompetent in the film industry. It uses some of the most idiotic shots ever <br /> <br /> -. A couple of random sequences of random images scattered throughout the film. I do not know when he was trying to be profound and clever and poetic, but it was not. It was stupid. Random shots from the trailer main character lived in a random building a random panoramic images of buildings, random cat that goes. WTF? And the cloud. Many gloomy dark clouds <br /> <br /> -. He really loved this technique with cut scenes on various arrows, not to be only one continuous shot. EX: Guy is trying to ignite a grass and the camera circles around him. Instead of only one shot, he edits it into 10 different images, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and SMART! stupid. <br /> <br /> action awful, but that's what makes the film so funny. A scarecrow is a gymnast, because he flips and spins and rotate all the time. And some of the deaths could have been better. Do you expect that the main bully have a long built-up a good death, but nope. Simple maize in the ear. Love interest was hot. Sensual. That's why this movie gets 2.
