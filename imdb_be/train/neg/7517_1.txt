*** One of the ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if it was, it gets F. Holy Mother of God Mary was that bad. I mean, I gave him a reasonable accommodation, taking into account that it is a movie right, but let me at every step. Like many other films B, the main story was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the performance was funny. It's a shame, they give the good name of Halloween in this fiasco. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is surrounded by some of brotherhood bags DOUCHE hosting its annual Halloween haunted house fund raiser, when the satanic spell book comes out of nowhere and throws frat boys in hell. Well, that's the idea, anyway, but instead a large part of the film is dedicated to reflecting the relationship of this escapade Frat boy has a lot of outrageous lesbian scene. Very few actual stories devoted to Halloween and the mysterious book of spells. It really makes me mad that the filmmakers thought they could get away with the creation of the dig. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially about the relationship between fraternity boy. It's not that the film is billed as. I'm tempted to find manufacturers and at least threaten them with physical violence. Acting is about as bad as it gets, it's disgusting! Scenario unintentionally funny. Cinema just laziness. The entire film is amateur night. This film actually makes the production of Syfy channel movies look masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film felt the filmmakers realized that they did not produce a soap opera, and had to throw in a horror sequence. An evil spell book finally comes into play and makes everyone in a haunted house in the nature of their removal, like. I almost feel like crying as I write this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was a transcript of chopped disaster.
