After watching Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loved every second of it, I finally had the opportunity to see a continuation of life in transformation. I was really dissappointed as it is not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first. 90 minutes, people with baskets on their heads is not my idea of ​​a good movie. Cost of Philip Glass was not for that, no beauty, no correlation of forces first. Compared with the film Koyaanisqatsi seemed slow and pointless. Single version of Baraka, that the same idea, but to do better. I really hope that the third film in the series will not follow the example of these wastes.
