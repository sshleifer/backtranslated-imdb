Back in 1985 I caught this thing (I can not even call it a movie) on the cable. I was in college, and I was a high school friends whose hormones are raging out of control. I realized early on that it was hopeless. Silly scenario (a bunch of old guys hired a few young guys to show them how to kill women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. Abundant female nudity my friend kept happy here for a while - but even he was bored after 30 minutes Remember -. It was a schoolboy! This was even before the nudity was so easy to get on the Internet and the like. We continued to watch in the hope that something interesting or funny, but it never happened. The funny thing is that this was the original advertising campaign, in which the studio has recognized this film was shit! (On one of the posters was a fictional review that said, "This is the best film I've seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer amongst showed talent and actually went on to a career in business. No estimates and sad and so on. Skip it.
