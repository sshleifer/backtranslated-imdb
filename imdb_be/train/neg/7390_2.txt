How do you pronounce washed fat Italian who could barely pull martial arts move without the need for some heart medications? In this film we see Steven Seagal at its lowest level accomplishment-, since his career began its steady decline in miserable over indulgent behavior that scuttled his career. In this film he looks like a big part of its preparation was ordered fetuccini Alfred in its restaurant every day. <br /> <br /> It is a thick, slow and very old looking in this film, it is unlikely martial arts action hero .. more ridicule clown <br /> <br /> it's time for Steven Seagal to resign this film is about 2 hours reasons <br /> <br /> the plot: a fat Italian guy with a great reputation on the force got wind of that criminal group can play around with the drug, developed by the military to create the ultimate warrior reply. This is a sham, though helpless and ridiculous, provides an opportunity for some more of the best fight scenes, which include explosive through a wall, like a comic. <br /> <br /> I have already said that this film is totally sucks and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? Yes. I did.
