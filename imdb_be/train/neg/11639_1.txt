Spoilers: I'm always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews. It was awful. The script and voice alone destroyed it. Gabriel and Grace are the most unsympathetic characters in the game. You are almost praying for their death. And worst of all, that there are fewer vampires in this game than they were werewolves in The Beast Within. <br /> <br /> The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing. If you are expecting some Anne Rice style vampire stories, forget about it. History This game has very little to do with vampires. You will not even see any until about the end, and even then, you do not get to deal with them. <br /> <br /> The story takes a radical and largely blasphemous view of Christianity. I am surprised that came off the drawing board. I'm not even a Christian, and I found it offensive. Mainly, the story centers around a quest for the Holy Grail and treasures. Theft of the Royal child, who was to be the center of attention, actually gets pushed aside. There's no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the child. In fact, he was almost never asked anyone about the child after the first few blocks of time. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty bad. Characters move a snail's pace, even in the best systems. They are stocky and outdated. And it's hard to go from the FMV of the Beast In this terrible game engine for Blood Sacred. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace takes a terrible turn, too. I really do not know why it was so terribly rushed, but they sleep together. And it's no fun. Gabriel spends most of the game, telling his best friend Maz, as he thinks that Grace like a sister, and he did not think that it is for him. And he seems to be really dirty, that they slept together. But he was so unsympathetic throughout the game that you almost do not even care at that time. His dialogue was the worst in the game. And he kept making silly sexual innuendo to something feminine entire game. By the end of the game, Grace leaves him with what appears to be a letter Dear John. I believe that she was as bored as most of the players were. <br /> <br /> I found the story to be annoying and boring. I've been waiting to play the story of the royal baby, who was kidnapped by vampires. And I was expecting to get to see and fight the vampires, maybe even Gabriel and Grace will become one. But no. Instead, the story focuses on the warped view of Christian author. What a shame. There were elements of a great adventure, and instead we got it. <br /> <br /> For me the only interesting part of the game was in fact at the very end. We get a few puzzles action style in the end. But do not be suffering through the whole game to get to them. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this game. I got it back when it came out many years ago, and I hated the game engine so much that I put it for many years. I just recently dusted it to see what I was missing. And now, I'm sorry that I did. My favorite characters were destroyed. I hope that will be the fourth game of a series of repurchase. And I hope that they get it right the next time. It would be a terrible shame to end the series with this party.
