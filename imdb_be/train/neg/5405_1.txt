I got this as a film of turkey and I was not disappointed <br /> <br /> Acting. - in general, although many of them were in the other films, it is clear that they had to work, to act is bad so constantly over all this film because of the accident released some degree of action <br /> <br /> Land -. future generous I could say that the writer was initially start with the plot, but, but did his best to ignore it. story broke faster than the Chinese knock off the computer <br /> <br /> Scrip - now it was an abomination of nature. he does not run from any rhyme or reason. most of the characters lines were at best helpless imbecilic. script worked hard to make sure that none of the sign could not be obtained to hold memorable. I watched the other films where extras were more interesting and memorable <br /> <br /> Special effects -. ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were a short bus special <br /> <br /> Direction - until you can come up with its own director's ability to copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make failures, as <br /> <br /> It. nice to know that your friends / family gave you 10 stars for this film
