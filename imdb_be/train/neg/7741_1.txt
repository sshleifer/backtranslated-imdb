Josh Hartnett in the dead eyes, thick letters from him, and Harrison Ford being in a friendly cop comedy! Here are 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it, and to use his life 116 minutes is better. <br /> <br /> The friendly police movies fun. However, their real golden age was still in the 1980s and 1990s. Create one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of Hollywood, of course, a good idea, but the end result that was not at least a parody subgenre, but the reason to ask God to have mercy on all the latest movies of the same kind, while the worst of which was by all means more than (Hollywood Homicide). <br /> <br /> What is really wrong with this exciting formula ?! Since a decade was not the same thing. You would be hard-friendly action flop after another. I delight you with some names to catch the disaster well: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (taxi - 2004) (Starsky and Hutch - 2004) and the worst of them still (Miami Vice - 2006 )! <br /> <br /> I believe that one of the reasons why this is a natural phenomenon of saturation after numerous similar cinematographic films and television shows for the past 2 years. Add to this, in particular, here, sloppy dealing and goofy humor. In fact the case this time quite unbearable. Yes, we have a loyal nature of the 2 police, having a second job, and against the backdrop of the city of sin, but what else is new ?! It is not a cliché; we are talking about several extensions, mixed with clichés, where both were poorly made. <br /> <br /> action, especially with (Hartnett) 's side, it's terrible. This guy is nothing but a comedian (or actor). So his character wants to avenge the death of his father! Revenge of the people, he probably died from a view actor !!. Even small roles in people who have nothing to do with comedy (or is it the fact that they seemed to be here anyway!). <br /> <br /> direction fails to present something severe if the comic, some parts was very dim (mild black guy for lack ??); this is a rare time to be boring, there should be an action / comedy! They do not use myself as an ironic Hollywood Or a place where there is the ugly face of superficial charm, or even as a place that is full of shiny or fallen star (cameo, which could have given it a few interesting moments). <, Br /> <br /> This is a very easy film, which is transmitted at a time watchable only the glamor of its stars, and how will Buddy-cop film, ultimately, as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with the non-chemistry on the screen (one of them have chemistry from the screen! Guess who ?!), and Buddy-Cop destroyer more than the movie! God, do not make me, my children, live enough to watch (Hollywood Homicide ?? Part 2)! After all, look at Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted to have a good time, but at least we did.
