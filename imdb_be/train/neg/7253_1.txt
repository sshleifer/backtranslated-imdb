We rented a DVD hoping for a good western. The film was quite a scene and clever, but the ideas were very bad. Here's my problem with the film. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why it was a bad guy killed the owner of the mines? Nya really connected with the film, except to determine how bad it was and is the den. <br /> <br /> Bank employee deteriorated simply acts too bad to conclusively decided to hire killers from their employers. At the very least, to keep us guessing. A lot of character designed for the owners of all bank or a bank clerk. <br /> <br /> It is a long delay a lot going on. <br /> <br /> The absurdity of the premise that Martin still need to see a judge after the gang confessed to the murder in the laws. Even more absurd, he recognized judge and judge will listen to the sheriff guy. Even more ridiculous is that Martin and his Hung rope breaks, the sheriff takes him at gunpoint, to finally head back to the city and save his wife from the bad bank employee. Whether it will just come back after a quick dispatch of the gang to rescue his wife and the arrest of the bank's bad guy? Simply send the judge a note that the gang confessed before he died on the trail ???? !!! Overall, a very sad actions and there is no point in the film.
