No, <br /> <br /> Basically, your watch is that it makes no sense. In order not to spoil the movie for people who really want it to look at the film, I will explain the story. <br /> <br /> normal everyday women a day, walking down the street, you find it yourself driving her own car. She follows her and many of the events taking place at the time, which include her and her family. <br /> <br /> I specifically made the comment on this movie, how badly it was written. The action was great, the events were great, but the story just did not bring it anywhere - he could with added enormously and be turned into a global epidemic. I'm not sure what the author is trying to achieve by doing so, as a rule, at the end of films, most of your questions to get answers, but this film is you ask what happened, and 1 hour and 20 minutes just in vain. <, Br /> <br /> Spoiler Starts__ <br /> <br /> They had this area of ​​between 2 dimensions (ours and the glass), who come to our world and to kill us. It was not developed at all in the movie, and you never know how it happens and why it was or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the film. The protagonist should not even have been the protagonist. At the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all and run away (her sister's boyfriend) have been the main character, but unfortunately, the film ends after 20 seconds after. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, abandoned her immediately after .. do not waste your time. I really hope that nothing like this has been done again.
