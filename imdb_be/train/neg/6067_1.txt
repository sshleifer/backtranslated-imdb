Minor SPOILERS (but it does not matter anyway). <br /> <br /> Exercise in gobblygook catastrophic proportions not even worthy of l0 line I need to put these comments on netwaves. This is the only the worst episode of the Masters Series to date, and the first that has the right to a non-existent Mystery Science Theater treatment. Even when it took me a full half an hour to realize the intended ironic angle, he was still very lame mess. His only value lies in the future, that makes one realize that in addition to Gore and the ugly mask genre can be achieved only when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and action, editing and synchronization will be used. Here they are missing, and not the master John Carpenter. Period. And the banal analysis of lung social commentary here will not change. Ironically, Carpenter has never been anything more than a director of B, but, at least, of such films as "fog" and «The Thing» has a great atmosphere (the last one is one of my favorite cult). <br /> <br /> Abominable acting. The camera angles are stuck in cement. Rhythm without effort. However, perhaps the most embarrassing episodes element of the plot, which, of course, JC can not really be blamed for (if the authors were not buddies Cody.) Initially, two minutes of slow-mo woman running through the woods, only to be almost move to Scully, Mulder duet is the first and last thing that works in the film. But come on, girl, do not rush through the deserted forest to nowhere in particular, in dire need of an abortion of a single rendezvous with a pair of wing MDs «women's rights", whose clinic is just at the end of the road around the corner. Oh, and I'm not even going to cling on how to dock rinse accidentee in the car and drive speed to 0 to 60 in six seconds. There are wonders for possible broken ribs and a concussion. <br /> <br /> Then things fall apart very quickly. Idle Conversation "I just want to help you," that infinitely lingering back and forth through the gate, epic battle tactics as cutting telephone line (in the cell phone age?) From the shootout: a Born again Ramboesque director of the clinic against Ron Perlman and High school of the bullpen for a few bumps in the Easter break. Another great line: "So what are we going to do," From a child who had been sitting on a pile of machines in the back of the van?. Uh, no, that's not the pheasant season. So who is still in need of these young boys. How about good old method of accurately and lone madman who beats his way through the gate with his all-American SUV? <br /> <br /> Regarding exchange bullets themselves scenes, cuts there were rigid as a staccato DC comic strip. All that was missing were Wham, Bam, and the Whistle of balloons names. And all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old episode of Mannix. <br /> <br /> At some point, we know that the pope is not really dad, but at the moment we do not have led to the departure of a lot more either. The only source of this story is a drama about the conflict between the life of his father and his pregnant daughter, who is just grateful that it is not twins. However, there is not one scene flashback or not, where they actually never occur together. They are only abstractions of each other in everything. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the goalkeeper, each one of the characters is absolutely dislikeable. Bland, hysterical, slow-witted, macho. How completely flat, as a man can be wallpaper. None of the doctors do not give up, there is something about them medical. And there is that controversy dad who Reiki on his pregnant daughter, as if he himself had been a busy one. He, fortunately, got it. There are two big MST-worthy comic moments: when the fountain plumbing Angelica leaves and later the newborn baby lobster with glued on head. Also nice was a rugby ball Angelica stomach before she finally owls right to life little monster from hell. As for this saucy men's abortion scenes ... well, they kept Miike episode and banned this one instead. <br /> <br /> In short, the third baby Rosemary rate meets alien set on the lawn in M.A.S.H. episode. Only in this bitch, seen only today's generation permit children under the age of 16 years, will ensure as someone here said that this series would not be renewed for a third season. This is a shame as there was a whole series of brilliant performances, including those really decent parody of Dante "Homecoming" or the charmingly quirky "Sick Girl" Maki. Not to mention the beautiful imagery Malone «Fairhaired child." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Carpenter, I think your days are over rails. The pair run for the presidency.
