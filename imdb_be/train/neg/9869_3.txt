Do not care for the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where he was shot? *** This was my first visit to your site ... just found the answer to my question. so now I look like a dummy, but I think I still have to submit their comments. and let, British Columbia is a perfect *** Or why they took him out of the South Carolina coastal settings? (This question is) the place is important for a book of fabric and its change was part of my disappointment with the film. Oh, I just read where I have to write at least ten lines. Here is my second major problem with the film. Basinger was too sweet and not at all what I pictured in the book. I know that the book was a book, and the film; Well, not so good. I found a character in the book is much more circumspect. In addition, the book has a rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the "lock" in the film was much more visually impressive, this distorted sense of history, and seemed to be at odds with the characters.
