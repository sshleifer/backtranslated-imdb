I do not see how someone who even likes Van Damne may like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film actually begins with some promise. I would say that the scene early in the film perfectly. These actions are the scene of a family chamber, trying to save the twin is a great start and a good lead into the main story. Nevertheless, the film is all down hill from there. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. That is, the brothers were born in different parts of the world, and, therefore, to learn different skills. One brother has to be skilled in martial arts, and the second brother should be proficient in firearms. How convenient, when there is time, that his brother, who had never picked up a gun before all of a sudden is a great shooter, and a brother who was not taught any martial arts all of a sudden does the splits and high kicks. <, Br /> <br /> plot, action, etc., is simply ridiculous. What is your favorite scene? How about when Van Damne opposes armed soldiers with AK-forty-seventh The soldier is about 100 yards. Instead of aiming and shooting at the van Damne he does battle cry as he wielded an ax, and works for him. Van Damne goes to pick up a gun with the fallen soldier and shoots him ... while he was still about 75 to 80 yards. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is an accomplished martial artist. However, instead of choreography worthy of the struggle. Bolo throws barrels Van Damne like Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise. If your a fan of Van Damne, save your time and see Hard Target or one of his early films.
