Jerry spy Tom listens to a terrible story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare off his nemesis <br /> <br /> I have not found this particular episode that funny :. Humor seemed very limited and all the set-up was kind of lame (Jerry, in fact, the "bad guy" in that, hurts poor Tom for no particular reason). <br /> <br /> There are occasional flashes of inspiration (ie, the literal "heart in mouth" experience of Tom, and at that moment, when his nine lives sucked out of his body), but, in general, these efforts are not enough to go obsessed , excellent animation and wit currently most other cartoon T & J in.
