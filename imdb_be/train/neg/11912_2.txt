The story of this film is very interesting, and the whole story is not so bad ... but the details :. Who write, direction, continuity, going, action sequences, stunts and use all CG cheaper and spoil the film <br /> <br /> First, the sequence of actions. All of them are quite interesting. The majority consists of someone standing up and shot, making no attempt to flee, fight, Dodge, or something, even if they have all the time in the world. BLAND sequence just seem to do something in 2004. <br /> <br /> CG is characterized by a very nice rendering and animation effects, but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used. <br /> <br /> stimulation: it is too fast. For example, «Elle» fight trained for several hours, and from the beginning can be flipped back, etc. Why is it so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the film. Lilith, she would not have needed to be able to do a back flip - maybe she could not, because she had wings <br /> <br /> In addition, we have the sequence as a woman to get the car will move. As well as the receipt and just wander into a deserted room with a sink and mirror, and then stabbing himself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the viewers actually cared that she had just hit by a car (and then felt the secondary effects other things, the machine will explode) ... "are you okay?" asked the driver, "yes, I'm fine," she says, bloodied and disheveled. <br /> <br /> I've been watching all of this, though, because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end, poor performance made me want anything else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even this movie with vampires, where Jackie Chan was comical, because they were able to suspend my disbelief, but it just made me shake director wakes up, and give a good talk with the writer.
