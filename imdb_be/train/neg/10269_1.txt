this film is provocative. for outrageous, I mean terrible. I had more fun watching paint dry at my local hardware store for August day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke. actor got worse and worse, as "cinema", which suggested that the use and euphoric drug of Directors became apparent as we approach the final scenes. When the mist was shot, she decided that it would be appropriate to blink after mordem. it was not sensible. in truth, Stevie Wonder could have caught that with my eyes closed. If you choose between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watch this movie, keep in mind that nail guns, will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
