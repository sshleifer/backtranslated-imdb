Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes, and ... well, yes, that's all for this film. <br /> <br /> there is no real plot, NO storyline. Many charming characters, well, "character" is not correct given that you do not have a clue, anyone really. I mean, they are being chased by some strange looking "things" in the collectors (who is the matter? Why is it there?) it is very scary, I guess, but I really do not care? no, I do not know. Why did not I? Because I have not the slightest idea who these people are, and I do not know if I want them to live or die. This is one-dimensional and relies on the Mount, and sound effects to scare you, it rarely does. <br /> <br /> In etym film lacks any meaning, any purpose. It seems that I fell asleep and missed 45mins from accumulating. He jumps right into the action. In fact, some women and her friends are trapped in a London subway, get chased strange creatures they eventually leave him. <br /> <br /> Creep has its moments that make you jump, art good, location is excellent and the sound is OK, but this is not what makes a decent horror film, so that, unfortunately, all that goes to waste. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new. Another predictable modern "horror", where Kate (the leading character "") consistently makes silly, "Hey, I know you a lot of sitting at home thinking that I should do the smart thing in this situation, but, ohh no! I'm going to do the exact opposite, because I'm dumb blonde "thing. I wish they would not do it, it's done so many times, it becomes a sad and predictable. In fact, I am very annoyed a fool not got a knife in the uh, gray alien looking creatures. <br /> <br /> Â«Your journey ends here" is the tag line of films. Well, Creeps journey ends only a short time in the film. If you've had a few beers, we got a couple of friends back to your own, of course, watching it all means. But if you want something original and reasonable, avoid.
