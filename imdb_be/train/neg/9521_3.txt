This movie gets a lot of play lately during the day at any HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they assume people will be interested in comparing it with Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks caper of the same name. The only reason to see what kind of an attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I must say, Matt was more than a little long in the tooth to play a high school student. If he were a woman, they would have him playing a high school student's mother! (Is it just me, or his daughter, begins to look like Shelley Duvall?) Ah yes, the plot - who cares? Typical teenager adults play highjinx.
