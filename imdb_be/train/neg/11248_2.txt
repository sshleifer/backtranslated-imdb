A gave a "2" instead of "1" (terrible), because there is no doubt that many of the visuals were stunning, a lot of talent went into the special effects and art work. But it was not enough to save him. <br /> <br /> «sepia» toned, washed out colors kind of things were done many times before in other films. Nothing new. I can see that there are some caps tips for other old classic movies. GOOD. No problem with that. <br /> <br /> But the film should not be exciting and interesting, but not what you would sleep. <br /> <br /> storyline and script of the film was awful, two-dimensional characters. Slow moving. Some scenes were pretty to watch, but, ultimately, overall, it was pretty sad, I can not recommend it.
