If you see a friend, a letter will feel very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 friends season is often the same settings comedy. <br /> <br /> The show about a group of people whose connection is the fact that they share the same class, when they were still quite young (about 10 years, I think). They are now in their mid-twenties, and they meet again at the reunion. Here begins the series. <br /> <br /> typical episode deals with several subjects at once. They usually are not related in any way. Each storyline is cut into several sections, which are then set out in a mixed manner. <br /> <br /> outline where my problems lie in this series. As in more recent times, friends, often pretty stupid system with hard to believe the situation. One of the main characters is doing something really stupid, it's hard to believe. The situation then is greatly exaggerated, as if that were not enough silly. If you are in this kind of in-your-face humor, then maybe you will like this series. For me it's a big turn-off. <br /> <br /> So I started to look at each of the first few seasons. There are interesting and especially robust storylines, with some romance in it, that makes you root for the characters. Class does not have any of that. Symbols are just too forced and stereotypes go too far. It, therefore, does not allow to treat them and how they are. <br /> <br /> At least with your friends, it took a few seasons before he ran out of gas and character traits were milked. But in the classroom, she seems to fizzle out before it even started.
