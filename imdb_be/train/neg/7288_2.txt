WARNING FOR ALL Directors: Long is not necessarily good. This film is an incredibly long time. However, not good. The scenes were taken out way, way, way, way, way too long. The sex scenes were not necessary, and often too long. The film is edited to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would be exclusive, but, unfortunately, it has become so boring for a long time, I can only give it a 2 out of 10. This is below the average. <br /> <br /> Some of the other problems exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays a complete family tree. The guy who played the grandfather looks nothing like him, but his grandfather, father and son (who gives us constant unnecessary voice-over) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull with a face head. No one seems to have noticed that each of the children looks like a clone of the latter, even if their pictures are captured at each step. This is one small but if the film has not been 3 weeks long would not be so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany was not even whispered for the longest time on the Jews rounded and sent funny. Some of the words have got to them and the idea of ​​trying to escape, perhaps, have been discussed. Uncle in France, of course, sent a warning to try to get them to leave. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this film is completely wrong. You spend forever telling us this thing, and the development of relations between the main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people love each other, and almost instantly ... married. Then have children. Then we draw things for ages 6 and forget about the development of relations. This again is not so much stuck in the 2:00 movie, but with time spent nothing was given to us. <br /> <br /> 4) The ending is just bad. I do not want to spoil it for everyone, but it's not like it either ... if you do not sadistic. <br /> <br /> The director / author shall be subjected to torture in order to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis, I mean an infinite loop, they are one and the same ups. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford has done nothing for this film, I mean, I think that Istvan Szabo to be modeling his directing career after. Long stretched film that completely destroys any substance in the film. A brief description of "The Horse Whisperer," and the sun. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, a perfect title. When you start watching while the sun shines it is quite possible, and after dark when you leave.
