What made the original Killer Tomatoes fun had it been made by people with a budget that was just silly for a few days ... <br /> <br /> It was something with the budget, but it just was not as much fun. John Astin from the Adams Family fame actually makes an effort here to be comical, but it is supported by the lame actors, special effects and cheap unfunny gags. <br /> <br /> The plot. Dr. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides that he's going to put the pretenders to the throne of France ... The hero, his French girlfriend and Gizmo-like Â«Fuzzy Tomato" decides that they are going to stop it ... <br /> <br /> forget the live video is nonsense ...
