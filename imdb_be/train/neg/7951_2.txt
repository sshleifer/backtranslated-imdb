I gave "Kohi Jiko» low score, not because it was a bad movie, but because nothing should be done to praise. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the work Hou Hsiao Hsien before, but for the uninitiated (including me), "Koch Jiko» advertised as a tribute to Ozu. (Japanese film director, whose last film was way, way in 1962) The film is very rare work ... which contains very little dialogue, story, music and emotion. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays "Yoko" and unemployed, wandering character, who spends his time at her local coffee shop or free investigates Taiwanese composer she loves. Tadanobu Asano plays his friend, who works at the store CD and sometimes indulge his otaku interest in trains. And that's all he is. <br /> <br /> We have seen, as soon as Yoko drinking coffee ... walks ... waiting for the train ... ... catches the train to sleep on the train. Kind of a secular reality, no one in Japan can be seen on a daily basis. Hou captures these ordinary moments of life of these characters, but without any sense in these vignettes is completely pointless movie to do or see.
