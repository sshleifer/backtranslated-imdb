I was very impressed with Cinderella 2, and The Jungle Book 2, but it may be worse than both names. First of all, I do not like animation, very Saturday-morning-cartoon, only worse, in some scenes. I liked some of the characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters like Cruella were mediocre. Cruella was really criminal in the original, but it has lost the quality in the future. What she said was not anything to write home about, and it was kind of ugly animations. As its companion of the artist Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to quit for the night. Speech talents were very good, especially at Bostwick as the Thunderbolt, except Jodi Benson, the emphasis ruined it for me. There were good moments, but the whole story seemed overblown to me, and very suggestive of an extended TV episode. Overall, an extremely disappointing sequel of the most memorable 60s Disney movies along with the Jungle Book. Unfortunately, I can only give it 3/10, it's just not my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
