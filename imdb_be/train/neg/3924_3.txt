Really scary, pretentious, an endless film. Director Bellocchio, it seems seized with a beautiful face and figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he would have focused a little bit more to make a good, engaging film. I hate it when a film is like sex, "a feature film," just to become a more "respectable". Frequent, sometimes hot sex scenes are the only reason for the existence of this film. Regardless of whether or not they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste. (*)
