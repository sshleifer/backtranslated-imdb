Thank you for the murder of a franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks so many levels it's pathetic. VAMPIRES first it was fun, but it's a low-budget new tire makes me yawn. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (pauper Kevin Bacon) drives around Mexico with a surfboard body hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala Antonio Banderas guitar case in Desperado. He picks up some lame "Hunter" along the way (including the annoying feminist infected girl who takes pills to turn into a vampire), and they went to stop any female master vampire who does not come entirely pre-history, and so we could care less about her or find her (walk in the sunlight, stealing Black Cross and perform the ritual to allow her to do so). If you have seen the first vampire you've seen it, and did much better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter was responsible for many bad movies lately. Frankly, I think he's past his prime and unable to make another horror classic. The only decent film he made, as they live (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else sucks up to the incredibly cheap long-term and delayed Ghosts of Mars ... and now this waste of celluloid. Where more great people like the attempt on Precinct 13, HALLOWEEN (1) Escape from New York and the thing? <br /> <br /> Carpenter clan Wallace proves that he can not write your way out of a paper bag with its paper -thin script packed with yawns, groans and recycled gags from the original. I have already said, I hated every character in the film? There was not a single memorable character in the whole film. How does this happen? This film has nothing to recommend it. Not even a DVD presentation is good; menu looks terrible <br /> <br /> In comparison with JASON X :. "Friday the 13th in Space" was a masterpiece. Now, how do you make a sequel and (updated) to activate the franchise, the lady and the germ, as well as to create an exciting DVD menus.
