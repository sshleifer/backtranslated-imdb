When I was a teenager, seeing this movie for the first time, I thought that it was one of the best films ever made. Of course, the reason for this is the fact Derek and its various states of nudity in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is terrible. Keep in mind, Because Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and her husband, director John Derek, make sure that you see a lot of it. But if you take this aspect of the film, it becomes one big dull drive. Tarzan, well, he's muscular, as you think it should be, but when he sees Jane (this is, of course) for the first time, he does not know what to think. And this despite the fact that After wearing a wet shirt with a viewing to see her breasts to appear. Tarzan would have been the only primitive man on the planet who have this problem. If you are looking for a film to drool over the beautiful naked body, it can fill in a ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, interesting and what is the point of the film, go elsewhere ... almost anywhere on that !!!
