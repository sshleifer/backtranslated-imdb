The only real event in the film Death whining guy and reaction surviving characters to it. <br /> <br /> In every other way, this film is very inaccurate plagiarism Jaws, calm lake and Alligator Car, with a bit of Godzilla (1998) boot. <br /> <br /> in accordance with the standard for the horror film of the 1990s style, the two are not the main role of women, each taking his clothes at least once, the female lead does not, as it obviously It is the best remedy. <br /> <br /> In general, the film surrounds the filming really dumb extreme surfing sport of blood, in which surfers cut themselves and surfing in shark-infested waters. In this film, a giant saltwater crocodile, too, is in the area. People eat. The film ends. <br /> <br /> I do not mind a bad horror movie, but I really hate stupid bad horror movie, which it certainly is.
