This kind of movies where a psychopath of one sort or another is trying to damage the reputation (and ultimately eliminate all) some naive person to take over his life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female and thousands of television films some examples of this. But while some of them, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights can offer at least some very paranoid, anxious character or several plot twists, Illegal Entry plays everything by the book. And were it not for the fame of its stars (Kurt Russell, Ray Liotta, and Stowe), the film will sink to mediocrity faster than miniseries Steele. <br /> <br /> Russel played by Michael Carr, continuously naive guy who summons a couple of officers, if someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Stowe). Unfortunately, he calmly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in a situation pectoral cop (Ray Liotta), a typically psychopathic villain without any restrictions to its power. On the first empathizing Carr (probably just pretending to do so), police friendly couple. But quickly, the police want to curry out of the way, thus destroying life, guys, almost as he could (which is quite easy if you are a police officer, and if you're a police officer, who found the guy security system in his house) to take over and seemed to get his wife. It seems less ends-oriented, and more like a cop just wants to prove his strength. Wife more like a trophy, in other words, the end. And the story is played out entirely by the book, you can probably predict each occurrence before it happens on the screen, if you had seen these films. With the "shocking" moment our main naive character realizes that he is a victim of credit card fraud (committed by psychopathic villain) to the turnover-he's-nya-a very dead-finals.
