I was very, very disappointed with this film. he started very well and created some great atmosphere and intrigue, but when he finally went around to the disclosure of the "monster" ... it was just some kind of crazy with skin problems ...... again. Whoopee. Another nutjob film ... as we do not have enough. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the "creep" is really anxious look, and the way he moves, and he makes amazing sounds pretty awful, but I'm tired of renting a movie like this only to discover that the monster is a man, although twisted, crazy, bizarre one. When I saw that all alarm rat at early stage I was hoping for some bizarre hybrid rat monster things ... it was announced this when he was discovered Creep. <br /> <br /> On top of this, some things in this movie makes no sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why the hell does Creep kill the guard? What is the point other than sticking a big honking sign up that says Â«HI I'm crazy and I live here!"? His silly, and seems to only happen to prevent the character from Franka Potente assistance. <br /> <br />, that Ada he ate there? I got the impression that he is effectively walled, and only unexpected finding in this tunnel section let loose ... just as he chewed the rats all this time, and if so, why they hang around so much? Why is it so damn hard to kill? He was thin, malnourished and not exactly at the peak of performance ... but it seems to keep going, despite the injury, equivalent to those .cripple nya-psycho characters in the film. <br /> <br /> DVD-comment says that we are to empathize Creep, but I just find it disgusting. Its effective enough film, but wasted so many opportunities, that makes me sick.
