I only rated this film 3 out of pity, because he is trying to be helpful. I like to praise a great movie, and I'm not biased towards movies "male". Legally Blonde was a great movie. Georgia rule, on the other hand, was disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of creating movies in the worst case. By the end of the movie, I do not care who's lying, or if something is decided. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in the film is a good story. This story is weak and does not develop (because the subject deeply, does not mean that the story is good). A good story has a dynamic character. The dynamic character of the one who is experiencing considerable change in the nature and primed for this change in the course of the film. Georgia Rule, the changing nature were harsh and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many attempted dynamic characters. Removing a really good dynamic nature of hard work and takes a long time (you've only got a couple of hours in the cinema). This means that too many attempts of dynamic characters get too little attention to their personality changes. Even if I ignore poorly written story, and litter weak dynamic character, I can not even say I loved anyone. Each character was a mess. This is good if you just write American Beauty, but not when you're trying to dramatic comedy. Georgia has been a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible basis for person (no, I'm not cutting her slack because she was molested, shit happens to everyone, and we are all responsible for our own actions). «Dudley Do Right» Mormons child had to have the courage to not jeopardize their religion and commitment to ... Simon, I mean seriously, that guy gives a 17-year-old girl who was clinging to just stay for a while from time to time (if he is not an actor or a politician). This film is worth watching, if you want to remind yourself that making a good film NO!
