There's also a big difference between holding an original, intense, edge of your seat, it is terrible, Gore-festival, and does as a director Eli Roth and his team have done with "Cabin Fever" and simply acted as he did. The film-five college graduates in the house in the forest, which begins be fatal, as one by one succumb to this mysterious, fast, carnivorous disease. It's not long before friends turn on each other, and can barely stand in sight of one another, much less want to be in the same area as them. As gross as it all sounds, there is a certain spark of the basic premise of this film, which could be worked into the hands of the less daring filmmaker. Unfortunately, what we end up with a poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look nice in the beginning, to make the inevitable expansion of the higher contrast, a banal script so Profanity loaded to leave the settings view of the dialogue, and more podagovory obscure, slightly larger inducing (in one case) from the on-screen appearance Roth director. This sloppy filmmaking several ways! Avoid it devour time.
