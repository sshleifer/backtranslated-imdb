This film does not deserve one. It was a complete waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not offensive, but it was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler, which I think should be read by all. There is a full exposure and disgusting language. But not only that, no storyline, the actors are terrible, horrible accents, the actors a little time, and I even EXCITED to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was for Van Holt (received only fifteen second part, by the way). I think it may have been an error on the part of directors and editors, but they repeat the same segments of two or three times, adding only a new proposal. <br /> <br /> The film is like a rubber band head, perhaps the most disturbing movie there. There's no storyline, and it's not funny. While that is not trying to be funny. DO NOT SEE EITHER MOVIE.
