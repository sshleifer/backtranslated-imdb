Maaan, where I would start with that god awful movie. Bad bad bad speaking stories. I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this film. Namastey London was a pretty enjoyable film will honest..even soundtrack was good. But this one..oh good..for my film to be a musical one..the songs soooo bad. AR Rahman was musical director. <br /> <br /> Given the two great actors much better job should be made director. Even though the first half of the sludge in the last 30 minutes of the film OK. Presentation of Salman and Ajay save the film from being a complete failure. <br /> <br /> See if you have nothing better to do. Last good movie from Bollywood, I watched (and I watch the load of them) is Dev D and Up Sid.
