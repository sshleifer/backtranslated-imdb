I'm usually pretty generous critic, but in the case of this film, I must say that it was incredibly bad. I'm surprised at how positive most of the reviews seem to be. <br /> <br /> There were some stunning pictures, but it's too bad they have been spent on this sinkhole film. This could work if the "cross" was a pure action flick, and not a novel, but unfortunately, the film is built around a love triangle empty. There's no chemistry between any of the pairs, no matter there is between May and her men seem to be more than the longing for love, and for the most part of the dialogue just stupid. It may just be a problem with the translation, but the frequent use of the word "yoke", in particular, reminded me of the 8th grade, and not through the heels head, together forever, it is worth-dying of love; I also felt that we were beaten on the head wind metaphor. The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I'm wishing on the remote control to fast forward, I fell down on the seat, ready to snore, but mostly I just shrunk a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now, the icing on the cake. Or, rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was really one of the worst, ridiculous ones I've ever seen. Boys who have their bachelor fighting and yelling and screaming and breaking one by one. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Accidental. Oh, and then Mei (cross built in the heart) suddenly pops out of the weeds. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to get to its destination, even slowing down comfortably in the middle of the screen to hit a small drop of blood. Wow, that's cool. <br /> <br /> Well, Mae dies in the end, I think, because she threw the dagger, which was caught in her chest and bleed to death. Gene sings, crying, holding her body close, the screen goes blank. I and the people around me are laughing. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, but ultimately fail.
