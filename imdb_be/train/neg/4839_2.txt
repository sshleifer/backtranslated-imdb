... And it is lowered more than ever before. I will not make any direct reference or anything here, but, to put it mildly, this film is miserable. If you are trained in the military, do not bother to look. I put it on a DVD with 2 friends who want to see some interesting action / war film. Why do not I just read the reviews first. <br /> <br /> In the very first "bomb" movie scene it has enormous difficulties, and they continue to show, and are becoming more and more. Has 2 friends that are not related to the military anyway spotted a couple of mistakes filmmaker almost as quickly as I did, and I was asked if some of the things that happen we realistically. Well, as you might guess, they do not -. Generally <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you are not able to ignore the absolutely idiotic and again there are errors being made. 2/10 for catching my interest in the first place.
