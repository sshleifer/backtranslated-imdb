Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... well, two of my friends and me, we have pizza ordered, I sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi, or at least something brainless, but funny as a comparison. But Bare sucked blood. It's a waste. Well, the scene with the woman who likes to have a pretty outstanding. But that's all. Nothing more, nothing less. I will not summerize story, other people, and already, I just wanted to stop the hype. But look for yourself and speed. Maybe we can click on the rating, which sould be. Another thing that comes to mind: the soundtrack is worse than ever was Carpenter - well, John ... cool :) 2/10
