Well, I absolutely love Ben Stiller, although I warm to Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act in the least degree. Each movie or Cibitoke I saw it very difficult to pass it a fake action. It looks like she's just standing there reading directly from a script. This film was only one good thing about this, and this, that Ben Stiller was in it. This story is so Insulted and Injured is ridiculous. How many films have the same plot is the type ?? Can we say, "The forces of nature ??" Not only is the story so old, but the outcome is so predictable, it's boring. I knew that all that needs to happen before it did. It was boring, but watching Stiller always delight !!!
