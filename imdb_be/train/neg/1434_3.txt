James Bond in the desert? Well, here's how it looks: Pierce Brosnan, in the end, most known as Bond in "Tomorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both shot up this issue honestly, the two wires of the film of both. badly miscast, with Brosnan turn in a little more convincing performance, and Annie Galipeau (as the Pony, the love interest of Gray Owl) having a fight with carelessly written dialogue. <br /> <br /> two aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But the film is not about aunts. it is about the depths of the Canadian wilderness. And while fatagr FFL can be quite, NO grit to the harsh reality of life in the depths. Annie Galipeau as the Pony, simply can not be persuasive, unfortunately, because I really wanted to believe it. It was a relatively inexperienced twenty years on this film, and he might work, but Richard Attenborough was perhaps just not tough enough on it. it makes her look vulnerable, which, of course, it is .. but not in that sort of way. <br /> <br /> but one thing is certain it is a fabulous all over. But mascara and eyebrow thickening agent in the wilderness? He just does not fit, the more that she only ever seems to go test forest with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl), and use the photographs for kissing closeup. <br /> <br /> I lived with the forest people in the north-west Pacific, and they just do not look this beautiful and remain so sweet, fighting for survival. This brings me to another point: the film is not in a position to cause a period in which it is installed: in the 1930s. I nod here mostly on a dull script that seeks to preach at the expense of a dramatic arc, plot points, and those small details that can evoke the period through action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script, and his latest offering, "Elizabeth The Golden Age" opened three days ago, so I hope that there is an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the other comments posted, but I'm not sure. Lots of potential, but it is wrong, and even, perhaps, ill-conceived. If it was a religious film, it would be destined to, but because he preaches environmentalism, the film is slightly above criticism because it is "politically correct". Unfortunately, for all that I do not buy it. Amen.
