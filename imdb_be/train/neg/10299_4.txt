I must admit that I'm stuck is one to think that something should happen, except a dead body in the first scenes ... and its removal from it. I was wrong. It was a movie Verite Betty striking beach enclosed in the first part of the mordant Morwenna. I really do not care that the young lassies from Scotland to do these days, that's your screw, which medications they are taking. Visually, a walk through Cabo de Gata in Andalusia was pleasant and, of course, the highest point for me. Nadir was chop shop for his dead friend. As the film came to an end, I had two thoughts ... 1. That's all there is? 2. Now I understand why her boyfriend committed suicide. Rename it. "Naked Bitch Boredom, or what I did on my trip to Spain." I'm such a sucker for sticking these things.
