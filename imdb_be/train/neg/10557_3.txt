This is a disgusting little production, prone to give one nightmares and headaches. This ugly blend of live action and stop-motion animation is ugly. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, a wonderful journey any optimism can wait. This cold, inhuman, hostile, sick, or even horrible little strange. There's absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney has done a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove Hall has made things much more attractive from the stop-motion. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that a French production. Thus, he re-enforces the stereotype that the French do not have a clue about scary.
