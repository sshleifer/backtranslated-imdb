I could barely keep from either nodding off or just turn off this piece of shit, but I decided to stick with it, if only for the reasoning, it is possible * something * will. This work is a writer / producer / director / special effects Kenneth Hertz, who wants to make a statement on environmental damage, making a monster movie. This is what he wanted anyway. That it is a lot of action, a bit exaggerated, or simply ordinary and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat itself as the attacking monsters in the river waters (Oh, and what a blessing, a woman just happens to be naked in it .. . although even disappearance) <br /> <br /> it's just meaningless stuff, but I think that it's not so bad !; it is not very pleasant, at least, and once or twice, we get an interesting view of the floor in the Brazilian "culture" (which is the father walking around the city with his flock or other parts of the similarities, "Hey, this is not America!). But that I hope that the director was casting Mitch or Carradine is spent in the best pedestrian, at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialogue. It does not help that when we finally get something good look at the monsters and "action "occurs, it is too stupid to put and only running a privat Nost. Usually I feel sorry for the filmmaker, who has had a lot of problems getting a particular painting finished- in this case, it took most of the mid 70s- but Monstroid or monsters, or whatever it's called ... nah. <Br /> <br / > If you accidentally get the Elvira DVD double feature of this (bad print with poor transmission quality) with blue Sunshine, make sure to skip this course, if you are not a die-hard Elvira and can not help themselves, to hear her juicy comment.; I personally would prefer to receive Joel or Mike Nelson with robots of Mystery Science Theater this roast turkey.
