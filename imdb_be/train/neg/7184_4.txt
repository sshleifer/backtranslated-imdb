It was really not a very good film. There was a lot of improbable and predictable things that happened during the movie ... but I think most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this film should enjoy broad audience. This film was produced by Magic Johnson! Is not that enough to inspire all of us to see this film? Former NBA star of the film production does not come every day, you know. Beautifully stupid children in a big house, getting slashed the ax, which has a psycho. Every clich√© trot for us to moan again. Teen sex. And all this was made by Magic Johnson! I can not say enough about this movie! teens use drugs! Hijinx college! And all this was made by Magic Johnson! Yippeeee!
