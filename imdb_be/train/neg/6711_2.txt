1993 was the year. This was long before Philip Seymour Thomas won an Oscar. Who knew that I would be an extra in a movie with him? I was actually paid in addition to the "My boyfriend back", which was shot in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, Texas. The original title was «Johnny Zombie» (thank God, the producers had a change of heart!) I was in the theater scene. I ran out to see a movie the next day it was released in theaters. This is more of a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you can check it. There is nothing that even comes close to the "Dawn of the Dead" or even "by Shaun of the Dead," the quality, but the cheese factor is good enough. ciao
