When I was a kid, and I lived with my sister, she bought all the horror she could find, and it was one of them. VCRs first became household item, and we did not have, but about 150 films, and we watched the hell out of all of them. <br /> <br /> I have been on sale the other day and I saw this VHS copy BLOOD LEGACY and buy any horror film I have, and I knew that this film seemed familiar. I thought for a moment and realized that it was the one who bought my sister. She sold it years ago in a yard sale I guess -. Who knows <br /> <br /> I do not remember anything in general about it, and I watched it, I bought it at night, and it refreshed my memory because of several scenes. I do not know how I felt about it as a child, but I'm sure that I liked it because it was new to me, and I would watch and enjoy personal time. <br /> <br /> I'm a freak horror movies, but there are certain requirements in order to get me to consider it "good", and this one fell very short. It was one of those conversations conversation talk and gave birth to my type of death. Death scenes you see are made with the help of the shadow on the wall, then splashes of blood and then if you're lucky, you get that a lot. <br /> <br /> the story is good, and I've seen a few similar sites, so I think that this one should be buried and forgotten. Do not look at these people, if you are not hard up.
