0 * 's Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Matthew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> On the basis of director Uwe Boll video game tries to recreate the game in a futuristic nail biting, unfortunately, he could not. Instead, it makes one of the worst movies ever! Despite the fact that he gets a minor celebrity, such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff his film does not have the necessary foundation that the film should be good, such as the storyline and some of the basic theory of relativity of what is happening in the dark and the light. The film jumps around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI is used to create monsters. Despite the fact that they have made to look cool and feeding it was good, a little limp. Honestly, this is one of the worst movies ever. My final rating of 0/10.
