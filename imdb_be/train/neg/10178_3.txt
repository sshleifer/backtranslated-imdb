How could I appreciate this dud sequel? All this makes the balls roll! Worst of all, it does not compare even the first installment of the series! Comedy suffers not funny. Where are all the unintentional laughter go? Suffice farce on-field action is too long. Bob Uecker literally saved by the full nine-inning shutout. What's next, MAJOR LEAGUE 4: RETURN TO LITTLE LEAGUE? Ehh, maybe! Leave one on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game. This one had three strikes too much.
