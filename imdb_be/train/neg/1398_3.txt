I bought it (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the title «Gray Matter». The novelty of seeing Sherriff Rosco on Sun DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me. As other reviewers have warned, it's quite boring story about a top-secret government experiment gone awry. <br /> <br /> And so, there are many set shots, especially in a house with a swimming pool in front of him. Some of the characters and the interior is so plain, I believe that the creators of the film is concerned, we might forget who is who, so they continue to rollover of the first showing outside of buildings. It's actually pretty funny. After a while the pool shot feels like a channel logo identification station, reminding us that we are seeing «Gray Matter». <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed two bouts of swearing. At some point, an enraged subject of ridicule someone in charge of calling it a "Scientific and b * snip!". It's just a very inadequate insult. A few scenes later, another theme releases steam, muttering that "scientific b ** Tardy!". It just sounded very uncomfortable for me. <br /> <br /> Someday, this film will disappear forever. Ten years from now it will probably be impossible to find any copies. Almost like it never happened. <br /> <br />
