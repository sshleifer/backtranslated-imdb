- Mexican priest becomes a fighter in order to save an orphanage or something - <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie because it was not about the WWF-fight, and so I thought it might be funny. It was not. It is painful to watch. Uncomfortable. Any and all opportunities for comedy mercilessly squandered. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I do not like Jack Black in any case. After that, I racked my brain to think of a good role that he performed. The only thing I can think of where he was been suitable as a necessary foil character John Cusack in the «High Fidelity». Jack Black is one of those horrible tireless flat out ham-It-Up wandering guys (as little fat one at Abbott and Costello or Jerry Lewis), which must be said that, as a powerfully idiocy is not the same thing funny . <br /> <br /> It's not even a farce. It's just annoying. It's not even Stoopid, that's just silly. <br /> <br /> I've also heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite, but if it's anything to go by I will not be rushing out to find it on DVD.
