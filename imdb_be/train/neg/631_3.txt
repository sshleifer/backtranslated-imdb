Strange. That's what you said, if you were sitting through this movie. It's incredible, amazing. It really is so amazing that someone was dumb enough to lose money in the creation of this monster that you just can not believe what you see. That, my friends, that's what's really scary about this movie. Someone thought it a good idea to do so. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another amazing original story: High school student (sometimes it seemed that college ?? go figure) is a slut for mom, lives in a trailer park, and "artist", which ridiculed for his " be all in a different way. "well, of course, the poor boy laughed eventually killed, but the original part of his soul dwells stuffed (by which he kills his mother's latest depraved John). Then he goes around with the standard kill all the people who made him sick. . Awww <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> --Amazingly funny movie ?? even if it's not what I wanted, obviously drunk filmmakers. <br /> <br /> --This continue on the same disk in the Wal-Mart $ 5:00 hopper ?? so it's a bit overpriced. <br /> <br /> does not hurt, Didn »t Help: <br /> <br /> --The violence and blood is their native substandard. One man stabbed corncob. <br /> <br /> --Sounds, they put some effort into the music ?? but it does not really put the movie ?? and not all that good. <, Br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br /> <br /> --Terrible, horrible acting <br /> <br /> --Another chopper let down with the sexy woman ?? none of them produce clothes .. If it ceases to be a staple of low-grade slashers ?? <br /> <br /> --Ridiculous history. <br /> <br /> --The stuffed vomit jokes that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush. <br /> <br /> --Standard who are going nowhere, and poorly done based on a love story. <br /> <br /> --Some people killed, it seems that they were chosen at random ?? you never know, someone there, and then they kill. And you can only assume that they must have been his closest <br /> <br /> Ugly :. <br /> <br /> --Extremely average slasher fare, with just killing the scarecrow instead ?? Well, all that other crap. <br /> <br /> --Nowhere near as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or even a series of Angela «Sleepaway Camp» ?? all better than this atrocity. <br /> <br /> --The absolute worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. The script loaded to the level retardedness, that I never thought could exist. I'm serious here ?? it is a complete step-by-awful. Do not get me wrong though, it's funny as hell ??, but I never heard a donkey banter ?? even in the "hen Massacre III». This film makes "Jason X» look like Shakespeare <br /> <br /> human --The, which kills a boy who becomes a stuffed :. The worst wig ever. Dialogue to match <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes :. <br /> <br /> --The one where the primary boys school spew their own witty dialogue: "Hey, let's find a small animal torture. to a "<br /> <br /> duties :. 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Operator: 1/10 Character development: 2/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 5/10 nudity / sexuality: 1 / 10 (nO poverty mother whore girls are not bras) Violence / Gore: 5-10 (low quality, mediocre quantity) Dialogue: 0/10 (very funny, brash, over-the-top and painfully funny ?? so bad My first is a good rating for the communication in any movie) Music:.! Direction 5/10: 2/10 <br /> <br /> cheesiness: 10/10 crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 3/10 <br /> <br /> one for all people like me, who love to watch the pure crap Or Tsyas. ak Completists film.
