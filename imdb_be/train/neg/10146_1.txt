«Flight Of Fury» is surprisingly deplorable, but worst of all boring fighter - I do not expect much from Seagal movie, everything that I expected to be mildly entertained for 90 minutes or so with some meaningless actions OK regret it indifferent "t even reach that low expectations, the scene is small and far apart, the plot (which does not matter in these tapes) unnecessarily complex and confusing with huge holes in the plot around, acting is really horrible - bordering on uncomfortable with Segal and One of his whisper speech expression appears Xia best among helpless many 3-evaluators - I find that hard to believe that anything close to the $ 12M has been spent on this terrible confusion when the $ 11M that 12 was not Sigal salary - I somehow doubt it! One moment of any interest to direct the guy or gay girls that from seemingly out of nowhere, two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene kind, complete with a huge Bat on display, in addition - it is mediocre stuff that does no different from many of Michael Dudikoff in B-movies I hated <br /> <br /> 1/10
