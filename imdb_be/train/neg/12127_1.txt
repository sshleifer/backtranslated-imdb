Unfortunately Fulci fans, but I could not go through with it. The soundtrack was also annoying as they come, the action was a childhood history was made and made, and there was no direction. <br /> <br Massacre /> honestly looked like a children's film project. But I've seen some of them, and they actually look better than it did! Apparently, was so under-funded that they can not afford to ... NOTHING! Nha DoP, Sun director, no one who even remotely have a clue what the action was. It was a very bad experience in cinema; One of my worst. <br /> <br /> It was the worst suck-fest I saw near the Terror Toons, which is second only to killer clowns from outer space. I have nothing to say about it <br /> <br /> It is the rate of 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> hostile.:.
