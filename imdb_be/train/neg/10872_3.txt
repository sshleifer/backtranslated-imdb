Here's an indie film that I really wanted to, but ultimately could not. The lack of a script (boldly declared in the main title) really shines through and kills a picture. History meaningless clutter that you should not try to find out. I quickly became bored within 10 minutes, and then moved through the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before reaching the head of the stops (mercifully) to reach the end ... even that is not worth the extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE clearly trying too hard to be clever by raising their best sequence of EVIL DEAD 2 and the matrix. As a result, there is very little OZARK SAVAGE, that has not been done before, and better. This film would have been much more fun as a 10-20 minute short, but as a feature, it just feels routed and forced. Of course, there is no money in pants, so I fully understand the financial reasons, I think, motivated still outstretched 75+ minutes. Directed by Matt Steinauer shows great promise, and I wish him luck.
