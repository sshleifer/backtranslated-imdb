This show may be the biggest, ugliest, the most common steam pile I saw in children's programs, which actually become successful. The main character, Johnny, as I understand it, it should be a normal child, not pretty or even tolerable. Lame jokes, exaggerated (ie, "Wow! I did not see that there is a" stop-gap. Well, it was the first time not even funny. It's not even cute) and the absence of any form of primitive wit or inspiration. And finally ... it's just not nice to look at. While the children are not particularly important artistic talent, they still prefer the eye candy. I can not stand to watch the show, because in a certain sense, the art style is just ... gross. Ugliness, actually. Simply ugly. <br /> <br /> I just can not, it's getting so much airtime. While I understand that nostalgia may be a little irrational, and I should not get my hopes back ... I really miss the old cartoons. Return Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls ... nothing but this shit. I think it's just wishful thinking, though. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I advise you not to waste your time on the show. I find that really good cartoons can enjoy the big kids too. And it does not cut it.
