As the only film that I was able to see this year «Nordische Filmtage» in Lübeck, this year's festival will be remembered as a constantly low for me. <br /> <br /> This film, which has been declared as an erotic thriller, this is nothing more than a sick piece of shit! Excuse the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the actors are not the best. But even the best actors did not save the film. for example the story: after the first 15 minutes it was clear that John was sick, the neighbor girls were not real, and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting each other until the blood does not flow for me has nothing to do with sexuality), but, unfortunately, were not the only shocking images to be shown. Everything else has been copied by other directors, such as, for example ,. Lynch, but, of course, without genius <br /> <br /> So, summing up the whole movie, and save the other spectators time and money: a guy loses a friend, a friend back home, man kills girlfriend and goes mad after that, the guy is currently hot, but the crazy neighbor girl, the guy has a very nasty sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in the end, he realizes that he is mad, and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his the apartment is constantly ... bad story, bad actors, shots that make you sick ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point for what you know, how well you can understand Norwegian, when you have learned, Swedish - at least one advantage of the evening - and you can not choose 0 points here).
