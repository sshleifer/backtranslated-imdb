My husband and I bought an old school Sesame Street DVD for our daughter, and I must say that I do not let her watch new episodes on TV, because I find all the characters annoying. Bear and Tel? OMgosh, how annoying and useless windbag someone can think about their "skits"? Elmo? Give it a rest, not every child loves it, again, annoying and does not teach your child nothing. Mr. Noodle? that they reject. I think that once, when I turned the "new" show on her, she and I was dumber than before. Defined show took a wrong turn. I remember Yip Yips, Breaking News Kermit, 1-2 2 Little doll, Mumford Maga, Bert and Ernie, Grover Garzon, all great educational skits old school Sesame Street SS suffered from a direct hit by boredom and numbness as no passing of Jim Henson in 1990 the show has no more education, funny and interactive scenes he used to. I find the new versions simply unbearably irritating and full of useless non-educational talker. Way to go manufacturer S.S. / Authors you have another cartoon show for parents to sit there, not creative, nya-child carried to so they will go out of their hair. For Manufacturers / Writers: I suggest you pop out the old Muppets and start taping similar content as the first Sesame Street. Lord knows, I'm sure I do not want my child to speak, as the bear or Elmo.
