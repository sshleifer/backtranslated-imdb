They were able to make one of the best romantic movies tragedy mafia ever, because they were actors, budget and history, but the great director John Huston was too busy trying to mitigate this missed classic.Strenuously trying to find black humor as often as possible, which diluted the film is very much.And and they were so inattentive to the details of how sound and detailed action.Maybe it was the age of the director, who died two years later.
