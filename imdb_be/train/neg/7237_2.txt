Life really is too short for movies like this. I know that this can not be good when I realized that I had already suspected - that David Schwimmer will play the same type of person he plays in "FriendsÂ» <br /> <br /> Let's look to the truth eyes, either. the guy can not do anything to play, but a botanist, or he never offered any other parts. I have a feeling that it's a mixture of both. <br /> <br /> And I must say that it is very difficult to love a film that completely wastes considerable talents Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
