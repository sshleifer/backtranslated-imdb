If you liked the movie The Grinch ... go watch again that, since it was no where near as good a translation Seuss movie. Cat Mike Myers is probably the most annoying character "grace" screen recently. His voice / accent is terrible, and he laughs at his own jokes with the horrible sound weasing that about just laughed, I heard in the theater. Not even the children liked these people and children laugh at anything right now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action, if you really are looking for a fun family holiday movie.
