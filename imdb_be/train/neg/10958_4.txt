Watching it after receiving the DVD for Christmas 2005, I came here to the pan - but after reading the other comments, I have no heart. Obviously, this is a film that worked very well for children of a certain age. Well, let me not be complete Grinch; it can still work for some children - if they are not too media-saturated and do not become overly complex visually, for example, view all the LOTR and Harry Potter. But if you are an adult, stay miles; You will not enjoy it <br /> <br /> good bits :. Barbara Kellerman as a witch, especially in its early stages with Edmund, creates just the right combination of charismatic evil and restrained the madness. (Table Stone it is a little bit above.) Michael Aldridge in the minor role of Professor Jeffrey S. Perry as Mr. Tumnus also be in the form of polished, skillful action we might expect from the very best BBC drama. And Aslan suit works very well, surprisingly well considering. They got eyes just <br /> <br /> bad bits :. Almost everything else, but two areas in particular. One of them, casting. Britain is full with good actors and contains tens of thousands of British schoolchildren attractive. How could they possibly end with these four Stiffs?

Sophie and Lucy Wilcox, Lucy so much, probably dramatically wrong for this part, I can not imagine how she got the job. <br /> <br /> Second, animal costumes. Again, it seems that they have worked for some children. If children are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo fascinating, believable characters, they can be captivated by this film. But for the audience with the sophistication of, say, 12-year-old, who has seen the Prisoner of Azkaban? When Mr. Beaver comes out from behind the tree, it will be buzzing cruel, mocking laughter. Costumes just do not work - I could not, and I think that any adult or a modern teenager can not suspend disbelief, if you look at Mr. Beaver. Turn animation later (griffins, etc.) works better, is easier to take <br /> <br /> So :. Ten stars for themselves young and tender soul; all other read or reread the book and look much better than the film that unfolds in your mind.
