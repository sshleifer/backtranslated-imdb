Almost every part of land in this film is illogical and implausible. It does not carry the likeness of real human history, dead and dull. This is a parody of Hollywood, with pipe music beats that remind you of the film Denzel Washington, shaky camera shots and focusing racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and comic images and gestures of famous people in catalog clothing poses. This is done to meet a lot of zombies, whose value in life comes from watching celebrities names. The only good thing in the film and the final credits funk song that accompanies it. I feel like an idiot to see that, to preserve itself.
