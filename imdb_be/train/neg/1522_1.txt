You should know that I am the kind of person who looks even worse from movies to the end, often out of pure curiosity. I even watched Leprechaun to the end before you tempted tearing eyes and stamping on them. You should also know that this film was in my VCR in less than half an hour before I made a desperate leap to the button to stop and rushed back to the rental shop just put more distance between me and her as possible.
