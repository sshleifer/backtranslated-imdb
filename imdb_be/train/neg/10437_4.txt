Well enough, though vile comedy drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman directed quasi-comedy with bizarre characters are so overwhelmed by eccentrics, it starts to creak early on weight. Some of the cinematography flags, Shelley Duvall is a stitch in her debut as a guide, and Sally Kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as sight Bud Cort in the "mother bird" (imagine, Altman and producer Lou Adler, explaining the role it!) . The leaders, Bud Cort - again, after the "Harold and Maude" - a true original; Sun repels like, say, Michael J. Pollard, a Cort manages to be provocative, silly and harmless, a hard act to pull off. Unfortunately, this is one of misfires Altman. He can collect an actor and a prime example, as anyone else, but let them be dismissed with some inspiration to mislead, and it spirals down. ** from ****
