I really can not believe that now passes for entertainment. Death (and make fun of death), violence, sexual innuendo, adult child threatening, rude, alcohol abuse minors, theft of drugs, dysfunctional parents, nanny from hell, stereotypical jokes about African-Americans, the police and people who are overweight, and children secretly house in the middle of the night - yeah, sure it sounds like a movie kids for me - not !!! Add to that the dark and terrifying element - a dead woman who owns and converted into a house and keep her husband loves prisoner for more than 20 years, and terrorizing the whole neighborhood - like candy for the children. PARENTS - this is really what you want your children will see - this is what you want to teach them about life? <br /> <br /> This movie too scary for little kids, and I'm afraid that young people today can live some of the film script - so why rub it in your face? As for adult audiences - you will not find it scary or funny - just sad, contrived and predictable. And the characters are just plain wrong - ignorant parents, ignorant cops, stupid and annoying friends, ugly and manipulative nanny, and drinking beer / adultery boyfriends. What a wonderful material for children - it really sounds like a children's film to someone? Even computer animation and the voice work is not good enough to pay off this horrible film. Save your money, save your time and save your children's minds - to rent Ice Age, Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - all of them better than this horrible film. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on you both for the creation of such a disaster, and then billing it as a child / family film !!
