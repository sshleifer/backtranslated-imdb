For the "horror" made-for-TV movie cinema started very interesting. I was very intrigued by the history and mystery of the film. But the ending was a total dissappointment. The film went on to a rapid and built, it seemed, anyway, very climatic end. But I think that there is no end. The film is a bit more and after almost one-and-a-half hours, the audience were left wondering just what happened. Why are all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered. There was no explanation at all about any of the key moments in the plot. This film is like watching a murder mystery, and then never find out who did it. Very dissappointed. This film looks like the producers simply ran out of money and did not finish the film. A real bomb!
