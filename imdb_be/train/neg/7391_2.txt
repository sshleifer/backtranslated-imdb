Well, like most fans of Steven Seagal I know that I will not wait for a masterpiece every time he makes a film, but I'm waiting for the film, at least some of the sorter budget. The main problem with the copy I saw was terrible over the dubbing, I know that in some films it should be done, and I accept it, but if they are overwritten with completely different voice actors and continue to do so through the film is to take away the magic of blending. In addition, the kits seem to be built, without medical care, in the same stage, sliding glass top in a top-secret lab was a massive crack goes through it. I was really disappointed with this film and only hope, Stevens next project will be finished off before submitting the film for the purchase / lease. The story of this film has me wondering if I was watching a science fiction film or not some parts seemed strange how, but they never fully explain what was happening, I found it very confusing.
