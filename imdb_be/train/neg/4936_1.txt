I spent my time and gave it a chance to show. This should be one of the worst new shows. If they gave the award shows that sucks it needs to sweep the category. Actions poor storyline and unnatural. Now Dinosaurs were a little strange, but at least it was interesting. The show lasted three seasons and finally scraped. This is a new show based on the insurance companies, advertising is not funny, and really has nothing going for it. Perhaps the original video and the amount of time they have been, and still, repeating what happened to this show. He just came to the TV and we are already tired of seeing "mountain" character.
