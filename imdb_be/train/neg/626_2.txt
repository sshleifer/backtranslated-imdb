Spirit High School killed geek animates stuffed, which then takes revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is really annoying me. It has a great-looking monster, has some good low budget implications, some atmosphere, but still manages to short-circuit the good stuff from the bad. Half way in I started to fast forward, and then step through the head on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problems associated with this film a lot. Firstly plaster looks about thirty, and yet they are suppose to be in high school. You do not believe from the get-go as a result. Scarecrow, while looking cool is not much further. He says that stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary. Is this a comedy or a horror film? Its a problem that goes beyond the liners for the most part of the dialog box and the settings. It seems more send to each cliche horror film than a heart. I like some expected that the film was made for a very limited audience in the form of horror fans who want to make fun of the genre, and not take it. <br /> <br /> Despite the good looking monster film is to be avoided. Even if you take it in the bargain bin for up to five dollars, you're paying too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
