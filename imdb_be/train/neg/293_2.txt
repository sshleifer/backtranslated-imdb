This film is mostly about some of the girls in a Catholic school, that eventually get into trouble for putting red paint in one in one of his school friends shampoo and after a reprimand for this act, they decide to take off for Florida vacation . there they meet on their way with some guys at a local diner, and decide that they both meet each other somewhere else later. The girls end up on the side of the road near the forest and stop for a while, and while one of the girls decided to walk around a bit, she saw the murder take place, in which the local sheriff himself involved. She gets scared and runs to tell the others what had happened. Other girls decided to go look at her and the two of them die from the killer. Then the two remaining girls to catch the killer and placed in the local jail cell. Deputy sheriff yet guarded by women and despite their claims that the sheriff assassin he ignores them both and acts as an ignorant and everyone else in this film that just can not put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at the same time. The best part was the scene of rape between a killer and one of the girls, where he decides to rape her in a prison cell, and it seems that she really wants to be raped by the man and the bare stage breast I admit, it was nice, but they lips meet in he has other things in mind. This film reminds me of the low-budget thriller «Blood Song» Frankie Avalon looking at him, the same tune, just another part of the signs. It is not necessary to rent a movie even for a low-budget film's 80th and the end of the end was the worst I have ever seen in a movie, and it left me wanting to return the money!
