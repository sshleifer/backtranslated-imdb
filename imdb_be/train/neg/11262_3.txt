Adrian just came out of the shelter to be rich, and without parents, his life seems to be empty. One day he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother is a prostitute. Desperate to earn some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian to look for his life, and who, where his father. This is a film with a new director, and it is clear to most of the film: the scene is not properly directed, the dialogues a bit forced, some incoherences in the script ... In any case, the end unexpectedly well done (well, just a little), and that saves a little film . Actors are known with great quality, however, they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting; they did the best articles in another film. The film is boring and results, you probably will spend most of their time thinking about how long it will take before it is completed. Of course, there are plenty of the worst films, but, of course, there are many much better than them.
