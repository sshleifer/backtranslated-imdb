Not anyone tired of that old cliché "where almost a dead man shows in the horror film gives us some information, and then blows his head for no apparent reason? I know I am. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that its use in this film is worth nothing. If you've seen the first film (a remake of the first I have to say), the information is completely useless, because you would already know about it. I think you can, it is not useless to the main characters..but why an idiot to shoot himself in the head? he does not want to live? Of course, he would have died anyway .. <br /> <br /> This is the second film will be called "The Hills Have Eyes II." The first, which is a continuation of the original 70-film. This is where it gets a little more difficult for someone like me. Look, I'm probably a minority of the people my age that even knew HHE2 start with, it is much smaller than the original HHE1. And now, when we have a continuation of the remake and the fact that this extension is named so, as a continuation of the original HHE1 ... it just makes it worse! But in any case .. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's original Hills Have Eyes was worthy. In the end, however, this idea was better than the presentation, but it is likely to have been a low budget. Honestly, Wes Craven's not what good is a horror director. He just made some good horror movies (A Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), some of them are Alright (Creek) and a lot of terrible ones (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh yeah, and he made the Swamp Thing, as well ... but the original HHE2 falls under the latter category. I saw only a few minutes, but it was awful. <br /> <br /> Currently, he co-authored a new HHE2..and is such a disappointment! Last year HHE remake was even better than the original film. It was intense. I believe that this was due to the fact that the main characters were a family, and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazed teenagers. It made us feel dirty. For the first hour we were in hell, and finally, in the last few minutes, the good guys revenge on the bad guys, and it felt good .. <br /> <br /> This new film has no voltage. A lot of uncertainty in general. Only hard things happen mostly stupid people. There is hardly a menacing presence here. Just ugly tramp hiding under rocks. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of the horror film where people die because of stupid mistakes, which they continue to do. It was just on the days that I looked «Deep Blue Sea", where Samuel L. Jackson continued to walk on water, giving a speech, and then he gets eaten by a shark, because the idiot was not close to the water .. something, that no one would do in this situation! That's the exact same thing. People leave themselves cast on their own, even if they know people dying..seriously, the pot could not wait for a break? And when you think that people would know who is coming out by themselves! Seriously, this is nothing more scary when characters bring their A-game and so far the losses? I think so ... <br /> <br /> He even under delivers. He had to do a remake of the first to look like «The Fog» remake (which was less formidable than the "Becker" episode). More bad guys. More time in the caves. More tension. Most. <br /> <br /> But it's actually dropped. Less bad guys. A lot of stress. Of course, we have more time in the caves, but not a lot going on there. In the end, it just seems that there are two or three bad guys. The last movie made it seem like the whole tribe of people. Where is this nation? Who continue to watch them through binoculars? Seriously, those are the things that this film has brought us, but he ends up with exactly the same promise that the last film has given us, this is the same "viewed" scene. Come on! I'll give the devil it is connected. Appearance good..but film it is. <br /> <br /> I do not even think that the supporters like baked this..though I'm probably wrong! There is blood (although most of them are accelerated, while in the dark), but without the stress, and the characters that you even care about..the blood does not do anything in my book! After all, you do not panic. You're not shocked (if you are not in the 8-year-old girl). You do not even feel like you've seen something new.
