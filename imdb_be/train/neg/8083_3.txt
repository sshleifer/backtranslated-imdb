Discarded Richard C. Sarafian, this disaster smelly to Japanese theaters before coming to the United States and will be immediately a video where he was not seen again until the Turner networks do not need anything else than infomercials to fill their 3 am-6am timeslots and I found it to tape at the bottom of the hopper them. Name Smithee be used when the studio breaks the film is so bad that the director does not want to have his name attached to it. But I'm afraid that Sarafian can not blame the studio is fully on it. Actors, mainly recent graduates "hamming 101", put one line after another cornball. The plot is convoluted. The special effects are impressive. Parts that are not funny just boring. Script or book should be good - otherwise why would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agreed to appear in this rags? But something went terribly wrong from the page to the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not even bad enough to be so bad-it's good.
