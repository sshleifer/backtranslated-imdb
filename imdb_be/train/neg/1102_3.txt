Firstly, I must admit that I have seen both films of this director I have seen without a title, and so may have missed the point. May the Czech Republic is not bad, but after sitting through the two films with him, if I did not try to find out. Samotari too cool. Too cool. This is about ten different storylines that weave in and out together. It is not so deeply unusual in Prague size (tiny, actually.) The main characters between 20 and 30. They got the job, and only one study. Best Balkan character young girl. Her sense repeats immigrants here every damn day. That's about it. The only great character. Everything else makes their own lives into hell all alone. How can I empathize with such apparent incompetence? Maybe there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists, but I need another stereotype in the film? Alright if you want music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, to see this movie. If you enjoy irony and dry humor, see the original Jarmusch not imitation. And in any case do not see the movie in Ondrzhichek, Septej (Whisper.) That is, if you do not use homophobic stereotypes.
