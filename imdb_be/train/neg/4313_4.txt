Like last year, I could not sit through it all. Thus, Chris Rock as host was a good choice, because it was vaguely attractive. Or rather, of all the common holes, packed the theater, at least he was not in the Top 10 most unfortunate. Many bearer, on the other hand, were in the coveted Top 10. I do not know what it was all done Autocue (although I knew that this was the scenario), but it was really scary to see these supposedly good actors are unable to insert the expression , view from the cane and stumble simple words (Natalie Portman ?? if there is no director, she went). Night Fancy Dress and boring speeches were long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles killed some good songs, and there were very few decent acceptance speech and clips. Adam Sandler wins award Worst Presenter. <br /> <br /> For helping me to write this review, I would like to thank my mom, my dad, my lawyers and my pedicure for all who believe in me, and I would like to point out that I have a high metabolism and, of course, I did not starve myself for a month. I will not cry ... thank you.
