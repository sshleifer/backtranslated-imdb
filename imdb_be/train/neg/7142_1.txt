This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I was going in expecting a cheesy movie, but at least, with some cool car scene / races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene is so low budget they have accelerated them to make it look like a "go fast" car in one scene Mercedes SLR comes from more than 200 to 0 to 4 seconds, just revolves around. That's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, to see fast and furious series. They can be a little cheesy, but 100x better than this film could ever hope to be. Better yet, just watch Mischief 3000, best car movie ever made, I think.
