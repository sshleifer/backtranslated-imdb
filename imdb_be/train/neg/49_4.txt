Very bad and sad road movie, with the intention of being hip and modern, as shown in the editing style and some amazing angles, resulting in only in sleepiness. <br /> <br /> The gypsum waste, writing silly and pretentious. The only thing standing is a first class soundtrack lalola Shifrin, really cool, as well as the opening sequence, a very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Run, if you can, the bad reviews and comments about this movie fully deserved; it's really clean garbage. It is known that it has its own charm, from watching a movie that's not throw a glass of beer when he was on fire, but to save his stormy day, when you have absolutely nothing to do.
