Slavery, humiliation, S & M show and not much more. The plot is flat, is actually just a banal setting for stylish corrupted Set-pieces.

Dream-like ending feel to wear. To the credit of the movie, though, Aya Sugimoto was quite convincing as the tormented lead. Flower and snake were compared with eyes wide shut, but aside from some slight superficial similarities, Kubrick more easily layered, rhythmic and atmospheric picture.
