I'm sorry to the fans of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slowly, badly cast and poorly acted in this film tries to avoid aperiodic romcoms recent years and failing! McDonald and Parker does not seem to be able to convey real emotions and lifeless. They seem to be in this one for any wages they get paid for it, and not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is dull !! I love the big chick movies as much as the next girl, and it's not the only one !! If you avoid one movie this year, let it be ....
