This film is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life - surpassing the previous most god-awful film, "Caviar Slithis», which I saw when I was about 10. <br /> <br /> Bad acting unnatural and funny dialogue, strange story, mishmashed cut scenes, even the music is annoying. Did I miss something? Well, the special effects were not bad - but the CGI movie indecent makeup <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I actually spent money to see this movie .. If someone has contact information for Hyung- rae Shim (Director), please send it to my user name "in Gmail», and I will refer to him personally to request a refund.
