What happens to the RGV? He seems to be repeating itself in every movie. whether it has run out of creative ideas? If he has time to take a back seat. I went to see a movie with great expectation - certainly never, I believe that it will be somewhere close to the original. I knew it was wrong, promo said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great pleasure to RGV, as he is not the same guy who directed sat and company? Or is it? I have my doubts after seeing the AAG. I will not talk about the plot or the story, as most of them are taken from the original, if you're really dying to go and see this, you could play a fun game with friends: to determine the stage of the original one, and give ratings yourself! So Veeru becomes Hiro (as corny is that?), I think, Heeru does not sound so great. Ajay Devgan is completely trouble as Heero, comedy tense and vaguely say that was really effective in the company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, more magic Niche strives to be more annoying it becomes. It reaches its peak towards the end. Raj is actually not bad compared to the other, he's the guy to watch in the future. I was very disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, it looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he drinks something from the cup all covered with a shawl, instead cause fear, he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was the Mohan Lal, inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I do not have the patience to write more.
