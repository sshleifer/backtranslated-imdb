It was put out on the DVD market, Alpha, and it is for die-hard fans of Boris Karloff (as MOI) only. This is not a horror film, but a drama, where Boris struggling scientists agreeing to kill the husband of a rich woman to succeed they need to continue their work. But after dying victim changes his will, and leaves his wife anything, all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> It is enough to see peace Karloff as another selfish sinister type, and some of the existing unintentionally funny (especially with a leading lady Mona Goya, which is absolutely a laugh riot, as double crossed wife). <br /> <br /> But to continue with great care.
