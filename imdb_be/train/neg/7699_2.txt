I was expecting a comedy, like in the movie «Big Mama». Instead, the film was a strange combination of comedy, drama and love story <br /> <br /> This film consists of three parts :. The first involves Madea and her commitment to the pupil. The second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who abuses her. The third involves the relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a father. <br /> <br /> There is actually very little comedy in the film. There are also some very twisted messages in the film. For example, beats Madea's foster child with a belt (in a comedic manner) to persuade the child to correct. The child does, in fact, to turn itself around. Apparently, it pays to hit children. <br /> <br /> There are areas related to child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old ogling young girls that are relevant to them. (The ogling happens to family reunification.) The film jumps from site to site so that you are always off-balance. It's a comedy, a love story or a drama? It is not, in essence, nothing ... except waste of time and money.
