There are bad movies, scary movies even boring movie ... I can watch most and deliver to the end, but not this time. Avoid this like the plague, annoying music around, scared edit or comedy, it tackier than novelty mug ... My wife wanted to watch it thinking that it would be Legally Blonde material or something like watchable, but never better than the average chick flick. Her first time when she begged me to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> The girls, well, they were not great to begin with (Denise done OK in Starship Troopers and Wild things), but you have fallen on the gravel. I feel like a mug spent 30 minutes on this ... Pamela Anderson almost changed after lengthy construction work on her face. <br /> <br /> Please take my advice, if you want to avoid the loss of valuable oxygen and brain cells to talk in full stuffing, which is on the screen.
