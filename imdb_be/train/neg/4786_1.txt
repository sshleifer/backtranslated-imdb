I despise horror movies, it's no secret. No plot, bad acting, and gallons of blood are not the main products of these movie mistakes, and this "cinema" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually run this garbage. (. This particular litter was released directly to video, as I recall) As noted any other film would be a great insult to this other movie, I say this: All films All films Jason phantom, movies of Freddy, Chucky movie, and most from films Michael Myers can be summed up in one word: horrible !!! <br /> <br /> Rating (fantasy III): 0,5 / 10
