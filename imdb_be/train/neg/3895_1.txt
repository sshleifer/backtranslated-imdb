One day, some evil people have made a movie about a guy who got shot into space, ostensibly to go to Saturn, but in fact only some footage of solar flares, and then he gets a nosebleed, and before you know it, he lies in the hospital bandaged head to toe, and then overweight nurse with an ill-fitting uniform comes and gets eaten by a guy who has to melt all over the place, but never seem to lose weight, and then, NASA, or at least one guy at NASA , upset about this and calls the one John Sim Man to hunt him down, but the guy they sent to hunt melting guy should go home and soup first, and its strange shape of his wife forgot crackers, so it can not be crackers, and then he has to go out and look for a guy melting with a Geiger counter, and that does not really work, so it is really only worth following half-eaten corpses, and there is something about the sheriff, and the two clumsy old people in the lemon grove, and women with a meat cleaver, d a commercial plant with aggressive guards, and since I can not tell you how to end but all I can say, Jonathan Demme in it somewhere with some guy with a stupid name Berry Debenning, and if there is any justice in the world of all those associated with this film died a hideous, violent death and could not do more movies and the world he lived in clover - END!
