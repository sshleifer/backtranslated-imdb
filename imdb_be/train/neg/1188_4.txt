Kurosawa really blew it on this one. Every genius refusal is permitted. The concept is good, but the execution is poorly lubricated. <br /> <br /> There is a fantasy air about this movie makes it something of a feature film. Tokyo poverty deserve a fairer and more realistic images. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. Very disappointing movie.
