If you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you will really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter glued to the television when she watches it. As an adult, I can not !! I'm all for sequels .... if they have a decent plot. But it is not up to standard. Please forgive me for the slate that, after the film of small, but if you have to sit through it almost every day when your children who love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter will watch this movie over and over again on the same day, when we let it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my younger entertained.
