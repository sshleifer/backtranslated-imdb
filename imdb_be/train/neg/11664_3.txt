I so wanted to enjoy this movie. He moved very slowly, and was just boring. If it was on TV, he was supposed to last for 15 to 20 minutes can be. What happened to the story? Large throw and the photographer worked on the faulty foundation. If it is loosely based on the life of the director, why did not he get someone to see that the letter itself was "free". Then he sent his turtle step which may have been the source of several people nod off during the film. Music takes off, but for another movie, not this .... for a soap opera saga possible. There were times when the dialogue was not clear when Armin Meuller Stahl said. I was not alone, because I have heard several rolls of who said what to whom. Why Hollywood can not make the best films? This one had a large nugget of history, but just poorly executed.
