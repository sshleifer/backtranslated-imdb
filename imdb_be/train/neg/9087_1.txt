Canadians too polite to boo, but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival theater left muttering that they will vote for this film 0 or 1 on their electoral lists. A prerequisite is that the modern director interprets the 17th century tale of the love of shepherds and shepherdesses, set in the distant past, when the Druids were the spiritual leaders. Working in three epochs provides many opportunities for the introduction of an anachronism, including silly and impractical clothing, and a kind of spiritual ceremonies that include very bad poetry. Fans separated zeal and their strict compliance stupid codes of conduct, which arise from changing and high farcical situation. The movie could be fun, like a piece of Monty Python, which too closely resembles, but Romer effort falls very flat. The audience laughed at the observation aside, but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace. The ending comes all in a hurry, and it's really terrible. This is a trivial and a waste of your movie film takes time.
