Movie Underground Comedy, perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known it would be bad if the box was the phrase "guaranteed to offend" written on it ... which means that the filmmakers are going to focus on the cash you than make you laugh. <br /> <br /> this film amateur jumble of children's skits, bad character, and worse jokes ... from pathetic Bat-Man sketch painfully not funny Arnold Shvollenpecker skit, they're just not funny. Several monasteries that are a little funny and a little far from each other - watch Micheal Clarke Duncan plays a gay virgin, for example. - but even they are too long, and get destroyed because of the absurdity of Vince offer comedy <br /> <br /> Keep The Underground Underground Comedy Movie ... dig!
