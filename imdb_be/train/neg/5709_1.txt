Nick Cage Gates', a treasure hunter (oops, sorry ... a treasure "Protector", whatever that means), which comes from a long line of hunters. One of his ancestors was given the key to the location of a huge treasure that our founding fathers, most, if not all Masons, he decided to hide because they simply do not want to finance their independence all that bad. <br /> <br /> The first key is in the long-lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his team of financiers Ian (Sean Bean), a film Dork Riley (Justin Bartha immortal "Gigli") and a couple of faceless minions, enter the hold of the vessel. They immediately poured tons of powder on the floor, not that it is of great importance in any case. In the end, they find the key (skeleton hovers over it), and it turns out to be a pipe with a record ... on it. Like. Do not ask me to explain. <br /> <br /> This is a mystery, and, despite the fact that his expedition is clearly offended by Sun finding a real treasure, Gates roam aching to him about the importance of the puzzle, in this frozen cargo compartment, while the crew just standing around slack-jawed. I mean, come on. Someone was supposed to be a bit vocal in their frustration comes all the way to the Arctic and uncontrolled nothing interesting to find, but they are just standing there, like Gates is part of his own world, solving the puzzle. <br /> <br /> The following prompt appears on the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates shocked. Different characters provide gratingly apparent exposure (get used to it). All this leads to the waiter they pull a gun on Gates, and the powder goes into the big bang. (Oh, that's why they have shed all the gunpowder! Yeah !!) Jan and his friends make their escape, and Gates and film Dork Riley walk nine miles in sub-zero temperatures to the village of Inuit to stop them. <br /> <br /> In order to stop them, Gates concluded after trying FBI and super archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Gates and Riley have to steal it himself. Riley then said Gates in great detail, why they can not steal the Declaration, because it is so protected by metal and laser eyes and high-tech security blah blah. Gates then tells Riley that it is possible to steal it from a saved number. Riley knows that maintaining numbers, Gates asked? "The place where they make jams and jellies?" I'm not kidding; is the actual line. Bart does not give him a joke, either. So Riley doing all this research on the Library of Congress and archives, and water and wastewater, fercryinoutloud, but does not know that the preservation room. It's pretty much points to the fact that the level of this script is included. <br /> <br /> In order to make the rest of this short, Gates does in fact run from D to I, in a ridiculous run-that could only happen in the film. (I hate the way they paint a computer monitor technology in the cinema -. Full improbable and impractical graphics and fonts) Abigail Chase ends heels for the sake of convenience, and as an obvious "love interest" angle. At one point, three of them on the run from the law, discuss their plans really loud in a clothing store, surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of tips and abduction Gates' father, Jon Voight plays dyspepsia, leads the good guys and the bad guys, so that a huge Indiana Jones fun-house, located near New York City. It is surprising that the builders of the subway did not find this thing. Gates and Gates Senior Lead Ian out on a wild goose chase. Yang believes that they are trapped in a dead-end, and leave them there. However, after they left, Riley asks how they are going to get out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... oh boy ... <br /> <br /> ... pushes a button and the door opens. No, I'm serious. Button, as they might have on the Vacu-flush toilets in an office building. Well, he knew where it was. Anyway, after some additional pen-torsion-rotation, they find this great treasure room (remember, this is all under the Manhattan!), Full historyish variety of gold items. Riley gets put really stupid line. Again. And the FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgive them, arresting Sean Bean, and allows two chemicals results in less marry. <br /> <br /> For any spectator, I think it would be hard to ignore the whole exposition, leaps of logic and stereotypical characters for a long time. Although some of his exposition includes the good lessons of history, are inserted into the conversation at random times. I would like more talk like that in my life.
