Plot, character development and gags in the film are all very weak. Quite a waste of time. Conclusion saving grace must make one feel warm and fuzzy, as if the characters have grown at the expense of their struggle. There have been no such developments to make possible such a warm fuzzy feeling. Gag drug templates and most of the film does not ring true to life. The plot builds what should be the voltage, but the characters are not developed enough to care. Then he rushes to address all outstanding issues in a minute of screen time leaving the audience feeling like they just wasted their time.
