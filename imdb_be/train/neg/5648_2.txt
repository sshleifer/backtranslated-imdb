Boston Legal turned tail and headed for the door of the shed and the second pig slop he created! When this show first aired almost four seasons ago, he was humorous slap in the face of the legal system, which seems to take pride in drawing all the actors. It was interesting, diversified and to some extent reliable. Characters and images were acceptable to the extent in their real scenes. Sexual comments and activities were limited and with a sense of humor. Julie Bowen and was beautiful, as in other series, she has participated, but now pulling the lower depths of the media program of sex and violence. Julie beautiful actress and needs a more stable platform than the "production". Rene Adjurdubois wonderful actor, who has from the days of «Benson» for these products held his own entertainment, always showing a sense of humor and respect the existing production. Captain Kirk "it". Funny and humorous is Candice Bergan and be admired for its continuation in this production, and a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt in his acting abilities, but he must return to its roots XXX, such as «Crash», as it seems that he has a lot of talent and desire in this direction. We ask that this series will be smashed, as it already is, and it's really starting to smell !!!
