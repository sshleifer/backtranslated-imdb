Let me put it another way: the balls. Or, how about Bollo * about. It's really terrible, more awkward than he tries to ridicule. Julia Roberts is an experienced actress, and, as a rule, her work at the highest level. This film is so lacking in direction, even she struggled to look experienced. Usually it is a professional, but I swear that in her eyes, there were signs of confusion and despair. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved this move was the idea of ​​the director (Chris Walken) turning the film into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, this topic has not been explored to its full potential. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta-Jones was made of wood, was Cusack Cusack, and the crystal must adhere to existing ones. Two talented stars of ex-Buffy different experience - Green hopelessly wrong cast, and Balfour underutilized. Well done Julia little to prevent it from the worst movie ever made.
