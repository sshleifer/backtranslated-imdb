Criminally Insane 2 are included in the new DVD Black Wedding Satan / rabid criminals, and it is a good thing, too, because when I saw the film, and I know that is a continuation (especially the fact that just as unclear as it is) I always interesting. I now had my curiosity satisfied and will never look at it again. Most CI2 is not nothing but a "memory" in the CI and Ethel staff slept, recalling pleasant memories, I guess. Thanks to Proposition 13, it is released from Napa State (I wonder if it is, to see the Cramps play while she was there?) And sent to a halfway house, which is headed by a good grandmother, Ethel quickly takes called "Grandma." It's all filmed with a video camera so that the picture and sound are pretty pathetic, and it even included a pair of "rolls". Of course, Ethel does her thing, which should send someone between it and the food, especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of lawlessness and drains her dessert. In addition, you have to wonder about any house, halfway to the killers, who have a big box full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. I guess it's all about "trust" misleading. If you liked or did not like, mad criminal, anyway, there's no reason to look at it, except out of curiosity. I wonder why the creators of this even disturbed. 2 of 10.
