**** NOTE: here be spoilers **** Why do I spend a hastily fleeing, the watch garbage like this? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, bad writing, worse direction, and then we have not even got to the action. <br /> <br /> And, of course, you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. Expert <br /> <br /> The hero fights with stupid, corrupt and incompetent henchmen. One of avalanches, burying all the characters who somehow manage to get out alive, despite going through all sorts of dangers climber. Corrupt partner who has caused all this gets roasted alive together with him winning money. The second avalanche heroically rejected adventurous experiment Renegade expert. Evil helpers in the end turn out to be at the heart, as well. Worried teenager falls into the hands of her stepmother's crust after the rescue of her. Etc, etc, etc, etc, and on it goes. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is little reason to warn for spoilers. You could work the whole story, if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least, I was not too wide of the mark most of the time, waiting to see what will happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we have not yet discussed the actual error. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that even though, as a rule, some redeeming feature, even a bad film. You would be hard to find any of it. I believe that I gave it a 2 out of 10 for some good shots of scenery, but that's all. <br /> <br /> It's been awhile since the movie made me moan, but this one, of course.
