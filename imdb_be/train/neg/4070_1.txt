Draw on Fugly annoying gothic kid out of college in the chute film, throw in a crumb of history and a lot of hardcore action, and you're still not even close to how bad this film. <br /> <br /> Shot bad, bad effects, worse acting. Contrived attempt shocking horror. All I have shown that it becomes a sort of depression to watch. The sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they are just what you want to finish as quickly as possible. The last sex scene is simply a foul, even before she gets to the guy. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people that likes to watch movies that people hate, which is why I picked this up. But for his own sake, to save time and avoid this disgust. It's so bad. I just threw it in the trash.
