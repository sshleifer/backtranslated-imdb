Sheesh! What a terrible movie. Tricky camera work, a scenario with more grain than Kellogg, and act as Hammy, you could open a pig farm with him. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, he does not know what audience seek - we Cornelia Wild - that banal or Wilde? - getting on his soapbox about the dangers of smoking every time someone lights a cigarette, my dear, on the road, and the other inconvenient place we villain, loby, causing it to, um, if you do, "male friend" to do a striptease wearing a bikini. Try to explain that one for children ... <br /> <br /> Throw in too contrived type of story Treasure Island Nazem - Jaws, and the resulting film is so unintentionally funny, it's nice - I do not have to wait in a special DVD release soon, though.
