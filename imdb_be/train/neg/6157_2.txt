Man, this is definitely one of those sleepless nights when I moved channels and came across this bitch movie. For some of the names in the cast, I would expect a much better film. I'm pretty stunned to see Oscar F. Murray Abraham is reduced to such a terrible part. I hope that the money is worth it. And the students, they were talking about fencing as they talked about surviving in war or through a terrible catastrophe. I mean, I fenced, it is a fun sport, but I've never been so intense. The only reason I even watched the whole film because the remote fell under the sofa, and I was too lazy to get it back.
