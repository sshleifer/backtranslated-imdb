Well, I bought the trilogy of zombie Bloodbath thinking that it would be pointless bloody fun. That's what it is, without satisfaction. This film is really meaningless, it lacks any plot or character development, or a storyline. The main problem with this film is to kill and gore. In principle, every murder is exactly the same. Zombies tearing someone apart. Yes, it's good, but you need some spare kills too. I mean, there's really lame, every murder looked exactly the same, taken in the same way. What killed me. I love blood, and blood in this film did nothing for me. It was just boring. No plot, just lame scenes over and over again with another man. I wanted to love this movie too. I love shot on video gore movies ... as a zombie animals. But I could not kid myself. This film has its good points, but none of them in the film. I understand that many of the "zombie", helped with the floods and there was like more than 100 zombies, that's pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped in the world. But overall, this is a terrible movie.
