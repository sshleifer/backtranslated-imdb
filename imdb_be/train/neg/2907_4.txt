Often voted the greatest film ever in China Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film fans on the outside, and to be honest, I do not understand at all. What I saw was one of the most common melodramas conceivable, humbly directed and acted with complete shrew for the main character. Wei Wei (do not laugh), that shrew, a young married woman who had tuberculosis (Yu Shi) together with her husband for the past few years. This is after the Second World War, and they live with her husband's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated house with not a lot of money (was a rich man when they got married). Along comes an old best friend of her husband (Wei Li), who also used to be the boyfriend of his wife when they were teenagers. She considers running away from her husband with that person, while the husband is still very much not paying attention, thinking that he can deal with his little sister, my friend. This setting, and it does not go anywhere you do not expect. I actually saw the remake, directed by director Blue Kite Zhuangzhuang Tian. He runs half an hour longer, and actually kind of dull, too, but at least it was pretty. This classic has quite unbearable.
