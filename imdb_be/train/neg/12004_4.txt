Starting work in the endless three hours and twenty minutes, "Salo-e-IshqÂ» is beautiful but superficial comic soap opera of India, which treats us with six interwoven stories of romantic love (which, at least four tales too much in my estimation). <br /> <br /> film is shot like a cross between a music video and MTV Super Bowl beer ads, the film spread hodgepodge of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy actress, high stepping song and dance numbers, a dream and a fantasy sequence, winking nature of the departure, corny dialogue and a way-over-the-top comic performances - it's pretty much the personnel of things when it comes to events in Bollywood these days. It's tedious chore just trying to keep all the characters straight, as they dance, prance and preen their way through a strange story <br /> <br /> There's a lot for the viewer to feast his eyes here -. Last but not least all drop dead gorgeous women - but you need the patience of Job to get it all the way through it.
