The book is fantastic, this film is not. There's no reason for this film could not be embraced futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, the overall response was released a few years later and has done a good job, even Clockwork Orange released in the 70's did a good job trying to make a futuristic world. In the unfortunate German expressionist colors, black and white frames with screens of view, there is no justification for this approach when the film was made in 1984. The main character in a white collar work writing yet he dresses, how he works with oil and grease in the garage. This movie decides to take a mock-communist approach to set design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel does not necessarily dictate himself a Communist, worship, submissive deputy-cleaner threads. This book seriously has to be adapted in a modern context, this book is relevant today more than ever before. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight annoying, this film seems to have been made to deny the sense of realism and believability if it is exactly what is required to drive a novel message to the viewer.
