I had to watch this movie, because the plot was so blatant, and the film fell short of expectations. In fact, it makes pretty uncomfortable viewing at times. Unlike other films Mayer, sexual antics to a minimum. Some scenes of violence unnecessarily gratuitous and insulting. The plot is chaotic and some of the actions and lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful combination of sado-masochistic fantasy in conjunction with a window of cruelty and immorality of slavery, and not on all counts, It's like trying to fill Meyer sexploitation / blackploitation, having higher moral message. Meyer knows, we feel a little guilty about how to turn on, glaring vamp connotations early scene showing Lady Susan wielding a whip in provocative attire. He then tries to send back to the right path, turning it into a film about the joy of good over evil. However, because they balance each other, you end up with nothing. <br /> <br /> Because it's so bad in so many ways, it's really worth a look if you appreciate the art of making a terrible film in the worst possible taste. Maybe because it was so bad, we just did not get away with unacceptable Meyer.
