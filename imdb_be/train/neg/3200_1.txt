Joe Don Baker ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, plump, sweaty murderous lout in a silly costume cowboy Roy Rogers would have laughed. Somehow, he still has a sign, perhaps, because he lives in Texas, and they will allow nothing to be law enforcement there. <br /> <br /> This is a fat loser deputy sheriff near the Texas border. It is not surprising that he once was a Texas Ranger, but was expelled because he seemed to think that the law was his own personal play with the ball at their own discretion. It includes pictures of the suspects, who across the international border into Mexico, knocking on suspected fraud in the gun battle, threatening to women, since the shooting, which could have been avoided and the management to get a child's life is in jeopardy in the process, allowing women, he promised that he would help and protect kill just so he could get out of prison, etc., etc. This guy makes the LA cops look like a saint in comparison. <br /> <br /> When his partner is killed by a pair of wandering Italian killer character Joe Don hunt them down and kill one of them. He then takes the other to Italy at the request of Mr Wilson, who rightly believes that Joe Don will tighten a great time. In record time, he loses Italian and Maltese taxi driver gets blown up in the process. This is just the first of many deaths and major destruction, Joe Don goes to follow him as he seeks riot through Malta Palermo (Italian killer). <br /> <br /> So begins the MÃ¶bius strip of the film, in which our hero arrest, lectures Maltese police chief comes out and causes more problems, arrest, police chief gets a lecture ... and so on and so forth. As long as you do not want to blow your mind with ivory pistol processed Joe Don and be done with horror. <br /> <br /> Joe Don proves its usefulness not only in Palermo for the first time slips away, but the next boat chase in which he is just one punch. Then he gets to take Palermo after he threatened a woman with a coat hanger. You hope that Palermo will actually get to torture him in a basement chamber he put in, but no-stripper, he threatened to not come and get it, because it promised to protect her. Her throat quickly cuts (big surprise) and Joe Don's Journey Into Night. <br /> <br /> And here's hoping he might have been drowned in (another) boat chase. Even the ocean does not want it, and spit it on the shore, where he fed a poor Maltese family (that they will ever do to deserve this?), He returns to the city where he was arrested by the police, the chief of the lecture police ... arrrgghhh! A female police officer who was escorting him around free him, so that they can go to get Palermo. Why she would do everything as brain dead, to destroy her career, this big slush me. It's just a head scratchily confused. <br /> <br /> They go to the villa, where Palermo hiding and begin to shoot from. Joe Don carefree Chita and kills Palermo. Then he utters the great and dazzling last movie line: "Big one has its own icon, you can go get it for me," Thank you for that immortal line, Mr. Baker This will go down in the annals of film history as the most competent, strange.?. , amazing last line ever uttered by a character in the film. It is, of course, it falls in line with the rest of the nature. Bravo.
