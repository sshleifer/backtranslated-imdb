I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller and Jack Black for the implementation of this movie. It is, in a word, sad. Perhaps that is too predictable, the more than exploited loser role of Ben Stiller or not-at-all funny scenes make this movie just to forget something. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken to finish in a miserable way. I was very disappointed. I like to play Ben Stiller. I loved him in most of his films, the last one I saw before was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and not too bad. About Jack Black ... Well, except for High Fidelity I've never seen him do something good. What about the school of rock? Oops, that's scary.
