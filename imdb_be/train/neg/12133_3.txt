What are they going to do? <br /> <br /> Familiar? <br /> <br /> In the film, it seems that he is trying to be a combination of acting workshop film "indie" and theater. <br /> <br /> This kind of things actors like - it's kind of like a studio or a game, because it mainly consists of a rigid focus on the actors, who are ... acting angry, tense, frightened, talking, treacherous planning - gives the performers a lot of free range really ham it all <br /> <br /> and the trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, a brother, to come up with a great scheme of robbery .. .. and throw a monkey wrench in the works. On top, there is little "wing tongs" and one of the hooks in the branched portion through the rear windshield. <br /> <br /> The cops on the tail and stumble into a bar called the poetic (and leadenly) «Dean's last chance." <br /> <br /> Spacey, as a director, he tries to keep the focus on performance and delivery dialouge actors. He pan to the bright red of passion cigarette advertisement for smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he keeps all the violence behind the scenes, in fact. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on intensity and disgusting scene of violence would give the film some edges. <br /> <br /> The problem of the film is that it is moving too slowly, and suffers from miscasting almost every role. Matt Dillon ( "Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Harry Sinese, think, thoughtful, and thought to be spineless tag- along with these guys and Joe Mantaga effective as the traditional routine of confusion swear rabid dog police lieutenant, and all his fingers, but he did not give anything, to really do here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a mindless grunt who just want to shed blood. <br /> <br /> And the crooks in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they are trying to think of some way out of it. <br /> <br /> Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and save it. Symbols are mainly talking, trying to come up with a plan ... and they quietly and too eloquent. There's even a scene where fraudsters play pool with a swarm of armed cops on the street, ready to strike. At one point, one of the thieves even call the police, who are right at the bar. Oh, brother. Oh bother. <br /> <br /> These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up. If not punched up crooks be a little scary, a little uncomfortable? At the same time, all the real action takes place inside. <br /> <br /> Someone pulls out a pistol, baseball bat, resulting in an ugly confrontation outside of the screen and have another accident that happens ... well, kind of sad. But ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway also has to spend more time with a dialect coach, improving it in New Orleans accent. Ulrich skit well in smaller part. <br /> <br /> Cop listening within for a box of matches in the absolute worst time good view. And the scene when someone goes straight through the rear windshield. <br /> <br /> dialouge is clearly trying to go on the way of David Mamet, and it is unclean, but not so realistic, or insightful. <br /> <br /> The film feels too much of what he really is ... a very low-budget film with the actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from the script that it was "not bad, but needs a few more rewrites. "Spacey shows that it is not a terrible director, but it lacks the kind of feelings for the" formation of a movie, "and he feels that he simply filmed the actors act. <br /> <br /> These actors are all talented and can work with the material, but they feel out of place. As I have already said that the film really suffers from miscasting. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they've found just the right shot, but put them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some roles would help very much. <br /> <br /> Having a veteran actor Joe crowd Mantagna play leader of the pack, Gary Sinese like an angry police lieutenant is on his horn and gave orders to his army to bark, holding Fischter in his "bloodthirsty Goon» part and Matt Dillon in as a sacrificial lamb. It would be a big step forward. <br /> <br /> While some actors are straight, it works. They may even win an Oscar for it. But a lot of time when direct actors, they tend to just focus on the performances. Just shoot the actor acting. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but you need a good showcase for him. A reason for this. <br /> <br /> Hostage situation all pretty much the same in real life as well as a transitional age stories, so it is natural that the films of them will go from point A to point B as well. <br /> <br /> There are a few very large entries in this genre. Sam Spacey has appeared in such films Hostage situation: "The Negotiator» <br /> <br /> Of course, this will not be a cult, not to mention one of the AFI's 100. However, it does have some good moments and personal contacts, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable, and the kind of movie that will play better on a regular TV. It's just not worth going out of your way to see. <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> other directorial credits Spacey, «Beyond The Sea», are reportedly better efforts. Hmm ... Maybe it's true. You have to fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> Dane Youssef
