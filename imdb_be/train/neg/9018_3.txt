This formula B science fiction film, and director made no secret about it. We are talking about the dragon, which is recovered in the life of the research group. All this is done the things you have seen many times. This is a weak script, with no real character. In fact, it is full of stereotypical characters and situations. Directed attacks it, just make it a formula movie, not trying to deceive us, and that gives this film a soft call, but it's not something that you are likely to remember for some time. This is best seen while you are cooking, cleaning, working. Sort mindless fun. It takes place in the field of entertainment, but it is certainly not something that you sit with your friends to see if you're not all just drunk and do not care. 3.2 Evaluation of the masses is probably true. I do not think it is so lousy, like most people, but I am surprised that some people in the postings thought it was exciting. It's really slipping away from me, because I do not see any attempt to even make this a memorable film.
