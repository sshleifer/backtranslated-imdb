Okay, let's get right to the point. We have five last ridge College (must have majored in F word) enters the weekend camping. They work for someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decided to put it on the fire instead. A good group of people. Then some of them started to go sick - must be something in the water in the cabin they were staying in. However, the neighbors seem to be okay. Well, if things start to get really bad, they lock up one of their partner instead of getting help (try the neighbor down the road). Some of the locals did not take a liking to them. They chase each high-speed romp through the woods for miles, until a truck breaks down. Once ten minutes later he appears in the cabin (as he could find it, and how he could move at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another type of brain surgeon in the cabin realizes there is something wrong, so that he is hiding in a cave, to this blow over. He then decides the next day to return to the cabin thinking that it must be some kind of temple. He was giddy with relief that he survived (he must have thought that it is 24 hours a bug). Unfortuneatley he met some officers, not as friendly police. Another couple decided to have sex while meat eating bug works its magic, and after a while she realizes that she needs to shave their legs (taking a lot of the affected skin with shaving cream). In any case, you get the idea. Nothing does not make sense here. It is five people, I would not like to be with friends. I'm rooting for flesh eating bacteria. Other characters were introduced, which were somewhat funny, but it is not nice, as well. Ninety minutes wasted a good life here.
