Well .. it was not the worst film I've ever seen, but I have heard many good things about it, and I was very disappointed. I could see where filmmakers from and what they are trying to express the fact that both sides in this battle was not much different from each other that the people were lost in the fighting, etc., etc. . (Well, that's my guess, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> In any case the movie .. kind of boring to me. I watched a lot of really long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on .. mostly because I just could not bring myself to care for any of the characters. I just kept thinking .. who cares ??? I also found that the cast be dead faster, pan and intense dialogue. I understand that it was the 1800s and all, but most of the calls just seemed quite unnatural. No one seemed to have any emotions for most of the film, except during the melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> «romance" in history, it seems, is not supported by anything except "I'm a guy and you're a girl," I do not think a lot of romance, and yet I felt that at the present time, directing the conviction that these people were in love. Well .. I think that it is all "the whole horror around us, we have each other to cling to" type of thing, or whatever. I'm also hoping for some kind of dynamic between the two best friends (who initially seemed to have interest in women), but it was just kind of dropped out. Maybe avoiding the clichés of a love triangle. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Oh well .. Daniel Holt was almost the only character I really really I loved. And Sue Lee was all right. I do not do not like Jake, but he seemed a little too ... spineless, I think. Jack Bull I did not like at all. And I'm sure that you * have * to hate just about everything else, except for the poor normal people who just get sloping down to the left and to the right. It was pretty graphic and had that intact "horrors of war" things down, but I saw a lot of other films with the same theme, to do better. (I enjoyed many a patriot, for example, even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative), but, as I said, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
