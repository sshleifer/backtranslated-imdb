There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you on the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very bad. Actions awful, deplorable scenario; and the special effects are overrated. <br /> <br /> Why Hollywood to treat its audience with such contempt? And why they made the continuation?
