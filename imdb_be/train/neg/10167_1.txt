This TV movie goes to show that there are bad movies. The only reason I saw that it was covered on KTMA MST3K. This Super Bowl in the Superdome in New Orleans. However, neither in football is not played for better or worse, and we can see that behind the scenes look at basically nothing. With many stars in this film, it does not matter. I really do not know why I watched this.
