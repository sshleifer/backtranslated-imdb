My God, this movie is bad. I was completely misled by my local movie review, because it's not normal garbage. Yes, yes, the good guys wear white, bad guys wear black .... and the good guys always win. Now go home and hug the child, and to feel as well-Hollywood has made you feel. Blech! I can not believe it's dead brain film was made by Wes Craven. I believe that he needs some money to pay the mortgage, so he made this piece of excrement. This kind of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly feel that they could do as well or better than an experienced director. <br /> <br /> I see the bad guy wants a nice girl who loves her daddy do a bad thing wittle il, or it's going to hurt her father. But as Ms. All-American girl next door, we know that it is going to save the day and beat the bad guys ... the end. Girl Power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> Come on now, only an idiot would find it entertaining ... "roller coaster" not to mention something fresh or new. All of this "super-duper" reviews you see on this site are from the industry hacks that either make money from this flick, pay back a favor, or they sold their souls to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful .... yes, it is. Not a very good performance, entirely horrible ... she's just cute. She had to show all much skin to save the movie. It is not tough enough to be a good woman of action of lead. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was at least passable in 28 days. But here he is playing dumb villain pretending to be a smart one. He gets his ass up and down the 5'5 '' McAdams, because in the end, she was a dancer ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure it has all the ribbons Tae Bo .. .so it should be able to hit the crap out international terrorist recruitment. I would not trust him to steal a pack of gum with 7-11. <br /> <br /> I can see that this film has been done before, except that before they did it well. Go re-rent any of the Die Hard films. You are close to the danger of international terrorists, except the characters more cute and believable, and the bad guys are WAY more competent and interesting. I just do not understand how Hollywood can keep doing this crap, as if they did not pay attention to their own models, they can be easily copied. No income countries, the movie is not down. <br /> <br /> Throw your $ 6 to the toilet and save 2:00 your life, you will never get back. <br /> <br /> chao, FreddyShoop
