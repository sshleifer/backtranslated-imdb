If you love the occasional nudity with the junior high school level of slapstick comedy, then look no further. <br /> <br /> From about halfway, beautiful and erotic Dombasle strip starts at every opportunity. This is the only thing that made this film worth watching. <br /> <br /> The history and the lame and ridiculous, corny humor, and character development basically does not exist.
