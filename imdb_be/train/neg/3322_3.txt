Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley film I ever watched was "42nd Street." Then I waited all his things to be so good. I have found that is not always so, even here, with my all time favorite classical era actor James Cagney. <br /> <br /> So, at the end of the musical numbers are just as exciting as ever, but the story, like many others, and quite tedious. They seem to be always associated with a cry, unhappy producers of the show. In this film, it's Cagney, who completed shouting things so often that it gives me a headache after a while, and his character wears thin quickly ....! <br /> <br /> Even the songs are anywhere near "42nd StreetÂ» class songs that you could hum for years and years -. decades, I have to say songs in this film not be remembered. this is one of the few early Cagney movies - movies and Berkeley - I do not like it and was very disappointed, watching.
