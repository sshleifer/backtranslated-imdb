It was more than 80 minutes of the semi-trailer unexpected boredom. Firstly, I was wondering how you can create something like this. Then, reaching 70 minutes, I convince myself that it's just a few more minutes, and I lasted until the very end that I kind of pride, I think watching this film as a big test for the patience and tolerance of human crap. Was it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, give it a try, and if you are strong enough, strong-willed, you can even last until the end ... The film lacks coherence and the characters seem to have nothing in common the meaning of it all. All events in the film, you can be sure that you have seen somewhere before, and they seem to be put in this film just to fill the reel of film.
