Wow. The only people review it positively are apologists Carpenter. I know a lot of these. Guys who will watch John Carpenter squat on celluloid movies and pinch and declare it a masterpiece of horror. This "film" full of shit. It looks and sounds like a porn (good lord, terrible soundtrack ...), and has a sub-par porn action, which is shocking because usually Ron Perlman really good actor. I honestly do not know what Carpenter thinks doing it. Most likely, "beans, beans, beans .." until someone fed him and rolled him up in a blanket in the day ... They say there is nothing to debate about abortion in general, when they could have had a very interesting center theme (as a religious fanatic anti abortion feel if a child of the devil?), but instead they chose to Ron Perlman and his badly behaved children kill a bunch of people and have a terribly cast doctors try to calm hysterical poor pregnant women. Not a single person from this episode or that you should leave whole. It's just awful. As Plan 9 From Outerspace terrible. Like, good god, please, who would turn it off before I soil myself terrible. Try watching this thing on the same day, and your mind will explode.
