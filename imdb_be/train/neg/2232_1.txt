I watched it .... let me rephrase ... suffered because of this, because I'm a fan of Eve. I do not think it's a movie, it will be put on the back of the head shot pictures. I like Gangsta Flix, but it was not even close. The budget can not be more than a few hundred dollars, and that money is probably spent on the caterer. <br /> <br /> The room was interesting, but the first victim died before you will be able to take care of her or not. <br /> <br /> I will not bother saying who did what and how, because it's not worth the effort. I'm just glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that I did not have to actually pay for this rubbish. <br /> <br /> OH !! Before you flame me, I love movies, I thought Lotta Flix were good, some of you are stuck, so for me to suppress it tells you everything you need to know.
