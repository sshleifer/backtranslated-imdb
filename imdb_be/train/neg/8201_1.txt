Snuggle down in your favorite chair and switch to play-station, you throw it in the waste disposal unit. Conduct a useful 90 minutes. to live in their favorite game. Awkward - bad shot - not sent debris. He takes bits of several other "science fiction" films and bad attempts to put the pieces together in a pathetic weak story. There is nothing new, the filmmakers do not seem to understand that the provision of mere entertainment to make money game, but a touch of ingenuity skills and talent it takes to turn it into a good film. Any money spent watching it waste, and personally, I would like my life 90 minutes ago.
