One question: why? First, the room is not funny or engaging at all. They use the taped interview and receive audio with animated animals ITE speaking part. First, the interview is not funny or interesting, to start with, and even if they were, I'm sure they would have been much more interesting to consider how they originally, Sun turned into cartoons. How it add any fun for him? I turned on CBS Monday night sitcom lineup, (which has become the normal way for me to unwind after a hard days Monday) and found this on. Of course, the sitcom lineup will be a repetition in any case, as in the summer, but seeing these episodes again would be more interesting. I tried to give the «CC» chance. I really did. When it started, I figured, well, maybe it would be funny. No. And then he kept going. It was half an hour long. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see, there is a purpose, if the interview were shown in all its fullness, and had issues with them. But no, it was only one line of clips, cut and paste together very quickly. It was like a horrible horrible version of Cartoon Network in the «Robot Chicken». I was not a supporter of CBS »is now canceled sitcom" The Class. "Despite what happened, it was one of a half-line I fight until the end. But when he came to me to solve the whole season, and that three more episodes «Creatures» .... let's just say I would take a "class." Considering it was a couple of hours, as it is in the air, and I came here, to see that I'm the first to comment ... I think that's a good sign that no one was looking, and that it will not last much longer. Cartoon Roadkill.
