Why watch it? There is only one reason, and that it is for the greatness of John Saxon. I like his action. My most favorite performances on his Nightmare on Elm Street 1,3 and 7, as the father of Nancy cops, Black Christmas as a police officer, and from dusk to dawn again, like a cop. When I dug through my local outlet video I stumbled upon the film Zombie Death House, and I quickly threw it back, but before I go, I noticed that John Saxon was not only actor in this film, but the first time I've ever heard of the director. This intrigued me (and cheap $ 9.00 price tag), and I, and I had to have. When I got home, I realized that this film did not live up to other work, even the Saxon his actions, which may have been confused by the added pressure of direction. But it was not only the rest of the cast is also sucked. It seemed as if they were pulled from a recent shoot porn and told the guy now you really must act. The film even looks as porn 80s. I can not in good faith recommend this film for the casual audience, but if you're obsessed fan of the 80s, which is passed through the culture that came from that era, having been born to the end, or a fan of shit films than this one is for. Also, if you dig John Saxon as I am.
