Song title for this film ........... this is the best free spirited ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie back in 1978-79, when I first signed up for a cable. In 1979, the cable is just beginning to become common place in homes. (Or, at least, when it becomes common here in Missouri) <br /> <br /> This may very well be the first movie that I've ever looked at the pay channel, called «The Movie Channel» -., Which He was named «Star Channel» if they changed the name to "The Movie Channel" in the early 1980s ........ I got a free month of "The Star Channel" with my new subscription cable. "Van" was one of the films that was in rotation on the network at the time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie then, and thinking that it was a typical teenager Flick (in the same way as the other budget teens middle click) ... those where the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten that this film did not exist until recently, I have not seen this film once again after not seeing him decades (I found a copy on DVD for sale in the cheap bin) I learned it, and bought it for only $ 4.99. <br /> <br /> I think I remember this movie being much better than it was (is). But watch it if was a different experience than watching now (30+ years). <br /> <br /> It was fun to see a list of the children of rock 'n' roll, smoking pot and having sex in the back of a fancy van (often one and the same time). This is something that should be a good teen movie party. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot, except that the protagonist fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals looks good friend ... he blows his entire college savings money to buy fancy Dodge Van (with shag carpet wall. mirrored ceiling and a layer of water in it) to get her attention, and he finally gets to have sex with her. But his main rival learns and come looking for him (so that the two of them can resolve their differences through Drag Racing their vans) .... he and his main rival eventually wrecking both of their vans, and instead steal away his girlfriend arch rivals, he wins the heart of a neat (less attractive) girl that he is half / ass goes for most of the film, and he decides that he is happier / better, and the film ends. <br /> <br /> the film does have this funny moments. But watch this movie 30+ years later, he became a trip down memory lane. Because I still remember the pizza, pinball arcade, and also brought back memories of cruising around the small town while we were smoking pot, we would yell at a good looking girl and hoping to have sex (sometimes I take away and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we'd screw in the back seat of an epilogue, I remember many of the songs in this move (if they were new) ...... this film serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in this respect ( I brought a lot of memories) <br /> <br /> one things depicted in this film that I really can not remember that .... I never remember a time when the full-size vans have been popular as the film portrays them as. I remember that time very well, and I'm not young people that go around wishing they had a van. Instead, I remember the young people in the 70's (self included) Want Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or hot rod Ford Mustang, but never a van. This film makes it appear as if the vans were the most popular item is going, and that every young person wanted one (which simply was not true of the era)
