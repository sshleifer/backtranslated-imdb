I use IMDb for several years, but never wrote reviews before. However, this film so much that I could not disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) say nothing more. <br /> <br /> The noise of the history of New York (Tim Robbins) who is so outraged noisy that it takes on an alter ego, as in the vigilance, "Rectifier" and vandalizes any car he finds a car-alarm sound. <br /> <br /> I take the name of the movie to be something wrong. Although there are one or two copies of the other sources of noise are solved or have already mentioned, the only true focus of our protagonist car alarm. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There really is no other focus. If the movie is trying to link other examples of noise pollution car alarm problems, it seems, simply cast to give credit to the actions of the characters Robbins. <br /> <br /> Yes, we have all the noise is annoying. No one likes the sound of a car alarm. Of course, we all have that inner desire to take a baseball bat screaming car, and this film makes use of the fact, and to a large extent, that only the fact to sell this movie. I say "almost" because there are obviously far-fetched sexual relationships (including a completely unnecessary Trinity), which obviously added to those moviegoers who need such things thrown in, to enjoy a movie. Frankly, it's rolling eyes. <br /> <br /> character Robbin, very soon in the movie, it becomes quite unrelatable. It seems less that he decided not to put up with the noise more and more, that by focusing so much noise that he began to lose his sanity. The first half of the film is essentially the story of how he transformed from a malignant, car scrapes the guy in the little man's hero, rectifier. However ... the transformation occurs. He simply renames itself. <br /> <br /> I could go on for some time. Madden generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the film, and a smug grin that never leaves a person completely Robbins does not help. <br /> <br /> In general, I believe that it is quite obvious that this film tries to be as it is largely pushed down his throat, but, in my opinion, it is not in a big way. Just the opinion of one guy, cheers.
