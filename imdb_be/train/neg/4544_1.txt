This film is simply not worth your time. Its dependence on the New Age mysticism serve as a single semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been recycled countless times. <br /> <br /> I just offered even take the time to put in the comments when I noticed that some of them were trying to prop up the reputation of this nonsense. Their motivation and objectivity is questionable, since they encourage you not to look at the faults of films, but his good intentions messages New Age consciousness. <br /> <br /> So it would be good for some twenty to thirty evangelical Christians, or Islamic fundamentalists infuse positive reviews about the movie / television support their views? Despite the poor quality of the product, or lack of truth in any of its alleged historical basis? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I believe that followers come for me to say colorful things about this film, in spite of the truth.
