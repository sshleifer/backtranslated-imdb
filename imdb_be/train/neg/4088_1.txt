It was a milestone in my movie watching life. I went to see it in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put money in and who is obliged to whom grace - a very, very big favor. The special effects are absolutely first quality, as with any first-grader could do it. Toy rubber bats on line without any attempt to hide the lines, arrows, which are to be drawn on the film and see that the shape of the arrow, you will find a sign on the street, and funny storyline. Ed Wood make a masterpiece compared to the «Conquest». Each student film should see this thing just so they will know the definition of a bad movie.
