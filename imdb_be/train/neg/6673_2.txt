My first clue about how bad it will be when the video was the case said that it is from the people who brought us The Blair Witch Project, which was a masterpiece compared to this piece of garbage. The action was on hummingbirds 6 production mark of Oklahoma and the plot, such as it was, predictably, a sad and senseless. 85% of the four-letter word script and countless variations on them. Mother F, it seems, in the "writer" favorite, because it is constantly in use. It should be taken every 10 minutes to write this script in a dive in the last call. Thank God, I rented it, and can jump through most of it on fast forward. Do not waste your time and money with this.
