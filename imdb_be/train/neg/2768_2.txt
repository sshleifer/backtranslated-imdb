This movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> They do not develop any of the characters at all, and the story was played terrible. It was some sleepers. You would expect the scene to the film as it will be his strengths, but D-Wars surprises even fully supplied in this department. <br /> <br /> In addition, the action was just a step above the level of the low-budget porn film. And I'm serious. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the final credits for it because it was just so bad !!! Please, whatever you do, people do not waste their time and money on a bad movie, like D-Wars.
