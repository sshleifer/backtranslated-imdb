Deathstalker manages John Watson and stars Rick Hill, which is his native body builder and you know that when I understood correctly? The plot follows how Deathstalker (Hill) is trying to get something from his evil host, and he has to go to Mr. Cave. He meets a lot of dwarfs and monsters during his travels, and settings are very close to Tolkien, and of course, Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip off huge success of Conan, and despite the fact that it is a very silly movie, he has a lot of advantages of good trash and garbage is recommended for supporters and tolerant movie addicts! <br /> <br /> There are many kinematograficheskoga merit in this film. A pair of scenes almost atmospheric and exciting, but that Deathstalker concentrates to show naked women and are huge muscles Hill. Women are usually the victims are helpless and very foolish, too, so it's a very courageous film, and therefore, can not please many feminists! The fight scene is nothing special and pretty boring, and the monsters entirely or anything special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done, but what you expect from a low-budget efforts like this? It tries to be as great as Conan, but not too badly. As I said, it may please movie buffs turkey, but no one else. It belongs to the category is so bad, it's great! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker not even as close as bad as it could be, and as turkey film, I appreciate it nearly as much as the other turkeys, nice of them of course! If bad films is your cup of tea, try it and have fun, but if you do not understand "nice bad movies," then stay away. And if someone can not be a large amount of nudity, then stay away as well. There is a more nudity here than violence, and because of these scenes, the film is rated R. otherwise, it may be some kind of safe family PG movie! <br /> <br /> 4/10
