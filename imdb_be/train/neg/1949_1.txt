The animation looks like it was made for 30 seconds, and more like a caricature, not characters. I was a supporter of Scooby-Doo since the series premiered in 1969. I do not think much of the Scooby Doo animated movies (I'm talking about the show, but not full-length movies.) But some of them were pretty cool, and I, like most people found Scrappy Doo be annoying, but this series is pure garbage. As soon as I saw the animation and hear the characters (and I use that term loosely) to say, I cringed. In addition, Mystery Inc., was a team without the whole crew complement each other, it just seems like opening a box of chocolates to find someone has already eaten the best of them, and the only thing that remains are those that no one He wants What's new Scooby Doo was better than that. If you are going to have a number of Scooby Doo TV, include elements that made the series stand for so long. The entire cast of characters, and the quality of the animation. They should put this back under the rock from whence he came.
