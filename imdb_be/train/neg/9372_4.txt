This is a typical late Universal Horror film: it is technically competent state, if by numbers, with cookies cutting portions and some serious replay. The most interesting part of this movie is its stunt casting Rondo Hatton, people with bone disease as the film "Monster." Its sad to see that this man operates, but it probably made good use of the money they paid him. Hatton is less terrifying than the studio had hoped, as I often had compassion over fear or even disgust. Martin Koslack on board like crazy film artist, and he is very funny in this part. I for one good to see Koslack in anything; for some reason, the man amuses me. Just another part of the film that entertains me absurd to take the film to the art world. It shows the evil art that dig their ability to destroy an artist; it side by side with the male "hero" of the film, which is an "artist" who paints ... get this ... pin up girls. Once the work of our hero considered side by side with the absurd sculpture in Villan. Also amusing main bad film critic, who in one place says that he despises stabbing arts hero, because "women like that does not exist", to which our heroine meets with confidence that criticism simply does not get out enough, finally, there is little story about heroin (which is itself an art critic) domestication leading man .... totally antifeminism and funny to watch. Overall, this film is pretty mediocre picture with few fun elements.
