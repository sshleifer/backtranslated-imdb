Tim Meadows was the first acting role in the film? nature lion, enough, but soon after that sexual jokes and humor too stupid to listen more funny. Some movies can get away with sexual jokes, and to found the audience to know that right, if the advertisement is going on. some films that make this American Pie and a scary movie. scary movie was stupid, and American Pie had to do without the sexual jokes. the only role, besides Levon, he had a sense of humor, who rode was Will Ferrell. the character really was dumb, and it was all dumb humor all that look at me. movie was ok, and nothing else. I really do not understand why SNL people who are dying to leave the show always get a film based on the character they played on the show. parody last about 5 minutes, and if they can make a film with a 5-minute parody, that the world is heading? Molly Shannon was a superstar, Cheri o'terri was a terrible movie, but it was not the leading role, and will be an elf. but it was good, but he's some dumb movie, but I can not remember, and Mike Myers with the world of Wayne. how mad television crew always get a sun deal to the movies? only saw one guy to break through, but only 2 as movies and TV shows with Andy Dick. but this guy is supposed to comedy for his life to continue, funny or not. this movie is not very good, but had some positive humor. that films and waste people's money.
