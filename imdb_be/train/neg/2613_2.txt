This is a continuation carefully uneven, inconsistent and incomprehensible in the "plot" (if indeed there is one), and trying too damn hard to be modern (funny, since the period and nature of the 21-th song in the style of a century dominated) and sweet (yawn: there are too many made, enough jokes with animals.) actors in his film are secondary to the Juvenile section. Even Glenn Close (and it is usually very good) sweeps through the film, a parody of itself as the original De Ville and tip Sunset Boulevard! This is a film that does not even look nice. This is a very good example of bad and senseless continuation. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, characterization, and an acceptable action. It does not. This is bad.
