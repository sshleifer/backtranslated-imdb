Note: I will open a key part of the story, but if you looked at the DVD cover or any promotional material, you already know it <br /> <br /> This film seems to have been written. Eleven-year-old, who is not very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between the chemical and the body. <br /> <br /> Forget about the UN and the NSA seems to be running the show in Hungary. Forget about the fact that, if the master scouts chasing someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute, they do not wear protective clothing (not gloves). These quibbles in the context of the film. In the scientific world in this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes sideways. <br /> <br /> The fact that people in this film is not (with some exceptions), behave, how people behave. Almost every time a character reacts to what is ridiculous. Love story (of course, there is one) makes the soap opera scripts seem like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can not believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing.
