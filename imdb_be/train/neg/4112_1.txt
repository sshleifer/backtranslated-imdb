I think if they made any money making a complete turd bomb, like this one. I need to get into the film industry. I wiped my ass on a piece of toilet paper and did the best script once. Look, if the guy running through the tunnel, they used the same 30-foot tunnel again and again and again, and never even changed the location of a fool hanging light. <br /> <br /> I think if I get THRILL meeting with the director of this movie jewel, I think I'll pick a fight with him and start him on his loafers deficating <br /> <br /> I think We should be sick now
