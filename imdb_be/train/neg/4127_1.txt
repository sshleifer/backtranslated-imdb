The film is as bad as it should be removed from all stores worldwide. So a lot of boring, dull, lacking representation of the characters and the main character with a dry irritating attitude and voice constantly give thoughtless voice on every action and feeling, this film holds the record for the most difficult film I've ever watched. I paid money to enjoy, I felt the obligation to see it through, and I regret it. My head ached all over because of the awful boring characters and their senseless plot less life. A bunch of kids who have zero knowledge about anything, are all frigid, and worst of all, have a terrible dialogue around, just mulling around the main character is trying to get a date with a girl. Sad, yes, my friend was shaking from hatred, and I was red from embarrassment, I ejected Â£ 6. The DVD was on eBay the next day, and I did not make much of their money back. Avoid like the plague.
