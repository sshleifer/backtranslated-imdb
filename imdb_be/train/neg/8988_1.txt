So far, the worst film I've ever seen was Ben and Arthur. You really should check out the reviews on this film instead. Statistics for the inspection of this film was distorted positive through relentless and unscrupulous press some of the people involved in the creation of this proof, which is quite easy to find on the Internet. At least, the people who made Ben & Arthur were sufficiently honorable, that it stand on its shaky legs and shamelessly promote his so-suckers, I would buy it. <br /> <br /> All of this film terrible, the script, the story, casting, acting, direction, photography, editing, music ... what else is in the movie? In any case, here it is as bad as it gets. If it was not so funny it would be unpleasant. I kept watching it to think that it should be better, because I have not found that none of the positive reviews for it are not reliable. <br /> <br /> It does not take a lot of money to make a great movie, and not low budget means the film should be bad. My favorite example of a shoestring-budget masterpiece Gus Van Sant's strange Mala Noche, but there are many others. Incidental secrets ?? Uncut or original ?? bad, not because the people who made it had no money, but because they had a huge ego and talent in general is nothing but self-promotion.
