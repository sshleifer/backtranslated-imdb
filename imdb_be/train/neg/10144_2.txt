Steven Seagal movies go this is one of the lower trunk. It's better just fodder for bored teenagers. This is one tips the scales, and then falls. Symbols of the entire board. History double inaccurate. I can not spoil it by telling you the ending. You already know how all the movies of Steven Seagal end, if you've seen one. Here it goes. He is a super-dooper government agent, who knows too much to let go so they decided instead to kill him, doping his brain until he can not remember squat. He runs away, of course, is arrested, and his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back the stealth aircraft, which has been referred to the terrorist gang in Afghanastan rogue pilot of the Air Force, which, surprise, surprise, Segal I trained. All the characters, except for the character of Segal and his dull friend, to die heroically, and Steve-Baby to save the world in one fell swoop or swelling foop. Anything. Made with some surplus Air Force and Navy volatile film. And a lot of boom-booms. Get some Popeye cartoons instead.
