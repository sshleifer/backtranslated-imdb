With all the excessive violence in this film, it may have been an NC-17. But the blood may have been rated PG-13 and there was a lot of swearing when my mother was the original bad ass hairdewed boyfriend. There were a lot of character development that made the movie better look after the child back to life, like a scarecrow, was meaningless hour and ten minutes, he kills people. Violence was too excessive, and I think that Bodycount was higher than twelve, which is a lot of movies like this. Almost every character in the film killed or get their head cut off, and a teacher who called him a "white trash" and "bully" (although the character of Lester nothing but a bully, not even close, I know I am part of hoods and hood, they do not draw in the classroom, they sit there and throw things at the teacher). Teacher deserves a more terrible death than any of the characters, but only stabbed in the back. There were two Tense scenes in the film, but not long enough to be scary at all. As I said, that the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the storyline to get their heads chopped off. If the blood was really interesting to see, it would be NC-17. Two children describe the body they found in the fields, they describe it as a lot gorier, than it really was, they explained to the police that there were maggots crawling in the intestines of children. His stomach was not even cut so that there was no way larvae was not in his stomach, although I would have liked to see. The action was pathetic characters were losers, and the scarecrow can do a lot of tricks gymnastix. I offer to rent this movie for scenes of death, I will not see him again soon, but I enjoyed excessive violence. Also, do not bother with the sequel, I watched five minutes of it and was bored to death, it sounds good, but it is not. The original stuffed actually kept me interested.
