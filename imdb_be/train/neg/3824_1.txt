I feel that the film does not portray Smith historically. The aim of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be "comfortable" to the leaders of the LDS Church, historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The film was conceived as a "faith promoting" experience is not a balanced view of Smith, "as a man." I took the liberty to examine Smith's life and read the two LDS LDS works and no runs. The film, like most of the LDS project was filmed beautifully and well acted. However, this is not a realistic portrayal of a Mormon started or relatively short life of Smith. <br /> <br /> A considerable period of time was given to reproducing the accident that Smith, when he was seven. Although this event was no doubt, it is important in the formation of his outlook, apparently, the main reason for its inclusion in the film, to help establish a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another thing is drawing teen years, Smith's film is silent about the involvement of the Smith family in the magical practices during the 1820s. Another problem is that while the film shows Joseph Smith gently entering a wrestling competition, it does not show, he sometimes lost his temper and became rigid. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. This film was not historic in any way and should be considered as a fictional film about a man. I would not recommend to see this movie for any other purpose of entertainment.
