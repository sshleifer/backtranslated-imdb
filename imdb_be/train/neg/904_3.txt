«Stella», starring Bette Midler in the lead role, it is shamelessly sentimental. Located in upstate New York, Stella Claire works at night as a bar maid, pouring and dancing in the cabin of the working person. One night, in a slum comes the medical intern, Stephen Dallas, who woos Stella, and in the course of their business nourishes it. It rejects both his proposal of marriage and abortion, sends him packing to the lucrative medical career, and raises herself to her daughter in the near poverty. Flash forward 16 years and daughter has turned into a beautiful, loving, young lady. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, preserving the fragile, but a caring relationship with his daughter and ?? .. I'm clumsy, and even worse, that makes the film sound more interesting. Actions and the writers are so over-the-top, you released a groan almost every scene. The main culprit is Bette Midler, but close behind is John Goodman as her alcoholic boyfriend. Each scene seems more far-fetched than the previous one, until the final, which is really the horn. Taken as a dramatic part, this film does not rate a class D, but the camp, he unintentionally kills B +. <br /> <br />
