I saw some bad things in my time. Half dead cow tries to come up with a waist high dirt; head on collision of two cars; thousands of smashing plates on the kitchen floor; people who live like animals. <br /> <br /> But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as the Cat in the Hat. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse Vllad Tepes, worse than the people who put the kitten in a microwave oven. <br /> <br /> this is the most disturbing movie ever made, it is easy. <br /> <br /> I used to think it was a joke, some complicated joke, and Mike Myers may be high sniffing cocaine drug addict confusing rates, which lost a bet or something. <br /> <br /> I shudder
