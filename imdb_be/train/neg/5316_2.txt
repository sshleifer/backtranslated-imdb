Throw this lame dog a bone. Soooo bad ... you can look in any case. Kol (Ross Hagen) is intergalactic bad guy who escapes being vaporized through more careful spacecraft commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). If you managed to steal the boat, crash land on Earth. Runaway android assassin sent to bring back the villain alive or dead. John Phillip Law plays a forest / park rangers, which calls for caution in dealing with the two visitors from far, far away. The costumes are outrageous and the script lacks intelligence. Vincent, of course, took the money and ran. The law specifies only sign effort.So bad it's almost funny. Also starring: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
