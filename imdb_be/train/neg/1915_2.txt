This is a very good shot, but the film is far from the mercy of the original Italian comedy «Deal on Madonna Street Big" Everyone is looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original source. William Mays could be one of our greatest actors, but then he put little use. And his role originally played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I'm kind of sorry for him trying to fill these shoes. I might as well try to imitate Bogart and the young De Niro. art direction and richly textured, but brings nothing to the story, the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and that they take skipped. Even the beginning, as they do seem oddly gratuitous and takes away from the wonder of the original. Sam Rockwell is a strange and good-natured charm and Luis Guzmán has some amazing charm, but the love story of the movie just seems awkward and flat. It's too bad no one knew how to make this film as well as it was first made, but again, it's too bad that we live in a culture where we feel that we need to alter strange things instead of just learning to savor originals.
