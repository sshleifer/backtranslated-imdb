I made this film thinking that it was a sad sob 1959 version, which I saw as a child. It was not. So I was very disappointed with what I felt was a marginal activities, poor character development, and above all, the inability to identify the relationship between a boy and his dog. In this version ... "Dog of Flanders" is just a nice "away" in the movie. Get the version of 1959!
