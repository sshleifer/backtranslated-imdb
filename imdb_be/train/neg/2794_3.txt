Well, because I'm a musician, I thought, maybe I will not check this movie on TMC, nothing good on. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and it's only half the story. I seriously thought it was one of those soft-core movies with lousy shitty plot and action, bad shots and bad effects. But no, I did not even get a kick out of it. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping for maybe some laugh, but I was not sure if they had tried to quit in a single-line or not. But now I must sit here and watch the rest only until it starts Pulp Fiction. Or maybe something better. And now I get to sit here typing until I 10 lines
