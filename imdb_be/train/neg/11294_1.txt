Well, I was a big fan of the Black for a long time and was disgusted after watching this movie. We say that the problem ... First of all, this film has much of the same team, that the first two were. He was also named a prequel to the original Black Stallion. Why is it that they can not get Shetan platinum name if the color is correct ?? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learn Sagr chestnut mother was Black, and in this film it is a gray mare named Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it's set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could be wrong, but the first was installed in 1940, and when the ship wrecks. Timeline does not sound quite right to me. In addition, as a goof, has Frisian at the beginning of the film, which is to be a father in Shetan ... upon further notice she seems to be a horse. Ben Ishaak single character, which remains even to make this film, apparently, due to the previous two in any case. Maybe a nice family movie for some, but this is my biggest film of the year disappointed.
