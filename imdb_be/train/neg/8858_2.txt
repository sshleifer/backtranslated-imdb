Ben out of the city police is convinced that his sister was brutally murdered and wants her killers to justice, but he approached Stephen, who believes that his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, the best friend of his sister and Stefan go to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly horrible stuff the B-Class, and I wondered how he even got released. This makes the original "Oh," looks like a masterpiece. Christopher Lee thinks, how it should be its worst figure I saw. <br /> <br /> There was a lot wrong with this real cheap ass film, ranging from really unnatural and wooden performances by Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (or have forgotten), cheesy fashion (those sunnies ), cheap and lame special effects, poor use of lighting, humor ... if there was any bad 80s music (with some of the film only with a focus on some unknown band playing), having an orgy werewolf, who ' is the vision to see and tedious story flat and irritable dialogue. I thought that if it was so bad it was would be very funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> positives location and parameters of the film looked great, but that's about it ... In fact, I'll add Sybil Danning short stripping scene too. <br /> <br /> During the end credits the band plays their shit-house song during installation surprising scenes from the movie, which I question why Manu? <br /> <br /> terrible mess piece, but at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1.5
