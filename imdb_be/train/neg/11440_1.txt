Otherwise, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen - and I mean ever. My wife and I were both bored out of our minds for 10 minutes. Not to mention boring, it's absolutely incredible. Women (not lesbian) did not wash together - they are not "accidentally" kiss. Brothers and sisters do not live together well into their 30s and run swing together and participate in footraces in Central Park. Men do not think my wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with his wife said. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham, perhaps the worst actress in the movies today. She smiles when she needs to cry, and vice versa. The only film she's never been good at this Boogie Nights - and that's because it does not work <br /> <br /> I can not stress how bad this movie was ..
