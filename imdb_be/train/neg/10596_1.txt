Van Damme. What else can I say? Goldberg. We will continue. Now we know that this film is really awful. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of the film on the TBS, knowing that it would be bad. But even I did not think it would be so bad. The plot is terrible, Van Damme is aging (in the end), but unlike Arnold, his films as well. <br /> <br /> Forget the movie. If you do not see it. Ever. I would not pay to see this movie <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars. - at its heart is a wonderful, action-packed thrill ride <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not. But marketers would be sure we think so, right? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
