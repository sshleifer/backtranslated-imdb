As a casual listener to the Rolling Stones, I thought it might be interesting. Not so, as this film is very "his age" in the 1960s. For me (someone born in 1980), it looks to me like a hippie purists propaganda crap, but I'm sure that this movie was not made for me, but the people who were active during the Th '60s. I expect that the drugs in the wealth hectare stones, I was disappointed that actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much so that I felt as if I was working with them to get to the conclusion that God terrible movie. I have not seen any of the directors of the other films, but I suspect that they follow a similar style of directing, a kind of «amatuerish», which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash, poorly directed, tackily put together, and lacking in real entertainment value. My only good opinion that I did not spend money on it, it came free with the paper on Sunday.
