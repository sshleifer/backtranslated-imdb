When I first saw this movie in a movie 11 years ago, I loved it. I still believe that the leadership and excellent cinematography, the music. But this is actually a script that has over time started to bother me more and more. I think Emma Thompson literacy self-centered and changed the original book; she declined to Marianne side character, the second violin it is too old, too heavy Eleanor - she was in the movie is given a lot of kind of "focal points", and often they appear to be there just to show Thompson herself. <br /> <br /> I know it by cutting a few characters from the book, but leaving a scene where Willoughby in the book is repaid? For someone who ReD and treasured book long before the movie, those things are always difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She did not give the best script in the world to work with, but she still pulls it off gracefully, without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, a bit old maybe, but he plays the role beautifully. And Spriggs, it is absolutely fantastic, as always.
