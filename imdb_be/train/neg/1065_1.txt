Based on the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this film. I really apologize to them - all 4 of us hated him, and spent the whole time looking at his watch while waiting for the film to finally end. Half vignette whimsical, with very little entertainment value. There were a few scenes from Paris - for example, I'm looking forward to see some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I could not recognize anything. Most of the scenes were in the bar. No one at the theater not laughing at anything or react in any way. If you like strange, bizarre, pseudo-intellectual movies, do not miss it. If you are down to earth, like me, you'll be sorry that you saw.
