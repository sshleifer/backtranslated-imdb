Where to start. The film started out as something that seemed like a rip-off of «Darkness Falls». Old, disfigured woman who lives in the woods, giving gifts to children for their teeth. Sounds familiar? Then it changes. In «Darkness Falls», the tooth fairy only kill you if you saw her. Tooth Fairy in this film did not kill you no matter what. Why do they need a rocker, his girlfriend hippie or Bubbas and sister? I think the film would have been fine without them. It seems that the producers were and decided that they need to put more people in the film simply because the tooth fairy will have people to kill. Although, it is a pleasure to see a pretty blonde sun painted bubble head to change. Good for rent, but I would not recommend buying it.
