Anita and I think a little more than an excuse for NLS Meyer, author of the novel and script to ventilate her prejudice, resentment and general antipathy towards the British. Indian general feeling of superiority over England in this film is a foul. <br /> <br /> English people in this film is shown as being overweight, strong, swears, messy, involving neglect, stupid, uneducated racist, ugly, have a poor diet, and the near - revealing only referring to the Indian culture can local priest to be "redeemed" in the film's end <br /> <br /> in contrast to this. Indian family is beautiful, intelligent, educated and can speak many languages, which are caring and loving parents and grammar school fodder. The film is so insidiously that detrimental'm surprised the BBC is funded by all. If it were otherwise, an English family in Indian society reflected in such a way, the film would be seen as racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments where my eyebrows shot up so far to my forehead, I thought that dwell in my hairline. Firstly, the gossip scene between women at a party Divo - undertext: British dirty and chaotic - and men - undertext: British women are prostitutes. Secondly, the food is with Anita, where the family lie to her about Neema cutlery - undertext: the English are so stupid, you can make them do anything <br /> <br /> But the basic contempt for everything English - even the English. Weddings are an object of scorn - obviously, all the way through the movie. Anita character was developed so badly - almost fallen woman trail - I finished the film a sense of angry <br /> <br /> It's not "Bend It Like Beckham", where the humor focuses on love. exaggeration of behavior and customs of the community from someone in this community, and it is a film about two girls from different backgrounds come together. Instead, Anita, and it seems to me to pass on that form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, as the Indian version of the British almost untouchable, and this is emphasized by a series of thinly-veiled attacks on the film "other" of the community in English. <br /> <br /> I felt Anita and I hate, resentment on the basis of a piece of work. On this basis, BBC did not finance the production.
