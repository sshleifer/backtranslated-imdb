This one probably will not fit in the bottom of the barrel mediocre slasher films, but it's certainly a hell of a bad movie. <br /> <br /> rest room pretended interesting, but after the first scenes of the film shows that the poor production values ​​and a stupid plot. I mean, a sub-genre was at that moment all of the invisible maniac fray teenagers for no apparent reasons, but this one took it too far. There is absolutely no consistency in the events or add anything. <br /> <br /> stamps more boring gore is minimal, as well as in secret. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly unremarkable record slasher that should not be blown out of proportion, even if it has a video nastie labels. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed with this overpriced piece of junk.
