This film is a total dog. I found that annoying, to find something to laugh just so I would not feel like I completely wasted my money - and my time. Drawing up in this movie is absolutely horrible. It's a shame, is not to the standards of other Hale Grozovo films. <br /> <br /> They have to save money for a D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, and do not spend money by working the script until he was right. Even Gary Coleman has not been properly used to its role <br /> <br /> This film leaves you wondering what the majority of the plot point was. - including the story. After watching this film, I left the impression that the manufacturers were hoping to grab some Napoleon Dynamite-like humor where it is not so many lines as the nature and delivery. Unfortunately, this movie is not able to deliver the lines, symbols, delivery and humor. I had to go to the dentist, as well!
