This film never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. At this time, I have to listen to critics and went on it. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent line of the Screen Actors Guild was very disappointing. Now I understand why he went straight to video. <br /> <br /> I thought that with Bloom, Ledger, Rush, and it may have some value. All done an excellent job in the past. <br /> <br /> The film was not a low-speed and never pulled me. I have not been able to develop a lot of empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast forward to get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you think about it for lease only "eye candy." This does not satisfy even this.
