Wait, do not tell me ... they threw the film and kept with doubles. You know, this movie could be filmed in a back alley in New York. "Gangster BangsterÂ» I think. Gangster Rap, designer of gangster anther clothing, including a scarf, which is some way moved from the neck to protect it from dust storms in the head. I believe that it was to protect the head from heat filtering through hats K-Mart. "Budget rental horse" seems to have put a horse. One bedroom scene where the girl and the guy was talking bad-mouthing her words .... I though it was talking to him. You know, watching this film as proof that it's not about acting more ... about his appearance, and it is about money. Perhaps there was too much of that which concerns the film. Well, in the end, I think that this film will go down as the worst film constantly ever made. Just one more thing, though, where he was Ice T? Maybe he finally go on Oprah?
