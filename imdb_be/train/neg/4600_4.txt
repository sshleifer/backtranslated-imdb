I read all the reviews here about how this is such a good movie. Jeez, this film was predictable and rather boring. Action was below average in most cases, especially McKenna. I have not seen more than a failed attempt to make someone a "bully" in the movie. About people, this movie was a disappointment. I also read somewhere it could be a cult. I know that there are followers of the director, but the film was just the middle part of the film. <br /> <br /> The script was lame, for the most part acting was lame, the movie was lame. <, Br /> <br /> Yes, and I pray for the guy who used to be welcomed. It looks very bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this film, probably the guy in the office space, and it was only in the film for 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
