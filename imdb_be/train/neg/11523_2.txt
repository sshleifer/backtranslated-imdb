"Igor and Crazy" is completely inappropriate and clumsy attempt at a horror movie with the crazy hippie cult-spree killings. Apparently, almost twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspired by overenthusiastic but incompetent thrash filmmakers. This is a typical Troma production, that is, in other words, there is a lot of boring and totally irrelevant indent footage to accompany a meaningless story. There's a bit of a random baked blood and gratuitous nudity on the screen ?? which is not bad ?? but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes unpleasant to watch. "Igor and Crazy" is so horrible that he even uses a lot of the footage twice, like a circle saw the murder, for example. Incoherent story tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by drug addicts and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of the lower ranked Paul's disciples, named Igor, it becomes a little too obsessed with biblical stories and orgy of drugs and gradually leads to the whole cult down further in the criminal madness. Just to illustrate through a small example of how crazy Igor: it breaks the heart right out of his chest really sexy black Hitchhiker girl! There is annoying synth soundtrack and some really strikingly lame pseudo-artistic techniques the camera as shots slow and gloomy dream sequences. Maybe there is one sequence that is more or less qualifies as costs for garbage fanatics and that "when the poor girl was cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera keeps hitting the blade in the bloody stomach for a full fifteen seconds.
