At the end of the film, I just said to myself, "this is the worst movie I have ever seen, or is it worse film I have ever seen?". And the answer ... In fact, after he saw the film and thought little about the meaning of it, you just can not find any sense, and you can only remember two scenes of violence that are incredibly stiff and useless. It seems to me as if the director tried to push the issue in the heads of the crowd, "that such crimes in comparison with the horrors of war and destruction" because I noticed that two horrific scenes, where directly related to the war, and a horror (at the time of the first scene you can here the girl that rape scream at the same time you hear one of the speeches of President Bush on the need to start a war with Iraq, and in the second stage, the picture of the three criminals who stick sword of women who directly follows archival photos world war II. However, as a matter of fact, I really could not think about the relative severity of theses two different expressions of human horror being done I was too shocked by what I had just seen and felt. (sorry for bad english)
