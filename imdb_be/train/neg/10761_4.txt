This movie was a mess. It was the worst editing I've ever seen. It was almost like the end of the scene the author wanted to go in a commercial, and the director added a second of black screen, to fulfill the dream of writers. <br /> <br /> Under the direction and editing of dirty, there was a glimmer of something good. Good idea, exciting spark. But somewhere something went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story of quasi-psychic priest who tries to solve the murders line. First, it is difficult to bite Richard Creek as a priest. Well part does not require that he was a good priest, and he manages quite well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper, like crazy bad guy. He is always playing crazy bad guy. Very ho hum. <br /> <br /> Oh, the thought occurred to me that maybe all nervous, terrible assembly and separate the land trying to add a sense of confusion in nature (Creek) experienced. And to prove that she managed they rolled backwords loans. Nya good sign for any film. <br /> <br />
