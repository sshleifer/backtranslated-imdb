It's in the early 80's. There's also a group of suspicious-looking older teens. And there's a maniac around annoying. Yes, it slasherville. <br /> <br /> This film is called pranks. Why is it called a prank? I do not have a clue. If your idea of ​​a joke is not a big time hit someone with a baseball bat lunch - on balance, not a big prank; in fact, if truth be told, quite rubbish pranks. But there you go. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to a group of teenagers who are tasked to clean the hostel charged. They realize that a psychopath on the loose. To counter this development, they broke up and wander around in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Frolic is poorly made slasher movie. Release DVD I watched was Vipco one. It seems to cut a fair bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more pointless because, let's face it, slasher film devoid of violence is a waste of time. For the film Chopper and only video nasty Completists.
