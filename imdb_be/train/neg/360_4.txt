I read the book and really enjoyed it from start to finish. However, when I saw the film, I was very disappointed. First of all, no disrespect to Deborah Raffin but it was not too mature to play a woman 24/25. The late Christopher Reeve was also miscast, the same reason. Whether, according to the book, it was about 30. I'd like to see a little more study of his military life, his friend Red, Elly trip to see it as it was an important part of the storyline characters. In addition, Miss Beazley was miscast as the book mentions her future plus size lady. I know that the film did not have the budget for the "Bridges of Madison County", which I believe was released around the same time. <br /> <br /> But I was very badly done, a low budget, the film is miscast. As someone said, I want that Miss Spenser will retire and write scripts for his books, as they should be. She knows that her characters better than anyone else, I hope that it will consider doing the casting too. The film let me down!
