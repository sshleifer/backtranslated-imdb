Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Frakes <br /> <br /> Starring: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbirds are GO! <br /> <br /> And so began the Thunderbirds, the childhood favorite of mine. When I heard that they were going to make a movie Thunderbirds, I was ecstatic. I could not wait to see Thunderbird 2 pit to save people, while Thunderbird 4 will sink deep into ?? You get the idea. I just could not wait. Then in August 2004, when the film was released. Critics prepared, but I still wanted to go. In the end, as long as the heart has been in the same place, that's all that matters to me. So I sat down in the theater, the only teenager in the crowd of 50 ?? It was still under thirty and ten. Quite possibly the most awkward theatrical experience I've ever had ?? <br /> <br /> The film (which is intended for the prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Corbett), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days, wishing he could be the salvation of the people, like the rest of his family, but he was too young. One day, he finally gets his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) picks up the rest of his family up to the Thunderbird 5 (space station). This involves him in order to outwit the assistant of the hood and save his family in the time before Hood could steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the plot sounds like a normal episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. After he gets put in the movie ?? a mess we have in our hands. First, the film was designed for children, as well as the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us as adults, and gave us the areas that were quite advanced for children's programs. This on the other hand, dumbs down the story as he tries to make himself stripped of the franchise Spy Kids. The final product is a film that tries to appeal to fans of the series Thunderbirds and children, while missing completely. Lama joke, cartoon sounds and silly antics that no one really finds it amusing all on this film, and I'm sure there are willing to Frakes, he never sent it. <br /> <br /> In general, all yielded good results, given the scenario that they are given. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood, playing the role very well. My only complaint about the characters of the servants of evil, which are reduced to the residual of the old cartoons Looney Tunes, is about as awkward, oddly enough, that children take them with ease. <br /> <br /> What is surprising about this film is that while I was watching the film, I had the pleasure. But as soon as the lights came on, I realized that the film was pretty bad, I had $ 8 easier, and after two hours of my time is gone. Guilty pleasure? Maybe. However, Thunderbirds is a forgettable mess. Instead of a big "go," I'm going to have to recommend you stay away from this movie. If the rest of the film can be like the first ten minutes of this, it would be an incredible film worthy of the name Thunderbirds. However, we get a film that only die-hard fans Thunderbirds (if you want to see your childhood in pieces) or very sad to have to worry about. <br /> <br /> My rating for the Thunderbirds is a 1 Â½ stars.
