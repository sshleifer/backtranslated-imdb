This film had IMDB 8,1 rating, so I was expecting a lot more from him. It starts funny and wins with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie halfway through, he began to pull and everything becomes predictable sickingly. The symbols in the office were excellent in the first third of the film, but we find them a little too well; they are cartoons, not real people at all. It's the same story I've seen hundreds of times, but said there are several with different circumstances. The fact that I could stomach another predictable love story, unless the dialogue was not so callous! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse, if the characters were inconsistent and improbable motives, and, unfortunately, this was also the case with the Dead Letter Office. I hope that this film will end up in the Office of the Dead movie in the near future.
