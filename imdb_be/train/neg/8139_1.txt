Or maybe this is what it feels like. In any case, «The Bat People» about as flat as a carpet, soft as a bag of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as smart as all three put together. <br /> <br /> Thus, the plot in two words (vessels fitting, ...): a doctor (Moss) receives bitten bat cave checking his wife (McAndrew) and then converted into a bat - well, not exactly a bat, but BAT- like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in the camera view of the first person .... <br /> <br /> but it is a matter of sheriff (Pataca), which is about the worst sheriff type: a dull appearance. He skirmishes people he Leers on married women, he steals a handkerchief from haberdashery (hostility!), He smokes with one of the mouthpieces of the mouth and the negotiations at the same time, which makes it look and sound like Buford T. Justice "Smokey and bandit "and (this is the worst) ... He is the most likeable character in the whole movie! <br /> <br /> entire film, though, it's just a TV movie-of-the-week in-like crapola (guano, in this case). This AIP, to call out loud! What are you expecting Oscar-caliber stuff? <br /> <br /> And what else can be said about the film, which is not even MST3K can save? <br /> <br /> How about ... no stars for "The Bat People», the full version or the version of MST3K! <br /> <br /> By the way, if ever the continuation of this movie, I have to hide the TV.
