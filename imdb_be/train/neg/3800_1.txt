Calling absolutely the most pathetic piece of shit in cinematic history is not an easy task, the candidates have much, but Nemesis 2 was my favorite ever since I saw him. It was so funny, we had to take it again the next day, and again I was laughing so hard that I was literally rolling on the floor. (Typically, this occurs only when I see Monty Python "Scott of the Antarctic"). <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, overwhelming that-The-Heck feeling firmly grasps the viewer. I am quite ashamed that this is a clumsy home video ever made its production stage. This should be continued until it has a clear connection at all with the first film. Hero has the same name, but this time the "Alex" the female sex, although it took us half way to the movies, to stop wondering what all the muscles and barbarian nomad outfit! <br /> <br /> There really is no story at all, it's just a long chase scene, but it is so slow to develop and pointless, that calling it a chase scene makes the sound much more interesting than it actually is. There is almost no dialogue, which is just as well, considering the quality, and then the movie just suddenly comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scenes with a lot of gasoline explosion, never explaining that in fact it was all about. Fortunately, it will never be boring, because there is something stupid and phony going on at all times! <br /> <br /> Scary movies are generally only tedious, but Nemesis 2 is the perfect mixture of excessive seriousness and full nonintentional wackiness that is really interesting. This film, or even to buy it, you will not be disappointed!
