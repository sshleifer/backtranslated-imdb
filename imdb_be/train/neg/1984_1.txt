Absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It is stunning to me that this movie was even made. Hip-Hop and old westerns, do not seem to mix. What is the target audience were these people thinking when planning this Trainwreck. <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and the story to make a joke, but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors, even in this nightmare film makes his entire career laughingstock. Chicken with Clueless should never be forgiven, and it is devoid of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of dialogue she had to ask which one of her friends was playing this sick joke. After some research, I did find a list of some other actors who have passed on this film :. Jada Pinkett Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monica, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah, and finally, Marge Simpson <br /> <br /> In short, I would like to look at a blank TV than watch this movie again .
