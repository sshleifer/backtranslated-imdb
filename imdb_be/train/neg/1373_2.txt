It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I used to praise any movie for some aspects of its manufacture, but very annoying behavior of more than half of the characters made it hard for me to evaluate any part of this film. <br /> <br /> The most common conclusion was that the guy who designed the building was the fault of an avalanche destroyed it. Er fine. <br /> <br /> In addition, trying to ski in style slalom avalanche will not work. Running 10 feet into the trees, it does not work. Unfortunately it's not here. As mentioned previously the innate stupidity and dumbness of some characters funny. In a confined space with a limited amount of oxygen-four-year-old can tell you from the fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about 5 minutes of the film redeems himself and gets some appreciation. However, if you have a modicum of intelligence, you will also find a large part of the film is difficult to endure. <br /> <br /> It hurts me so much the quality of the stories are non-produced, and someone else will pay for things such as this will be done. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have already said, in the last five minutes? Well, to give you the hook you have to keep watching to see the latest avalanche in the martial arts technique. Absolutely priceless.
