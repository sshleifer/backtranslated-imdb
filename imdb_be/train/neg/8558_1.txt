This movie was absolutely horrible, I even feel uncomfortable to call it a movie. His typical "mamblkor" film with zero plot and a lot of pointless whining twenty-something stumbling around trying to "figure things out." I tried to give mamblkor chance, but let's be honest it's just awful. <br /> <br /> I is not synchronized with the movie, I appreciate Dogme95 movies, Idioterne is one of my favorite movies. So I do not mind if the film is cheaply made as long as there is some (ANY) substances. <br /> <br /> All in this movie reverse acting, writing (or was it all homemade?) direction, but most of all, above all, the camera work was just simply nonsense. The camera has never been somewhere logical, there was no consistency. I must admit, when I heard the man that was already in this film, so I thought to myself, well, even if it is horrible, at least, there is nudity (yes I know, I'm a jerk). Well, thanks to the uber shitty camera-work that you never get to see anything, and things that you see, trust me - you do not want. This film made me sick at many levels. <br /> <br /> The dialogue made me sick, the camera-work made me feel sick, but basically the idea that this film was praised by some critics of the law, and now that most of all I want to vomit.
