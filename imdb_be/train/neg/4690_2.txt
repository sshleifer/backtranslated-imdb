This British film is really terrible, and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford in it, although it is largely sleepwalks through it. The idea to train bomb sounds good ... but it turns out this train ends in the parking lot for most of the film! No action, no traffic, just the static train. The area where the train is parked pumped out, so it's not like there is any danger to those who either. In fact, this film could be used in the film class to illustrate how NOT to do a suspense film. True uncertainty generated by letting the audience know what characters Nia, a fact apparently unknown to the director. Spoiler: train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe that there is only one. After the first bomb defused, it feels as if it is no longer a reason to see the movie more. But at the last minute, a villain who has no apparent motivation for his actions, shows, there are two. We are not sure when the bombs go off, so we did not even have the classic "time bomb" tightening sequence. A good 10 minutes or more is spent watching the French wife of Glenn Ford is thinking about leaving him, but then I wonder where he is. She's so annoying character that we do not care whether she agreed with him, so if it does, there is nothing emotional about it. Most of the other characters is quite devoid of personality, and nobody has any problems or questions. It is only 72 minutes, but it feels like a long time, because it is hard and boring. Do not waste your time.
