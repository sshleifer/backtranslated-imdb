Oh, not very good slasher film. Because by doing so, the effects worthy of more familiar and uninventive soundtrack. <br /> <br /> There are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the film, which makes for a pretty good scene in which, it would seem, everything goes. In addition, there are many characters hanging around, not knowing what was happening, or in pursuit of a red herring; more killing time than humans. There are other deaths, and equal opportunity killer killer entirely indifferent to any implementation. The killer also likes to set other people to kill innocent people as well. Identity not be disclosed closer to the end, and the motive is quite thin, and we really do not care. <br /> <br /> Presumably, the film takes place around Christmas, but it is not a major factor. One scene gets lit Christmas lights, that's about it. <br /> <br /> The film is quite dark muddy the picture much of the time, at least on video I watched. Some of the dialogue was a bit lost in some of the opening scenes. The ending should be stronger than it was. We think we know what happened, but there is a chance that someone else did.
