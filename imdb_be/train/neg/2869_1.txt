The story goes like this, Netflix is ​​too late to send me back my DVDs so I went down to the analog rent a place known as "Blockbuster Video" They suck you know. Real bad they have 150 copies of recent poor movies for your viewing pleasure while I never want to see any of them. So I saw the BTK killer out there on the shelf, his lonely self. I like to see movies based on serial killers. Its just part of humanity that I will never understand why I want to see that kind of thing. In any case, I put the DVD in and all of a sudden from the first second, it sucks. I sat there with my B.F. and we as "that this kind of crap?" Non-stationary camera work, a terrible act - the first scene, in which a woman is killed, you wonder if it will just quietly enough talkativeness instead, then the rats were sacrificed down her throat. It is very interesting when the director has an erection for this shit. There's nothing decent about this "movie". All I have to say the director, "You have a Freakin 'tripod?" Every shot was brutally unstable. The music was terrible. It was just one day, they decided to make the film. They are likely to gather people with WalMart, to show up and "act" for them. Simply awful. If you make a film like this is the direction of your hobby is not something that you should do to make it entirely living- renal DVD outlets for movie lovers like me. Better to leave the house for your friends when you are having a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them .... Then you break your movie BOK murderers and said: "You want to see this crappy movie that I did once?"
