I'm a big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this film is terrible. While Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong, and he was the director of this film, and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could from her, making this big-budget porn film. Now I know why they do not make a big-budget porn movies anymore. In the world of fantasy, porn star can act, but it is the real world, and they can not act. That is why there is a porn star, if the woman is beautiful, like Jenna could act, she would have tried to go into regular films, not porn. Just because your beautiful does not make you a movie star. A perfect example of this is Traci Lords when she was a teenager, through her 20s she was one of the most beautiful, sexiest women on earth. She made a step in the prevailing low budget films, and can not act. Where is she now? I gave it a 2 instead of 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she made the «Dream Quest». Let Jenna, we do not want to hear what you say, just as we want to let you have sex. In addition, you Jenna, will have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account, if you do anal on film.
