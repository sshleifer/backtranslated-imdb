I've never read Bradbury's novel, this film is based on, but from what I gathered, it will be interesting (when I finally read, and I will). My comments will be based solely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it and was so excited, but when I finally, I was so disappointed that hurt. This is because the film itself felt so amateur. The actors were not well matched (though Robards and squatting both good actors - not just here). Child actors seemed to be simply asked to see, get dressed characters, for example, the line and make a face. Set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised by the awfulness of it, I had to go online and check who sent it, only to see the kind of work he did. Editing has been cut and pasted and story (script) was just as good (even if the author was involved himself, the irony?). Creating tension, fear, and uncertainty was so soft that it was ineffective if the climax finally came. <br /> <br /> I have read some of the comments on this film and find it hard to believe people actually like it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. It had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was technically so bad it takes the light of history.
