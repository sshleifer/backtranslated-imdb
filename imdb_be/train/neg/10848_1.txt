Apparently, it could be an interesting movie. Featuring with powerful Cradle Of Filth, starring their frontman Dani and being hyped as "the future of British horror," I expected gusset festival live up to the hype. <br /> <br Alex Chandon in /> I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> All of this film or plate or incompetent. A Brief History of the installation anthology was done to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. It should be recognized that the idea of ​​"sickroom" sent a chill on the back, but like most of the film was summing up the poor script writing and acting. <br /> <br /> Chandon can not write dialogue. Each proposal with the chief police investigator is brim full with insults and arrogance (the typical "police on the edge" of the formula. It's funny, I'm sure I have not seen that anywhere else before ...) a lot of Chandon, you do not Tarantino, or Scorsese. It sounds BAD. Add a ridiculously OTT operates with very intricate casting (do not get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but he is not an actor), and performance for a ridiculous vein burstingly adulation. Give me Bruce Campbell on any given day. <br /> <br /> The visual effects on the whole poor, with some atrocious CGI, Gore terrible effects (for goodness sakes, Peter Jackson has done better, and it was more than a decade ago, with less budget) and edit filters who cry overuse! With regard to the often rolled use Cradle Of Filth account ... man, they should sue. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Cradle Of Fear is that he takes seriously, trying to create the atmosphere and incite fear and repulsion within their audience. too many good horror film made in the seventies and eighties to do so much better with a far superior Gore effects (eg: geek, zombie flesh eaters, transcendent, Suspiria, etc.), which makes the cradle of terror, in my opinion, the second speed and outdated. <br /> <br /> I hope Chandon can learn from this disgusting ghoul movie and then do some of the qualities of horror that really scares. <br /> <br /> Better luck next time.
