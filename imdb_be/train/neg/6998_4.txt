Hollywood has always been a problem of coming to terms with the "religious painting." Surprisingly Cargo proves to be no exception. While using the excellent cast talent, and are made on the upper budget, with the corresponding moody photographs of Robert Planck, the film can not depressing account of trust. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements excites the viewer's involvement in the action and the characters fate. I found it difficult to sit through all the flimsy metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and it is impossible to take in the light-bathed smug Ian Hunter nerdy as the figure of Christ. And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence, at least agree with me. The film was banned. Few moviegoers Boston / Detroit / Providence, if any, complained and went to other cities, because it was clear from the trailer that Gable and Crawford somehow became involved in "a multimedia message." He flopped all over the world. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the film enjoyed something of a revival on television. Home atmosphere, seems to make the allegory of the film more receptive to the audience. However, despite the growing reputation of surprising or unusual film, the story of this amazing traffic on a predictable, highly moralistic lines, which will have no one to guess how the main characters eventually come to terms with destiny.
