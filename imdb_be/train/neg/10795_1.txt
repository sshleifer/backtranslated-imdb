Will somebody tell Shaq to follow what he is good at playing basketball. This film was not even entertaining a silly level. In this film, Shaq plays Gin, who lives in the boombox, not Orginal genie in the lamp instead of boombox. It should help a little boy playing the same annoying Francais cappra. This film was the flimsy plot because water world, the effect was terrible, and I think that anyone who loves this Flim afraid to admit it.
