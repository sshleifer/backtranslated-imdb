Because "hard" is the only word in existence to describe the intentions of the filmmakers. Where do you even start? The nose b * tchiness, I'm going to start with a terrible effect of almost everyone in this film. Scratches that. Almost does not belong in this sentence. I can not think of even one character, which has been painted well. Although, in all fairness, it would be almost impossible to reflect these zero-dimensional characters in a successful way. However, the girl who played Catherine (whose name I deliberately do not include - I pretend it does not exist) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only overshadowed by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was God awful. He tried to portray the brilliance that was the first, but not in so many ways. Virtually every part of it does not make sense - although I admit (reluctantly) that the plot twist was pretty good it was his surprise. And the finale was at least a little bit of humor. But this film there with the worst I've seen. Do not look. Just no. There is absolutely no value in viewing it. Nobody. It only takes pleasure from the first.
