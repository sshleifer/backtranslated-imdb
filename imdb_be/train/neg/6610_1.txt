This film should be watched as it should have been a flop. Ram Gopal Verma wanted first to do this remake of the classic Bollywood film «Sholay», but after having problems with the original manufacturers have decided to go ahead with the project ... and I think, to leave all the good parts of the movie (acting, script, songs, music , comedy, action, etc.), and make a film just because it has already happened to hire the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After the movie Rangeela, Satya, Company and he pulled Coppola (The Godfather) to us; What were you thinking RGV? In any case, the story, although it is difficult to follow, almost like Old Sholay. Ajay Devgan plays Hiro (Beeru, Sholay) and Ajay, the new kid on the block plays Ajay (Jay, Sholay). Both "bad even funny" friends help the police catch the bad guy first. Later in the film, is now retired policeman hires their personal safety and protection of the hands of very most wanted Bubban plays Amitabh Bachan. If you do not watch Bollywood movies, the good guys win in the end. There, I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
