His first film after the death of longtime friend John Belushi Aykroyd exhibits great fatigue, trying to pull off a character who would have been a snap for Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Doctor Detroit" gives us a book professor Aykroyd masquerading as a strange, violent pimp, to ward off the enemy known only as Mother. This is bad, but it also has classes for learning, the school dinner will be held, four homes in the evening, in order to protect and dinner pimp (or something similar) to be present. Not surprisingly, Aykroyd not seem overwhelmed most of the time. Why does the viewer has to be one? <br /> <br /> It was in this film that Aykroyd met future wife, Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this chaotic mess. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. You want a good Aykroyd, see «The Blues Brothers». Do you want to bad, see "Doctor Detroit."
