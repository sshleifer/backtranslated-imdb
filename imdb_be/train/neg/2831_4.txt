I saw this recently with my wife and found that it's better than Kane says, although it's not much cop. UK's largest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as it could have raised it with more conviction in his game. Rex Harrison seems to be even less concerned, perhaps it is not surprising, since his character is very poorly written. William Holden best, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is not very good script. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson, like a beautiful woman I have ever seen, but given very little to do, the film could get much, concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but mostly plays comic character does not match the serious tone of the film. Music poor and Omar Sharif, making one of his many senseless cameo (his career has been based on this for decades). <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer was to be blamed for the better, not directing it, he was annoyingly unpredictable director, and it's one of his weaker films.
