I saw it on TV. I'm glad I did not go to the cinema to see it or to spend money on rent. The film is entirely predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner before winding electrical cables. The plot is really weak and incredibly - expert avalanche guy gets hit by 20-foot waves breaking bones avalanche (using actual frames) and all he has to do is stand up and shake yourself down. Avalanche thunders down a million miles per hour and stops at the roadside. <br /> <br /> Some impressive and demonstrates its destructive force from the actual avalanche material. But the contract between the real avalanche, and a stepped material makes this movie look even flimsier. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, do not bother with it at all on TV
