House of the Dead was the worst film I've ever seen, by the pathetic "matrix" 360 attemps camera angle and cheese actions I fell asleep. I do not think that the director and set manager can decide whether or not rain, because there will be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I would rate this movie 1 out of 10 (10 being best, 1 being the worst). In addition, the jumping scene from the movie in the game was really annoying, it makes you wonder if they just make up for lost time. I ask all who read it, did not see. It's not worth the time.
