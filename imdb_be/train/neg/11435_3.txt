I would like to know more about this film, when I shot him. I would put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and its strong credit as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the film were charming, most of the film felt contrived, undeveloped, or otherwise simply boring and predictable. Not to mention the ick factor of so many people who think of siblings had a couple of ... I do not care how much of the story line, that is, he still felt a little, um, gross. And Charlie for a zoologist, she certainly does not seem very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was in it (except for her hotness and some common interests), who made Gray's falling for her? The story could have been much more interesting, with a little more depth. High point - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who found it annoying on occasion), a cabbie in clothes and dance sequences (if Sam & Gray had such great dancers, I wish we had seen more of how the bits they showed us really It was better than most of the rest of the film). It could be better.
