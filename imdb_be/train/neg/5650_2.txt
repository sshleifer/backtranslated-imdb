William Shatner in small doses is valid. Unfortunately, instead of having to leave his character as a minor irritation, but that is moderately amusing, it was seen fit to increase its role and overdone. Just as was the case in the original Star Trek series. I guess I'll never understand the American humor, which often comes from "above" to get the message across. I vote with their feet. I do not watch the show, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast were good. It is a pity that overdone role Shatner also affects performance in Spader. But most of the show, as a society will be, I think. I do not travel the same routes. Frank
