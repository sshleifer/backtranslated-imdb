As often happens, the films of self-loathing characters not usually make for good drama. "Downloading NancyÂ» is no exception. He allegedly based on a true story about a woman who killed her own request someone she met through the Internet. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist, Nancy (Maria Bello), who is married Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who developed the game of golf, which his company has successfully marketed in a variety of bars and bar / restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has little positive properties (except for its ability to be successful in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a gloomy and stern expression on his face. He has no compassion for his wife with all his emotional problems and addresses the indulgent prostitutes. When his wife asks sex, he punishes her by masturbating in front of her instead. <br /> <br /> Nancy same one note as a symbol. Moreover, she had a year marriage Who does not like 15, but it was sexual abuse by her uncle when she was growing up (fortunately, no retrospective of the history in the film). Her hatred takes the form of self-mutilation, and as a result, she was forced into therapy. However, it has such contempt for her therapist, that there can be no progress. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis over the Internet. He kind of sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women for money, making a huge amount of pain download. This showed that Louis has two children, but no longer see them (the children's mother no longer wants anything to do with it). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is the first to have painful sex with Louis, and then to kill her, there is a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis has sex with Nancy and slashing her vaginal area with fragments of glass. These scenes are displayed in the form of flashbacks after Louis Albert visits that binds him and hits him with a golf club. It seems that Luis has a plan twice in going to see Albert: 1) scold him for his treatment of Nancy and 2) use the beating he received. It will take some time before the show, Louis fate Nancy ?? First, it makes Alberta to do him a favor by taking your dog to a relative, so someone else will take care of it in the future. Nancy Fate, of course, that Louis, finally, ultimately suppresses it to death (but showed some hesitation the first, he made it clear that he had a certain "feel" to it). We soon learn that Louis jailed for life for the murder of Nancy. <br /> <br /> What are we to take away from the film, such as Nancy loading? Should we feel sorry for the victims of sexual violence and domestic violence? This is the main point of the film? It is in fact a guarantee of sympathy for Nancy? I do not think so. The filmmakers create a straw man in the character of Alberta ?? someone who is cut off from his emotions, he is the one who is responsible for the decrease in Nancy. But people are so one-dimensional in real life? I think not. They are repelled by Louis, a man who makes a living by causing pain, come and pass the Albert contempt Nancy. In addition, his expressions of love for Nancy (before he kills her), should show his "sensitive side". <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not matter whether the filmmakers determine where their sympathies with the various characters in the film. They are so bent on tickles your audience with scenes of gratuitous violence that downloading Nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in bad taste and soft pornography.
