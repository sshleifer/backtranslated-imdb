Just PPV'd it. I do not want to spend too much time on it, as most of the posters here put it better than I ever could, but I want to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I did not know was ridiculous: Redgrave chasing butterflies and small stumbling nanny; Close screaming that her "valuable" the boy (whom she and Mr. decided to have drunk lost) was transformed into Roadkill; that deaf Ann schmoozed with Peggy Lee; or reverse CGI crypt Guardian Annie looked at the younger yourself! <br /> <br /> I never bought the Dane, as the younger Redgrave. I did not buy Collette and Richardson, as a sister, too. When Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, it's better to get my mother to give her a few lessons! I had zero idea why any girl (or friends) would make a fool of yourself over fresh pin duty Harris! daughter Ann are whining and frivolous, like her, Luke backward lounger on a crack, and I did not let rot on any of them! The evening gives chick flicks a bad name!
