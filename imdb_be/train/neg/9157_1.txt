Your first indication that this is a cheesy film, which was shot on video instead of film. History complicated, and the production of a surprisingly sloppy. Note that, for example, if the name of the pairs in the plane allegedly landing in Vermont, where they went to celebrate their relationships in ceremony, civil union, the plane is shown going to the airport, surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - Vermont - takes place in the garden of tropical plants, including palms, which do not last five minutes in the climate of New England. In yet another plane trip, targeted plan reflects a FedEx cargo plane takes off. Presumably, they could only afford to travel in the cabin. As for the plot, the film is waiting for you to believe that Victor, then furiously Christian brother Arthur, was expelled from his church when society learns that his brother was gay. Not only that, but in the end the pastor Victor puts up with the killer to have Ben and Arthur killed "to cleanse their souls of sin." Clearly, no one in the church had never heard of the Ten Commandments. If it was not Jamie Brett tapestry that is surprisingly effective as Arthur, the film will not have the quality of life at all.
