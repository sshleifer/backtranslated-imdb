This is not a good film. It is inconsistent, all the action is bad and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times done much better elsewhere. Not to mention you can see every plot point is a mile away. The worst part is that no one bothered to tell Lonett McKee, she can not sing. But who cares, it looks sooooo fucking good. But I do not back down, nothing new here. Bottom line, a group of hot girl gets taken advantage of, some only one gets hooked on drugs, somebody gets hooked on guys, someone gets a hell, and then terrible things happen. Surprise, surprise. Welcome to the music business. I can not believe that so many people think it's a good movie. So many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to the classification of Black films. I do not play it! If you want to support these movies by navigating to them - great! If you liked it - great! To each his own. But do not try to tell me that it was good. Pleeeease! I want people of color are not fawning over such movies come just because they have a black actor. Want to see a good African-American film? See Love Jones. Ray. Or The Color Purple. Those would not be a great movie, no matter what color the actors. Why? Because they tell interesting stories with a lot of action that made you feel something for a long time after you leave the theater. Just because our experience does not automatically make it a good movie. It's only good - if it is good. Period.
