While 3-D animation (nail shows) did his job well, most of the other elements fell. It was as if the filmmakers were thinking: "Well, it will be 3-D, so we do not have to work that hard on the development of the plot or the characters" And the fact that this is a children's film is absolutely no excuse.. The public refers to the three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's dad) in the same way as they are drawn to the three-dimensional graphics. The only measurement of any of the main characters was shown with dimensional scooter which spins the story from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? The appearance of Buzz Aldrin at the end (after watching a very animated robotic version of a historical figure for a half hour) happens on the screen, and ruining a good time for each call of the main characters of the film "pollutants" and announces that the situation put forward on the screen was actually impossible. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? You just want to tell the children the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus does not exist, while you're at it?
