I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through a few things I thought could be improved; acting, writing, direction, special effects, camera crew, sound and lighting. In addition, it seemed that the authors did not have the slightest idea that anything to do with the film. Apparently, back in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber, which can go completely invisible to $ 75 million. Now-a-days, these things are worth about $ 3 billion, and they can not go unseen. Apparently, you can fly from the US to the Middle East for an hour. It was completely random lesbian scene, which I do not mind, but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it. The camera will randomly increase by an actor and go to random scenes. Oh yeah, because its in the Steven Seagal film, it is predictable as hell. In general, I rank it right up there with Snakes on a Plane.
