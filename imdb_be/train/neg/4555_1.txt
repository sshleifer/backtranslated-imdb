This film can not capture all of the mystery and intrigue that offers book. The essence of the book, insight, hardly even touched, leaving the viewer wondering why everyone makes such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> nature of the development does not fit. A lot of background or personality development leaves no audience does not really care about what happens to them, and so the action sequences fall flat. <br /> <br /> In search of manuscripts breaks, and with no real explanation, and without leaving a feeling of satisfaction as to the fact that the whole search was for. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst film adaptations of the books that I have ever seen. It's horrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, you can skip this movie and read it. If you read the book, you can skip this movie and reread it. <br /> <br /> It is almost as if the point of making the film was to discredit the book, that is how bad it is done and funny movie. It's a shame, too, because it might be nice if they capitalized on it at the peak of their success, and they probably would have been able to get a good writer and a few good actors. <br /> <br /> Please do not 't waste your time, read a book !!!
