"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" (strange incovenient name) just a bad film; she has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing special about it. So, CGI backgrounds look interesting, but the result is that all of this was withdrawn in irritating soft focus. In addition, the film uses music as well as, say, "Gilligan's Island" or Scooby-Doo cartoons-- IT never stops. Awful, just awful. There's no fresh ideas, or just a lot and hosts, and the hosts and ... etc., bits taken from old films and TV series. There's no shot here, the movie just seems to be there because he can. Save your money and time. Nha entertainment in general.
