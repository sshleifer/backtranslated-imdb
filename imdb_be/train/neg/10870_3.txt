Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York, his uncle (Richard Tucker), to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid 3 women Zhakov (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline ( carole Lombard), to accompany him and make sure he does not fall foul of a gold digger. One such lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) appears on the scene in disapprovement women. We follow the story of the girls offer more money to appear in the show instead accompanies the role they agreed to during the 3 months that the Bill is in New York, while the Bill meets with Cleo and another woman. In the end, love is in the air for Bill and one another ............. <br /> <br /> The quality of picture and sound quality is poor in this film. History interspersed with musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Katherine Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not so good either. He was pleasant enough, but only really comes to life when he plays the drums and trombone. There is a very annoying character who plays the taxi driver (Roscoe Karns), and the film is just boring.
