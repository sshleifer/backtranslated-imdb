Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre 'B' mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with Simon as a director, of course, he could have fit another film Red Skelton or two on his schedule! Anyway, Grand Central Murder shameless rip-off of the Thin Man movies minus the wit, charm, and chemistry findings. We were treated to a paper thin plot, which can barely support his 73 minutes, bad acting and tired jokes <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nick and Nora Char -. Er, Monty and Butch Custer. He PI and she was his wife and tracking partner. They participate in the "humorous" banter with each other. You see? It is quite another. Heflin only one here who hints at bigger and better things, though it is very close to being a jerk in it. Virginia Gray in another Thin Man, but again, let me emphasize that this film has nothing to do, that one, no, sir. And only when we begin to think that this film is not absolutely nothing like another film (for example, thin MAN) we really like it, Sam Levene pops up as the lead detective, which is kind of dull and must be Van Heflin subtly guide him towards the all important conclusions. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Soon, the "murder" is what an angry king Mida schemer who loves to trade on the rich people, until she finds richer one. It plays a patrician Dane, which is like a C- with Hedy Lamarr version until she opens her mouth and turns to F. There is a whole array of silly suspects, all with their own motivation for wanting MFA dead. There is a type of society, tough talk will give a thug, ex-lover, and shadow theater impresario (Tom Conway, is difficult Signed unlikely name of "Frank Ciro»). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous, twitchy type, I think he could do before. Millard Mitchell plays the idiot cop who, in a running gag that will not quit, can not stop thinking about a piece of ass he was waiting for him, only in this case, gets wrapped up (that's right, Millard Mitchell, a swordsman). Finally, most innovative method of storytelling that we've never seen before, all the suspects will be gathered in one place, where they tell their stories (as flashback) to the detective, as Rocky taking mental notes, until eventually blame forced to abruptly blurted recognition. <br /> <br /> In addition to the actual painting being a dud, I naively thought occurs that maybe a few shots of the actual location of one thousand nine hundred forty-two era of the Great Central, but, unfortunately, no. There is only one very brief shot in the beginning. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. So, to sum up, a bit formulaic, but Heflin was good. <br /> <br /> * ½ out of 4
