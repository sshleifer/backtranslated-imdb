There is a key aspect of the film, which Jobson, seem to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story, showing it to you. You do not need to tell the audience what to think, because they will see it. The action is interspersed with some of the most cumbersome narrative unleashed on the unsuspecting public - purple prose sensitive fifth former. And it should be unnecessary, because they are thin cast here and some beautifully composed and shot the visuals. Maybe, Jobbo felt that the main story needs a lit bit support. And he may have been right, it lacks basic trust: 70s Edinburgh was not exactly full of beautiful girls with a penchant for savvy Velvet Underground and a soft spot for the passage of a sociopath. From too tidy and new looking clothes, the character is in intellectualism cod, which is trying to tie it all together, it's all too contrived for my taste.
