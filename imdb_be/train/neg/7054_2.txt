This film was absolutely helpless. Pathetic scenario and the lack of any history, just let me look three losers drooling over bikini babes. Sometimes I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I could not even sit through the entire movie. Hashe frustrating and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive. Celina Jaitley was not bad. Meaning only part of the film is a parody of the Anu Malik and his obsession shayaris. It was pretty fun. Songs "Sineva NeÂ» and its remix version was really good. You can always count on Emran lock lips and lip-sync Hit. In general, it seems, Emran does not have a good script from the Bhatts, to support him at this time.
