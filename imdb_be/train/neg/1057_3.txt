I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. When I realized that the entire movie was really just an older guy experiencing the dream, I felt cheated. Of course, this could be a device to lead us into something deeper, something more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So do not buy a large drink, or you will be running to the restroom. My kids did not enjoy it either. Ah, well.
