- Contains spoilers sinker - <br /> <br /> I've seen a few decent indie horror films, such as Hamilton, guys love Mandy Lane and irritability; Unfortunately, I felt fear eyes do not fall into this category. From start to finish the film suffers from amateurish actions resonate with a very bad scenario, God only knows why the writer (a) considers the dialogue, such as, "No, do not go there, do not go there, it will get you if she gets you she will kill you, and if it kills you, you're dead "is the quality of the film <br /> this film reflects very little character development <br /> and to be honest I could not care. at least that was the cause of the pain and torture on them as they are just a group of college ditsy girls who do not show almost no saving qualities. All that they do is scream and whine for the film, and if the girls do not cry their dispute; if they talk topics by chance: the familiarity of boys or as one of the girls father was recently burned (relevant subjects, if you pursue a psychotic murderer) <br /> <br /> The soundtrack too. bottomless exposure sugary tehy both the start and end credits (although rumor credit Music knowing the end was approaching, it seemed like the sky). <br /> <br /> The camcorder works badly, and sometimes makes the film unwatchable. I believe that because of little or no budget director has been limited to only one digital camera, which resides in the car girls almost the entire movie. I think it was an attempt to glue the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and experience what women are going through. But because of the very trembling camera, grainy and too close to the action can be hard to tell what's going on during the scenes and just chaotic. It is one thing to make a film is subjective, but it is another to have the action on the screen, the audience can not decipher because of a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that fear Eyes is a low budget indie film, but it does not justify a very low quality. There's no redeeming factors in this film: bad acting, bad scripting, camera work and stuff is not a story. In light off this, I decided to give the film 1 of 10, he left me very disappointed; wanting a meteorite that hit the earth brought me sweet relief. His 94 minutes of stupid college girls are crying, arguing, run aimlessly and with occasional inappropriate conversations. However, how many times you can see a woman defecating in their hands and throwing shit on windscreen car glass coinage.
