I have seen most if not all of the classic Laurel and Hardy films. I've always enjoyed it stupidly ridiculous, even after watching it again and again. This new film tries to bring back the classic with two new actors that resemble like Laurel & Hardy, but fails miserably for various reasons. One of them, both from the place of their webs (in the early 20th century), but both were portrayed in an atmosphere of the 90s. Some of the former dialogue back, but he did not miserable approach the classic series. This movie may very well be the worst movie I have ever seen, and must be withdrawn from the shelves and closed forever. This Laurel and Hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation.
