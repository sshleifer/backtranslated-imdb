After watching the trailer of this movie and find out, Spike Lee directing, I was thrilled to hear about this event. I was not alive at the time, I lived in New York, so I was expecting a history lesson than anything. I got some interesting action, lots of sex, and about 30 minutes worth of film that really had nothing to do with the Son of Sam. I think that the film is not about the Son of Sam, but it was the look in the summer of '77. Add me disappointed. <br /> <br />
