This is one of those movies that appear on the cables as two o'clock in the afternoon to entertain the bored housewives when they iron. Actions is the second speed. Poor Modine seem to sleepwalk through the entire film. And God help Gina Gershon. Her accent is too excessive. That does not sound like a real Englishwoman. It sounds forced and fake, as well as its effects. It must follow what she does best, lesbian dancer fraudsters, who plays in a rock and roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are not entirely better. They are two-dimensional. empty empty and stupid. How do we have to care about these people. At some point, Christy Scott Cashman get lost in Central Park. Really? It is not so difficult to focus on the Central Park. Just follow any path with. Not only that, I do not care about any of the characters, I downright hated them. The only reason I even stayed with this train-crash of the film was Fisher Stevens. Even his sparkling humor could not save the fish dies. Each scene is a typical romantic comedy fare, and there's nothing left to surprise us. The script was terrible as it was to do something. If you catch this fish to throw it back!
