There is a lot to like here. Cast the first course and the script provides a good dialogue is better to capture the atmosphere of a cohesive, lovely family. However, for this reason, the film does not ring true. We see Leo, who, apparently, had just learned of his HIV-positive diagnosis, in fact respond in a way that is not in tune to the favorable atmosphere for which it is located. As well, the film ends somewhat unexpectedly avoiding the fact that Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family should be considered in light of their love for him. The young actor, who plays the brother Leo, Marcel, is impressive, as a rule, is the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the writers could not decide onwhether they wanted insightful dissertation on the impact of HIV on the functional, appealing family or devastation of HIV is the victim - so it only hints of both. While the film gives food for thought it leaves the viewer who wants a lot more than it delivers.
