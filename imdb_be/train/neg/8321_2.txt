Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba are two of my least favorite actors of this century will combine that quite possibly, the most flat attempting to rework already miserable Butterfly Effect. Awake is so dull and uninteresting so perfectly that you would be better sleeping. Terrence Howard is still not recovered from the diabolical August Rush put a decent fight as a sadistic doctor who seems hell-bent on killing Christianson and after watching his performance, I'd love to help. <br /> <br /> Alba, is still recovering from the Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. Natural catastrophic and equally unwatchable as it has always been. Only once did she ever was quite brilliant in that it was in good hands of a master director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. Maybe it is possible that Jessica Alba is not as poor as the majority of the actress to give her credit, and it is possible that her acting skills to be weight down bad script. If so, that might explain Awake. That with a script that would be a shame that the Plan 9 from Outer Space. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christensen, and Terrence Howard star in first-time director / nerves jangling psychological thriller writer Harold Jobe of the person who feels frightened common surgical phenomenon known as "aesthetic consciousness," in which those that are installed on the desktop are acutely aware of what is happening around them, despite remaining completely paralyzed and cried out for help. If successful young young man (Christensen) goes under the knife and realizes that the anesthesia is not quite completed its work, the horror quickly sets, as his wife was worried (Alba) waits anxiously and terrible drama takes place in the operating room. <br /> <br /> Hoping to do for operating tables that Final Destination made aircraft, is the first attempt directed by Joby Harold twist on blood-icing conceit. The sequence of the previous loans tells us one in 700 people suffer from a phenomenon known as "anesthetic awareness", where the patient remains awake but paralyzed during surgery. One such person is unfortunate Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), who finds himself awake during a heart transplant ... and he can feel every slice. <br /> <br /> Intermittently inventive as he gropes away at his tortured psyche, Awake can not give a true horror in his new parcel. Spirals of chilling simplicity in an absurd plot, it prevents unnatural twists of Christensen and Jessica Alba. You have you popped a sedative before watching ?? <br /> <br /> Results: Awake is at best a very unpretentious. And do not pull no punches film that is sure to look better on paper. As the film, although it is a very versatile and extremely derivative. Awake can not pay the horror in his new parcel. The end result is really quite bad. Alba and Christian are at least of your worries as the films main drawback is its inability to scare its audience. Awake movie you are likely to sleep through.
