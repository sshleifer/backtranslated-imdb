If someone is remaking a classic film, a remake is always unfavorable in comparison with the original. In addition, there is a chance that a remake differs so radically that it is simply too unfamiliar to the audience. <br /> <br /> Well 1973 TV version of "Double Indemnity" is almost identical scenes and dialogue, as in the 1944 original, the main difference is that the remake just does not seem to have any energy at all. McMurray was as big as a lecherous, leering insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Tilt just seems tired and weary. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role MacMurray boss Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a great actor, it seems almost tired of the production. Samantha Eggar's not as insidious, back stabbing Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was just amazing in this role godless, Eggar overly polite and well-mannered, and only seems to come from a place. <br /> <br /> Robert Webber, in the old role of Richard Gaines as Robinson boss Norton and John Fiedler assumes the role of Porter Hall as a key witness, bring life to the cinema. In particular, Webber recreates the role of Norton and in the 1970s context. <br /> <br /> However, after the film begins, it all just sort of lying there, without any life or electricity. This is one movie that never had to be redone.
