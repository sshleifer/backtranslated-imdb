Cute and playful, but the lame and cheap. «Munchies» Gremlins is another clone to come out of the 80s. I'm not a big fan with imitations. <br /> <br /> In the first place it was great "Gremlins." <br /> <br /> Then there were very average "small animals". <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the lousy «Ghoulies». <br /> <br /> But the full pit will have to go to the "houses". <br /> <br /> there is ?? <br /> <br /> Currently, "Munchies" for me it would fall somewhere between "Ghoulies" and "houses". In fact, I probably found it more interesting than «Ghoulies», but I prefer a darker tone THST her. <br /> <br /> From the get-go, he plays a goofy character (it is better for it), but because of the nature of unnatural acts (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), you can get quite powerful, that you rather just see Munchies running amok. That's where the most interesting. Basically a light-hearted fluff, though, as the story mainly focuses on Munchies (or who are hungry, horny and destructive) in a whole heap of alleged comic encounters (some things do work) in a small desert town, a couple of people on the hunt. It's silly, but surprisingly attractive thanks to vigorous stimulation. These creatures themselves are pretty bland and poorly detailed, as they are the main doll being tossed about. Where they face the profits from the fact that they can actually talk ... and attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton, and malicious Nadine Van der Velde (which was "Critters") Picard also floats were fair conclusions. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles.. <br /> <br /> Interestingly with low-cut entertainment for the lowly.
