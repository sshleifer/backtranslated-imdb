I just watched this movie, because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in the special forces. But it's not Special Forces. SWAT was a plot and some charming characters and meaning. The bullfighter was not one of them. <br /> <br /> I should have realized that it could not be any good in the end, always hurt badly Michelle Forbes had a major role. <br /> <br /> One poster here called the film awkward. Another called it the worst film ever. Both gave the film too much credit. I'm so glad that I got it from the library for free, but I still feel ripped off. <br /> <br /> IMDb must include the "0" in "this film speed" voice only for movies like this one.
