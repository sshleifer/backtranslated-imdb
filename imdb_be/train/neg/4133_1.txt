I watched this movie with my friends a couple of months ago, I still laugh now to think about some of the utter stupidity. The first few scenes, some were funny. I will not do anything for those who want to see him screw up, I would not want to ruin a laugh. Needless to say all the time, I was watching this film, I tried to find out exactly what the characters in this movie makes a point of something. In the end we are all tired, but as the initial shock of fun and movies being the occasional disappearing. There is no plot, and not a trace of decent action. Symbols about as well developed as in the "Learning to read" kindergarten book. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting.
