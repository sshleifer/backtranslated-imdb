Eytan Fox, while in general, based on the apologist side of Israeli politics, has made quite a few interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and in a wonderful film, "Yossi & Jagger". In «Bubble», however, he accepted the illogical and unjust approach to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Far from giving the film a standing ovation, people on the screening I attended quietly got up and left. I also quietly walked away, fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one-sided film, which translates self-preservation, as racist bullying and racist bullying (and terrorism) as a flash of anger justified; which means that the Arabs as evil hurt the Israelis that they react in anger to a steady stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and that they, therefore, should not be held accountable for their actions. <br /> <br /> This film is not worth the money I paid for the ticket (in fact, I thought, demanding the return of money), and was mainly Israeli apeing Palestinian film «Paradise Now». If you want to be anti-Israel, then by all means watch this movie, because it really justify just such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, worse still, such a talented Israeli film director, it's a crying shame. In fact, just as Israel may be surprised, it can be regarded as a rogue state, if the Israelis themselves do such anti-Israeli propaganda, beggars belief. <br /> <br /> What a shameful, horrible little film!
