Early film directed by D.W. Griffith; it has a nice happy King (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the King leaves the stage, his Queen makes music with menestrmsya Palace (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers the lovers, he decides to take a horrific Edgar Allen Poe type of revenge. Hard to believe, an amateur can not hear those who plot against them; though the actors are trying to look alternately noisy (fan) and quiet (cement mixers). Sets make "sealed room" looks very staged. Performance in order, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** sealed room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
