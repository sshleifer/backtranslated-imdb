I liked the performance of Boyle's, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. Everything was exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke the way you expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak, if he pretends to be exhausted, the stone heart of the police, or the ultra-evil villain. In a hoarse voice-overs, it seemed amateurish to me. I could go and buy a cheap synthesizer and turn the best music discovery. And with all the things 1984ish police torture? It was completely unnecessary and has nothing to do with the actual events of history. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, he seemed to think that it would be really great, but I had nothing to do with this story. It's a big disappointment, because one of the things that makes the stories of Borges as well its minimalism - are closely linked, without unnecessary details. This film is just the opposite. I stopped watching after the scene where the guy with LÃ¶nnrot interrogates Yidische Zeitung, or so. I spent $ 4 rent, but at least I can get some pleasure from writing this review, and we hope to save others from making the same mistake.
