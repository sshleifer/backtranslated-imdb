Pakage means that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn will pull off a huge bank robbery, but that's not what I got from him! I got nothing! In the first half, a new character (without the introduction) in any other place. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, and the rest only one long, annoying, underlit chase scene. There's always annoying sound in the background, whether it's loud ticking clock, A roar of sirens, train whistling, or even a terrible rating Quincy Jones. There are many details that are laughably bad, too. Like, bad guys chasing Beatty on thin ice from the car! Or, the police arrive on the scene about fifteen times. I really hated that movie!
