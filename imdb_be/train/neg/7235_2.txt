Not even Bob Hope, accompanied by a raft of great actors of character, can save this poorly written attempt wartime comedy, as his patented little time, which is to work. The plot includes Hollywood movie star named Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of the Second World War, and then his recruitment by mistake in a confused attempt judicial colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Agent Bolton, playing Lin Overman, and his assistant, Eddie reflected marriages, enlist with him and three are involved in various adventures with respect to training exercises shot in Malibu, California, hills. Paramount in handsomely budget for this effort by using some of their best talent, but the direction of usually reliable David Butler was sluggish, and it must be related to the missing element of comedy in the script. The shift towards the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroic Bolton is stillborn bad stunt operation and effect as proof chamber. Ironically, Lin Overman are the best lines and the veteran master of ridicule makes them very well. Dorothy Lamour looks great and works beautifully as well, and it's always nice to see and hear Clarence Kolb, like her father, whose voice is unique on the screen or the radio, but they can do little to save the film, as the cursed it is an error in the appointment of the script.
