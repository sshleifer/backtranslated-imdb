This movie kind of reminds me of Mary-Kate and Ashley movie worse. Only the rich sister pretend that I think that even if Alysons great actress in this movie, Amanda Michalka was good, but sometimes Alysons action smelly. I think the musical them after high school had to come up with somethihng better, and it's definitely not the case. The plot was not so great, and I think they were supposed to get two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this film does not make me like it better. I think they should definitely sick to sing and just watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which, unfortunately, I did not)
