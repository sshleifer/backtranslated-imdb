Once again I took a chance and rented this sack of shit. Billed as a horror film, there was not a single scene and not one that even remotely afraid. NOT ONE !! Of course, there is some need, but all lesbian action got a little old. I think maybe that was suppose to be the saving grace of this film? And Dan, which is annoying bum bag !! From the beginning I knew that in this case, if the good ol 'Dan said the first. He was suppose to be scary? Who laugh !! In general, this movie awful awful! How in the hell do movies like this get done? If you want a movie with a few thrills in it, rent it. This film is about as exciting as Teletubbies.
