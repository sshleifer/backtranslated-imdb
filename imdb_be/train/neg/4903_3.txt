I never a big fan of film production to Taiwan, unlike Korea, Hong Kong or China. Strong quality of action is unlikely to them, as is clearly shown in this film. I do not consider myself a hard-to-please audience, like me, in fact, a supporter of indie films. However, this film shows the weak plot and slow pace. I discovered that he had lost in the middle of where the story goes. Actions, of course, does not make it better. Rainey acting is sub par, as it "over-act", trying to be cheerful and cute. Although I must admit that it is a pleasure to watch. Isabella Leong on the other hand, plays a more appropriate role as confused, sad, very unfortunate restrained. Overall I think that this film is a disappointment.
