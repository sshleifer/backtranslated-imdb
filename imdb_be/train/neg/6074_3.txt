What a bad film. I am very surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes will be associated with something like this. If you are going to make a film that includes baseball and shows the scene in baseball, at least, make the action look more realistic. Why the crowd has always stood for no apparent reason during the game? Possible Spoiler *** *** The last scene in the movie .... what was it? We somehow led to believe that DeNiro found its way onto the field in the form of an arbitrator, and the game is even played in a torrential downpour .... one of the worst ever in a sports movie scenes. 3 stars out of 10.
