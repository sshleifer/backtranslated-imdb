"Laugh, Clown Laugh", released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito raised a foundling (young and beautiful Loretta Young) in adulthood, and the names of its Simonetta. Tito picked up the girl in circus life, and she became an accomplished dancer. while Cheney gives his usual great performance, I could not get over the fact that Tito, now in middle age, so pleased for the young Simonetta. Despite the fact that he is not her biological father, he raised her as a daughter. This kind of "ick" factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes for the Simonetta passion with a young and beautiful "Count" Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls on the young man, but feels guilty because of the failure of Tito (out of loyalty rather than romantic love). The whole premise of the movie is ridiculous, and I find it strange that no one in the film does not tell Tito that silly old fool he is (as long as it does not open its own at the end). The film is mentioned only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career. While I love CHANEY shine as an actor, the whole film seems to me, and only very terrible.
