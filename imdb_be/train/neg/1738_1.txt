This unfortunate film remake of 1927 film. They have to let it stay that way. <br /> <br /> What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks Sun reflects absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero exposed role as a real jerk and Betty Grable sings with chorus- What am I going to do to that the Hungarian! <br /> <br /> A funny story deals with the image of women in the castle 1561 Rome, which saved the day, killing the invaders. (Fairbanks) Now, let's fast forward 300 years later, where Grable, has just married the Count Romero, faced with a similar situation, when her wedding night, there is an invasion of the Hungarian soldiers. <br /> <br /> Romero acts cowardly and running before the army's arrival. He disguises himself as a gypsy and made to stay in the castle, where his violin game pleases Fairbanks. The ending is worse than all the poor film Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news, angry Romero annulment. <br /> <br /> The poor imitation of the film was made in 1948, Harry Davenport, veteran support a player who is in it, died in 1949; this should be his last film. That the bomb to get out of after a remarkable career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel co-stars, but there was little he could do with such bad writing. Costumes are more similar to those that emerged from the Stone Age. I can not understand that Fairbanks was wearing.
