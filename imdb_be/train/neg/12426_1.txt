Anyone who thought that the other film Home Alone is a good idea, should have their head examined ... the same story, a wonderful child, greater foe (which leads to more infinite stupidity in traps). Two other films were bad enough, and this is where it hits rock bottom. People may also see other movies for the plot, as it is all the same.
