Jennifer ticket office (Jean Phillips from "Dead and Breakfast") back into the house she grew up, where she recently inherited from his late sister, unbeknownst to her grandmother (Dunaway), who still lives there. Jennifer decides to sell it, it is in dire need of money unfortunately Grandma. She also begins to experience unpleasant recurring nightmares of a mysterious crow. There really was no one to relate to this movie. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, unsentimental and self-centered, while the grandmother seemed angry, boring and narcissistic. The film is good and well made, but with no one to sympathize with me it was hard to care about what happened to them <br /> <br /> My rating :. C-
