The plot of "Edison" was decent, but one actor in particular, ruined the entire movie. Justin Timberlake spoiled movie with every line he spoke during the film. He is definitely one of the worst actors I've ever seen, and the same fate should be addressed, and that the whole F.R.A.T. National team. <br /> <br /> Was this emotional scene, the moment of action, or even dumb, Justin Timberlake managed to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this movie. Do not even bother downloading, midget porn would be a much better choice. <br /> <br /> And Justin, if you're reading this, stick to music. Even if you have nothing good that you have done an excellent job of tricking people into thinking you can sing.
