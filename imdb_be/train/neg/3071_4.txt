I discovered that the characters are mediocre and uninteresting story. I should never have read this book (thankfully), and it would be a painful experience. I got tickets to the preview is free, but it's still not worth my time, or my friend. I think that this story is not worth talking about. It is said that old people have a past before they aged (not kidding). The life of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation is better than the next by avoiding stupid mistakes. Nevertheless, I think that the actors have done all we could with a lame story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review to counteract the positive feedback on that, unfortunately, convinced me to give this film a try.
