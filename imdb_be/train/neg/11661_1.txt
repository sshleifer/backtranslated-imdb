Basically, it's a long, unfunny, Action / Comedy. First of all I would like to say that I really enjoyed the Wayans brothers Scary Movie (1) and it was a continuation of moments. Unfortunately, white chicks do not even put HALF laughs. <br /> <br /> Humor absolutely raw. If you want to belching, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look at it. If this is not raw, it's idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the film are all handed to me by a serious quite simply idiotic. <br /> <br /> However, I watched the whole thing, because I was with a friend (otherwise I would not bother). History, of course, fine, it was in a terrible film also, but there is at least a laugh were quick and adults. I think this is probably one of the main problems, as with this film, laughter does not come quickly enough. Some jokes are tightened too long when they are more disgusting than funny in the first place. If you prefer a comedy with a few brain cells, just avoid it. If you want a silly comedy with lots of laughter, then watch scary movies, airplane, HOTSHOTS 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is quite serious, thin plot, the film, which seems to be based on a single idea (what if we are dressed in white chicks for the film?), but simply did not have enough material.
