I mean, I thought I heard the dialogue in the film, but it was so bad, and the place that I can not believe it. I laughed so hard that must have been the worst thing to write and act in human history, I was seriously concerned that I might have a heart attack and die right in the theater. <br /> <br /> So it's a scene that I mean, the "hero" just looked like his brother an accident and his brothers car exploded right there just feet from him (the hero). "Hero" threw expected "appropriate" to see something so tragic, and people tried to keep him from his work in the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the middle of seizures and uncontrollable rage / emotional outburst down he says: "I'm so sad," - he said the wrong Am I crazy?
