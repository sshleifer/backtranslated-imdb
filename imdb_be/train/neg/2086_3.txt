Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired areas (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in his capable hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days Seven Nights) show signs of life and humor that make it worth a look. So I was disappointed that Reitman may not take quite an original story (a man dump superhero, superhero superpower gets fed revenge), and shape it into something nice. "Girlfriend" is an exercise in pointlessness. One trick pony length in the tooth portion after the first 20 minutes. The film can not decide whether to be a romantic comedy or drama superhero. A result of the film between the two trigger or an aspect to be made very well. Uma Thurman top, as usual, and Luke Wilson pulls a role as well, though his antics Slacker tire quickly. What's even more crazy is that in some scenes (for example, if very exciting Minds knocks the head through the wall), you feel clever, raucous Reitman opus practically screaming to get out. But after a few seconds, the magic is lost, gone just as quickly as the superhero, whose films are disappointing in almost every way.
