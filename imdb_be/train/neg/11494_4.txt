Richard Dix big, not very good industrialist, who almost brought himself to death. When he takes leave of his doctors offer for him, he can find happiness in the last months of his life? Well, he is likely to be better if he does not take into account the vote WHISTLER. <br /> <br /> This William Castle directed entry has some great moments (introduction and depiction of life Richard Dix through newsreel Ã  la Citizen Kane), and some intriguing sketches in the final reels. Dix's performance is usually pretty good. But, unfortunately, just does not quite work, because one does not end up buying that characters will behave in such a way that they do. In addition, the film turns dark (and exciting start) to almost cheerful 30s movie like tummy (full of good urban ethnic types who do not mind that they are not rich) and back to the complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so < br /> <br /> It is a good film. - worth a look - but you need a little more time to set ran a couple of characters and female role, able to satisfy the demand of its role.
