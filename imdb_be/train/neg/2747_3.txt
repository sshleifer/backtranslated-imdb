I knew it would be, but I gave him the rent for a few laughs and maybe some mindless fun. Everyone who has read some of my reviews you will see that I'm pretty easy to please. I really do not think I would end up feeling that it adversely in relation to him. <br /> <br /> The story of the ancient army of dragons are huge serpent, which is not to destroy the world, when some selected characters, inherited responsibility can ?? to become one with ?? good dragon ?? or something ?? I do not know. It was so stupid, I did not bother to put a lot of effort in maintaining it. <br /> <br /> He has a very dull story full of funny moments and wacky concepts. So many of the events just felt completely random and unexpected. <br /> <br /> I believe, had a studio interference or something, because the biggest problem I have with the film is the fact that the story seems to be that he was trying to be so big and epic, but everything happens so fast and It passes so quickly. I feel like I've just been hit a million plot points and action sequences into one big ball. The film is like a punch in the face. It does not take much time at all to set the characters or the drama. Imagine "Lord of the Rings" trilogy in 90 minutes ?? You could have the most epic battle sequences, but would not have been absolutely no swing, and you're unlikely to care about the outcome of these battles. This was the case with Dragon Wars ?? 90 minutes, I do not give a crap, expecting that it will be more. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI with some directing okay but terrible actions, rapid pacing, and dumb history has made it very difficult to use for any reason, I probably would have loved it when I was 6.
