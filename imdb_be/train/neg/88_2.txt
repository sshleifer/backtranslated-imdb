I look forward to this film. Its a good family movie; However, if the team editing by Michael Landon, Jr. did a better job of editing, the film would have been much better. Too many scenes out of context. I hope that there is another film in the series, all of them very well. But, if you have one done, I ask them to take better care when editing. This story was everywhere, and it seems, has no center. Which is sad because the other films of the series were great. I love the story of Willie and Miss; they are both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the audience always enjoys a good love story.
