Absolute rubbish. The reason that this is not so scary because it deviated from the formula, but because the story was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> allegedly stars do nothing to solve the case - and neither did anyone else really - it's just a routine police work. . Utter tedious <br /> <br /> You were right to the end, hoping for a turnaround - and got nothing but a huge frustration. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of potential in that respect to the alleged abduction. Can private participation LT finally darken your mind? <br /> <br /> All the telltale signs were strangers doing it. But, of course, a genius as Lt C, at a constant conversation with an injured husband, will gradually uncover the diabolical plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room, and disguised the bridegroom finds the bride hides the body, and then the plants thin tips. This could be good. It was a waste of time.
