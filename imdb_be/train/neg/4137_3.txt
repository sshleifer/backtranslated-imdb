I have a high level of tolerance for stupidity, so I'm looking forward to it. He did not disappoint. Apparently based on the classic Carmilla Fanny, it's worth hunting father and daughter female vampire who fortunately happens to be traveling with them. Then we have a Santa Claus (or the general, as he likes to be called here) is working on a random zombie. I've been there a zombie outbreak? The dead come back to life, but no one seems too concerned. We have a construction worker zombies, zombie soldiers and even St.Trinian schoolgirl zombies. Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter, who was turned into a vampire. Oh wait NO vampire girl in a madhouse Carmilla and her nurse, or is it? Zombies are back and crazy Santa. Lesbian sex, I love vampires and I love zombies, but I particularly like lesbian sex. Nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing. If we see the vampires fight zombies? Is she a vampire or she is a lunatic? Or what? Carmilla is a hot lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. St.Trinian here come the zombies. Chainsaw time !! More lesbian zombies that kill and eat vampires. I believe that the zombies win, or do they? The plot? Who needs plot when you have received a lesbian vampire and zombie schoolgirl? And cunnilingus?
