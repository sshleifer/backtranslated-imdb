Well, if you have a few hours to spend, or if you just really hate my life, I'd say, watch this movie. If anything, it's good for a few laughs. Not only do you have with obesity, topless natives, but the special effects are so bad, they probably illegal in most states. Seriuosly, the rating «PG» quite humorous as well, if you see a Native porn Extravaganza. I would not give this film to my late nephew. You might not even show this Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy, and clichés, and it and dumb. Actions are terrible, and the ending is so painful to look at, I really began to pour salt in my eyes just to take my mind off of my idiocy fill the TV screen.
