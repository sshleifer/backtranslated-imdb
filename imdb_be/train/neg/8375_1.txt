America. The land of freedom, hope and dreams. It is a country which, since independence, sought to bring democracy, prosperity and peace in the world, for the benefit of all mankind. There are times, however, when one can not help but wish that the Americans just stay on your side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This "cinema" (and I use this word with some reservations) causes these feelings with intense purity. This vision of hell about the adventures of Calvin, quaint gem thief, which was created by joining the severed head Wayans body two feet tall dwarf. After carelessly throwing off a large diamond in the purse of Vanessa, a career woman who does not want to have children, Calvin understands that in order to recover the diamond, he should buy it. So, like any normal person would, Calvin puts itself as a 2-year-old and parks himself on the verge of a poor woman, where he found Daryl, in a pensive husband of Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Daryl disproportionately falls on a disguise, Calvin, in spite of the fact that the "child" has a full set of teeth, hair, tattoos, knife-scar, and sex drive of a 16-godu- old. Even more absurd, Vanessa can not see past Calvin wear baby or really trying to breastfeed miniature pervert. This unfortunate attack on the soul of mankind attempts, and fails, to find humor in the rape, scatology, sexual abuse and pedophilia, however, dishonest attempt to turn himself into a part of the "family entertainment" in the Wayan brothers stir in nauseating number of feelings and perverse morals . <br /> <br /> Brothers faded Freudian attempts to rehabilitate them thieves rapist, showing that he was "bad father". Repeatedly hitting Daryl crotch allows Calvin to develop a loving father-son relationship that he and Daryl always wanted. As if that was not funny enough, Calvin attempted to sexual assault Vanessa a way to convince her that it's selfish for a woman to pamper yourself with a successful career, and that instead she should spend his life playing the role housebound little woman who spends his time as an alternative to squeezing the child and cooking for her husband. <br /> <br /> In this film Wayan brothers mixed them dull and twisted form of humor along with the sentimental clich√© that struck a large part of the recent Hollywood body of work. In addition, they are endemic in the current generation of black comedians, who are responsible for the transformation of the African-American humor in a poor and pathetic shadow of himself, that is more or indulge fart jokes and crude sexual jokes. According to the law, these two should be legally prohibited from charging anything even remotely resembling a camera ever. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, currently the artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that by this time next month, they will undoubtedly shoot two sequels and make millions of dollars from the sticky merchandising deals.
