I do not remember leaving the theater, but this once. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go. Uninteresting storyline, characters from clay, violence, without a point. I do not care when they died the good guys; I do not care where the bad guys got. Fantasy and magic were laid on thick as pudding and liver was not coherent. In short, fine entertainment, if you happen to spend eternity in hell.
