If this is your first time experiencing the miracle of a movie, if you've never seen «Moving Picture» before, you will think that this film is a descendant of the gods. BUT, if you saw the movie, TV show, even Barney dinosaur, then you will not be very impressed by this film. Heck Barney the dinosaur was more realistic than the Dinos in this film. <br /> <br /> Now, I, as a B movie. I just watched «Giant Gila Monster" right before I watched this swill, and I liked the film a lot better. It works like a B movie. It has a lamer dialogue, hokier action, cheesier effects and honest real hell Gila monster, the monster! Carnot 3 just does not pack much of the B movie hit. It has some gore, and that Polchek guy approaching entertaining several times, but this film was destroyed, almost .... sluggish. It's the little engine that could not Dinosaur movies. I'm not saying that you should not watch movies. <br /> <br /> Some people may look dry gum on the pavement and feel entertained. If you are one of those people, then give this film a shot.
