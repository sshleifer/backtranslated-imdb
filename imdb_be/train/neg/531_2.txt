The list of the cast like this, I was expecting much better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the movie while lying in bed. Best actress in the world can do something very interesting if their actions are limited to lying and sleep throughout the film. Plot summary says that the secret is revealed daughters, their mother comes closer to death. The fact that she never tells her daughter nothing but mysterious tips to be happy. All relationships in the undeveloped film. I also felt that the back and forth between past and present was not necessary. It seems that this idea has been stolen either from the book The Da Vinci Code, in which the device has been used to increase the suspense, or from a notebook, in which they used the tool to create an infinite novel the main characters of the narrative. In any case, it was a cheap device in this film, because it does not work to create something. It was a way to try and suspense in a film that does not have one. I left wondering why good movies can not be written for women. It was really disappointing.
