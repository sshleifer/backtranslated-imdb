The really scary movie. I originally did not know that it was an attempt Kiwi - but I soon began to realize that all the characters spoke with barely disguised Kiwi accents under the false American. Why should it be found n America anyway? - it could be set in New Zealand, and then the actors could use their normal voices. Of course, someone on the production team could hear the terrible attempts to speak with an American accent? Bad bad movie. I'm surprised that it lasted so long - how does it make it out of the jar? It just seemed like a very bad attempt at Segal / Willis action type human flick.A waste of money! If you have any taxpayers' money in this part of the garbage, I would leading a revolution in order to have all the money put back in the treasury. I still did not move (get it? Pun, reeling!) I've ever seen in absolute garbage. Why do I keep watching? Well, I'm a fanatic movie and I can not help myself!
