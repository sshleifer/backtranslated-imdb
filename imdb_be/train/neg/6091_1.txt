I bought this film exciting nice gratuitous, over the top, entertaining bloodshed. I is not got none of them. This film will not work on almost every level, no less scary or funny, it's just a scary movie production, and never gives the audience with nothing worth seeing. What's so bad about it that is not as raw, violent and hard as it promised to be, there is very little violence in general. Virtually no blood shed, and no excitement at all. Acting, direction and dialogue are absolutely intolerable. Honestly, it's really funny. I could hardly sit through this common trash once; Of course, I never want to see him again. Do not waste your time with celluloid waste, as it is; it is indeed possible, the worst film ever made. If I could give it a negative star I would.
