Audrey, I know that you really cherish the memory of your husband Ted but please, his legacy of justice and to listen to his wishes. Dr. Seuss has refused to license their characters throughout his life for very good reasons. We ask you to please stop preying on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are gutting of contain Hollywood and Broadway. Baby tomorrow will be stuck with these actors' and grotesque interpretations that pollute forever loving warmth and innocence of his books. <br /> <br /> This is really your property to make as you want. I just want you to listen to the advice of others for some time. Save what is left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
