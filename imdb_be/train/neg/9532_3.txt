So this guy named George is sitting at home alone on his birthday, when two women are. George's wife is in the hospital, taking care of his son, so when my wife is away, George gets into a bubble bath and makes love to both girls. It is not that great scene because it really does not show anything. After that, the birthday boy wakes up the next morning, and the girl is still in his house. They make it a good breakfast, but George is not hungry. George was not very happy, and he's trying to destroy them, but when he returned home the girl was still in his house. The girls have had enough with the old George and did not want to cook for them. They both provide basic psychopaths and use George in her little crazy game. I liked that girl just did what they wanted, and messed up the home of George. George was not really that great of his two guests. When George said that he was a married man, he really did not seem to mean it. George looked like Tom Thacker on Family Guy. I was at the two girls all the time.
