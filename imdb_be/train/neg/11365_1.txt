This is a very sad movie. In fact. Nothing happens in this film. The script is bad !!! I think they just copy-paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages. Producers should consider, let's create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They failed. Now in the third week, he only works in Antwerp and Brussels, 22h45 or something. In the past we have had some really good movies in Belgium as Daens. Shades is a waste of time. Maybe you could sneak into the theater after you've seen a real movie. If you have seen 10 minutes Shades, you've seen it all. It was declared to death by local radio and television. I hope that it will disappear in Shades quickly.
