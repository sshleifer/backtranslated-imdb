If you've seen other movies like this, they are probably better. Omega People come to mind. To the credit of the studio, they avoided the spread, unnecessary, big budget technofest, that the prototype of this kind of movies. In addition, the installation and the facilities were great: four people whose past has virtually nothing to do with us trying to get away from the overwhelming infection with a fatal outcome. What's wrong with the rest! I'm tired of the endless silly, sloppy, cowardly, ineffective, arrogant characters in the film. That pretty much describes everything in the movie at some point. I take it, and found myself yelling at the TV a few times, "No, do not do it!", "Why are you so stupid", "beware", and so on. Currently, the lack of character development appears about halfway in. The film should give you a strong personal relationship with at least some of the characters, so you really do not care what happens to them. This one does not. In addition, there had to be more, more zavlekayusche end of the film as well.
