Some of the worst, the least natural acting performances I've ever seen. That is not surprising, given the awkward, lame dialogue given characters one remarks. Add to this the cheap production values, and you have a film that does not look like she even belongs on television. Nobody expected much from the Lifetime movie, especially one that old, but it is almost unwatchably bad. <br /> <br /> The plot-wise, it's horrible, formulaic romance Harlequin type would even consider beneath them, can assume the rest of the film will go just watching open a couple of scenes. Surprisingly, the only female character who gets all the focus and the mysterious stranger eventually fall in love.
