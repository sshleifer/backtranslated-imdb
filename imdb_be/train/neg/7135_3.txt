I am sorry to say that there is not really any way to, in my opinion, that Enzo would really be able to keep up with the Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The weight force will receive the benefits of S7 may be too large. S7 has the power: weight ratio of 3.93 lb / hp while Enzo is 4.61 lb / L. S7S the lower end of a lot better, too. Unfortunately Ferrari fans but Saleen just gets it done much better. <br /> <br /> As for the other parts of this movie, I have to say that it is so substandard, to be miserable. History is too weak. To act in this lemon worse than the soaps in the daytime. <br /> <br /> I can say that as far as it is a treatise on his kind of gem negative psychology. This film is nothing if not blatant determination is that narcissism and sociopathic all about. Its all about these rich punks get their rocks off, showing only traces of feigned repentance for all the innocent road users that they cause injury or death, too. <br /> <br /> I can not give the film "1 star" rating, because it is not made me actually get out of the theater. I also believe that, with surprisingly beautiful brunette with blue eyes killers, as the leading woman saves it from complete deplorable .... although there is no way of her singing was to put her on the cover of «Variety». <br /> <br /> PS: the guy who plays Jason SOOOOO version of skid row James Vanderbeek.
