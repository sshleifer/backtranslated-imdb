Definitely a product of young minds, this part may well apply to the crowd the 20s, which is still trying to find its place in the world, while enthusiastically every neurosis. Nevertheless, I can not imagine that heavy amount of narcissistic navel scrutiny, banal humor, or a banal object will be particularly attract any more than 30. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, which the filmmakers clearly have nothing but contempt for that bloated to such absurd caricatures for comic effect, they can not be Relatable any real way. <br /> <br /> However, one has to give some style points for the creators of the film, which obviously raised in the video generation and use every conceivable editing trick in the book to dress up otherwise non-existent plot, there are 2 points to remember here. First, beware of the darlings of the festival. Second, despite the fact that we live in the era of YouTube account is each worldly life deserves big- screen processing. But these young filmmakers have every right to make the film, and if the other 20 might find something in it to identify with, then all the better. However, I could not help but think that at the end of this film, as the last generation, only now of age, will live in the real world, which is so many problems and complications. In an age when every child is constantly reassured how special they are, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resilience and ability to cope with adversity does not exactly seem to be a strong point of this generation.
