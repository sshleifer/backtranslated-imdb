I can sum up this film with 20 words or less. Way too predictable from the storyline with the potential to be funny, but instead falls flat on his face. Look, 19 words, but I'm not completely panning the film with only one star, but instead decided to raise it to two stars because of the fact that Julie Bowen smoking only hot enough and provided eye candy to keep me from copying DVD-simply out of the car and blow it up to the M80. My advice is to take a rental fee of $ 4.00 you would pay to see this movie and just send it directly to me as a thank you in advance for what saves you time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck, or you can email me for replacement for $ 50.00, you would be charged from taking their twelve track to use this piece of garbage like plates shooting practice.
