«Ambushed» not ordinary action flick. It is very bad to be ordinary. One person goes to another with a machine gun blazing. Another man fired one round and knocks a person with more firepower, not so much as a nick with a hail of lead came down on him. Guess which one is the good guy. Duh. Such «Ambushed» through. Not good action movie, not a good drama, not a good movie, «Ambushed» will not work at all levels with the throwing of a B-movie veterans mechanically passing through traffic almost as if they know what they are doing real loser . Not recommended for those who are. <br /> <br />
