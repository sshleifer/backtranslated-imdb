This 30-minute documentary film Bu√±uel made in the early 1930s, one of the poorest regions of Spain, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, let us recognize that in 70 years, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring its own problems, like excessive individualism and consumerism, but all in all abundance is far better state than is portrayed here in extreme poverty). And if poverty is waste in Spain it was not exactly born with Bunuel favored socialism, but with the Western style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the film is as follows: in one scene, the narrator chides that school children learn the value of Pi. Mathematics Education for the poor people, the horror!. Bunuel myopia is at its most striking here, not realizing that access to the latest knowledge and technologies that will help the poor to overcome the situation. What does it offer? What children learn is that in school? Nha Bunuel understood that the lack of modern technology, making them poor in comparison with other people?
