Simply put, I do not like westerns. And they never sat through one from beginning to end, I decided not to watch "My Darling Clementine" and see all the way to the end, no matter how painful it was for me. At first it was painful, as expected. I have found that actor to be funny, decoration (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and the timing of its teetering on the edge of the disease. However, after the incendiary thoughts speaks fight after the first 20 minutes, he was quite a bit easier for me to endure. Focus on Film, and John Ford managed to make even a sad situation (dim for me, that is) looks absolutely stunning from time to time, made it much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not go so far as to say that I enjoyed the movie before the end of this. However, this was done well enough for me to sit all the way to the end, and that in itself is impressive to me.
