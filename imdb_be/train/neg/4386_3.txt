with a name like that, you know, do not expect a great horror film. But it was very bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: ex-offender is a Halloween mask, so that everyone around him thinks someone else. This joke can actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not throughout the film! actors are not so bad, but their characters are quite dull and boring story, and completely stupid. A lot of uncertainty, there is no risk and little gore (very cheap). Satan's Little Helper tries to combine terror (...) with the comedy and dramatically fail in this. It was so boring until the end, I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I could not take care of no matter what happens. Amanda Plummer was the biggest in Pulp Fiction, but come on .. it was 13 years ago, and she did a decent then did not. So it is not surprising that she had drowned as low as this piece of shit .. Avoid or be warned ..
