Italian horror film / suspense film about a rich English lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair as well as his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know that it must be really loved his wife, because he brings them into his house - a huge, rotting castle - and makes them undress and then torturing them, their whips, and kill them. The strangest aspect of this film for me was that somehow the end of the movie we see, this guy plays Antonio De Teffe as the hero of the film. Anyway, in the near future, on the advice of his uncle's Playboy Roberto Maldera, De Teffe settles with a girl he meets at a party of his uncle. It moves and strange things begin to occur in an unstable state De Teffe in mind. He begins to see and hear the dead wife, and finally, well, just look at the name, if you are still interested. In addition, family members and friends begin to die in the hard modes. Poor Aunt Agatha (it looks like it may even be younger De Teffe, and they have her in a wheelchair and tries to look old) meets his fate in fox fashion. Another person is injected, and then buried alive. And, of course, there is the whole explanation of why / how Evelyn did what she did. Director Miralem really do some things very well: the settings in the film are well suited for this film, but try to make us believe that England is laughable at best. None of the actors did not appear in English. Many have dark black hair and the Mediterranean and skin color to wear clothes Englishman would not be caught dead in. The cars drive on the wrong side of the road. But all that despite this, the basement scene effectively fired, and I also liked the cheesy resolution. And, of course, any movie with hot, red-haired Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a strip of sexual perversion; however, I have found some appalling idea that plagued the women were pretty good and healthy to offload one of his mental demons. Come on.
