This film is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of those movies that they show the child on a rainy day at school, when you can not get out to retrieve, and you would like to watch something, anything else. At least, that's what it was when I was in elementary school. I just remember hating this movie. Of course, I have not seen him for 15 years or so, and they probably will not use it on rainy days more, but I just want to warn all: You have to use it better to put the kids to bed, than entertaining them. Believe me, pick something else. Even if this topic is controversial in part, the story is so manual and slow, I can not remember anything about it except that I did not like it so much here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn you all against him,
