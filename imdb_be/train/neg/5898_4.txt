In principle, to accept the concept of every Asian horror movies and ghost break it down into one, and you get this film. The story goes like this: a bunch of college kids get a voice mail from their phones, heralding their deaths. There's some s *** happens with ghosts, which, if you've seen any Asian ghost film, not scary right now. This film was very exciting, because it's very corny. It's bullcrap, different movies. <br /> <br /> The action was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors are contained in the Ring-squire situation, so there is nothing that we have not seen in the past. Two major steps done serious work, though. <br /> <br /> As far as gore, there is not much going on. We get a cool sequence that includes arm twisting head (I do not know how else to explain it), but it was cut down, so that you do not see anything but the final result. You see blood in times, including headless zombies and weapons (which looked really cool, I might add), but this film is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The panic in the film is very small, and distributed and it is actually not so bad. You will get some horrible images at times, but it's not enough for me to consider frightening. This is nothing different from Ringu, Ju-On, or the dark water, and none of them scared me too. It is actually a fall of this (and the majority of Asian horror films), that it's just not as good if it does not deliver the scares. <br /> <br /> As for directing, Takashi Miike's still pretty good job. He seemed a bit tame in this film compared to his previous films, but it still reflects a lot of messed up his style he became famous. Many graphics were many like Miike (including a scene with lots of jars of dead fetuses), and the last 15 - 20 minutes, it seemed much more Miike, the rest of the film. Nevertheless, the movie spoiled it's not real. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it only for people who are huge in Asian horror movies (even if you are, I can recommend much better) or big fans of Miike. Warning for those who want to get into Miike, it was not his best work. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 because it's just mediocre. Maybe if it was released 4 or 5 years ago, it might be worth a higher valuation. <br /> <br /> Also, I'd like to **** about Asian real horror movies quickly. How, if the Asian horror film it automatically assumes to be good here (US)? Many of these films are the equivalent in Japan, Scream, Urban Legend, and I know what you did last summer have been here 90 years. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. And many of these films to hope too much panic and imagery, that if she does not deliver the horror stories they are taught to do things that they simply are not as good, and nothing will change that. Other Asian horror movies should be more Audition and the tale of two sisters, two films that, if they do not frighten or scare you, at least, they have a great story, acting, directing, cinematography, and more to support them, two films that are not only great horror movies, but great movies in general. More Asian horror movies should be like this, instead of the clich√©, "Ghost just like to know, so go kill people through their phone / movies / home / electric appliance / water pipes / Google search engine / vibrator / groceries / etc . ".
