If it hurts stop? I do not want to see another version of Christmas Carol again. They continue to make films with the same story, falling on each other, trying to make the movie better than the rest, but unfortunately not in a position to do so, because it's not a very good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative thinking happy. As if people find out. Many different versions of this film proves that we do not.
