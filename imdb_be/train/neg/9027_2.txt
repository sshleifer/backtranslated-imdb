Revenge on us public viewing possible. I sat through this film 2:00, and I was waiting for the second act, to die, so that the film lives up to its name. But Costner never avenge his lover fate she was dying, and the movie ends. I was wondering where the rest of the movie was. If a film called Revenge of the protagonist then better get some before the end of the film. I had a choice, or seeing it in the movie Black Rain, fortunately, I've seen the other brother in the movie theater caught instead.i with this turkey in the video. there was one good thing about the film and it was a beautiful theme tune. Listen cd.dont watch this it's terrible. 1 in 10
