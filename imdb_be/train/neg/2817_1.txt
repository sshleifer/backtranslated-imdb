Toba Hooper, quite possibly the biggest accident horror genre has to offer. Like any horror fan, I loved Texas Chainsaw, but I think that in order to put your name in front of the name of the movie, you have to have at least more than one hit movie. I can not think of any other film Hooper made (on its own, do not expect a poltergeist) that really influenced the horror genre or film world. And this film, Nightmares, just supports my point. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I give him credit, at least, does a good job with terrible material he was given. He did what he could. As for the film itself? Net Drudge. Unnecessary nude scene every five minutes, a story that should be written in our, in fact, simply a terrible landscape, music and cinematography. Nothing in this film are not redeemable. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> In general, 1 out of 10. I sympathize Hooper, his career, it seems like it was over before it really ever began. I hope that he is able to pump out at least one more good film, so he can do his cult status some justice. <br /> <br />
