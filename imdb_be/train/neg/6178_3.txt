Frank Tashlin «The Home Front» is one of the more lifeless Private Snafu shorts, cartoon series, made as training films for the military. Instead take some Snafu inappropriate actions leading to the accident, «The Home Front» instead focuses on his family home and how much they can offer to the war effort, too. Snafu realizes that he was wrong when he thought that they were easy. This concept is little scope for good gags and instead plays Tashlin risky card to a greater extent, extended jokes involving strippers and half-naked dancers in the place of a large effective comic. As a result of well-intentioned short, which has little relevance or entertainment value today except as a historical artifact.
