If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini-series, he would cry. It's a waste of time and money. I read the book, and even if the film is not quite what the book might be, CBS wasted time and money on this, and it is inconvenient to say that this work Ludlum. <br /> <br /> Maybe creator must check Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good the show was. <br /> <br /> The poor world, Blair, Angelico and Koly why they sign stoop so low? <br /> <br /> The Awful !!
