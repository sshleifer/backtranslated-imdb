This may not be the last film Mandy Schaffer. Somebody do something! .. :-( <br /> <br /> ARGH <br /> <br /> What little life may have been this one, finished off direction Do not blame the cast, they did OK winemaker Even younger. My brother was very well done and he did not even get into the movie until halfway. and please put Mandy in a few movies! She is too beautiful to bury his career at such a young age. Ya »Breakin 'My haht, heah .. .. <br /> <br /> Two specific criticisms, if someone cares (apparently no one liked this movie a lot). first, Tracy went on to appear in needs th moment melodramatic, to see what she had seen, and was never seen in his turn, was very annoying Hollywood. please stop giving attackers a perfect synchronization of luck, which works exactly when it's climax It's silly to write better scripts, so that you should not use this .. lame plot device more. If your script is not well enough to stand without it, it does not produce it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Carmen would not fall on to this trick fake injury that resulted in Tracy. She was already Tracy fingers. Worse record / direction there. <br /> <br /> I could smash this movie on, but prohibits mercy. In fact, I do not hate it as much as others seem to have. It just did not have many reasons to be made if it was not friendly vehicles to show an excellent Mandy. Oh, and one who did not think she was sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how can you say that she was not sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I do not think it's me. <br /> <br /> MORE Mandy. (Not to be confused with the "Moore, Mandy» - although I would love to see her again as ;-) <br /> <br /> PS. As I said, I hope that Mandy makes me more movies? <: - D
