I had to close it after about 15 disgusting moments .. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that it can improve, <br /> <br /> What I saw was poorly acted, directed and wrote. <, Br /> <br /> This film has never had even released directly to DVD,. <br /> <br /> The main character, which is the bride to be on top of the HELL is a huge ice sculpture of falling on her to kill her. It was such a disgusting person I was not even sorry for her. She winds it in some heaven, and was still repulsive, I left shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria reflects her & I hope that I will never see her again, she may not even act.She it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> actor Paul Rudd, who usually can not do anything wrong in this, too, was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer a teenager) is also present, <br /> <br /> I love comedy, but not stupid, stupid people on <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. * (C 4) 30 points (100) IMDb 2 (10)
