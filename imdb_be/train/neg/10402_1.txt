Well ... I have a tremor, the original began in 1990, and I found the film quite enjoyable to watch. however, they continued to do tremor II and III. Believe me, these films began rolling down immediately after they finished the first, I mean, ass blasters ??? Now, only God Himself is capable of answering the question "why in the name of the gods, they would have created another one of those garbage container film dives?" Shivers IV can not be regarded as a bad film, in fact it may not even be considered the epitome of a bad movie, because he lives up to over. As I tried to sit up, although it is, I noticed that my eyes started to bleed, and I was hoping the rich that a little girl from the ring will creep on TV, and to kill me. they really think they wear men who stare at others s films, yes, as if they we wild west would make a movie (with the same entries) is better? To be honest, I never would suggest to buy this movie, I mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
