The film begins with a voice over telling the audience where they are, and who the characters. And it is at that moment I began to love the movie. With all of the endless possibilities of any director have in hand, I do think it's very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice to speak through it. I actually believe the voice-over is to change the concept of photographic film. <br /> <br /> I do not want to hear the sound of words, where we are, we are the date, and especially the fact that the characters are feeling and thinking. I believe that the director must find a visual way to convey your feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after a bad influence intro, very strange film begins and continues to go for quite a long time. The life of a middle class family, and all members of the individual depicted in a perfect realistic. I think that the director has the talent to capture the real-life situations. For example, a father who has to make his personal calls with a bath may seem abnormal at first, but life itself brings us some of the situations that may seem abnormal, but also very fine, as well. I think the director is very good observer of real life. <br /> <br /> But this is it. After some time, the realism in the film begins to sacrifice speaking stories. I really felt that I had a big headache because of the non-stop characters speak. It was as if the actors and actresses got this theme were allowed to improvise dialog boxes. It really is actually, but the characters are always asking, "indeed, it is so," etc. with each other, or the characters say "no" or "you're listening to me," ten times, when they say that only once simply makes me have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think that the game is practicing and reading books scenes more, then they should be. I understand that the game and the book in the film is very strongly associated with the plot, but I think that the director missed the moment when it should stop running these scenes.
