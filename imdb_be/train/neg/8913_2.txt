When I first set up to this news this morning, I thought. "Wow, finally some fun" It was a bit funny for a week or so ... But we have to face it, these reporters (if you can even call them that) have too much 'playing' time. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought that Gillian had to breathe fresh air. But seriously, this woman has not the slightest journalist there. She is very unprofessional. It continues to breaking Steve, when he begins to inform the audience about a specific reporting. It's just actually become irritating to the fact that I can not watch it anymore. <br /> <br /> Gillian is not good journalist. Heck, it is more a celebrity who likes to be a celebrity. Thus, it is instantly transformed into a celebrity around celebrities, which it is supposed to be an interview. She was not very professional, and it is possible perceives its relationship with the celebrities more important than to be on the right insatiable journalist- and that's all I can say about it. <br /> <br /> In addition (disappointingly), this show is more entertainment than news the necessary news about the world, the US government, or something that will benefit and / or serve the best interests of the public. They are too focused on sensationalism, they're all talking about comes off as a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters interested tolerant ... <br /> <br /> I believe that «Good Day LA» for young teens and celebrities, and this is definitely not for people who really care about news. <br /> <br /> A side note :. (I actually prefer watching KTLA Nevertheless, they try so hard to be interesting, sometimes they are still a bit boring, but well, I'll stick with NBC ".. today." ABC's "Good Morning America" ​​too good to ... as long as Diane Sawyer became too severe.)
