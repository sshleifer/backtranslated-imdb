This film is the same as any other Dutch film, so if you like movies such as Turks fruit and De Kleine Blonde Dood. then you may be OK with it (even if those two have much better stories and actor) Zomerhitte starts strong enough, but even that one good scene ends that have nothing to do with the plot. There's a lot obnazhenok (but I and others simply could not find the girl attractive), funny dialog box (as we have done much to the annoyance of other movies observers), and some of the scenes are so completely random, it was more an unintentional comedy than anything another (eg, random scene in which an owl rips someone's eyes ... it has nothing to do with anything, and once referred to later in the sentence, the words "you know what happened ... I was there"). only the reason why I gave it a 2 because some of the places that Prices for a good view ... that's it. And the reason, I saw that it was because we went to a movie preview (here in Holland we have an amazing system with respect to the parasitic preview, you pay less money, for an ordinary movie, and you do not know what movie this is what you'll see. you all know that this new film, which is not yet in theaters). My advice is to stay away from this movie, if you really want to see a good Dutch film look temmink or zwartboek.
