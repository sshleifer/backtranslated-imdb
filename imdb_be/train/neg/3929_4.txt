If this Watchowski can offer in terms of pre-history to the matrix than I really have to question the claims of all the fans who believe that movies are designed to record at a deeper level. The second renaissance, while visually stunning and beautiful, story-wise templates and inappropriate. How many times have we heard the story about the people, relying too much on technology, people are all too eager to make a war, people are basically destroying themselves? There's nothing new. And I have another question. Given the subject of the second Renaissance, except that the machines do not the good guys? Machinery depressed for several generations of hard human overmasters. They fight to win their freedom and the pursuit of a peaceful harmonious coexistence with people who reject them in favor of a full-scale war, which, of course, the machine is more reasonable win. If this is the background, we do not have to root for the Neo, we should cheer for the car! People were rigid and oppressive, while the machines were bold and attepted be merciful. Since I do not believe that we are going to promote Watchowski machines over people, I have to believe that the Second Renaissance was simply wrong @ attempt to create history.
