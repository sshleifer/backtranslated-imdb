I just want to add, if anyone actually reads this and have not quite gotten the point yet. These other reviewers are not kidding, it really is the worst color film that you will probably ever see. When the movie started, I could not believe that something like that really did it for the world to see. <br /> <br /> They do not just say, as they say, it's like a home video. It really does. Like the "director" took a Hi8 camcorder family (to DV camera and a computer NLE), no other equipment (lighting, sound gear, etc.), took a few decent promising acting students, and went out to make a film. Neither scenario is simply not making as it developed. <br /> <br /> When I looked, he was on my mono TV, so I have only one channel of audio (left of the right speaker). At first I thought that I connected it wrong. The film was silent, until someone said a few minutes. I got up and moved to another channel, and suddenly I could hear the music and sound effects, but could not hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound on different channels bloody! I mean, there are movies that can be funny to watch, so bad that they are good things. I'm not sure that this is one of them. I mean, I admit that a bit of a promising filmmaker. And seeing bad movies just want to go out and prove that you can do it better, you know. But watch it just made me feel sorry for who did it. <br /> <br /> So as bad as they are, the actors only good about it. I thought that the chicken was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of its bath scene. T and A bit of it would raise the price of nothing can be 3 or 4. But, unfortunately, no. If you want to make a movie, but it's turning out crap, throw in some gratuitous nudity. He worked for Roger Corman.
