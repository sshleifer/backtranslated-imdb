Not really spoilers, in my opinion, but I would like to cover yourself, however. As executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the many absurdities of the character 10 Items Or Less, film deliberate indie-feeling, and simply be absorbed into the teacher / be-all-that-you-can -be topic. He plays the alternate universe, half-washed version of the real Morgan Freeman, who in the old driver in a small Econovan all paths in Carson, California from Brentwood to examine his next film role. Why Carson, is a mystery to star Cal residents. It could save a trip and went somewhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. Paz Vega is enough to observe a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz playing unhappy hiking piece to the great, but slow the local market, which apparently is the main source for research Moragn Freeman. His character known only as "his" hints at how the actors felt when they meet in real life, people-middle "Psst, that it is" his ", etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted by what He was all kinds of secular wisdom and advice, but there was no reliable return back to his home in Brentwood, entirely carried no cash or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him. If one has such a high evaluation of his personality, they believe that they have the answer to everything, just as he does, I need to see the cash Blackberry, reflecting the intelligence and good survival instincts to keep it a big ego, which he definitely is. Nothing much is happening in this movie. I do not believe that any of their meetings with each other have been substantially modified from the main character. He flirts with the idea of ​​adultery, but then the thought vanished. That to me was like the Steve Martin's Shopgirl, without sexual affairs. It was a self-indulgent to Freeman and unconvincing audience
