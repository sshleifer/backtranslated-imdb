always ever ever consider watching this pathetic excuse for a movie. he shot and lit up, acting, etc. just does not make sense. it's so bad, it is difficult to watch. loads repeated clips of boredom. there seems to be no "normal" people in the whole film, and the existence of "the outside world", well, it just does not exist. and why is this bald guy suddenly become invincible? this film of nonsense. zero.
