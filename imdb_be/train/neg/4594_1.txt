I had many problems with this film. <br /> <br /> It contains some basic factual information about quantum mechanics, which is good. Although quantum physics for more than 50 years, the film presents this information in a grand way, what seems to be saying, "Do not you just stunned by this," Well, not exactly. It's not earth shattering discoveries more. Anyway, I was already familiar with the quantum theory, and the fact that the particles must be described by wave equations, and so on is not new. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this film, however, is how these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I do not have any serious problems with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics actually has nothing to do with these things, and it should be stored separately. The people they interviewed for this film begins with the ideas of quantum theory, and then to make a leap to say that just thinking about something you can change matter around us, so we should think positively, so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better. Arguments are completely ridiculous, and conclusions logically follows from quantum theory. For each so-called "expert" that the interview for this film, there are many theoretical physicists who would strongly disagree. They show, rightly, that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not provide support of mystical ideas about our spiritual connectedness. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that people are going to see this movie and eat fully, because it leaves them with a good positive feeling. The main thrust of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory, and it is just as bad in the sense, as any attempt to justify an organized religion with similar pseudoscientific arguments. <br /> <br /> To avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah. At one point, one of the "experts" said that because throughout history the majority of people's assumptions about the world proved to be false, so the assumption that we currently hold about the world, is also likely to be false. And? It is absolutely not worth it. And even if this is so, I do not see how it helps his argument. I mean, when his ideas ever become a common assumption, then I think we have to assume that they are false as well, based on his own reasoning.
