Despite the fact that there is a repertoire of more than 180 films to choose from, this "succubus" is often called the best film of Jess Franco. Heck, even the legendary film director Fritz Lang believes «Succubus» among his personal favorites. So, maybe it's me, but I thought it was terribly boring and too complicated movie. Opening is great, though, and shows Janine Reynaud SM committing the act on stage. It's getting worse here, unfortunately. the nature of the Rhine is a cannibal, who eventually kills her lover in a trance. Franco was a decent budget to work with and spend it well in good locations, beautiful pictures and mesmerizing musical score. This could be his greatest film in fact, if it were not for the lame and uninteresting stories. It should be psychedelic, but I would say that babble better term to describe what is shown here. Half the time, you do not have a clue what was going on or what exactly it is written so that even a short period of time for 80 minutes, it seems the last age. This is certainly not the best film of Franco for me. I would not recommend it diehard fans operating. If you are looking for a superior film Jess Franco, try to get your hands on a "tasty Vampiras», «Horrible Dr. Orloff" or "vampire".
