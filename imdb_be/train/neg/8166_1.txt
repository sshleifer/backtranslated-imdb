I tracked down a copy of the Forest, because I was watching the VH1 special, I think, "Where are they now" and saw a flash video window on the screen during a segment on the actors Cork Pigeon. He played the male child ghost in this B horror terrible, but I remember it with the character of Freddy on the television show Silver Spoons. Flick it a major disappointment. There's nothing here. It actually took me four months to watch it from beginning to end. I kept stopping him into depression by setting it aside and forget about it, bumping into her and trying again to pass through it. It is obvious that the angle of the film, which was intended to set it apart from its peers was the supernatural element, the ghosts. And it is obvious that there is not working. I can not stand men leads. I keep expecting them to look down on the palms during long dialogue scene to read the cheat line. The situation at the outset, when couples decide to go hiking alone awkward and plain stupid. I believe that the only positive thing to say about this one scene where the guy falls and breaks a leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh. This is a pretty good gore makeup there. Man, I really do deliver positive now, yes. Not only film-budget horror at as bad as it is Home Sweet Home.
