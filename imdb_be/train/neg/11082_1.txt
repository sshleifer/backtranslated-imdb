I know it's a trick Power-Rangers and served 7-year-olds, but really, why they had to take himself seriously with this film? If they are going to write a story with a pencil, at least decency to do this is nonsense. It's kind of funny, when you look at it. We are a typical family filled with formulaic characters (father, a war veteran who lost his wife and blaming themselves LOLOL), air-head kids trying hard to fill a stereotype, but it fails with a terrible effect and ridiculously reverse the Sidekick, which serves no purpose in movie, but to fill the space of the camera. Funny stuff! <br /> <br /> However, the real great moment towards the end when the war dad and bad acting the villain trying to run a sword fight, but they do not understand, none of them do not know how (probably because there is no place in the budget for choreographers), so they came up with this installation type American Gladiator, to run around in. LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10 rating, because they are trying to take it seriously.
