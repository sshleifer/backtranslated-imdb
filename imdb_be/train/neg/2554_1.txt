To be honest I'm not even kidding when I say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen! It dosen't film has one ounce of originality in a contrived dialogue or clearly plagiarism storyline. I can not even count the number of things in this movie that obviously ripped off «The Omen" and other films like this. For example a nurse "Lucy" in this film is actually one of the minions of the devil, sent to guide and protect the spawn of Satan ..... it sounds a lot like Mrs. Baylock someone else. Another thing is that in the shelter, they were the first to get the child burned to the ground in just a few months after it was adopted, as well as in «The Omen». However, fortunately, one priest survived the flames, and escaped with tear burns all over her body .... another coincidence ?????? And to top it all he burned the priest stay in the hospital room with the Jesus pictures on the walls, as well as a priest in "The Omen", which has the pages of the Bible plastered on the walls, like wallpaper. Please do not even get me started to draw comparisons between the end of the film and "The Omen," for you, because, as I said above, there are too many to mention here.
