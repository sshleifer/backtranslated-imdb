... not that all the films Disney debris. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw the "Legend of the Bog cry" of the first and absolutely loved the film. When I heard that it was 2 sequels, I was delighted. Finally, I found a copy of it and watched it for one night. I do not understand how they can make a G-rated sequel to the horror film. Original film / documentary about Fauke Monster, and can scare anyone. "Return" for the children and not to look at anyone. I do not remember the story all too well, since it has been a long time since I watched it, and I will not watch it again, but ... It's about the hunter come to town, and they are looking to kill a snowman. Three small children SNEEK home to stop them. Large monsoon comes through. Hunters get hurt, rescued children. Then all of them hiding in a boat with a large piece of canvas on top and try to ride out the storm. Then suddenly, Bigfoot comes and does something really painful. I do not want to spoil the ending for any of Yas, but it's not terrible. Well ....
