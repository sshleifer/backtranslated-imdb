What happens during the Second World War, 11 in New Zealand, when US troops were there? <br /> <br /> This terrible story of four sisters, was really pathetic to see. Can you imagine the casting Joan Fontaine as the older sister, Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked like her mother. Even funnier was that Fontaine pregnant in the film. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who has shown such great chemistry on screen after 4 years in «The Hustler,» there are no scenes together in this film. Laurie plays another sister, who comes from Wellington to stomp around there, despite the fact that she was married. Woe to her when her husband returned from the war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons widowed and find romance with a much more muted Paul Newman. There is even a romance for the young Miss Yes here. <br /> <br /> The picture almost does not make sense. They are trying to say that all fair in love and war? If they are, they have done a poor job in selling this. <br /> <br /> A conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons quickly disposed of. This is what had to be done quickly to this very disappointing film in 1957.
