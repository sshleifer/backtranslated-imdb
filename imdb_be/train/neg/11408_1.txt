It was just awful. I was reading this book in school, I did like all tests, and see it as it is! My teacher made me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was worse than Leonardo portion 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk combined. The fact that made this film so awful was enough of a reason to want to kill herself again. First of all, this was done at Hallmark. Secondly, the effect was terrible. Thirdly, it was like a completely different book. Literally, it was so bad, I asked him to forgive me. In principle, I would prefer to watch Basic Instinct 2 than watching it. Take my advice, do not watch this movie. No one wanted to look at it. It was awful. HORRIBLE!
