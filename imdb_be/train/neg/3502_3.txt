Sarah Silverman is really "flavor of the month" comic right now. Is it really worth all the hype? Yes and no. It is sometimes funny, sometimes amusingly so (her standing procedure is actually very interesting, but not always funny). Other times, you feel deceived by the media for overhyping another performer. She's one of those really cute comedians that men in particular flock, saying they dig her intelligence and wit. But if you monopolize them, most people recognize that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch it. It reminds me of why many people flocked Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, although none of them are really "hot" at the moment in terms of popularity. Sarah drink or smoke (at least of CIGS), so it should be hot when she was 60, so its supporters (especially male) can rejoice. <br /> <br /> As for the show, it is very much as it is a comedy. If it works, it's fun. If this does not happen, it is undermined by the complete bore and very, very sad. Episode AIDS here is the best one. It constantly funny and has some really good satire in it. Brian Poeshn character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's fun to see him in Tab T-shirt. But they never go anywhere with him, and he eventually wears out its welcome. Sarah's character in the series, rather annoying, gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guy) seem tacked on, and never does anything for the show as a whole, and supporting players (including the real-life sisters Sarah, Laura that doesn 't look a thing as it is) in order. If the jokes are hit, they are brilliant. If they do not, they are terrible, and I mean really terrible. There's also an obsession coprophilia here (otherwise feed joke), which seems to have replaced the actual mind and intellect in comedy today. So you have to watch this show? If you have a crush on Sarah, go for it. You can look at it and pretend that it's yours. As for her show, it ranges from good to absolute zero.
