This is a high-quality cheese rate B movie kung fu cinema. Bruce "wannabe" Lee played Bruce Lee ... I think. Of course, let's show the quick clips of Bruce and do close-ups of his eyes, and if you are Quintus at a right angle at a certain time of the day during the winter solstice, it kind of looks like Bruce. You will laugh at bay as splicing the film is not very good, but some interesting deleted scenes from Exodus dragon thrown into the mix. According to the movie, Bruce Lee was killed by a javelin, and hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think that it may serve as a justification of Bruce Lee for being Bruce, though his character has to be a brother Bruce (who for some reason still mimes and gestures Bruce fighting style - very bad). See Bruce to go alone with the cowardly lion. Props department stopped Kay-Bee, you see. Bruce does not see anything wrong with brutally beating lame. Toward the end, the director decided to "let's throw flashback" on stage just showed 3 minutes ago !! They must have thought that only one-celled organisms with attention deficit syndrome can fully understand this movie. <br /> <br />
