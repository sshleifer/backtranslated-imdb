I argued with him, or to rent or not. I'm always afraid rent something I've never heard of (I do not remember this time in movie theaters). Large throw ... that's what tipped the scales. 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching. The first few minutes of fun to watch, but it's unbelievable. It only gets worse after that. The authors of this film could have done a little research on future projects, if they want their films, even a little better. Or they could just try to write something just a little bit plausible. I give it a 3 .... and one for writing (only because there is the word) and 2 to be able to get so many good actors to agree to do this film, despite the fact that to read the script. My God, this movie sucks.
