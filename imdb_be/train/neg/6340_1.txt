This is a film I fear most. Arrogant and irresponsible, it is a sketch of the Colombian conflict, as a template and dumb it is an insult to all the Colombian people. Performances godawul, with Grisales (her nude scene completely helpless) to Bejarano, Fanny Mickey (which looks straight out of a nightmare Tim Burton), to Diaz, who makes notable efforts to breathe life into the character, so that one-dimensional, so stereotyped and so badly written, all he's left to work with it all. Not to mention the gratuitous ending and Gore Festival so cheesy that Ed Wood would pervert. It fails in all respects, cinematography, art direction, costumes, makeup, editing, and best directing, Jorge Al√≠ trial has always been a lousy director, but at least his previous films had some dignity. I can not nothing good about this waste of money, except that I hope that the Colombian filmmakers learn the lesson of honesty, integrity and responsibility on its intentions of this medium to tell a fiasco.
