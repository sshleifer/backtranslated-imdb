Well, I saw this movie yesterday, and it's - unfortunately - worse than you might think. First of all, the idiocy of the plot, it does not make any sense. The script full of funny dialogues deliberately. The audience laughed many times. And uncertainty is very low. The actors play so-so, with the exception of Sharon Stone, which has some good moments, but also some very bad acting moments. The sad part, when she was trying to be aggressive sexually and says things like "I want to * BEEP * You", and it looks, say it gently, very very mature woman acts rude and not sexy at all. This erotic tension of BI1 completely disappeared. From a technical point of Basic Instinct 2 mediocre film - better than the usual straight to DVD, but at a much lower than the lever of the original film. For example the scene crazy adventures done poorly. Basic Instinct director Paul Verhoeven 2 entirely, and it shows. New composer Jerry Goldsmith and not his show. The script is made by people who are not suitable for Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and poorly edited several times. I'm sorry, but my first thought after I left the theater was, "Why? Heaven't they made this movie before, and with the original talent behind the success of the first film, "For all of the original film like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of a break-Thru in the popular movie. He provoked, sexy and controversial. It was the best performance by Sharon Stone in his career. He had this particular style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is unintentionally funny film, poorly directed and true winner of the Golden Raspberry awards in many categories. It is a pity that they did this film.
