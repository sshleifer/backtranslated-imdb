It was so lame that I turned the DVD off ... maybe halfway. He was so weak I could not even pay enough attention to tell you how far I've done it.Though I really wanted to believe that the image of the young Carlito is a bit different, I just could not buy. I do not blame the actors, because I think that this was a scenario that may have fallen flat. I consider myself to laugh a few times, but I do not think that these lines have been designated to be funny. <br /> <br /> It's only saving grace, I bought it included 2 DVD, and I would pay the price, which I did for the original alone. This is one of those cases where they had to solve the classic stand alone.
