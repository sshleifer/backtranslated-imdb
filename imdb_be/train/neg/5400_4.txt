It is simply not enough full of gore festival based on a Stephen King story. Two tabloid reporters, one filled (Miguel Ferrer) and one not achieved (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) may actually be a vampire. Stranger than strange a modern day blood suckers are not wing its way, of course, but the way of the black Cessna he was looking for his victim. Gore actually gets terrible, as the film nears its silly ending. Keep in mind that Mr. King had nothing to do with this film. I admit it's a bit scary in the first hours of the night.
