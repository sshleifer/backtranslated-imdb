I hated this movie. It was absolutely terrible, poor, poor, helpless acts REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals, who do not have even a bit ridiculous (unlike the first two home movies, which were very good). All Boobie Trap weak, helpless excuses for bad ideas copied from the first two, which simply means that people who write this film was just lazy, because their salaries do not rise above 20 dollars a week. This film is absolutely disgusting, not even worth renting. In fact, do not even look at the TV! Go use your eyes more useful way of seeing the first two! I barely give it 1 star (out of 10). Just believe me when I say, if you liked the first two, and you do not complete a foolish man, you do not like this movie, do not watch this movie !!!
