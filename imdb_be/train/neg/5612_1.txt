As Spiritualists and not a Christian. I thought I really was going to be holding on to my faith, but the fact that the goods I visionaries. I thought that the film would have great arguments, but got only one-sided views with atheists and Jews ??? And who are all these street people he interviewed who do not know the back of their hands on their heads. Where actually theologians and priests and the things he could get arguments. Nha retired nuts, who wrote the book and finished his studies in 1970, personally this DVD was a waste of time and not worth my time to check, if the facts are right or wrong, or if I should or should not believe, because the Antichrist said to me, yes. Please, to think that he came to the conclusion, finding God, because of his own ego and demons got the better of him. For they will not say that the movie was stunning, to help an atheist reading this feel better. But if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in Jesus, then encourage us to value, not your beating drums.
