A few years ago I saw The Godfather, and made an indelible impression on me, the film's atmosphere was first class acting and memorable story classic. I recently bought a Trilogy, and after watching part 1, I again looked eagerly to watch Part 2 ...... I was so happy to realize early on in Part 2 that here was fitting for them to the greatest Godfather movie, again everything was almost perfect and I could not wait to see the Godfather III ........ wrong! I would like to stay at the II. The storyline was not good, as it seemed to me like the story made only to have the story, the characters were weak, especially a daughter. Pacino was a protégé of weak character, which would have been eaten alive in the Godfather 1 or 2. Then the scene, such as Corleone is invested with all the attributes of the Catholic Church with the choir, the assassin riding riding off into the sunset, the invisible helicopter machine gunning meeting (where "goodies" to leave the rest of the shot), the daughter and the first cousin of rolling pasta pieces on the board, pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffing sweets down his orange juice for the treatment of diabetes (man, his intelligence and cunning are not prepared for an emergency situation?) ... no, it would not lo well and with the best will in the world, I can not watch it again. But I will watch 1 and 2 many times down the years.
