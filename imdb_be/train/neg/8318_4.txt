I have seen a fantastic story, but the room is so incredible that it is very close to irrelevant. Rich and young boy runs through a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and he once witnessed his own surgery and his surgeon plot to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for this phenomenon, then what is happening is a mixture of a dialogue between ... ... tell a soul? ... can be in real life, where a dedicated mother will do anything to save his son's life. There is no shadow of suspense or thrill, just a combination of a bad and a simplified plot of a series of accidents that could never happen in life. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film is completely lacking quality - in fact, the first time the director Joby Harold does a decent job at directing actors is a good team, which includes Hayden Christensen in his first starring role after he withdrew the suit Anakin Skywalker, fabulous Jessica Alba and super-talented Lena Olin. All would have deserved a better story.
