My wife and I watch a movie every night, without interruption, and mostly artsy films that require thought. I have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom. My wife has a double attention span, what I'm doing. All that being said-- this film is simply empty and boring! He did not go anywhere. We never bloomed. It started quite strong with a promising plot ... while she bakes cookies ... goes to Spain .... she's angry, she looks .... credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, false starts and blind alleys. We FF'd several long sequences of it just staring into space. Artificial depth to understand when she was playing with mud and tears. Zzzz ...... This is how beautiful chick-flick shot, which pretends to be deep or pretentious. You never know and do not understand at all Morvern. About halfway through you just do not care anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the story lines of development. Do not waste your time on it. I'm shocked it scores so high.
