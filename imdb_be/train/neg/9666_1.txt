Seeing the "Triumph of the Will," I can only say that this film is terrible, even measured against the historically low "standard" time. Naturally, all this is completely fabricated and harm. This is what one would expect from the 1930 German propaganda. Unfortunately, the quality of presentation, by itself, is formulaic and cheap. This is so obviously absurd that even modern Germans must have left the theater, holding their noses. In a genre known for its basic appeal, lack of originality and uncompromising wrong dizziness, this film does not even qualify as "bad." It would have been significantly improved to achieve this state!
