I do not see anything wrong with that, since I came out of a James Bond movie «Moonraker» twenty years ago. I managed to sit through this quite alone because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing she could do to save this animal. <br /> <br /> As a cross between "Pi," "Orlando" and "Tron", the film failed miserably in every aspect of cinema. The characters were cardboard, and not cause any sympathy. The plot was absolutely incredible. The action was except Swinton fans. Computer graphics has been worse than that of «Tron». Timothy Leary was very annoying. I could go on, but what's the point. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this film that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why the actress of her caliber has agreed to appear in such a hopeless, but it is likely all regret it now. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money or time on this bitch. There's nothing worth seeing here.
