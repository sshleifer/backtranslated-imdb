Hip. Erotica. Outrageously sexy ... whatever. This "Terminator" with werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. A policeman rescues a girl (waitress!) From the big monster calls himself her "protector." The lead actor Ryan Shad does a very good job of emulating Kyle Reese ... there is a massacre at the police station ... the bad guy is muscular with red eyes ... and even contains a dialogue along the lines of, "You said it yourself, it will never be if either. never ". Heavy script comes from first-time writer, who, thank God, did not sell anything, so as it is, and it's all thrown together famously bad director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a strip bar (always a good sign), and the average biker type guy rushes without any reason being pursued by three police officers. One of them is black, and (shock horror!) He is the one who dies in the first five minutes. The movie goes downhill for the next hour or so, and then picks up a bit with some decent action sequences to rounding for all this with terrible isolation. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the actors come across as competent actors do what they can with a bad script and the director, who is willing to settle for less. If nothing else, they seem to learn to act in this film and Alosio, together with some of the supporting cast, is showing signs of talent. DarkWolf in his human form, play a giant Kane Hodder -. Known for his numerous images of Jason Voorhees in the films "Friday the 13th" It is decent enough, especially considering that he was not used to speaking roles <br /> <br /> This has become. known among the group of horny teens for a lesbian scene on the roof between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who gets his kit off a couple of times in the great tradition of former actresses «Power Rangers». and it unnervingly clear that the editor has spent too much time on this stage ... in any case, the main zmya Primary is that the physical effects of the werewolf is pretty good, and not bad wolf design all.But KGOV is bad just bad, I mean seriously, if you can not reach a certain level of realism -.. Why just throw a little bit? extra money in make-up! in addition to the terrible script, this movie does have it moments, many of which are unintentionally funny. it's good for a laugh, if you have nothing better to do, but just do not spend money on it. Please.
