First of all, there was nothing in this film that caught me actually. It was not a bad movie, just another movie where I said, "Well, that was not anything special" after I saw him was probably drama and stuff, but it just did not grab me, but most of the seams. sex-bored. as I said in the title is sewn very cheap on the road. the quality of the (image) of the film seams, as poor quality and reminded me more of some cheap TV movie than a respected British cinematographer. the camera angles and shots were very fans like in my opinion. Perhaps, in fact, does not have any close shots or equivalent ichnyya effects for interesting scenes. I have not seen a lot of English movies and the ones I saw, did not actually hit me more than this, and they are sewn similar kind done by the camera work, flowers and the like. "The Game" trying to be more cool, hip and reasonable (see my review of "Lola RenntÂ» about this, if you want), but was not crowned with success for me, too. as a whole is only slightly indifferent film, which was nothing special (in the best case, I I'm afraid), and basically, unfortunately wasted two hours.
