Well what can I say about this movie is that it's great to see so many Asian people. What I did not like about the movie was that it was full of stereotypes that typical racial characters will make in his role. Asian girl without confidence, which should play someone else to get ahead, a white guy hijacked Asian culture and wants to leave her white light from behind the earth yellow and "keep it real" black cab. Plus all the coke, Shanghai Tang and Dunkin Donuts product placement was a bit too obvious. The very history of the story was funny, but pretty much as I thought that the story will unravel. Then again, if you watch a romantic comedy, you can not expect much, but then again, I would just like to be surprised, at least once. Parents are the best part of the film.
