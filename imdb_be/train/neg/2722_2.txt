For the great thinkers among us, "Safety" is annoyingly incoherent movie from France, giving the so-called "art films" a bad name. History is something about bitter old coot, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who goes in search of Tahiti for a heart transplant, but other than that, I have no idea who any of the people in the film were, and why they do it, what they are doing. In the absence of a coherent story line does not show off, the film loses us early, although I am quite ready to admit that there might be someone out there who actually gets some deep message of this film. <br /> <br /> This is confusing, unwieldy drama goes full for two hours and five minutes - although I seriously doubt that anyone with some life will still stick to the closing credits.
