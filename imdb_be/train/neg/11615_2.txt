Although not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits at the opening of "Joshua". Hell, I did not even know that he was in "Joshua", until I started the movie. So, needless to say, I watched the movie based on the film, not the wires. A kind of "Rosemary's Baby" has been declared «The Omen» or any other demonic child film "Jesus". Unfortunately, he fell. Slowly, incredibly slowly, and flat. Nevertheless, I went to see how it will resolve all hoping for the faith, the end of the climax to shed some light on this topic. Okay, I admit that I made (a little), but what the callous closing. And that the budget of the film low-low, or at least how they are designed. Man falls ?? you do not see a drop, you see someone lying in what appears to be blood. Man gets hit by a taxi ?? you do not see, you see someone complained, holding the bike. I'm not sure if it's called "style" or laziness or simply a lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mom, workaholic father trying to balance all of the child ?? Joshua, who may / may not be the Antichrist and a newborn girl who cries a lot. She was crying as we see how many days she was still alive ?? and what was it? There are rats above, or is it Jesus? Is his mother nuts? Is Jesus crazy? Is he just jealous of a newcomer to the family? He will grow up to be Michael Myers? Or he led his family to the brink? I do not think so. They were nuts, yes and no "so-called" action can not make me think otherwise. Unfortunately, almost all the questions were answered, almost all of the open doors closed. I'm sure that would be the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Never mind. There are a lot better for the child gone-wild movies to explore. Joshua is more like a Mini-Me of the Antichrist.
