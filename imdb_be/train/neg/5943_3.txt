This movie reminded me of The Sopranos, but not in a good way. <br /> <br /> seed crowd opera David Chase only ever put his foot wrong twice, the most dramatic and inexplicable incident which occurred in the fourth season, when Junior Soprano went on trial for his life. Rather than continue this riveting (and main) of the storyline, the authors instead decided to completely ignore it, focusing on the constant whining Bobby Baccalieri over frozen pasta dishes his recently deceased wife. <br /> <br /> When a party going on in Notorious - for example, that the first, the mysterious assassination of Tupac Shakur, who ignited the whole feud East Coast / West Coast, in the first instance, and eventually leads to the death of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the film treats it as another bit of the plot are drawn through. Why Tupac was so sure that he was sold by his own people? Unless he indulges its subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? And the transformation of Lila Kim from prim office drone in sex-obsessed, vampish diva really so trivial as it looks? <br /> <br /> None of these questions do not even fleetingly considered the writers of the film, which are much more interested in the image of the turbulent love life of Wallace to zero compelling drama avail. These sequences (including brain frazzlingly clich√©d indescretion fan in a hotel room) is so toothless and bruisingly manipulative, that the only real comparison to be made is with the television movie network. <br /> <br /> story, in both structure and content, is simplistic and corny. But more fundamentally, as a biopic; once developed, to mark his subject and enlighten the uninitiated in the intricacies of their living and working conditions; the film is almost completely useless. Reliance on meat-and-potatoes genre drawing, combined with lifeless musical performances (the area in which the film is as it should soar, definitely) lead in the film, which seems to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and needs of those involved, leaving Wallace's dubious status as a giant in the field as easily persuaded to put on previously converted only. <br /> <br /> And the final twenty minutes, in which the post-mortem cultural identity Wallace is widely portrayed as similar to that from the second day of the saint, quite openly made me feel like throwing up. <br /> <br /> On this account, as well as with any other notorious it is blunt calculation and compromised.
