I do not agree with any of theology Left Behind series, but nonetheless I found the book gripping and I read 8 out of 12 of them. Undoubtedly good writing and interesting history. However, I did not have very high expectations for the film. There was no way to mainstream Hollywood would take a series of Christian and made a big-budget film. So it was done independently of each other ... and it just felt like I was watching a TV show for a long time. He just did not feel like a movie; he did not have the movie "experience" to him, if anyone knows what I'm talking about. Thus, the film suffered because of this, and a low-budget, special effects were bad even belittling to me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I feel that Gordon Currie was depressing as Nicolie miscast Transcarpathia. Reading a book, my impression of the NC, he was supposed to be this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome guy, who spoke in English with almost zero trace accent. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found Clay Aiken pencil-neck, which looks like employee of the month from Best Buy, and gave him a very bad fake accent. So I lost a few stars for me right there. The film is simply not convincing when the main villain whether sounds does not look like it should. <br /> <br /> The action was good, but nothing special. Some of the scenes - as one of the scenes of the conversion (can not remember which one) - real-squirmers seat for me. And some of the Christian rock music, or that it was really impossible for some scenes in one of Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, it was not a bad movie, but it just does not do it for me. Stick to books, people, it's much better.
