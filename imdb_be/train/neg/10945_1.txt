Words can not describe just how awful this film. I watched it on video last night, and I just could not believe what I saw. In principle, «Snakeeater» of the ex-military man (Lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sister, who was a prisoner of Deliverance Rednecks style. action, writing, direction, photography and editing the film pathetic along with a song called "Soldiers", which should be one of the worst theme songs of all time! <br /> <br /> However, there is one delicacy, «Horshack» (Ron Pallio) from the «Welcome Back Carter» in the film plays the bad guy is ridiculous. Otherwise, please avoid this confusion at all costs.
