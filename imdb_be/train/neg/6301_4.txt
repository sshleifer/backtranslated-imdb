In spite of the sterling work by the supporting actors and a clever script by Alan Plater, the film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charisma of the central character / actor. One of the characters describes the character of Richard E Grant as "whining little turd," and, unfortunately, this brings it perfectly. There's nothing about him or his performance, to make him believe that his girlfriend, and high-end publisher / boyfriend will spend so much time and emotional strength to it. He was rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destruction and thoroughly annoying. Part called for an actor who can make you love him, even if he is being chatter -. Ewan McGregor, for example, <br /> <br /> All the witty satire on the class system, etc. It was wasted due to this annoying and thoroughly unsympathetic performance. All I wanted to do was to shake him and tell him to get over themselves.
