I think that they are actually at DVD quality products obtained from them. I rented this DVD from the 2nd movie stores, and the second time, when I finally got him to play the 3-DVD player, I've tried. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else have this problem? It's really difficult to give the film marked a biased review after the passage of such a hassle to play it. On the one hand, I have never seen a Finnish horror film before so I'm kind of bummed that the film was made in English. In addition, since it is never clear what happened to Sarah, she just came off as retarded and so I was really hoping that someone will shoot her in the face and make all the terrible incident go.
