This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. There is absolutely no storyline, the gags just for morons and there is absolutely nothing that would make this movie worth watching. In general, the film Freddy (My God, what a funny name. Ha ha) does not ask himself again as he stepped off the plane in Middle-earth. There are a lot of stupid and totally unfunny characters, whose names must sound ridiculous. for example: Gandalf called Almghandi, Sam called Pupsi ... and so on. I did not even smile once throughout the film. Gag, it seems as if they were made by people who have a negative IQ. If you laugh when someone's coat trapped in the door (it happens about 5 times), then this film might have for you. Another funny scene: They try to guess the code word for closed door (do not ask why- never ask "why" in the film) and the code word (haha): litter. So, if you laughed at these examples you could have this film. For everyone else: Go to Youtube and watch the "Lord of the WeedÂ»: a lot, a lot more fun.
