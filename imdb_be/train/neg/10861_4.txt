Maybe something I do not have enough, because I read the more positive things about the man who deceived himself than I had read bad reviews - and I just do not understand. I like my Noirs have some style to them with characters that speak, look and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep and Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this film is not that style or presence or whatever you want to call it. Take the lead actor Lee J. Cobb. His rumpled, rolled out of the bed look is about as far from the dashing, smooth-talking noir archetype, as you will find. Or take Jane Wyatt as a femme fatale, as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miscasting I've seen in a while. It is simply not convincing in the role. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, then tired and do not have any surprises or anything new to the genre. I could predict the outcome of man who deceived himself about five minutes. And that is the ultimate cat-and-mouse chase scene plain old sad. Ten to fifteen minutes, nothing happens actually ruined any pacing the film, it may go for it.
