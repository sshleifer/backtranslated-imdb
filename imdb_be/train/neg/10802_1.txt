Let me give a quick movie Summery: rotten, rough guy named Max stumbles upon a radio containing Kazaam: to shake the gin. Like all jinn, he gives 3 wishes, but being soft, helps Max to his personal life, as he has to deal with bullies, and his father was involved in organized crime. During all this, Kazaam knocks from time to time (and showing sad rap skills Shack in) <br /> <br /> This film proves that we all know :. Athletes must follow the sport. I admit that it was never like an Oscar worthy movie, but everything about this film waste is horrible. Symbols something unpleasant or stupid plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialogue is a joke, and Shaq, only a quarter of the problem. Heck, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this film will still be a joke. I know that the film drew only NOBODY because Shaq was so big (no pun intended) at the time. I really can not think of a single positive to say about this waste of time. Shaq has to put the time used to make the film in the direction of practicing free throws.
