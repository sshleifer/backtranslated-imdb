It appears that the general gist of these remarks, the film has some great animation (I watched it on Blu-Ray), but it really does not hold any real depth. <br /> <br /> First of all, all the characters are pretty dull. I got a hint on what-Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. However, maybe my mind is wanderd and wishful thinking (Laputa is my favorite anime, original Engilsh dub). Characters are not very attractive, and some, as mentioned in other posts, they fall in love very quickly, leaving poor old Minko jealous and rejected (she likes Agito, which seems to be unaware of this). However, she immediately seems to forgive Toola at the end, without giving any other changes in the heart, than it does the end of a little more "happy". <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanation. As the druids who in reality? Are they people? and which countries are women / girls who seem to hang out with them and work in the woods? There's nothing to explain why they are there and how they can give ordinary Humans superpowers. Plants that come from the moon still does not fill the gaps about it. It's almost like a strange version of the Triffids Day. <br /> <br /> And who called Toola? Why this, if it is not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, but I found a site where near as deep as in the film, like Ghost in the Shell or have any real character as those of Miyazaki. I'm not complaining, watching it, but I kind of wish I had not bought it. My advice? Give it a go, if you have a few hours to spare, but to take it, or buy it cheap! Maybe if your new anime movies and do not have to travel a lot, you will enjoy it. This, of course, visually pleasing.
