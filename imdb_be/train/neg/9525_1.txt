It's boring, pointless, meaningless, sluggish, and silent film is not conclusive evidence that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his post- "Trainspotting" movie: «The Beach» already took care of that. The fact that this low-budget strangeness makes it easy to secure your place among those who started very well, but was completely lost drugs, booze, ego, self-deception, poor management, or that it was something that leads to rapid death of this once promising director. <br /> <br /> absurd premise: two loser (Ecclestone and some Bimbo Jenna G - rapper probably) meet by chance and spontaneously begins singing heart more like a crazy asylum resident than a potential hit duet solutions - making them . Their one - even more illiterate loser - it becomes their manager, broke the window and steal the video camera with which he takes them to the "action" and then shows the tape of some music people who actually show interest in this litter. Now, I know that in the UK put out an incredible waste in recent years, but this is ridiculous; Oasis is an music does, it seems like The Beatles. During recording in the studio, the duo - a prostitute - to change the text in each take, and quite arrogantly said Ecclestone about the music business, the guys take it or leave it, and rather absurd they take it. Not only is the music of the total and complete rubbish, but his "performers" are anti-social; These visitors must call the shots. It's just too stupid. This is the usual awful. <br /> <br /> In a dialogue there unfunny and is not going anywhere, and it's a bitch to rags story makes no sense and has no meaning. He often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of debris is so bad that it is shameful to watch. IQ Ecclestone must also be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense. Who funded this £ 1,000 a joke has to leave the film business before they eventually sell their own underwear on street corners.
