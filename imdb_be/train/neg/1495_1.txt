I was watching horror movies since I was 5 years old, since Childs Play.Since then, I've seen good and bad horror movies, but this is without a doubt the stupidest movie I've ever seen! Actors have done all they could with the material. The plot was just idiotic. In addition, it was just all the gore. I can digest a lot of blood, but this was ridiculous! In one scene, a character gets stabbed in the back and choked the gut! Plain Stupid! Another problem with this film is that sad, and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end of this is just stupidity. But then again, it goes with the rest of it! In the end, when she receives from cannibals / ancestor, she gets help from an old woman. The old woman makes tea, but when she turned to talk to the girl, she attacks her! It has become a cannibal! Backlog of film.
