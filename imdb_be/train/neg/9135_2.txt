Oh, Sam Mraavich, we know you tried so hard. This is your opus, a shining example for all of us, you are definitely worth Selection in Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as you say on your Web site in 1998 AD). Unfortunately, it is better to remain silent and thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt. With Ben and Arthur, you just. <br /> <br /> It seems that assembly with the lack of training or entities screenplay takes us to a truly amazing with each new scene. It is crazy justification for stories that can also be the best ally of the film. Starting conducted in homosexual titular characters Ben and Arthur attempt to get married, so far, to fly across the country to do so, in the shadow of the beautiful palm trees in Vermont. But, all this posturing is just an introduction to the blood. Then there was blood, and more and more blood. I mean, there should be at least $ 20 in fake blood make-up in the last third of the film. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole technical gaffe. From sound editing to music, which is composed of one fuzzy bass notes held on the keyboard, it is surprising that even the film rests on any media you are viewing it on. It is such a shame that some decent amateur wasted here. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sam. I'm sure you've done five digits on the clicked on loan or something is driving the poor souls (like me) to see this movie. Unfortunately, we do not laugh at you.
