Contrary to its name, this film does not offer spices and, thus, the audience is subjected to tasteless dishes. All humor is forced, theatrical, mechanical, put resemble those Pakistani plays are available on video, including even mannerisms. All shout, scream and do strange things for no reason. The room looks interesting, since it is a direct lift from Hollywood «Boeing Boeing». John Abraham, who is so naturally in almost all his films complete loser here. If we keep the factor of morality aside, even then, strange things seem commonplace. Akshee Kumar and Paresh Rawa, two experienced lads are trying to raise the film, being natural, but in vain. at least, the nature of the three girls should be contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements, but unfortunately here too, all of them are those brainless, buxomed bimbettes (3BS), who say, behave and even scream quite similar way. primary hole in a plot that made the hero to keep the three girls in his own home, pretending that they will never know about each other? Just to do some sex, what else? the same can be done in hundreds of other ways. why so many dramabaazi no reason, not what the audience will digest easily. But, of course, more flesh shows and enticing promotional always gives seconds UCH movies most elementary. Now for those who call his sitcom, I call it a miserable taste. The sense of humor of this movie is the audience, of course, gone crazy and spoiled to the extent that they are connected to a sadistic, bizarre and crazy type of humor, which is not the characters that they laugh, but on themselves and on their own frustration that look like a senseless, we have that to laugh, we have to deal with such things?
