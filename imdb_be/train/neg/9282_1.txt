This film is not worthy of the title of Omen. It's so bad that it actually damaged the classical character of the first three. He would never have been made, they should change the name. <br /> <br /> They do not even spelled correctly NAME Damien Tom !!!! And there's daggers, the most important element of all Omen films. Pull it off the shelves and write it.
