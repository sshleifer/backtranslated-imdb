I picked this title up one, he sits in his exhaustive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so, fortunately, I do not personally have to pay for it. I felt that it would be a bad film, but I know that really bad film after watching the big men, the children should not play with dead things and incredibly strange creatures who had ceased to live, and turned into a zombie, and now there's really nothing that fazes me, if it's no wonder bad. <br /> <br /> Sunny crisis is bad, but it does not reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies. <br /> <br /> In any case, the overall story that the sun is going to reveal a huge solar flare to the ground, which is essentially to destroy it. To counter act this imminent threat, mankind has accumulated a spaceship and a crew whose duty it is to dismiss the antimatter bomb (which the discovery describes as "the biggest blast ever") the sun, that in some bizarre fiction logic to force the flash to shoot a from a different angle, leaving the ground unharmed. <br /> <br /> No matter what I have just described seems to you that a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with the ensemble cast (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle, Jack Palance), Sunny crisis just work out that the level of mediocrity, because of the story, which begins simply, but it is becoming increasingly meaningless as time wears on. <br /> <br /> the crown of the fiasco of the film is to add to the character of the villain (played by Boyle), who insists on sabotage missions. Through means that are never explained, he sends evil minion with strikingly bad haircut carry some vague electronic mind control over genetic engineering space crew learned to play the female lead Annabel Schofield. Why he sabotaged the mission? Because of his idiotic point of view, he believes that the flash will not be, and that if he does not, he will become fabulously rich, because he clung claws in bad stock market. In essence, you have a villain with the absurdly silly motivation imaginable. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film becomes remarkably complicated and develops very slowly, just by clicking on the use of symbols, which have only vague or aimlessly short role in the storyline. I could sit here and explain in detail what is happening to demonstrate the obvious inability of the writer to make a story that actually presses and holds your attention, but I sit and write this review on Microsoft Word, and I know for a fact that it would be three pages and I would succeed only lose interest. But then again, you're likely to get the same effect by watching the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film with a bang bogged extremely bad dialogue. Imagine if everything that ever happened in the Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters spew sci-fi jargon back and forth to each other. Yes, I know that they are already doing that, but imagine if that's all they did, and what they used to say jargon to set vague and almost meaningless scenes that do not produce any excitement, tension, or the interest of spectators in general . <, Br /> <br /> This is best illustrated when the character is zero-G environment screws bolt back to the metal box before you start crying in pain for several minutes before suddenly exploding. The script refers to the earlier nature of the riskiness of the explosion, but did not bother to give any solid answer as to why and how it happens and why it can not really be avoided. Taken together, there is a simple cross between the strange and funny. <br /> <br /> Then we have a couple of scenes where the dramatic increase in leads to nothing. performance of Jack Palance to spend on the symbol, which only serves to drive the boy hero (do not ask) around the desert, before they broke up and killed a bunch of suits. Before his death, Palance finally says our boy hero, his name (while wearing a terrible black eye make-up work, which makes him look like someone put a bowl under his eyeball), which he kept quiet before. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats his calm after it expires, giving the impression to the audience that the name has some significance later in the film. Maybe gray character Admiral Charlton Heston knows, and the plot will be promoted so as soon as his name is repeated. That. All. <br /> <br /> not. Sorry. Any hopes you have to be broken, when the moment is just another of the many helpless, unsuccessful attempts to create a drama ?? for the character, so flat and banal, that it will forever remain a stain on Palance's career, as well as those of the rest of the cast are just spoiled. <br /> <br /> The completion of the film is a painfully sharp end pointing Schofield piloting bombs in the center of the sun in an attempt to atone for their business while under the spell of the villain, the climax showing another significant well done visual effects sequence in the film, even to clearly complex care put into them, still always manages to make the film look as well as how it's chintzy actually. The saddest thing in this movie is obviously a big budget, tragically wasted bitch in the script and the supporting cast behind Boyle, Heston and Palance governing nail the coffin shut overproduction pure action. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: D-
