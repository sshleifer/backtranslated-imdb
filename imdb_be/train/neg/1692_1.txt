Well, if you've seen the ring, you are mostly seen Grudge. He tries to be scary, just having a fancy camera work and loud sounds, but fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it, is a rather weak and full of holes, for example, would care center knew that Yoko did not appear to work when the people who lived in the house were not? And it is not really clear that the character of Bill Pullman to do anything. He was only partly came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It does not make much sense, what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, a little boy or a daddy? And there was Yoko, alive or dead, if the center of the guy who found her care? There were too many unanswered questions, and I was too bored to think about it anymore.
