I made a big mistake, actually watch the whole movie a few days ago. God I'm still trying to recover. This film does not deserve an average of 1.4. IMDb shall have voting 0 ratings possible for films that really deserve, like this one. 1.4 is too high. <br /> <br /> I've heard how badly this movie was, but I do not think the movie could actually be so bad, especially in this day and age. I thought that all the god awful cheesy movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s. My god, I was wrong. Believe me people, this film really bad. This goes badly; is this pathetic; it is beyond any kind of words I can think of for it. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the best film of the year in comparison with this film. SNAKE ISLAND (which until now was the worst movie I have ever seen) looks like he deserves more Oscars than this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I seriously can not believe that the creators of this film thinking it was a legitimate serious efforts to produce a Hollywood film. It has no business referred to the film. During the first 25 seconds of the movie, I seriously thought I was watching some middle-class theater school tries to make a short film. Or better yet, I thought it was some sort of Saturday Night Live skit robbery of the real thing. I mean, it looks that way. Actions hit; the entire film almost looks like it was filmed with a video camera 20 year old VHS. special effects ....... good good Lord Fascinated with back in the day, had a more special effects than this film. The scene in which he gets a shot at the door is beyond ridiculous and cheese. I mean seriously, my introduction to the duty of the class of 4 years in college, all we could gather the best film than that. And the worst part of the film, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh my God, I almost melted right there. I have a strong stomach, but wow it was awful. Some people should never be bare, and he's one of them. The plot of this film just does not seem to go absolutely nowhere. They talk about the legal issues that we never hear about again; Ben says that the music that we never hear about again; Arthur says that he is looking for work, and the money for college, and the next thing we see that it runs a porn shop. Everything about the film is just awful. <br /> <br /> It does not really have much to do with my criticism, but that's how it knows that I am not gay. However, I support gay rights, and I believe that we should all be treated equally. And I would like to support any gay man in my church, in contrast to the rigid priest in the film, which, incidentally, seems to Cassie every other word. (Where F * (# * ING pale) hahaha But I do not want anyone to think I hated this film only due to the fact that it is about two gay guys This has nothing to do with it ?. It was would be just as horrible from the movie if it was Ben and Jill instead of Ben Arthur. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie, to see if it was really as bad as they say. and yes, it it was even worse than I read Let this be a warning to all: .. just watch this movie if you want to just sit back and laugh at how useless some movies in 21 th century can still be Seen this film indeed waiting for a good movie, or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you at all <br /> <br /> the final thoughts :. As there are 7 movies ranked below the world IMDb on this there is no way to have 7 films out there? worse than that!
