Dirty look at the life of the kibbutz <br /> <br /> This film is less about the cultural history of a boy's life in the kibbutz, but the deliberate demonization kibbutz life in general. During the first two minutes of the film, human milk, cows responsible for raping one of his calves. And it is getting worse in terms of characters, representing a typical «kibbutznikim.» In addition to the two main characters, clinical depression woman and her young son, everyone else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of a ?? evil. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on how the kibbutz as a cult, slowly pull the mother and son deeper into despair and that inevitably follows. There's no happiness, no joy, no laughter in the kibbutz. Each symbol / represents a different situation terrible human defects as misogyny hypocrisy, violence, cultism, repression, etc. For example, while the hero is a very beautiful European looking 12-year-old boy ?? his older brother typical kibtsa youth complete with its "Jewish" appearance and bestial face. He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He refers to these volunteers, as garbage. After his younger brother begs him to visit his dying mother, whom he has not seen for a long time due to his military service, he ordered, thank you ?? "Linda, go take a shower, and I will finish within two minutes.» <br /> <br /> There is another "good" character in this film ?? European foreigner, who plays the mother's boyfriend. If an animal abuser tries to hit his mother's son, boyfriend defends him, breaking his hand rapist. He was unceremoniously expelled from the kibbutz, for the "violent" behavior in relation to one of the kibbutzim. More hypocrisy: indescribably annoying French woman who plays a schoolteacher teaches that sex can not happen until 18 years of age, or without love, and reports on this instrument, which is expected, with a sense of humor for the audience, but in fact is just silly . She, of course, screwing the Kibbutz leader in the areas, which are then in turn the screws a little boy mom, when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> The film reflects the kibbutz as a kind of cult. Children are pulled out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to a ritual where they swear allegiance to the areas under the control of the elders of the kibbutz. The mother, apparently, can not "escape" the kibbutz, in fact, who was / is always free to come and go as they choose. It's a mystery, as the boy's father is dead, but you can be sure kibbutz "forced him to do so", and his parents survived a couple of heartless, poor character that weigh down on the mother and her son. <br /> <br /> This is the essence of this film. One-dimensional characters, over dramatization, dry speeches and insidious message, he keeps trying to drive yourself in the audience's head ?? that humiliates the Kibbutz life, unhappy and even deadly for those who do not "fit in." I feel sorry for the guy who made this film ?? it is obvious that he had a bad experience on a kibbutz grows. But I feel he made a few kernels of truth in relation to the kibbutz life and turned them into huge stereotypical atomic bomb.
