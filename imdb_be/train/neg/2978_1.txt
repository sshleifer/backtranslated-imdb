I'm a big fan of horror movies and zombie movies are particularly my favorite. Nevertheless, Zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen. So needless to say, I liked it, is the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon in "The Return of the Living Dead", but while this film was intentionally funny, this is one the opposite. This is one of the funniest acts I have ever seen, especially from the chief scientist character. His scene with the General was just hysterical. In addition, the effects of irregularities and, in many cases sloppy, and the death scene often just downright silly. This, of course, makes it all the more fun. Possible Spoiler - Worst scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees separated zombie head, which then opens his eyes and somehow departs from the fridge (apparently pulled clumsily with a small amount of line) blocking at the guys neck, killing him. Zombie head is able to float in the air now? He defies the laws of physics known to man, and this is one of the most absurd things ever made. This is just one of the many really stupid idiotic moments in the mash. I can not believe I got such a high rating here. If you are a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent this sucker.
