The 1960s were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social unrest and riots were commonplace as people said about their views. Racial tension, politics, the war in Vietnam, sexual promiscuity and drug use were part of the daily fabric, as well as daily news. . This film tries to encapsulate these historical aspects of an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded <br /> <br /> The two families this film are: one white, one black. In the first half of the film, the story is worth every family on an equal basis with the help of social and family struggle. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. However, there are characters in this family, and the story lines are intertwined, but equal attention is not paid to the racial aspects of this century. <br /> <br /> In general, acting is well done, and historical footage is mixed with color and black-and-white original footage to give a documentary feel to the film. The film is a work of fiction, but the clips of famous historical figures are used to set the time line. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie, but the situation was predictable, and the storyline was one-sided.
