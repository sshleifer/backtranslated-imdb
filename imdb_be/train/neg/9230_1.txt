I must qualify this name, now that I think about it. Checkout is not entirely useless. I had the opportunity to see him twice, and the second time I really got a great laugh at the expense of the film. so I think there is something to this. and it stands for the excruciating pain, he called me on the first viewing. as another reviewer noted that this film is beaten in every sense of the word. no original thought went into this film (which makes the following comment on the originality of the room full of heavy for me). the film is nothing but a long line of stamps that are strung together and marched around, like in the movies. it is certainly not the next clerks, it certainly is not original, and it is absolutely not a "good, clean fun." The film is an absolute agony for the uninitiated (after seeing it for the first time, the second time can be quite funny in an offensive sort of way). I looked around the theater, it was obvious that almost all, except, perhaps, the elderly, were very sad or hurt by this film. during some very emotional scenes like where Nick chews his mother, the audience was actually adulation because it was so badly done. I even heard someone groan * * in the theater, something I had never seen before. I do not care where you have a chance to see this film, whether it's at a film festival or in the indie theater, or anywhere. do yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. if you do not like me and just can not resist the opportunity to see what can really be the worst movie ever made.
