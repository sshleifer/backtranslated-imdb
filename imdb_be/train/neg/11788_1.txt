It was one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It was so bad I was laughing through the whole movie! The plot was SO cheese; especially at the end. This film turns from the end-of-the-world disaster, to keep-on-eel! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they are used for acne Sock puppet! And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with two protagonists who have been divorced. How predictable! It was so awful that my mother, my sister, and I could not finish it, and when we finish DID in, it was about a year! The second time we have seen, and we finished it this time, we made MST3K similar comments during the movie <br /> <br /> Summary :. See it only if you are a killer movie! Make funny comments, is to look for the night for a laugh, and I mean HUGE laughs. Also watch out for mockery. That explains the metaphor of the film: The film is very shallow and full of cheese Field sock puppet!
