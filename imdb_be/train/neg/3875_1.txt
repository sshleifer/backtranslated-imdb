I've seen a lot of stupid story at the time, but it is one of the worst. After catching some disease in space, astronaut returns to Earth and begins to melt. Then he goes on a rampage, killing people (as for me, I just look at them, I can not explain it.) It is a kind of film that should not have been made in the first place.
