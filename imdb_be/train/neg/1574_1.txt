There's no story! The plot is hopeless! Taken with a car based on a hanging accelerator without braking, and delayed automatic transmission lever can not be good! I would stop the car for a minute, if I was there or in a police car after he continually. Sorry for the actors, who had to put up with such a bad scenario. Several scenes that some similarities with the action has been greatly over-dramatize, but as far from reality, you can get. In addition, there were many blunders, such as the hood runs a car that jumped doing 100 miles per hour. At first he just bends a windshield, as it would be in reality, but then, after that, he was blown away. The car was later in the film observed with a hood on .... <br /> <br /> This film was nothing but annoying, stay away from it!
