Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film of course! This is a textbook example of how not to make a film. Watching the film, and then listen to comments screenwriter / director demonstrates the enormous gulf between what he knows about the character and what he communicates with the audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think that cinema as a means of communication, and communication is not complete if the public does not know what the hell, he says. avowed aim of the director to make the film void "Hollywood conventions." Among these conventions, unfortunately, the nature of consistency and clarity of the concept. The director realizes that viewers often do not understand the point, where he deliberately avoided the "Hollywood clichés." However, it never seems to get the idea that there are clichés for a reason. They are shorthand for transmitting complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's great in order to avoid them, but they have to be replaced by any other means of communication, and the same idea, and not simply liquidated. The film is based on an intriguing, rich potential. Two dolls are intended for the manufacture of a person and the background for an unidentified corpse, to be used in the mission of disinformation in the last days of World War II. Soon everyone begins to fill his personal fantasies to the nature of the invention and is becoming more real to them. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood convention" traditional narrative could create a great movie with this idea. This film is, of course, is not it! The puppets are doing everything possible to bring a sequence of characters, but they are all too often defeated by Dazed and desperate scenario. In particular, I am more impressed by Gonzo, who plays a living corpse. In some Mappayut movies, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
