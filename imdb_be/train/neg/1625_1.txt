When I was in high school, I made a film about a pair of wandering around in the trees and talking, and I realized the edit halfway, it was not just a failure of aesthetic strategies, but the clich√© of Canadian cinema: soaked lyricism married to a vacant, used a metaphor laden beats social comments. But whatever the shortcomings of my own film, I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... thing. On the one hand, my run for 20 minutes instead of 85, and had more content that: every pointless bit of business here fawned over four, five, six minutes tireless. Actor simply incredible, eyebrow-beating, loud creep based outbreaks class improvisation drama between philosophical understanding culled from U of T pub, and he gets a lot of and a lot of space to make us hate him. However, if he was not such a ** hole, the third act would make even less sense, as the pair SNARK dudes show up to provide long and thoroughly useless echoes of "exploitation" of values; but that does not make it easier to keep track of the clip creep whining "please" at close range until the magazine is over. I take back what I said about AUTUMN Borne, who at least had the courage of his own shameful debauchery: the cinematic crater and will remain the worst Canadian film of all time. At least I really hope so.
