*** Possible Interference *** <br /> <br /> When I saw this today I had some expectation of how it will look like, not too high, but not low anything. It was nothing like I expected at all, though, it seems to me, as the filmmakers could not make up their minds about what kind of movie to make. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film is somewhat mysterious and kind of exciting, but soon changes to a few funny scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I looked on, I almost fell asleep a couple of times <br /> <br /> ending is the most ridiculous of all. although almost splatter / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that he does not have some good scenes, it's just that the film would never be "everything". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Film-Man
