This film is about a group of five friends, rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends is fond catches terrifying virus. Suddenly, friends turn on each other in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves. <br /> <br /> «Cabin Fever» is a horrible film. On the one hand, he tries to be a lot of genres simultaneously. Is this supposed to be honoring and slasher, a black comedy or a horror film with unintentional comedy? No one can say. There is a serious scene in the first and second altar, it turns out funny. If the movie is trying to be funny, humor, pretty bland, except for the ending. I liked the ending a lot. <br /> <br /> But, apart from the final, I was very disappointed and disgusted. Violence crawl worthy, looking up from the screen more than frightened. Changes in pitch within each stage, sometimes funny, sometimes fearful, and sometimes even random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in Slo-motion. What should we gain from this? The same girl biting one of the characters. Was it supposed to be funny? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances were decent, and many of them were very amateurish. I do not care for most of the characters. I liked the story, but the execution was done badly. In a horror movie, I did not know what he's trying to be. I do not find it funny, tense or scared. In the end, you are left untouched, thinking: "What I've just been through?" Unfortunately, you'll never know the answer to this question.
