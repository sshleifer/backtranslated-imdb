Actions were not great, the story was full of twists simplified and transparent characters. We are talking about the consequences of the struggle between right-wing Vlaams Blok voters on the one hand, and people living Moroccon in Antwerp, Belgium, on the other hand. Is this a political analysis? Is this some kind of a Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is simply not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming they were directed questions, too). However, some scenes may function as a kind of Ken Loach film, established in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point of an extremist right Flemish Block party and fights with a lot of problems and tensions between different population groups and cultures. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one could not be, unfortunately. Nevertheless, it tells the tale of a very real and difficult situation in present-day Belgium. Few foreign viewers are watching must try and enjoy it and realize that it's not a real movie, which is important, but the social dividing lines, which cost her that haunt Belgium, a country of 10 million people in the 2000s < br /> <br /> Dries Van Dongen
