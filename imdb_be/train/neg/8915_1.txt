My comments on this film has been removed twice, which I find quite hurt because I make the effort to judge the film for other people. Please be tolerant of other people's opinions. Obviously, writing in the spirit of Nietzsches work did not understand so bad to change the comment completely <br /> <br /> I think it's a really bad movie for several reasons <br /> <br /> Subject: .. One must be very careful in making the film of the philosopher, who even today do not understand the weight and peer detects hot debate. One thing that philosophers agree that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So what makes a film about her life, which obviously includes their "ideas" thing to be very careful with, or, preferably, do not do it at all. Wisdom begins with knowing what you do not know. You might think that this is not a review of the film, but the film is not about the hollowness, we are talking about human life that really lived and had / has a big impact on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about the tomatoes, I can express my thoughts on the story itself, but also about the chosen topic, tomatoes. There is a responsibility of producers, if they make a film about the real facts. Especially in this case, as it is responsible for this has not been accepted <br /> <br /> The script :. One of the first things I noticed were funny accents. Why? It distracts from the fact that it should be about; Nietzsche and the truth he had found. It does not help to put things in the right geographical terms or time! Let's do it the correct English or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson got this part right ... giving his characters speak Aramaic in some gibberish Passion. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is more valid. <br /> <br /> 3D, Assante is not an actor to display Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the facts away. <br /> <br /> And so on. Its a waste of celluloid.
