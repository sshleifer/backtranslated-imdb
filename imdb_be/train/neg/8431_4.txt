Although the actors convincing job playing lost that hits the screen, the fact that these characters can not be determined with what I'm looking at the clock, only 20 minutes in the film (and more than once after that). Development of the plot is disjointed and slow verbal diarrhea the only friend of the protagonist is almost unbearable, the basic quality of most of the actions of the characters and unceremonious manner in which they treat annoying. <br /> <br /> This is typically Ventura Pons highlight CRASS characters psychologically disabled. Nevertheless, this is an artificial sociological analysis is a big step up from CARICIAS or Laski, where the characters to mock and despise each other's well-founded reasons to play during the movie. The AMOR IDIOTA we have to stick to the walk of the subnormal intelligence, he creeps to severe depression and exclusion of women. Presumably, this is due to his own depression, but the script does not support this. I will not give the rest of the story only in case there is any masochists out there ?? He cured through his obsession or a woman is shocked by his depression through his unwavering attention? Even when I watched the whole thing has not been done to take care even for a moment about any of them. <br /> <br /> If you can sit through all this prejudice, ignorance, betrayal, BAD dialogue, flimsy philosophy, etc. ?? Camera work was pretty good, and it seems that a group of inspired dogma. Make-up, too, seemed to be focused on the display of these players in the raw and rough light as it is the worst I've seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of his films (while the person she really attractive). <br /> <br /> I believe that if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society, so we can be thankful we are not part of it then Pons achieved his goal. Flurry almost identical sex scenes was appropriate film waste (when the actors were filmed, but once in a blue dress green background behind them could be changed in the studio special effects for a song). However, I've heard a lot of male audience squirm in their seats during this, but an objective view proves that it was not the real purpose of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and watch something else.
