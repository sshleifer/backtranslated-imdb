You could not go to sleep at night. So I got up, turned on the phone and this film was included. <br /> <br /> The film makers had bitten off more than they could chew. Just as in the framework of an ambitious, like "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump reads like a fairy tale, where an extremely lucky man leads us through the era. TGMB just rely on tired cliches to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical where the actors have to ham it. The goal of each character had to fill out stupid 60s archetype <br /> <br /> Take as we presented Finnegan :. Hugging her black maid and receive framed picture of MLK. Criminey, talk about oppressive. Why not just give him a t-shirt with the inscription «I Heart Black People» <br /> <br /> The Sun: "There is no free love groovay, man Oh, no, I have not had my period» <br /> <?. br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, Sun rectangular UCLA.» er, I'm sorry there was nothing square about Los Angeles in 60 years Instead of time to demonstrate that done?. Berkeley unique, we only hear the boy whine about not going to be there. <br /> <br /> I can not even remember the name of the black child. He was a pillar used to show how racially tolerant of other children. <br /> <br /> With right in that period, the pieces should not be this cheesy. Take "Dazed & Confused". Look, we met with the football hero, Randall Floyd. We first did not see him on the football field. In fact, we have never seen as he plays football. We presented it in a class by inviting him nerdish poker friends to a party. <br /> <br /> in «Dazed» feminism is not an accidental byproduct of a chick getting flown. It is much more organic, more serious than that. It is refined in the ladies room on the flip debate about the island Gilligan. Serious ideas can grow in the most ordinary circumstances. But real life is like this. <br /> <br /> Some of the warm comments here noted that the themes in the film is still relevant. I agree! That's why I feel so disappointed with this piece of Baby-Boomers pornostalgia.
