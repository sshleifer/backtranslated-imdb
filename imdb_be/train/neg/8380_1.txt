It's here. Finally the movie comes out, I can honestly say that it is worse than Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector. However, I'm willing to bet Wayan brothers in the (hilarious) will make more money than I've ever done in my life that is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time, outside of my fifth grade class is staging Romeo and Juliet. I mean really why would anyone ever seen this movie, if they have not been paid. Comedy weak, and all even remotely funny jokes from the weak plot were certainly shown in the advertisement. Closing remarks this movie was terrible disappointment to me. And videos looked so promising ...
