Generally I do not like movies directed by Sydney Pollack ( «The Firm» being somewhat of an exception), and I've never been a fan of Robert Redford ever. Nevertheless, I thought, "Three Days of the Condor" must be a good number of comments praising it has received. <br /> <br /> While the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing to the eye and Max von Sydow does a good job as a professional killer sinister, I discovered that the whole matter is extremely disappointing. The film is undoubtedly exudes the atmosphere of paranoid, but everything falls apart in a confusing plot, which seems to have no meaning. <br /> <br /> The film also contains one of the most unsatisfactory endings I've seen that actually the letter the audience hanging in the air. And what about that absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I would prefer to see any of Hitchcock's films five times than sit through this part of the waste again.
