Watching It lives at night makes you wonder who in the world of green light that shit. Young go caving on their honeymoon, attacking the bats and the husband begins to run in pajamas attacking different people. Where exactly are they? They are in the wilderness, they are on skis, they are in a small town that looks like it is a mountain nearby. The town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against Dr. whiny boy. Ski Hospital is run by really good groovy guy with a thick mustache, and his wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore and Marilyn Quayle. There's no drama and the ending will leave you filled with anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston did the effects for this film. I think you have to start somewhere.
