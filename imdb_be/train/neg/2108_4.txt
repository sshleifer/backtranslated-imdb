A number of brides mysteriously killed time at the altar, and then their bodies were stolen en route to the morgue. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate the mysterious murder. She discovers that before each ceremony, the bride got a rare orchid (presumably from the groom), which contained a powerful drug that yielded them. Patricia said that the orchids were first grown by Dr. Lorenz, who lives in a secluded estate with his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz was responsible for the crime, putting brides in limbo, and the use of their iron liquid to keep his wife forever young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz on medical secrecy surrounding his wife) tries to get a hand of Dr. Lorenz by creating a fictitious marriage, which eventually leads to a crazy Dr. Patricia paws. This film was very well opening of the drum, but mostly end up too many shots and set other weak scenes. Throw decent, the Walters and Coffin deserves better, but that's life. Russell eclipses (even with a grimace Lugosi-, which makes one of the most memorable of his speeches, even given his monogram) as Countess Lorenz plays a role in the quality of many stereotypical features many modern Hollywood diva. Weak and contrived ending, as well. An estimate based on B films 4.
