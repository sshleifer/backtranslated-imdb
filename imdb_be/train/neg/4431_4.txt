This painful comedy-drama has received surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979, I remember the opening film of the LA Times, and looking at the 2-page advertising the "second chapter" filled with burning captions like: "Better thanÂ« The Goodbye Girl ! "And," Neil Simon's doing it again! "What Neil Simon do? He takes an autobiographical situation (remarry too soon after the death of her beloved husband) and makes it a rusty, unpleasant and - worst of all - unfunny. James Caan plays Neil - er..that it, George - a writer who can not seem to come back to life after the loss of his wife; enter spirited Marsha Mason (in real life, Mrs. Simon ... soon to be ex-Mrs. Simon), who tries to love George, despite his general mood and melancholy. Mason is a very attractive and may have saved the day, if not indifference Caan (not to mention the relatively podagovore painfully thin, blonde Valerie Harper, who brings things to a screeching halt). I love Mason burst at the end ( "I'm fine! I'm nuts about me!"), But I did not see a happy ending for these two people ... and time has proved me right. ** from ****
