Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife died. Soon after, he approached Dr. Price, a specialist in the field of Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), who claims that he receives a message from his dead wife Anna Jonathan through all sorts of electronic gadgets. Anna tries to tell Jonathan that something? Is this just a hint of something on a large scale cosmic or other-worldly? It's good to see Keaton in the title role, but the story that he was stuck with a winding and absurd in the points; it's as if the film does not know how to answer any questions that it brings, so it's just distracting the viewer with new and unrelated issues. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself pretty well, convincingly cast as bereaving widow desperately trying to communicate with his dead wife. He had quite a bit as an actor, leaving behind the brotherhood role waacky-jokes he played 15 years or so before. He looks a bit rocky, with perhaps a few more wrinkles than you would expect, but it has not lost any of guile and panache that he showed during his quarter of a century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So it's not that Keaton turns in a mediocre performance, it's what he irregularities script. Author Niall Johnson, the story becomes more and more confusing, as it progresses, each winding path that ends in another tortuous path. It's all good, if the path leads to some kind of an acceptable solution, that connects more or less all together and explain ... something. But not white noise; I knew less about what happened with Jonathan than I did before I first saw it. <br /> <br /> really the only reason to watch this garbage Keaton, although he gets excellent support Maknisa (as Dr. value) and Deborah Kara Unger as a necessary love interest.
