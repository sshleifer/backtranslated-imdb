What made the idea to see this film so appealing was the hope that he will live up to the splendor of the original Charlotte Bronte's classic story. I was deeply disappointed that the film, which seemed to be in writing or withdrawn in a hurry, did not have the qualities that made the original novel is so powerful. Most of the witty back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, it seemed a no screenplay or left on the floor of the room. Moreover, the absence was a charismatic sense of Jane Eyre's self, which allowed her to suffer her confusion and triumph over all. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this film do not seem so much to win over, including one of the biggest part of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield, and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame over to ask for bread, the threat to freeze in the cold, anything to get away from the man she loved, were, in my opinion, the piercing of the stories that were simply excluded from this film. The title character seemed dry and uninspired. The story was unappealing for those who have not read the book, I can not imagine that this story is a little bit interesting. The script and direction were few, if any loan of the classic story.
