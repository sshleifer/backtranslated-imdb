I did watch the whole movie to the infamous finale, although I felt so angry at what I saw. I felt that the director shouted for attention, and the only way he could achieve this was to be disgusting as possible. Since I lived in the UK, I love this country, but this film reflects the British young people, in the worst imaginable. There's nothing to say, but to avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. People involved should be ashamed.
