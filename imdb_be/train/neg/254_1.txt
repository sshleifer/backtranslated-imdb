Ah, the lure. How I hate you? Let me count the ways. 1. Are you trying to be funny, but trite and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable to be expected, and when it comes, does not cause laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You are trying to be dramatic, but it's unbelievable; woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates, and how scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates is trying to intimidate someone with a gun. It does not work, is not it? A lawyer so maybe, but not a weapon. Not suitable.) As for Jamie Fox, well, just watching him try to put a dramatic and cordial dialogue is ridiculous, and makes me want to quit. 3. You are trying to be futuristic, but instead of boring and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up, a tripod for the camera to be lost to the stage to rock more than in the Project Blair Witch, and I consider myself to be sick, and I once again want to throw. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you've failed! I would like to walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of jerky and without water, sun sunscreen and only Meryl Streep for the company. This ad would be more beautiful than one minute more spent watching all bait overact his way through the idiot writing stories with Bill Gates for the bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in the car, what kind of character Jamie Foxx just drove away A Cliff, but somehow manages to escape ... just kill me, do the right thing and promise me that somehow I will never watch a movie is bad, ever again.
