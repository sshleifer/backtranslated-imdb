It is totally defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a perfect example of its irrelevance as a filmmaker and as a "smart" polemicist. It is hard to believe that in fact, Godard believed all the Marxist and Maoist Kant. Anyone with half a brain can handle the bankruptcy of the "isms" and how many people they have destroyed and continue to destroy even Godard made his movies supporting them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: are you sad voiceover reading tedious political tirade in your audience, and then, when you could not think of anything else to do, a layer of another voice-over to the first voice-over, who lost his audience after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insists on making the film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; is not it? It was the only guarantee of receipt of such a senseless waste seen in the first place: Stones genius outshining mediocre and gurgled a political idiot set freely with the camera. Bookstore scene was not fit even worse fringe theater, and it was an insult to intelligence, even young children who have been used to play in it - as it would be easy to see. Copping-out, allowing the friendly critics argue that all this simple shit was a satire on filmmaking does not basically safer was refused to offer to those who clearly see the poverty Godard intelligence and the arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironically, the one-time great friend of Godard, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film about filmmaking ever, and Godard made the worst of Lem Mepris! By the way, Godard has not chosen stones track sympathy Devil. It just happened to be when they were working on "Movie" began shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.
