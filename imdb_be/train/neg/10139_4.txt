You have to pass it to Steven Seagal: all his other shortcomings may be, he has good taste in women. If you choose a movie Segal, is likely to be one or more of very beautiful women in it. And, as a rule, they do not function just eye candy; they participate in the action and fight, shoot guns, killing knives, etc. "Flight of FuryÂ» offers the duo CIERA Payton (which has a very sexual person, with juicy lips to meet Angelina Jolie) and Cathy Jones, and find time to be involved in both and a little Catfight lesbian caresses! And when it seems that I spend too much time talking about them, it is because the rest of the film, although passable, so uninteresting, it's hard to find much else to say. Oddly, the weakest aspect probably Seagal himself, who looks as if he can not even be bothered to try and qualify for care. This is the future of the military-style action movie, there is very little fighting in it and it does not fit into his role (hidden fighter pilot, "the best in the world", of course) very well, which may explain his offensive almost sleepwalking.
