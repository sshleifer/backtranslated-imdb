Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and terribly thumbs), who hitchhiked cross-country, in the end, to find its proper place among a group of peyote enlightened Cowgirls on a ranch dedicated to the preservation of the crane; Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissi, fingers or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted by Tom Robbins book, but his satire is not the main goal, and just sweeps across the map as Sissi (perhaps it was his goal, but without attracting an audience). Notorious box office flop was not as prepared as it was ignored, and you can see why: it is a series of sketches in search of a plot, and performances, directing and cinematography risks of all the variables. Thurman stitch creates next to the highway, trying to get a ride, but it's pretty much kill the career of the Phoenix. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write, but perhaps should be) provides the most solid performance as a doctor who works in one of these bollards. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
