Where to start, this film became ill and ended badly! It consists of a very poor acting and unrealistic effects that me cringing in his place, seriously, my cat could do better than this lot. <br /> <br /> Some of them are really funny, because it was so incredible, I would have rated it lower, but they did not get anything! Thus, attention to my warning, and if your do not get tired of your loved one to suicide, and would like a good reason to continue with suicide mission, do not bother with it. I'm still in shock that it really can be released to the public, then it should be a crime, and all participants must be arrested. I gather you are there now, so I'll leave it up to you to decide.
