Until this movie I only saw two movies directed by Andrea Bianchi: bad zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore (1981), known among horror fans for his unforgettable performances with the man child, Peter Burke, and pleasantly sloppy Giallo Strip Nude for Your Killer. Neither film was particularly impressive piece of cinema, but both were interesting in their own special way (and the fact that they showed a lot of gore and nudity does not hurt). The massacre, however, boring, boring, boring, despite quite a bit to splash and odd place free of bare flesh. <br /> <br /> The story about a series of murders in the hotel where the cast and crew of the horror movie live during their escape, confusing and so sad: when the blood does not flow, and the skin is not on the show, the film of the present struggle to sit (it took me four attempts to finish), with endless scenes of unsympathetic characters squabbling among themselves and do very little attention. <br /> <br /> the only point of interest about the film is that its producer, Fulci, used several deadly scene cushion with his mega-bloody film The Cat in the brain (AKA The Nightmare Concert). And if you have seen this film, then there is very little reason to worry about the massacre.
