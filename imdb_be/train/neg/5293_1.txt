I took this video after reading the text on the box, the story seemed good, and it was Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of viewing, I noticed how badly his action was, he walks and talks so stupid all the time, it is a fake, and not convincing. It does not end there, almost all the characters are so strong that it's funny, the only acceptable action was Alan Boyce (David), but the guy committed suicide at an early stage, and you do not see it again, you do not even know why he did it! Everything about this movie scream of poor quality, I can not believe how such a thing is released! I felt a lot of time to stop looking, in fact, I did, halfway through it, I decided to stop watching, and turned the contraption came to IMDB to check what the thought of this, I found zero comment (not surprising), so I decided to force myself to deal with the pain and return to finish it then came here to comment. The only good thing going on (for me) was a high-school theme Rock band from time to time to play the guitar and singing parts, but it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> It is very bad acting and directing ... Scary movie
