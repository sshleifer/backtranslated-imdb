The plot is a direct rip off with Resident Evil, acting is awful, especially Rick Â»s fake crying his brother, so a fake gun, because each time the weapon is fired it sends out sparks, and make up only lame. It is only covered with fake blood on the actor's face. Zombies also vary. They run, growl, and must be shot in the heart, to die! Zombies just have to scuffle, moan, and should be killed by a shot in the brain to die! This film is so horrible, that is the only true outtakes good moment of the film. Hood of the Living Dead gets 3 out of 10, few entertainment here and there, but it is possible only to a low budget distorts the festival.
