I hate this movie! It was nothing like the book, and just thinking about it makes me crazy. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yes, it's a good movie. But the King was a strange book, and the film has not been anything like it. I mean, common sense can be a kind of similar, but most aspects of the film are quite different. Ending for example! Thus, the book is extremely intense and Denis and Wendy run second to vzryvaeta hotel. but in this horrible jack version of the film, such as take them through the maze stupid ... yeah, nety labyrinths in the book and there is no reason for this. The other part, which made me angry that Jack just killing Mr. Halloran! what the hell, he basically hero of the book, and they just kill him off as he was not important. Overall, it was just bad that movie was so much different.
