As Freddy's Revenge, is a continuation takes quite a strange idea and not have to go to great lengths to squeeze the story out of him. Basically Alice in number 4 is pregnant and her child pursues Freddie, which gives him a way out, to chase your friends. This is the least deaths of the entire series, and the wise cracks quite poor, so no supporters or supporters of the horror comedy happy. <br /> <br /> I have not much to say about it. This is a moderately interesting to see the character of Alice and Dan return of four, but it is not necessary to watch the movie again. Uninspriring and unenjoyable, is only possible direction competant saves him from the worst of the series.
