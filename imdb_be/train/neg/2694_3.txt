Warning: contains spoilers. When the film begins with the sex scenes, it is a bad film. (See, e.g., 300). This one confirms the statement made above. The second scene is a rotating center of all the action. The fact that we know that the end makes the film boring. Furthermore, other areas revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. It made more frustrated. In order to compensate for this lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how unbalanced are symbols. And oh yeah, they have a lot to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, a drug addict, anymore? He deceives his wife anymore? He plans to rob his father more? His wife is cheating with his brother more? He doesn "t regret his involvement in mother's death, more? he is a serial killer, more? etc. etc., is not enough space to write here ... I wonder how it could have maximum performance. And why his wife had not left him. On the other hand, I like a lot of the play actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here PSH save what's left of my $ 7 spent on this nonsense. Why nonsense? Because it does not make sense, why should I care about the nasty characters? Another broken lemma is that the film should be pretty (at least nice) character. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is a lot of sentiment, for example, we have to take care of Widowhood connivance of parents, not knowing anything about parents'lives to commit a crime.
