it was easier to time (the seventies), a prime location (San Francisco), where a person could make a simple movie about a crazy psychotic drugs re-crucifixion of Christ as a woman acid with never ending dream sequence among the retrospective section, having a multi-racial orgy inter gender, regardless of financial responsibility or moral consequences. <br /> <br /> This film is tedious, slow, boring is the worst example of this kind of artsy hands heavy art school dreck that passed as an art in the mid 70s. and I love it! when the train derailment ins endless slow motion zoom and heavy guitar reverbed echo chamber acid licks starts you can not take your eyes off it until it was ridiculous and absurd end. its kind of a cross between Jesus Christ Superstar and the valley of the dolls, and the trip really crappy acid on a water bed parents. it at the same time train wreck, completely mesmerizing and a great picture of the worst (or best) to class members seventies phychadelic film genre. <br /> <br /> plot. <br /> <br /> I just tell you the story, because it is unlikely to be able to say that is due to the constant cross-edited flashback to the events, which may or may not happen with characters who may or may not be themselves, and his face painted hippie freak nicknames endlessly jumping on a banal sequence level performing arts of pantomime as street theater. <br /> <br /> Â«Logan" really annoying film producer rebel who yells at people ALLOT and surrounded mostly silent film crew who are always dropping acid and have what seems like really bad orgy. Richard Dreyfuss has a supporting role, it seems as accountant. crew seems to hate him, for some reason, and breaks out into maniacal laughter, perhaps tormented him. "Suzanne," the title character is a blond willow that ladder vacuous space and comforts stark raving mad "artist" character. "Artist" is completely crazy, by the way. any of its hamfisted replays or incredible awfulness of his paintings. Of course all the terrible naked Suzanne. There are some other characters that appear randomly, cigar chomping "man" character. which is also all hot for Suzanne, I think. He has a monologue. I could not ever understand what he had to do with the story but each was to hate the "man" back, and you could not make the movie without him. there is also a mute girl. Dumb pays off in the end, believe me, it is incredibly stupid.
