After hearing raves about this movie for years, I finally decided to rent it and watch. Let me say that I am glad that the rent was free from the local library. This step was slow, boring, unrealistic and the plot does not make sense. After 2 hours I was ready to launch a nuclear strike that backwater town Texas and put the group of those characters out of their misery. I understand that taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand all the hype I had heard about this movie. Dallas provided as a good part of life in Texas as this film. Rent only if you want to understand how the studio can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the public that a bad film good.
