I saw this film when it first came out in 1970 and hated, hated, hated! Easily the most booooring film I've ever seen in my life. I do not know where Lee got his inspiration, but it's one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open your mouth and talk. The name says it all, because there is no save points in this movie, just a long, long silence with people who are not able to articulate what they (supposedly) feeling. If you want to see something that will drive you to drink, then this one is for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, then insert the plug in the toaster: the experience will be much more enjoyable than anything you will get from this! So, Lee came up with a lot of really worthwhile thing much later in his career, but give it a miss.
