The minimum scenario, the minimal nature of the development, the minimum steady camera. The maximum stretched scenes maximum headache causing jerky zooms, the maximum number of characters that are in the woods, doing nothing. Up until the time flashes on the screen 12:01, you can fast forward and not miss anything, because there are three hunters, we do not know anything, not doing anything. To be fair, the film has a certain line of music that was interesting, so maybe the music video would be the way with this. Unfortunately, it will not be, and that was twenty minutes short stretch of faith. Forget about «Trigger Man», I know what I'm trying. - MERK
