Pros: Performance Akshay Kumar (is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump AB together in his films?). . Some touching scenes in the 2nd half <br /> <br /> Cons: all the 1st hour (jokes are flat, to put it mildly). Every scene involving Razhpal Yadav. The main stupidity in making decisions AB. Let me get this straight, he said, brutally abusing the soul of his son in every way (which is likely to destroy their relationship irreparably) is the best way for him to make Akshay finally take some responsibility, it actually says him the truth ?? WTF? He believes Akshaye too soft to bear the fact that his old father was going to die of cancer, but thinks he insulted make it stronger? I'm the only one who does not see the logic here? Easily the biggest drawback <br /> <br /> film -. Akshay becomes stunt. LMAO !! We were told that he finished first in the college every year and has an MBA. But when it comes time to support himself and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stunt. LOL !! In fact Abt application for normal operation in the field of Uri? Or Heck, anywhere else where ur life is not in danger? This is some incredibly stupid literacy <br /> <br /> -. Ending. I hate this kind of melodramatic crap. Everything is pushed down our throats feel sorry for the nature of AB, which I could not. Everything that reminded me a little too much in the SRK KHNH (which I hate). This "please, sorry for the guy with the disease," obsolete crap. I felt like vomiting than sympathy for the old. Could see the final 20 or so minutes out of him, and therefore had to fast the FWD. . All this <br /> <br /> BottomLine:. waqt just too dumb to be called a good film, it's obvious, director Vipul Shah target is in an emotionally unstable Chicas and old people who could care less about the history, which is really It makes sense. Give them some decent picturizations songs, fancy costumes, lots of glycerin-filled scenes and some stars power, and they will happily lap up shit like that.
