Susan Swift is an attractive young man, flower child transplants in 1980 year (as a young Susan Dey), but it does not quite have the vocal range for the demanding dramatic lead, and she has a tendency to whine; still, it is quite sweet and has bright eyes and sweet smile. In «The Coming» (as it was called when briefly released in theaters), Swift may be the reincarnation of a witch Salem. Flick a very low budget and borrows from many other paintings that I gave him about 15 minutes to go. It starts strong and has a certain appeal camp. It is obvious that there are more serious films that deal with the witches of Salem, who deserve to see on this one; however, as unsuitable films go, it's not so scary. Boston locale is a definite plus, and the supporting cast is entertaining unnatural. * 1/2 ****
