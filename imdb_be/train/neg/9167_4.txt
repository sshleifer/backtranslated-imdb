"Leap Years" is a film adapted from the novel electron Singapore writer Catherine Lim, who became the first in Singapore novel / novella will be sold over the Internet. The film was a tortuous schedule of post-production: a shot at the beginning of 2005, he was slated for release in late 2005, only to be finally 3 years later, February 29, 2008, a leap year <br /> <. br /> Before I say something, I must first admit I am not a fan of romance genre, so I can be a bit biased against the film - I watched it only because it was the production in Singapore, and it is available to borrow in the library of my surroundings. Here are my two cents on the film. <br /> <br /> Let's just start with the fact that in addition to KS Or Yu-Wu and Wong Lee-Lin, all mention here seems Eurasian. The love interest is a Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and a trio of Wang friends all, e-scars, Eurasians. Do perpetuate this movie stereotype that falling in love and communion with the Eurasians are more "in" than the usual Chinese (or Asian race are you?) I do not know, it sure seems that way. In addition, everything in the film is spoken in some mystical «anglified» accent that does not exist anywhere, certainly not in Singapore. This kind of "semi-perfect English," that the government would like us to say, but does not exist anywhere outside of, say, MTV Channel. The effect is that the movie dialogue sounds forced and unnatural absence did not help believers blue Singaporeans in a cast. <br /> <br /> writer seems to be trying too hard to pull one-liners after one-liners. Twenty minutes later, "Joker" film begins to pall, and the film begins providing its usual cliché plate. <br /> <br /> I think I did not enjoy the movie because the entire premise of maintaining an affair for 16 years, it seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other incredulities in the film. I can not for one I believe that the KS (Li Yu-y plays) will fall on one of Wong's friends. A scene where the bride says, "Go, before I change my mind," has been used a hundred East Asia (Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc.) TV series ... <br /> <br /> so 4 stars for this film. The production cost is fair, and Wong Lee-Lin tries his best, but it does not help the script. Joan Chen has a 15-minute bit part in the film as a senior Wong and, perhaps, the best actress of the party, but, hey, its role is just a cameo. <br /> <br /> If you come across a "leap years" rent or library, you may want to pop it in the DVD-player for the sake of curiosity, but otherwise, for people who do not really love the romance genre , you can decide whether or not to give it a miss,
