Cut to the chase, this is one of the five worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's not that they did not try. There was some decent writing with some elements of the structure there is a good throw, some good action. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements may be a bad structure and no significant history, a lot of leadership replays (which is likely to be much better if reserved), some bad directing and editing. I've had enough for about an hour, tearing my hair for approximately half an hour, and is very excited about an hour and fifty minutes, he ran. There was also the insincerity of all this, is that I went with someone who used to be a drug addict. He was excited, he extolled the fact that there was nothing good to him. This was reinforced by a pretty 17-year-old girl who was in love with 30-year-old drug addict. <br /> <br /> And the lead character was obsessed with closing enough. It clumsy plot that were attempted structure, but the end result was sluggish and infinite (time jagged lines). The characters were colorful, but there is no end, that made me feel bad for the quality of the actors that you just have not seen enough. <br /> <br /> Let him. I assumed that this was the first time the director, who was fascinated by their shit, but he's done it before. I am puzzled as many other really bad idea to find someone who will actually give them the money.
