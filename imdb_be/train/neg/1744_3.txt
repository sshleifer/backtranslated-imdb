I watched the film Little «Boeing Boeing» made in 1985 (which, in turn, probably inspired by the British film of the same name), a long time ago. The main story of garam masala is the same - but he said in a pathetic way, great jokes replaced conventional ones that are in normal Hindi films (perhaps the director did it to satisfy the taste of the audience Hindi) ... <br /> <br /> I have not seen the original English. But really I liked the film is small (DIY Priyadarshan), which was on the side splitting comedy, then. Of course, acting by Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sakumari (which made the role of a cook) was so naturally and spontaneously. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too surprised Malayalam film that I can not tolerate even minor flaws in its Hindi remake. But I still feel like Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have outplayed. Paresh Rawa did a decent job - but it does not reach any Sakumari <br /> <br /> But on the whole it is good when compared with other recent comedy films in Hindi ..
