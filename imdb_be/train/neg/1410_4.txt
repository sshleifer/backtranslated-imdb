Yet known, but the decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) is not removed within four years. When he was invited to take part in a new project, he asked awkward cousin director cast him in the poor neighborhoods in Latin Carlson to explore the work of a small supermarket manager. He sees a beautiful Spanish Scarlett cashier (Paz Vega), and he is attracted to her ability. His driver does not return to catch it and Scarlet gives ride to the actor. But first, she interviewed for the post of secretary for a construction company and an actor helps her to be prepared; They then spend the afternoon together have a pleasant time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. Nevertheless, it is meaningless, "10 items or less" very disappointing. This low-budget film does not seem to have a story line, and is supported by Chemistry and improvisation, Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and really nothing happens for 82 minutes. Ambiguous open conclusion is ridiculous, with the character Morgan Freeman returns to his world silver spoon and says a simple worker, that they will never see each other again. Was he afraid of having an affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family? Or the clash of classes, and he understands that his fancy neighborhood will not be enough for an ordinary worker of the lower classes? My vote is four <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ( "Star in my life")
