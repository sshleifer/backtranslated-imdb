I am fully committed to novelist / screenwriter Chabon. His novel «Wonder Boys» became a fiction film by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago, and he had a hand in the script, "Spider-Man 2," perhaps the greatest comic book movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Director Rawson Marshall Thurber also directed the excellent comic figures, such as the gut-busting "Dodgeball" and a brilliant series of short films "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker». And with a cast including Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, it seems a no-brainer. <br /> <br /> It. Literally. <br /> <br /> John Foster star as Art Bechstein, the son of a bandit (Nolte), who recently graduated with a degree in economics. John is in the retardation of development: it works the minimum work salary in the book Barn, has a fresh relationship with his girlfriend / boss, phlox (Suvar), which is little more than a large number of sex, without any other than plans to chip in far in his career, for which he has zero passion. <br /> <br /> One night at a party, a former roommate, John introduces Jane (Miller), the beautiful, intelligent violinist. Later that night they go for the cake, and she asks Jon question that begins to shake it with the consciousness of the existence of the state, "I want you to tell me something that you've never told a single soul. If you do, it will make that night indelible ". John then tells her his dream haunting dream in which he wanders through the city, looking at the faces of strangers who pass by, but none of them do not look him in the eye. "I believe that this must be what death feels like," he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, a wild man Jane Cleveland (Saarsgard) kidnaps John from work and takes him to an abandoned steel mill clumsy, and soon John, Cleveland and Jane spend every minute together going to punk rock shows, doing drugs and drink a lot of alcohol. This does not sit well with phlox, which pushes John for more personal relationships, namely, to let her meet with his new friends and his parents. The film then tries to take us on the path of John, he gets rid of the shackles imposed on him by his father, phlox and his dead-end job, he finds the freedom and expression through his relationship with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem that we have to follow John throughout the film: it is completely uninteresting. He has no ambition, passion or purpose. He goes through life like an invisible ghost, he described the night they met Jane. In the beginning, it's not a problem. But he never gets more interesting. He's a passive character. He just follows the bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he did not give us any suspicions about what he cares about or wants to do with himself. <br /> <br /> Thus, the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do except party, have sex and get into an argument. In other words, much ado about nothing. What we have here is a shallow skin is a good movie without anything inside. Sweeping cinematography, ponderous voice-over with the characters, looking into the distance, a lot of sex scenes both straight and gay, big arguments, meaner sex, chase scenes and tragic death ... but it does not seem to matter. Oddly enough, at some point, Jane, embarrassed a number of aimless action Yona, asks him: "What's going on, John? What does all this mean? "Yes, John, tell me. We in the audience dying to know, too. <br /> <br /> called "Secrets of Pittsburgh" must refer to the characters themselves, because that is what they are. They all fronts, one-dimensional backup for real people. The film never lets us. We never know what makes each of them tick. We see them doing a lot of things, but we do not know why. A lack of "why" it is one of the worst things, the film can have.
