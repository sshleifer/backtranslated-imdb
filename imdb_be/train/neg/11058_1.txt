Disappointing and no doubt dim true crime film that cast the bad character of the actor Jeremy Renner sluggish mumbled his way through the title role Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most famous degenerates / serial killers of the last century. Released straight to video in early 2003, "Dahmer" is clearly Talky, boring, poorly acted and almost bloodless snoring festival with a true crime drama, which never really delves into the terrible and crazy soul of the deceased as a mass murderer it was quite a good potential to do! What is, however, trying to do for reasons unknown to me cause for some sympathy from the viewer to the man, drawing him, that ultimately, lonely, nebbishy and strictly socially inept homosexual loser who just looks for love in all the wrong places Unlike a cold, calculating and perverse Sicko ~ d and a madman that he was! Overall, 2003's "Dahmer" is one that is a true crime buff everywhere could also miss out because I'm not kidding when I say that this is one of the worst serial killers biopic ever made! It even sorrier, other than the pathetic and exploitative trash directly to the video as "Gacy", "bandit", "Ed Gein» and «The Night Stalker»! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
