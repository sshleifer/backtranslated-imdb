No one, but no one could chew the scenery is heavenly, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and "Elizabeth and Essex" is a perfect example of why. Despite the fact that she replays the time from time to time, to watch her when she gawfs of Raliegh write lyrics to the song her lady in waiting is going to play: in this one moment, it makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to manage and manage absolutely! At other times, it is done with the richness of the script. When Elizabeth needs to be vulnerable, it comes off as weak and quarrelsome. This has the additional effect of undermining his authority:. When it blows its stack and threatens to render justice, it's hard to take it seriously <br /> <br /> Flynn exudes charm, making us see how the Essex was able to get through it way into the heart of Elizabeth, but he is completely unsuitable when transferring the complexity and apparent human evil. It also does not help that Essex poorly underwritten. Why is he a bully who wants to lose his queen - even if he swears allegiance to her - except only that he no blue blood, thus more "worthy" rule? And why bring Raliegh Elizabeth intercepts her letters and Essex? He is not in danger of falling out of favor, and we know where Essex (and its head) are headed. So why did he risk his head, accelerating the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What to do with all Curtiz $$$ gave him? He did not even bother to try to hide the fact that his action scenes are shot on a sound stage. He had graduated with Elizabeth alone for the first time in the tower; everything else that is necessary (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is not necessary. The costumes are fantastic. And it's me or Betty to look just like Susan Sarandon?
