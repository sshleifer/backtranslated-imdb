Of all the films I've seen, this one rates about a day (Haunted Mansion, nothing but trouble, and some others to keep it from reaching the bottom.) This is a hasty, story questionable and events depicted poorly acted, of course, we must lay the part this at the door of the book writer. The book was filmed after outrageously cumbersome and illogical. Oprah gives a delicious appearance as Â«Bigger in" mother, but not on its potential. Other notable performers, too, seems to be the worst. The plot, which centers around an African-American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. When driving the family to the daughter of the communist dinner it becomes familiar. One thing leads to another, and she gets drunk. Now the family, it does not work away blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home, he puts her to bed, but she starts caterwauling. Blind mother (yes) hears it, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead to strangle her. Now, fearing that he was really in trouble for killing a white woman, he does what any logical thinking person would do - he puts it in the coal oven. So the investigators conducted a missing person case, and that they check the oven (idiot entirely prudent to get rid of the ashes. Then he was arrested, and the last hour or so is disgusting segments from the court. If your desperate bad film, it could be to make this work, but if you seriously want to learn about the problems of the culture in the 40's and 50's, or to see a good drama, there are many better options. Avoid this.
