I take this to see more Vanesa Talor once. She can act, but did not get a chance in this clunker. The sequence of opening to provide a camera crane mountain scenery. It must have come from the mother archive, because the film is based directly on the videotape. production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There's a really cheesy animated statue, but no other effects should be noted. This film is bad, but not so interesting. The players will do well, not to mention it on your resume.
