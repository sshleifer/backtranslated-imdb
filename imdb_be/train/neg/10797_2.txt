Shaq plays a genie was His name was Kazaam, and it was whack his rhymes were commonplace, these lines were bad some stupid kid crying over his bad dad silly anemones, bad casting, bad special effects, What's Next? this movie sucks Prolly not reach $ 20, he lives in a sun lamp tape hurts like a cramp, like a wet food stamp ... <br /> <br /> Yes, you get it, you silly rhyme genie who can "t act , in a silly movie with horrible special effects. Oh, and it is confusing as hell. I'm not even going to go further. Let's just say, it belongs to "its so bad its funny" category. Watch it once with your friends and get a good laugh. But do not expect anything spectacular.
