WOW! Why would anyone make a sequel to the film already rancid? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least have an idea about what he wanted to be. HPD2 not have a clue about what he wants to be. He was just there on the screen, for reasons I can not explain. Spoiler: The entire film is: Twitch (Kurupt played from Tha Dogg Pound) gets transferred to another prison, where he can be a box filled with gold bricks buried. In prison riot breaks out between rival inmates, one of them gets shot by a guy named Cortez, and Cortez is planning his escape. During the visit of the marriage fianc√©e twitch and Burke (played by Bill Goldberg) kidnapped daughter of Cortez and is held in the hall of execution. Burke reluctantly befriends Twitch, and they end up getting into trouble with the stupid prisoners, finding that Cortes has close <br /> <br /> Opinion :. This is the continuation of the unnecessary, as Universal Soldier: The Return. Scenario terrible acting is terrible, the dialogue is a joke, and everything in this film is a caricature. Look, I know that it was a low-budget film, but that is no reason for these guys not to make an effort in what they do. No one in this "cinema" does not believe in the characters they play. No one in this "cinema can not be taken seriously as an actor. Kurupt should be ashamed of themselves. His character "Twitch" largely spineless puppet Minstrel, who spends most of his time, creating a receipt exhausted Burke or other prisoners. Goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the film, as if he had to take a PHD (pretty huge dump). fight scene choreography bad and helpless and insurgent HPD2 is pretty boring, even if the action takes place! Don "t let anyone say that this film is somewhat decent. It stinks and is the main reason why people despise Follywood.
