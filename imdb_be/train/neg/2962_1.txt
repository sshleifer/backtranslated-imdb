Movies about dinosaurs may be of interest. So maybe Whoopi Goldberg movies. ? But Whoopi and dinosaurs <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex," I have come to one conclusion: this film is bad. Evil, mean, evil and reprehensible in it in spite of the audience. Nothing bad is done by accident; It is a visual equivalent of a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First of all, do not make good Vupite Adventure ( «Fatal Beauty» watch, if you think I'm lying), but the filmmaker Don "t care - it is a tough cop here again. <br /> <br /> I saw a million cops buddy clicks on this week? Well, that's the number one million and one, buddy. <br /> <br /> I do not like sweet, humanistic animated dinosaurs that came after that Spielberg TV show about them? Sorry, here's another one, and he was a policeman, too! <br /> <br /> Are you one of those people who hate car chases, shootouts, careless dialogue, boring futuristic FX and see talented people (Goldberg, Mueller- Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a film that looks like a tax write-off? BIG tax write-off? <br /> <br /> And you read this review all the way through. You deserve to continue. Seriously. <br /> <br /> At present, not the stars, but not the only one. And if they really do a sequel to "Theodore Rex" Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a whole flock of wise cracking foam rubber dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> At the present time, I would have paid to see it.
