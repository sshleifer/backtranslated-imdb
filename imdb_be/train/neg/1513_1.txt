Flock is actually not a movie. This wannabe film with actors imitators. Not including Richard Gere, he gave an excellent performance, but if only one of the actors really give themselves to their character, and the rest of the actors are just playing ... the result is pitiful, as well as the film. You see, the idea of ​​steps to conceal the fact that you are acting. What features Claire Dains doing this? She is the actress is unacceptable for this character. In 99.9% of the film, she looked very ridiculous, because all !! The only thing she does ask stupid questions like "do you really think so ??" and makes a silly face. I was confused by her actions, seriously, and I loved it ... It is a romantic movie type, I do not know who chose her among all the actresses out there .... LOL, and see Avril Lavigne? it really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to get the feeling of throwing up, this film will do the work for you !!! I would like to vote -5 ..
