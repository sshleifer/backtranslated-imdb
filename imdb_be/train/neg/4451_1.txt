This film was probably about as silly as The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Case in point: <br /> <br /> 1. To fake her Drowning Roberts secretly taking swimming lessons at the YWCA. After her "death" AMY call your husband at work to give their condolences. Hi, how they got it working number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before she leaves town, she loses wedding ring in the toilet. Days or even weeks later, her hubby is with Yana. Does this mean the toilet never flushed? <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation is given about how she pays for her mother's care in a nursing home (since she did it for her husband RICH ago). <br /> <br /> 4. By the end of this tedious film Roberts suspects her husband is in the house. Instead of running for his life, she runs to the kitchen instead, and see if the banks are neatly stacked.
