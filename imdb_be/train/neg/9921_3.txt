Strummer hippie past was open, but all in all it felt like crashing a wake. Koster story works best around intimacy stake. There were too many semi-boring old friends jokes and too much filler footage. I like The Clash and Joe ~ d for Sun reunification and to sell their songs still (FU Mick Jones), but this document has left me wanting..to more connected. Using fire storytellers without proper explanation of who tells anecdote alienate the viewer to some degree. They were interviewed in their own right. Even using Strummer in "radio DJ voice" was not enough to paste the film together. And can someone explain all flags fly over fires scene? After a strange «Filth And The Fury» I was hoping that the temple can deliver. Joe Strummer document deserves better.
