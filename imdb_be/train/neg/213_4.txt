Yes, indeed, it might be a good movie. Love lune (pardon the poetic license, but it's not a triangle!) Interesting story, unfortunately, poorly told. The image is sometimes strange, sometimes good, the picture is crowded and narrow-sighted. Sound requires more attention (it usually happens in the Romanian film), sometimes badly chosen light and color filters. The soundtrack is short and does not help actions. About acting ... I'm sorry, but the best actress mistress. The rest are variable and can not convince the viewer. Acts of poetry, when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetic. This picture is for adults told the children. Disturb only if it is very interesting.
