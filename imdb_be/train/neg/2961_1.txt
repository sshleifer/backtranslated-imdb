I was babysitting a family of three young children during the night, and their mother had given it to me to show them just grabbed him at Wal-Mart at the beginning of the week. All three children actually got physically ill during his show. I'm sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they picked up from school, but in fact it could be this movie. Absolutely disgusting. How anyone can produce this caliber of garbage for me. Fortunately, I turned off the movie when I noticed that the children do not react and behave strangely. For all the parents out there, I strongly advise you to refrain from putting young children to watch this movie.
