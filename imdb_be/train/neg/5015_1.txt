As a film critic for several Dutch websites I have seen a lot in the movie, but not all are very good. Some movies are so bad, you will not be surprised that they would be released directly to video. With the taboo, the IAM surprised that he would be released on video in general. This is really a low budget of poor quality is badly written trash. <br /> <br /> A group of young people playing a game of Taboo. They record their most sickening desire or action, and then to kill people because of their taboo's. The question is, should we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> There's a potentially interesting plot-twist, and I will not give it here. But that might be interesting is stupid, poorly acted and without any reason. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors playing the big titles, so why on earth they sign up for it? If you see it anywhere, try to avoid it. There is no logic, no sense of human qualities in this film.
