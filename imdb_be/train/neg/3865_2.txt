It is so incredibly bad. The poor actors. You can tell that they are trying really hard to polish the feces, but we all know you can not. Drafting is so obvious and patronizing, it's sad to see how they are trying to sell. Humor and walk so worked up, it's hard to believe any of these good actors, signed it. <br /> <br /> However, it is so terrible that we hardly looking up from the screen. We just need to know where it goes Trainwreck. But this is only because we caught it on TV. If we had actually paid for it, we would be disgusting. <br /> <br /> So what gets 2 stars for the fact that, at least, amusing / entertaining bad. A musical accompaniment (unlike Trying too hard indie soundtrack) is ridiculously reminiscent of an episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not as good.
