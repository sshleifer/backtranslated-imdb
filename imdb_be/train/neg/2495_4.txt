The problem with this type of film is that it is literally made every year for ten of them. Fortunately for the use of only a handful refer to the movie theater, while others pushed straight to video or TV, such as the film. <br /> <br /> Best problems of this movie is really its originality. This is one of those movies that use the «Die Hard» formula of hard, but troubled guy being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, the character played by Wang Ding, who works in the security agency that thoroughly test the security measures for companies and individuals. In this case, he did not send on a cruise ship, which, of course, gets stolen. You can watch this movie as a kind of mixture of «Die Hard» and «Air Force One» and the film does not try to hide the fact that these two films was probably his biggest source of inspiration "." So really, you can not consider this film like the original at all. It uses all the clichés in the book and the film does not offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles something original. <br /> <br /> As you can expect from such a film as it is, it has a very weak script. Rather, he said, it has some very lazy to write. As I have said, that the film has nothing original, but also the actual story has some elements that are far from all, and are simply ridicules truthfully. I mean, stealing a huge cruise ship only about 8 guys from which Halve carrying only some small cannon, and then ask for a ransom "only" $ 10 million, on the ship, which is roughly worth 10 times that amount to ' is already in itself is quite ridicules. They even intend to divide the money then? Each person gets a little more than a million or something? This is hardly beneficial for such a big and risky enterprise. And then in the case of hostage-taking passengers. Somehow they managed to take the passengers hostage in a huge ship and they are able to put them in the same room, only one guy with a gun, which he can not even seem to be able to keep straight, look at them. You will never see more than 30 hostages but as if they were all people who were on board at the time. Also, if Van Dien character is not looking for his son, and vice versa, regardless of which room they go through on a huge cruise ship, they always collide with each other instantly. Just some examples of lazy letters in the film. <br /> <br /> But, of course, it is the action flick, so the story is, of course, becomes secondary. But then again, it's not as if this film features any good action at all. Halve the actors look as if they will never hold a gun up and the movie is filled with some mocks slow motion. This is really getting ridiculous at points. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film also shows the best actor, although I must say that Wang Ding does not really bad "action hero and actor, as well as genre and scheme B-movie is concerned. It is simple, but also It suffers from the same problems as Tom Cruise, no matter how old he is, he just never looks convincing enough to play the father of a teenager Van Dien once started out as a promising new young actor, but starring in films such as. it really does not help his career a lot. he is probably capable of something better if he never really given the right opportunity to show it. All the other actors also do quite honest work, but their characters are just so formulaic that they never really become interesting. <br /> <br /> Well, okay, it's not the worst movie genre that I've ever seen, but it is also ain "t exactly the most original and memorable one either. <br /> <br /> 4/10
