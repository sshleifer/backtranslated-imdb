This is probably one of the worst movies ever. Bad action, bad special effects, bad plot, bad. In the last 15 minutes of the cat suits cyborg enter that confuses everything. Malcolm McDowell, is to be, it is necessary to pay at home, because otherwise he would have had to sell themselves on Hollywood Boulevard to pay the bill. I just do not "know how you can go from Clockwork Orange, to this shit and be able to look at myself in the mirror every morning. I could have done better special effects in my bathroom. There is no continuity. The editor had to sleep or on drugs it so bad. debt. whether they should smoke is bad.? gun or shoot blue flames or bullets solved. bad girl and another girl in the film is so similar that it is confusing. whay it is called 2013 Seadly Wake. this It has nothing to do with the film
