Now I like Bela Lugosi, do not get me wrong, it is one of the most interesting people ever make a movie, but it is, of course, its share clunkers.This is just another one of them. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays Dr.Lorenz, a doctor who had his medical license pulled unclear reasons.He, however, do experiments, to his wife and young beautiful.It showed that it is still 70-80 years Lugosi looks in his mid-50s, then why did he marry this old woman never explained. <br /> <br /> In any case, these procedures or experiments related giving brides who married at the altar for a fragrance material, causing them to pass out but it is believed to be dead.Then Lugosi and some of its aides to steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to the lab, where it is stored in some kind of suspended animation or real state.Then kidnapped brides have needle rammed somewhere in their bodies may be in the neck, and then the needle ran into his wife's body Lugosi to return it to the youth and beauty.We never see where Lugosi and needle sticks or whatever it is that he draws from the brides, but it somehow restores his wife .Apparently old age makes screaming in pain because Lugosi's wife does a lot of screaming, until she returns to her younger state.Helping Lugosi in his laboratory the only good thing about this film .... amazing old hag and her two sons, one son deformed .... big lumpy looking inertia of person who likes to fondle asleep bride and another son, this little dwarf average .... the little man in order to be politically correct in modern world.At night only these three kind of perched and sleep in Lugosi lab.Who mourners at the bottom of the 3 and how they came to be frightened aides Lugosi is, like many things in this movie, never explained. <br /> <br /> So in any case, a female reporter gets an assignment from her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen bride are going to quickly find out to.She thousand per one common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid, which is on them.So she asks around and say that there is a world-renowned expert orchid, who live nearby, which just happens to be the one who developed this particular orchid. This expert is terrible Dr.Lorenz.She quickly tracks him down and tilts his little house horrors.I'm not sure where the police all this, but they came to clean up after the reporter did all the dirty work. <br /> <br /> it seems that movies Lugosi always been some unnecessary stupid storyline that just made the whole thing stinks to high heavens.I mean world-renowned expert orchid kidnaps brides, sending them doped up he orchids It is known to have developed? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And then he showed that young ladies do not even have to be a bride for the procedure to work, so why keep Lugosi kidnap brides with very guarded churches for their experiments and the creation of all the attention and headlines? Why not just take a prostitute off the street like an ordinary pervert pervert will do? This clunker reminded me a lot of another stinker Lugosi, «The Devil Bat» .... the same silly storylines and bad actions and the same stupid "reporter gets a bad guy" thing. <br /> <br /> But Lugosi always good - it is creepy and sinister enough to keep you interested, at least enough to see him.The woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor .... it does not I had no emotions at all, she just put her lines like a machine gun, spewing them as fast as she could.Everyone still pretty much blew also, when he came to be a good actor. <br /> <br /> But this is watchable, if only it was always so intense for Bela Lugosi fans.Lugosi, even if the picture was dog.He must know what he was doing terrible picture, but perhaps he also knew that if he gave it everything he had little of the intensity can shine by all the bad sites and bad acting around him. <br /> <br /> And he was right ---- supporters horror, we will always have a love for Belo Lugosi.He gave it his all every tim e was before camera.We really gives two F ** ks for you Bella.
