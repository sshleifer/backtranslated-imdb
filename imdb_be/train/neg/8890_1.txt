On my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe that these people have done a very good game. <br /> <br /> -Let's start with the good bit, is not it? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman in the order, although some of his dialogue can be delivered with great feeling. Other actors need to pull it together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, whyfore You're not dead, Romeo? Actor, and not just completely wooden and calm, could not read it line with any appetite at all. He was completely out of focus, I had trouble even looking at Juliet's face, and does not grace with lines that he has been given. Whoever threw it deserves punishment. Juliet almost passable, but it does not provide the depth of her character, and it seems completely out of touch with the game. Mercutio was incredibly horrible and totally out of character for the entirety of his dialogue. Benvolio was unfeeling and ruthless jerks his lines. <br /> <br /> I had to endure this napavsyruyu production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was stilted, and the costumes were not enough distracting. I saw the kindergarten doll with great effort put into them. I just wish I could give this film the rating of zero.
