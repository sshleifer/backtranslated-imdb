This film was made for the people who found gremlin too seriously and Critters hardcore. Like many of the creatures / trolls / Gremlins movies 80s, this film is bad. The sad thing is that there is no climax to this comment. It's just wrong and not funny. <br /> <br /> The problem with this tiny monster movie is the fact that he is actually trying to be funny and ends up as well do it as Howie Mandell was Walk Like A people. What did the other 80-horror classics that they are really trying to be scary, but it was fun, because they are not so badly. Someone said Bettina Hirsch (yes Bettina Hirsch), she had a knack for comedy, before she started to direct this film. Unfortunately, they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course, seeing a strange little mutant cross between a ferret and a tumor worn brown cloak and throwing pool balls outcast from Lost Boys funny, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> So far, the most annoying part of the film's protagonist Paul. His Paul Reiser wannabe shtick enough to get you to start fast forward since his first scene to the ending credits only stopping once to see the scene where Munchie throwing pool balls on guys ... not that I did it. <, Br /> <br /> So, the bottom line is run, not walk, to the nearest Blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the grapes accumulate a bunch of garbage on the shelves.
