Not funny - anyone can relate it to Monty Python? This is absolutely ridiculous - no laughing. It's not funny. On top, but the ugly, strange only for the strange and it seems to me that these people were on to something all the time. Unfortunately, that does not make them funny. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to give some points for effort, etc. Whatever it was. In fact, it turns out, there is laughter track - or is there one? Hummm .... Since hardly any laughs that this is a controversial issue <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm doing this is unfair. - maybe it's some kind of exercise. A kind of art - in this case anything goes, not to mention <br /> <br /> But these guys play a woman with a high-pitched voices, upturned noses .. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one heir of Monty Python intellectual wit and Stephen Colbert, and, possibly, John Stewart.
