This film has not turned out to explore the human animal, that left me with an empty feeling inside. [Spoiler forward] I was not sure that Dr. D really had a good reason to give up a large ransom to do to help his furry friend. While Babe (Original) bucked the trend mnogobyuzhetnyh hits, focusing on the human virtues of animals against their fellow Humans, all the animals in this film was nothing more funny cartoons, one would love to stuff in meat grinder (especially when one would understand them meaningless babble). Without idiotic behavior Eddie Murphy, this film will be a failure.
