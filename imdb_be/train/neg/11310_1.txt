Firstly, yes, animal emotions. If you did not know that already, I believe you're a moron. But let's assume that none of us morons. We all know that animals have emotions, and now we want to see how these emotions are manifested in nature, right? <br /> <br /> What we get instead of tedious and ridiculously simplified documentary that tries to show how the animals are "people." Filmmakers search high and low for the shooting of animals involved in human-like behavior, and when that happens, they say: "This is a monkey almost human!" (This is actually a direct quote). <br /> <br /> All of this in human terms. They spend the time to theorize about what makes a dog "smile", but did not immediately mention it, which means wagging tail. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even go so far as to show a chimpanzee dressed in human clothes and cowboy hat. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a deep documentary about animals on their own terms. I would like to know how the animals re-play in their own languages. But instead, the researchers continue to fall back on the pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add cheezy soundtrack and images "Celebrating Christmas" chimpanzee, and it was enough to turn my stomach. <br /> <br /> But it does not end there. Half of this documentary filmed not in the wild, but in laboratories and pilot plants. All cameras Chimpanzee shots through the iron bars, and we see how these monkeys huddled in their sterile particular cells. One particularly sobering moment occurs near the beginning (although you have to be quick to note), where the captive monkey says in sign language, "want to. Hurry to go. " <br /> <br /> Obscure reference is made to "stress tests" and psychological experiments that I shudder to imagine. Baby monkeys separated from their mothers at birth and receive skeleton dolls in order to prove that the baby monkeys are hungry "mother figure". And after 40 years of experiments, the researchers smug pat yourself on the back for their achievement brilliant conclusion that the apes have emotions <br /> <br /> One chimp named "Washoe" was in a particular cell in 1966 for this purpose. and to this day it remains that way. We get a glimpse of a short (again through the bars) it leaning against a concrete wall with a rather dull expression. Personally, I do not need to see any additional experimental data. Washoe, I'm sorry for all of our kind.
