Isabelle Huppert's a great actor. Director of «La pianist" understands it, giving the viewer takes a long face Huppert, and it's nice to see. Huppert entirely animated actor. - it registers emotions with the smallest lift eyebrows or flickering smile <br /> <br /> Other than the pleasure of watching an experienced actor to succeed in their profession, it is not the film that makes me want to recommend it. (Well, if you like self-mutilation, sado-masochism and strange behavior, «La pianist" can work for you. In addition to these attributes, I could not find any particular value in it.) <br /> <br /> buried all over this amazing material has a grain of truth. People who are competing at the highest level - musically, athletically, whatever - start as strange people, and are formed in a competitive environment to strangers <br /> <br /> Not worth a trip to the theater in. re-learn this life lesson. <br /> <br />
