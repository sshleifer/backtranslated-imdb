James Gandolfini is a good actor, so that someday he will take on the role in this part of unfunny garbage. Affleck is just easy, that just can not cut it, the other actors are truly memorable. I have seen this in the United States in an empty theater, I soon realized why this place was empty after about 10 minutes. I went to the end it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when, in England, I have seen the film was lit this report yoyo "Paul Ross" in one of the Sunday market down. I always hope for Russia, to save me money on movie tickets, when he says that the movie is good, I get right on this very site to check it out. This film was supposed to go straight to a DVD Â£ 1.99 in a supermarket near you.
