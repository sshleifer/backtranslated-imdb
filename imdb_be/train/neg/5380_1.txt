At the time of writing this review, it would appear that more than 50% of voters, given the IMDb movie rating or 10 or 1. I can only assume that those giving it 10 were either cast or crew. <br /> <br /> They say that if enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters, the only monkey accidentally proddings on the keyboard, eventually by typing the complete works of Shakespeare. However, I seriously doubt that, given the same number of monkeys and time, you could find no one to give it a rating of the film 10. <br /> <br /> I patiently watched the first half, foolishly believing that the film would be, on some level, develop a plot or characters, or maybe do some social commentary or provoke a bit of intellectual thought. Otherwise, I was ready to take action, suspense, comedy, horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention. In the end, I was disappointed, and thus, most of the second half was seen twice as fast as I searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption. Unfortunately, it was not there. <br /> <br /> If the «Choke», thrown against Scooby-Doo episode, then I am afraid that the cartoon will win hands down in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And if we talk about a cartoon character, which affect the ability of various cast members ranged between acceptable (at best) and the strikingly poor with the image of Brooke Bailey of bizarre, death obsessed pseudo goth, London, being so bad, I almost felt sorry for her . <, Br /> <br /> I would like to end on a positive note, but even the soundtrack, the second speed of the ball of the modern punk rock, failed even to entertain, not to mention the film is very bad for gain.
