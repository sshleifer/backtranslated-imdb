Perhaps the only thing that got a movie to four for me is that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's largest portrayers of bumbling incompetence. ,, And yet it is one of the few anchors that prevent it from being a chaotic disaster. As Pops novel, it provides a respectable mix of gangster glamor and straight man to the manic folly Chris Cattani in. Solid performances also invited Richard Roundtree as the harried boss, Vinessa Shaw as a talented female FBI agent bobbing her head and the glass ceiling, Fred Ward, as an advisor Falk and Benedict Arnold. <br /> <br /> The story concept actually has some amazing opportunities and, in the hands of a young Steve Martin and Chevy Chase, would prove a great comedic car. Ride, which seems to deify or Ernest Pee Wee Herman, simply provides a tangled mess. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portrayed his brother discrepancies as far from their proven ability. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are too few and too many sad split. What I really miss is what always attracted me to the movies, Leslie Nielsen. There's no "second tier" wit top of a farce. A lot of cultural references that only adults get. , NO ambiguity. , This is just silly. <br /> <br /> And by the way, this does not mean that I recommend it for your 9-year-old, because we hope that they will have a better taste and less exciting with some of their body parts and their functions.
