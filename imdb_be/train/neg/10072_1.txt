Unfortunately, I made a mistake and I paid 7 euros in a movie theater watching this fine pointless film. My points; <br /> <br /> The film is based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) the ethnic point of view: As it happens in most American films, the writer considers himself as an expert after training 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But, unfortunately, not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 other names of products does not make a person understand the culture. For example, shaving is a sign of a pure life in Asia, but still tried to girl, to stop it. Lebanese Christians (Well they got that) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between eastern and western culture, we do not ethnocentrism. Thus, we do not judge people after their first issue of our life as a father figure made the film. <br /> <br /> 2) The sexual revolution of the girl: There's nothing special to say about it. Show me 10 girls who had them on their sexual awakening, what I will say that I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment, because manufacturers are promoting the film in black comic genre. Please look Dr.Strangelove and make sense of black humor. Black humor should reflect the truth and should focus the audience funny part. Where is the truth? Where the meaning of the film.
