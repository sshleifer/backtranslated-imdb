It is not surprising that this film never saw the world. Time was release was terrible. Gong Show was already "jumped the shark" as long as there was a film, so that someone would pay money to see some of the censored clips from the initial launch of the show? And the show just a modicum of clips that unfortunate 90 minutes Chuck Barris whine about how hard his life was as the host of the show. Did he really expect us to feel sorry for him and his messed up life of a millionaire? Does he really think that we even wanted to know about his life? (Obviously, this is because, as he later wrote his wonderful autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) He thought the gag to have everything, everywhere listening to it will stay fresh for 90 minutes? Or executive network hounded him at every turn? It may have served as a plot for an episode of the sitcom after 30 minutes, but not as a full-length movie. Nevertheless, it was nice to see, Rip Taylor, Gin Gin, and an unknown comedian again (though, to make a film, "sharp", include only its most vulgar procedures). And as someone pointed out that it is the first major film part of Phil Hartman (although it only lasts for a minute). Please note that his name is written in the credits Hartman, that is the name he was born. You can not miss his voice and facial expression, despite the fact that it is much thinner, and younger, than in the days of SNL. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; one of his first after leaving the soap world.
