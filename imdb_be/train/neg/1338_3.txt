I have seen switching targets ..twice .... always the same feeling ... you see the Olsen twins to make the same movie .... they like to play a variety of sports, and then fall in love with boys..OK now about the movie .... first of all these little boys and girls do not play on such big goals ... 2.football plays on timeouts ... 3. If the game is at its end referee gives overtime (a minute or more). .. and finish as expected .... I think this film is bad due to the lack of football knowledgement .... if it was made by European manufacturers would be better..an d also mane actors is not an option Wright ... they suffer from a lack of authentic..OK they played several seasons in the full house, but it does not make them big stars .... you have to show your talent. ... and this is what is missing in the Olsen twins
