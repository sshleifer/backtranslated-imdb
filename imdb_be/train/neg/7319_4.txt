if you come to the scene, which include Albert Brooks without his shirt ... I try not to gag on a fur ball. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I have seen most if not all of his films, but it was the first time seeing it. Modern Romance interesting perspective on the theme of love. There are some films that handle the hopelessness of love and openly as Modern Romance, although in 1979 Chilly Scenes of Winter is very close. They both basically deal with the possessed people who are too mentally involved / possessed by his woman. <br /> <br /> Somewhere like Chilly Scenes of Winter borders on stalking, this film has a reasonable basis to the subject of love, because both people are already in a relationship .. and from the relationship .. and back in again. <br /> <br /> because it's a film that was released in 1981, this time in terms of style and such. This is the main reason why I love this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies, "If it sucks, at least, it might have some historical significance," you know, the time capsule material <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the horrific scenes of Albert Brooks SANS. shirt. <br /> <br /> man hair. it is the hair. As he dressed in a black curly fur sweater hairs. and what's worse, it looks almost burn victim hairs. it's not a pleasant sight, and scenes with him shirtless go on and on. Back in the early 80's hairy men were seen as normal and nothing to shock ..! Naga But in 2009, represents something like this is just outrageous Unfortunately, Albert I want to at some point, someone said, "Hey, let's try this scene, but you wear a simple T-shirt, I mean you can scare people" . It's just too bad, and I feel sorry for the poor beautiful actress who had to deal with Albert Brooks naked body on top of her. She's probably pulling your hair from her teeth in a few days after that. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a movie OK. It might be better if I did not see Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 minutes long continuous because permanently damage my viewing of the film.
