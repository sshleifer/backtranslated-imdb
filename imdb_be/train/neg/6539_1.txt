If it can be assessed at 0, it will be. From monstrous wooden steps to blunt diligence pace, the children's corner of exploitation and babble pseudolesbian tickling added solely for the purpose of boring the audience, this is a disaster movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, since from the very beginning one is absolutely sure what will happen with all the characters and how the story begins. From boring, non-exclusive end to a miserable and sad ending, everyone present in this movie for nothing, and every poor patch of dug talent wasted for this turkey. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something so relentlessly grim with many of the same children's titillation, watch one of the Ilsa films. At least, they are irreconcilable and upfront about what they are trying to do. Somehow it managed to be terribly bad rated above 5 wonder how people without taste or fastidious standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of the goals. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all it is not exciting in any sense of the word. This, in my opinion, the crime; it is a crime that such a horrible abusive and incompetent stuff was ever conceived and to provide resources to come into existence, and even greater tragedy, that she still defended some woefully deceived viewers. <br /> <br /> not even cheerful personality Elvira and humorous way can soften the blow of that awful parody of the movie is. Avoid this at all costs.
