I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We learned about the cosmos. All little kids want to go to space, right? Well, after I saw it, I was so scared to death that I "accidentally" get thrown in the space of a psychotic robot with a view of the track. I had no idea that it was a movie. I thought it was some kind of news program or something. I believe that it was my own version, when people were shocked by the radio broadcast "War of the Worlds." So, lately, I get the movie again to see, knowing my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I was laughing over the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at work. I mean, when Andy is in space, it is moving in slow motion, you ever notice that? I do not think that being in a space makes you say that slowly or think slowly. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy knocked unconscious oxygen tank, and begins to go back, as the security doors close, little Max is trying to get her out. Suddenly, we get a big close-up on Max's face as he screams (in slow motion) Â«Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
