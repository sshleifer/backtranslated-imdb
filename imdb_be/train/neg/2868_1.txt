This is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events in this film are not even close to the truth. Why they could not make a film about real events, makes no sense, since the actual event more interesting, it was a farce. Do not even waste your time watching it for free. Low budget and shameful image of events that should not be taken as a joke, that really what this film made. If they would allow me to -10 for this film, I would. Acting sucked, and it looks like it was shot on an old VHS camcorder from the 80s. Save your time and money, do not watch this movie.
