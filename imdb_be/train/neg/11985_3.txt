Always I wanted to eat the worm? Here is the "documentary" to show you how! Yes ... The child eats live worms! But the most interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> This film was very well summed up the previous reviewers as rather boring. I completely agree here. The film just does not go anywhere .... if you dont like worm food! This one film is almost impossible to write a spoiler .... because not much is happening <br /> <br /> Currently, the technical side :. They were supposed to give the baby a haircut. Who is he trying to look anyway ... Boz clown. It was almost funny ... I almost expected him to turn into a shaggy dog ​​or something <br /> <br /> And on top of that. the child was too short to always look hungry! If you save it from junk food for a few weeks before filming. <br /> <br /> In general, this film almost put me to sleep. And my children could only work for about 15 minutes before they left the stage, something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the scenery was very large. And if there was a decent story to go with him, he might have made a stroke <br /> <br /> It does seem safe enough for the kids to watch :. Bear scene and "eccentric" eyeballs were too weak to frighten most children, and short "swimming naked" scene does not show anything. <br /> <br /> I gave it to one very generous 3.
