I barely made it through one episode ( «Crouch End»). Conversation was stilted and down-right worthy crawl. The action was tragic. Eion Bailey, in spite of all his attempts to be dramatic, remains largely impenetrable. His eyebrows hint at the recent treatment of Botox. Claire Forlani could have just as easily been playing damsel in distress in a silent movie. The characters were animated films, each of which plays a stereotypical cog in the plot largely by chance, wandering plot. Funny special effects can be freed, given the budget miniseries. But the attempt to create intrigue and surprise through distracting cinema added to unwatchability. I get the feeling that the ending had to be witty and weird, but he was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare it to the overall quality of something else, I would put the episode "Nightmares and Dreamscapes» along with Hercules in the NBC.
