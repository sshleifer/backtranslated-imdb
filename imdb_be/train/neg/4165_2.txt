I'm a big fan of the camp, but if each plot "twist" is predictable and bad, while obviously not trying to be, even I lose interest. I was going to evaluate to 3, but the ending point is easily released. Its only saving grace is that I hated more than the other films. There is not enough beer in the world to do so.
