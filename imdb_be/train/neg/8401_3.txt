Just saw this on the TMC, it is unusual in my memory. It is obvious that while the assistants are the signs of the stars, they do not actually run the show. Firstly, they are divided into 2 groups - Moe, as "Shorty" Larry and Curl as a couple of tramps, so not a lot of full team work. A love story that feeds the story is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only one with any acting ability, there is another group of musical puppets that unfunny, except for their attempts to be funny to be boring fun. Music tedious, they drive cars on the ranch, and then depending on the horses, the western wear goofy silly, and there are so many movies without any proxies on the camera. By the way, this is obviously the first blow Coeur and its low level of energy is clear. Vernon Dent appears early on in the credits role. I loved all those guys ever did, including without Curl things, but this little dogie pretty bad.
