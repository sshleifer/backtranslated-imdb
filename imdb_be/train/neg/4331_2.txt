Shortly after watching this movie, you'll understand why it does not even make it to the theater! This film does not deserve a "prequel" tag. Instead, a common theme in Hollywood, strip off earlier good movies with catastrophic prequel, sequel, etc. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film has been bouncing around like a ping-pong, and character development was not there. I seriously felt like I was watching a comedy at some points in the film, because the action was so bad. P Diddy is to stop polluting the films with his terrible acting, it actually made me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this movie Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks great in the movie and really brought some pleasure from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Carlito's Way, I recommend that you do not look at it. If you decide to watch it anyway, then consider this film as though it ripped off the original, because it's exactly what he did.
