I expected that he loved this film - a film noir, a serial killer, a dark irony. I was baffled by many choices the characters made ( "Hey, I know that they are terrible to watch, but let's hook on the road trip cross country anyway!") Found Shagan be icy, and focus on the moody light to take the place of the original thought of cameramen and director. <br /> <br /> Thinking about it now, it would be much better movie if someone just run the script through a common sense-o-meter (1992 model) before you begin to shoot ...
