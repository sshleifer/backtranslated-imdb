It seems that the cast must provide at least the average film. So I sat down for 102 minutes of disbelief. Besides Ed Harris nobody seems to have the skills of acting. Even Sean Connery, who I used to worship, should have a day off during the entire shoot, just in case. Not once throughout the film one actor could convince me. <br /> <br /> This has made this film looks cheap and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The story does little. This is an exciting and unexpected plot. <br /> <br /> Conclusion only watch this movie if you do nothing more useful to do.
