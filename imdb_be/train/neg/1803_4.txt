Here is one of these educational short films made to find unknown people there about the facts of life. At this time, the target audience of preteen girls, menstruation is a fact of life. This animated film created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some sponsorship from Kotex. <br /> <br /> It begins with an explanation of how hormones make you grow and develop. With the animations and the female narrator, he shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why all this leads to menstruation. It is almost surprising, becoming a comic note here how to avoid the subject of sex. Even the word is never mentioned, although «furtilized» will take place once. I really do not know why I saw it, but as it is one of those rare short films, which could give an idea of ​​the carefree time, you can give it a try.
