This is not the most well made Slasher films of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty funny. The plot is lame, but murder is not so bad. I must be honest, if you do not follow the group appearing in this film you will not find this movie so funny, as those who do. I knew someone who had seen the film and was very disappointed because of the poor quality of the film, but you need to understand that it was done in his spare time on tour between play slam children and drinking with friends backstage. ..It is not made to be taken lightly. It ubber cheese on it punk better and with more than 100 killings, most of which are ultra-gory, it is a fun movie to have friends to watch, drink and be merry!
