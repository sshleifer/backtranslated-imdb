All the ingredients are low-grade cult B-movie cinema. Topless (and bottomless) girls kung fu chefs feet, slave traders, angry Germans with a mustache, Cameron Mitchell and his sword, which holds in the hands of zombies. <br /> <br /> And, of course, Camille Keaton chest, who is best known feminist reflection occurs in the operation of the classic I Spit On Your Grave. We should also mention beeps value Shepard, who plays a prostitute in the last film Cooler. <br /> <br /> A lot of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among the topless dancers in the bar, in the brothel, and the load of the boat martial artists who sent in some zombie island where bad martial arts go to die or something like that. <br /> <br /> The top and bottoms come off easily and often, as travelers are well lubricated thanks to the boat owner. <br /> <br /> Then the trouble as their boat destroyed, and they land on the island of zombies, where the monks Mas sacrifice young girls dead martial arts, to bring them back to life. <br /> <br /> Just when you thought it was all there are piranhas in the water. Yum Yum Big Fat German dinner. <br /> <br /> Just the thing for your next zombie festival.
