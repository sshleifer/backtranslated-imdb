Exactly what one would expect from a B-Movie. Deritive, free of poverty, boring part, funny gore and cheesy special effects. Of course, it might be better, better acted (defintly) better writer, director, etc. But then I suppose it would not be a B movie. Actors are largely absorbed, in fact it is quite a lot, it seemed like an episode of Buffy or something, except with a lot of blood, profanity and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis should be allocated from. It is absolutely scream queen of the new millennium. Not that it really matters, which operates in these films, but it was better than any of the other participants. She also Smokin hot that the plastic bib thing she wore throughout the film - wow! Its rear is absolutely stunning in this dress, I mean it every time she turns around you can help, but check it out. And next, the end of the film the viewer to see it fully awarded nekked. <br /> <br /> So if your a loser b-horror film lover (like me), check it out. If not, then you should probably be avoided at all costs.
