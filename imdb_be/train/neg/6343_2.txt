Maybe, I do not complicate. This is closer to two more suspected cerebral films I've seen lately, and both suffer from the exact same problem in excruciating degree. Dialogue false false false. Nothing that comes out of the mouth of someone seem remotely plausible. how this movie can be created just so that he should feel, but it was unwatchable. And sad. I went out after 20 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I'll stick with Sleeper and bananas for my Woody Allen correct. If I ever came across it on the teevee, I roll over and try to find an episode of Quincy instead.
