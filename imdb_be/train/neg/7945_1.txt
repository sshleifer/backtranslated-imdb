The film mixes religious ethics and ideals so that it does not create a coherent argument against the death penalty at any level. Presenting a legitimate execution of a convicted murders as a catalyst for the apocalyptic end of the film raises humanity parent killer to the status of a martyr for Christ. Anyway, according to the story, God is outraged by the fact that society has chosen to deprive it yourself fanatic who killed his parents, starting them on fire while they were sleeping defenseless in their beds. But it's God has no indignation for the actions of murderers. Lead hero, nonreligious pregnant woman suicide, eventually giving his own life in a daring but incredibly vain attempt to save the convicted murderer. In other filaments undeveloped portion Jesus returns to impotent and frustration bum symbolic disclose wrath. Modern vague incarnation of Christ not only dehumanizes him, making fun of the messianic ideal of all religions as well. He is unable to affect mankind in favor of life and indifferent skates the edge waiting for humanity to destroy it himself. At the same time, with a little help from Jesus mentally unbalanced pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to transform himself into her newborn heartless child who for some way to save all of humanity from the wrath of the almighty. I also interpret this as a statement in support of abortion on some levels. This film, which is trying to weave the many religious themes into a thriller is not able to make any religious point that I could clearly interpret except persuasion IOC people. This raises many questions, that does not even try to answer. He despises the religious values ​​of his audience, trying to portray an ass version of their performance. silly
