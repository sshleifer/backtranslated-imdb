Most episodes of season 1, awful..There any comparison with the Dark Zone or Outer Limits, as they are actually programs were decent storylines. Most Amazing Stories dull..not good enough to rent or buy least..go series Twilight Zone ... I heard Season 2 of this series, many better..also for some reason on the DVD, they will cut part of Ray Walston, which further reduces the this collection. One cool thing to see actors and actresses when they were younger, in 1985 ... Most of the storylines are very predictable, although a number could have been better with turns that left you wondering ...
