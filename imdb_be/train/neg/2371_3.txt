I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but it does not mean that I do not like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies.I think Robert is a very good actor.Nobody plays better than Freddy Krueger he did not does.But, NOT Robert offense, this film sucked.The terrible action, the plot is really weak, and Freddy Krueger is only part of the cast, it even stands for watching.Sometimes can be better than the first, for example, on Friday the 13th franchise (I thought that a remake was the best in the series.) but it is not one of those who movies.The original was good, the second in May m was better, and the third was okay, but I haven t seen others.Whatever you do, don, t make the same mistake I did, watching this piece of shit.
