Many other reviewers here, including many whose thoughts I respect, to keep this piece of European horror song in high regard. Personally I do not like at all. His incoherent attempt to cross atmospheres between sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best doing these kinds of films very well. Unfortunately, the notorious exploitation filmmaker Joe DAmato does. The most famous films DAmato are notorious for their high factor of gross output. This earlier film it has no permanent disgusting scene that his famous "cannibal" and "In the Darkness's" done. Ultimately, his disjointed film that fails to engage the viewer in any way. Without a song or a factor, it becomes very boring. As I said, others enjoy this film, but I found it to be a perfect example of an incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are several advantages for the film. Ewa Aulin (from «Candy») in it, and it looks very hot and frequently naked. However, the cult of the image of the film, Klaus Kinski is completely lost in the scene without being connected to the main film. He seems bored with the role and does not have a manic intensity he does his best. Score well and there are some brief moments unintentionally funny gore. However, it is pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
