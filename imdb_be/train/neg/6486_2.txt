If there's one thing you can count on Disney, to do, it is their uncanny ability to take history and say it again and again and again. Even watching a promotional video for Lady and the Tramp II was a horrible experience. Disney is about to destroy one of its most amazing classics ever. It even had that meatball spaghetti scene. It's been done before! And that's what I'm talking about this sad right on the video (the entire concept should be prohibited). All this is simply a retelling of the original film, and even some very bad Bluth films. Penguin and Walrus duet (I even forgot their names) is simply a very poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is still Ursula. She even repeats almost all the old lines. Songs helpless, really terrible. I've never heard a song so badly by them before until now. And the dialogue brutal. It is a miserable and simplified. On the positive side, at least they took the time to make some decent animation. All the usual characters are not as annoying as they used to be (or perhaps a minus for little fans Mermaid). Therefore, in the negative, the melody just sickeningly cute you just might vomit. I'm almost done. Make yourself and your fan Mermaid affection. Do not waste your money on it. True, it's not as bad as The Return of Jafar and Pocahontas II, but that is little consolation.
