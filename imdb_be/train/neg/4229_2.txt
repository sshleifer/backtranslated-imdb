I ignored the reviews on this site in the belief that it will fall on my taste in horror, but I got bored and turned it off.Let see: <br /> <br /> wardrobe: Was a cheap cameo apparel and clothing artists from home depot. Masks were made of what looks like tin foil. <br /> <br /> Gore: Gore was very good, I have to give it to him. But Burning Ittenbach month was better for low-budget film. <br /> <br /> Acting: It's awful! I am not against dubbing. I find it humorous as in «Premutos» (great movie) Ittenbach in. The sequences of fighting and was pi $$ poor <br /> <br /> The result :. Nha Schnaas watch any movies. There are much better directors as Jörg Olaf Ittenbach Buttergeit and movie of the same blood and the baked item. Check Premutos, Blood House, Schramm and nekromantiks.
