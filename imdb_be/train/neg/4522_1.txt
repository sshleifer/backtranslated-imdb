Most misogynist movie of all time? Not to mention on the 68th, they should not be moved outside of the white man in a brown face play "Indian"? My favorite part, though they should be when the girls giggle and blush, as the bikers drag them to gang rape them. Rape is fun! Who knew? Let's see, that is blatant rip-off of «The Hustler» (thick boss character is actually playing pool, and plotting to destroy the Indian with a leading rebel dude), appalling acting as on-nose-they are-might-as-well would just say that you are, what to think, the music signals, lack of anyone who REALLY India in this film. And who are we rooting for? I have to say that the figures that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Although his films tend to champion strong women, I heard at least one source, in real life, he was an idiot misogynist. Why do I see it, you ask? Do not ask.
