Well, what can I say, <br /> <br /> Â«What we know, we know that" achieved the almost impossible -. Leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre, like "The Postman," "Lead", "the Merlin," and so fourth, he will go down in history as only the worst movie I have ever seen in its entirety. and that, ladies and gentlemen, is really impressive, because I've seen a lot of bad movies. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema It consists of two interlocking parts, which alternate between the silly and far-fetched story about an extremely annoying photographer, abandoned her husband and forced to take antyd presanty to survive, and a bunch of talking heads that are taking place on how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new AGY pseudo-philosophy. In fact, if you start your day with meditation, with the likes of Enya and Kenny G, this film is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and much of the good weed, then this movie is for you. otherwise, stay away. Take my word for it. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me, "What Bleep you know," it is that, apparently, edited and put together the same kinds of people who shoot cheap wedding on camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer-generated sparks across the screen, while the other team folly. Who let these people anywhere near the box office is a mystery to me. I think this is something that too many Kenny G does for you. The film is permeated with cheese GCI, loves, you, or I can put on your own computer by using over-the-counter software for video editing, but never will be, because it's just too funny. <br /> <br /> _obviously_ script was written by someone else without any writing experience. Not only that, all the characters and conversations bulky and pretentious beyond belief, but "writers" felt that they had to cram all the relevant piece of information, or rather disinformation, which is what most of this film was all, all the way down your throat. Well, considering the target audience that may not be so bad ideas. The main character, for example, spends half the movie pops pills. Apparently, though, it was deemed not sufficiently convincing, so that at least some of the dialogue for all relevant to its soothing tablets specifically, just in case the audience should not be able to connect it outplayed pain and flour with a little white pills she takes whenever she feels down. Actions ... Well, I've seen better acting in Ed Wood movie, and no, it is not an exaggeration. Heck, a little game I was when I was 12 featured a much more inspiring than the acting it. That's right. <br /> <br /> The story stopped here and there with a bunch of talking heads, or random, strange combination of kooky scientists, doctors and kooky self-proclaimed mystics who go on and on about how quantum physical supposedly provides an "explanation" of how when a man or woman, have created their own reality, only participating in the experience of life. Reality, you see, there is a probability field heap of different possibilities, and only set in stone, as soon as you have chosen to observe the observer. What happens when more than one observer notes, they said, but then again who cares. Hear of Enya, meditate, perform, and you have to be God, and no one gives a damn about such silly and archaic things like critical thinking, logic, etc. All the reasons immediately dismissed as people stuck in their relationship and are unable to achieve a "paradigm" and "go down the rabbit hole." Furthermore, Heidelberg uncertainty principle is alleged proof alternative realities parallel worlds, and the like. <br /> <br /> Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy pervades the film. All these people keep talking about going down the rabbit hole. I'm not sure it had to do with what they were saying or showing, but one thing I am sure of is that it somehow involves anal sex. In fact, the film _extremely_ anti-sex. Everywhere, sex presented as dirty, ugly, and anti-enlightening. <br /> <br /> In any case, the talking heads say, the protagonist achieves harmony and enlightenment, drawing a heart around the body with a magic marker and proceeds go to the Dumber look in her glassy eyes, than she started with. <br /> <br /> I want to 2:00 of my life back. <br /> <br /> Here are a few random quotes that I had to keep in mind: <br /> <br /> "I think that as the unreal became much more real to me, and the one that I used to be considered a real, it is often much less than the real unreal. "-.?. Some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physics <br /> <br />" What is necessary for a man to have an erection only one thought nothing changes on the outside is required, all these changes are within. Yet he has an erection. "- Some self-proclaimed mystic, leader of his school enlightenment <br /> <br /> [looking at himself in the mirror] "I hate you, I hate you, you! fat! You ugly! I got you! "- the main character, a fat and ugly photographer.
