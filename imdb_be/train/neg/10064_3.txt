Pokemon movie was a terrible film. Unlike the first, this is not a good movie at all. the graphics were decent, but the story was flat and no real drama was built in it. a first interaction between the characters were decent. Brock subtraction and addition Tracey was bad. Tracey really is not much to say or do, and unlike Brock does not comic. Only good points are you get to see the mist actually get jelous of the ashes, and its early brooding over his girlfriend had called entertainment. Overall, this movie is not worth the rental and short film before you do nothing for me and my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans.oh well, maybe the next will ge t better.cant worse
