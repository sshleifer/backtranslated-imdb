You will receive a gift. He elegantly wrapped. The box is in this manual with the best wood and shows the craftsmanship down to the smallest details. It is then wrapped in a beautiful paper, handmade and hand-painted by the most talented artists. All of this is wrapped in ribbons, made of thin silk lace. This spectacle. <br /> <br /> Then you cuts the tape to rip off the paper, open the box and find ... nothing. It TOYS. You either enjoy the package, or forget about it <br /> <br /> The film is not without its terms and objectives :. War is not a very good thing. Well, is not original! Morale is so obvious that almost ashamed to even point this out. And even that poor understanding clipped history, in which the elements of war - war toys, in particular - is clearly bad, as long as they do not need to be an exciting climax and the film mimics the war with the help of the innocent toys. It's like someone preaches food, condescending sermon, only to the end, saying, "jokes." <br /> <br /> But even in an empty field, the film can not attention.

Perhaps Levinson directed and redirected TOYS so often in his mind that he was not a fresh vision for him when he finally got on the audio. He has perfected it to death. <br /> <br /> Many of the toy shown in the film clumsy, mechanical, wind up deformities. So the film itself.
