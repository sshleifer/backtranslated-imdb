Turn your backs or you're going to get into big trouble with my boyfriend back! Just a happy ending can flourish innocence, full of gloom and doom at the very moment you see it. We can say with certainty that the entire movie crumbles, with a sarcastic approach and a tribute to the zombie shows that defies the stupidity max. We get the name as "John" every so often, and it's "Johnny" had nowhere to go. There is no specific reason why our "dead corpse" crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night, so that makes the film completely useless. Without a sense of grief, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he is dead. Johnny takes a bite with his hands after Eddie. The viewer is asked a difficult question: Why did the film should be such cornball? There is an answer. Any resemblance of all people living or dead is purely coincidental. "Life" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing to do with the film. Show this one to my girlfriend, and it will show the senior prom, transforming her life into an abandoned devastation. Blah !!!
