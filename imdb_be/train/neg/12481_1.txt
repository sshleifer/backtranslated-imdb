This sword - and - sorcery story about a horrible stiff and soulless "hero" overcoming evil king does not cost anything in almost every detail. Actions terrible from bring to an auxiliary role. Sideways, gloating joy with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around absolutely disgusting; and are not repaid or justice of their cause, since it is just as bad as the people he fights. Editing a Z-movie galore, including a scene where a character "dies" from the thrust of the sword, which is obviously completely missed! <br /> <br /> The film is clearly banking on female leads charms, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who marched mostly bare throughout the film. The 20-something man, I will not pretend that female flesh on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of their characters are so degraded, sex scenes, and random bleak that I could not even enjoy that aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> The majority of cheesy movies of this period, at least a few bought a light-hearted, insincere feel (continued better in this regard), but Deathstalker, it seems, takes seriously as a heroic fantasy. No way! Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> Rating: **** 1/2.
