This is just the answer on Yahoo, which says that the film is more realistic than the classical genre definition masterpieces Jaws. Thus, egghead large white (sharks and other species, bovine, black point, white-tip, tiger) as known, to fill areas where light extraction results. People do not often make it to the menu, provide, but the shark in the movie repeatedly shown exhibiting abnormal behavior. It's not like it never happened. The chances of the killer whale destroyed almost the whole city, which highlights human nemesis, sinking several dozen thick peeled North Atlantic fishing boats and know when some people, all members of the above-mentioned "Nemesis", is close enough to the water to reach it, so thin to be a clown. Much like the turd with Jaws in knock-offs. Laughable. Great white sharks are known to often chew on boats, protective underwater gardens, and people on rafts and surfboards, since they are similar to the seal below. Bruce the shark size (if you do not know, look it up) will be more than able to sink the boat, as the killer whale (hey it's the name of blatant plagiarism, we discuss!), And it will weigh more than 6,000 pounds. I could go on, but I do not need. Jaws strange (it is better to act better effects, the best music, the best writing), the Orca is crap (a blatant rip-off jaw, lousy letters unclean effects, the funniest story from this side of the film Olson twins). It does not take a master at Columbia University, to see it. See the best movies.
