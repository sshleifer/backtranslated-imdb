just I watched it, me and my better half could not believe how awful and poorly acted it was. If someone thinks that it is good, then you should easily be met. I actually refused the night to watch it, its all been done before. IE. hostel comes to mind, but at least it does not make you cringe with a bad action and the lack of story line, the same old stuff re-hatched, I read a lot about this film, I even recommended it to my comrades, my fault someone said that it was good! no more bloody, horror or aversion to wind back than the average "horror" it must be said, please do not bother with this film. get Mary Poppins. Now it's scary! I'll now go to the cinema and watch something worse than that, maybe a little Sunshine
