I'm not a big fan of Chopper movie as a genre, but even for a low low-budget operation, this one is really lame. Even on naked-and-gore level, it's incredibly boring (there are some of both, but it's kind of ... meh). For the home video revolution, it may not even be released theatrically (though, perhaps, in the end, * Plan 9 from Outer Space * playing in theaters). There is exactly one good (and well delivered) line in the entire film; I believe that they stole it from somewhere. <br /> <br /> Act is one of the worst I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had more competent actor, and the rest, as a rule, a ridiculously unnatural, it can be fun to watch. In any case, most of the actors can greatly pass as competent. That is, those who do not read their lines, like a cigar store Indian sounds like they know them phonetically. And this film is one difference :. This can be bad underplotted for most of the film, it is ridiculously overplotted for ending <br /> <br /> (Update:.. I had to identify the actress playing Receptionist as an exception it is not made of wood is not that it is good, but it of course, not wood.) <br /> <br /> even the worst Tesakov clicks are usually good for a few Puritan meditation on their grotesque obscene, but with this, there is not even seem to be anything there work up to the moral indignation and. <br /> <br /> And you know the funny thing? They were obviously waiting to make a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's so bad, and sad, that it actually becomes fun in a weird way. I sat enrapt through most of the video, I wonder why someone would go to take care of its preparation.
