This is bad, very bad film. <br /> <br /> Well, for people who live a realistic film is a good thing. For me it is not. Life is too predictable, bad, disgusting, trivial, meaningless, sometimes. Maybe the reason people say that this movie really <br /> <br /> Too many platitudes :. You're black, you're a criminal, you are condemned and cursed by what you do, you'll end up shooting someone or shoot; do not let children play with guns, it can be dangerous; and there are those who go to church, then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Prior to this, I have not seen such a bad movie. This is perhaps the reason I never noticed how important the photo itself is of great importance in the film. In this, each scene is shot in the daytime, outdoors, clear and maddeningly blue. They do not even care to correct the color balance. Oh! I "appreciated" more than 300 movies in the database so far, and it (3/10) my lowest ever.
