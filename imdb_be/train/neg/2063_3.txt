Rumors about how fun this film, I finally take it <br /> <br /> video store and within 75 minutes, maybe, I laughed 3 times. It <br /> <br /> film collection of skits that make fun of the TV is <br /> <br /> incoherrent mess. Jokes fall flat, humor seen <br /> <br /> problems of the 1970s, which simply do not have a relationship anymore, and <br /> <br /> jokes go too long (almost like new SNL parody of <br /> <br /> over the past few years). Thus, in this Chevy Chase, but perhaps only <br /> <br /> about 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that it was very <br /> <br /> obscene nudity and had in abundance, but it could not be funny? There <br /> <br /> yourself a favor and rent a Kentucky Fried Movie, which is far away <br /> <br /> superior film made in
