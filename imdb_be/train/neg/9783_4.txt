Not the worst film I've seen, but it certainly is not very good. I myself paintball player airball played a lot and going from the forest to the airball pretty big change. The film reflects similar qualitys First of all, the film begins with this team, which, apparently, trying to shoot this "Phantom" guy or something, they seem to be a professional team and wearing T-shirts and shoot MAGS, autocockers. One guy sporting thick. Not much wrong with the movie, but more about that perceived it was very cheesy. children pile, the good guys are Woodsball players who seem to have not much money, and dream about getting a "better guns." Another team constantly looks up at them and insulted them because they play the forest and blah-blah-blah Phantom helps these Woodsball children and teaches them, and all that shit, he gets them to play airball and basically won all the teams including "professionals". <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the film? Well, the budget is a huge thing, paintball movie is not bad, but the budget is quite low, and the film feels like it was made by an amateur. There are no big names in the film and the action is very cheesy. Paintball perception is pretty bad too. They seem to imply that everyone will speedball and all this other crap. He was just a lousy movie in my opinion and does not give a real perception that paintball. To be honest the real paintball, not all one, as many swear glands and the bonus is not "respect" and play by the rules. Do not watch this movie, and then wait to go to the field who shouts "April 1 !!"
