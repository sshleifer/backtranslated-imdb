No one should ever try to adapt the book by Tom Robbins on the screen. Despite the fact that the film is well and good performances, dialogue, which works well to read this crap when people talk. Or, in other words, no one is likely to assume that the hearing of another's name was, how he sees things which are written in the radium in Perl. <br /> <br /> In general, the film feels ill-equipped cliff notes to the book - most of the parts had been hacked to one-fifth of the size of the book, with the point of view of the history and current history, and the end of the wildly (and unpleasant) differs from book. Most of the stories from the book is lost, including the one that makes everything make sense in the end, and there is more than one reference, which makes sense in a book that makes the viewer say, "Huh?" Not worth the effort, unfortunately, - the script was read, compared with a book, burned, and all the actors were sent to do something much better. I admire Gus Van Sant's highly, but not even someone of his caliber could make a decent film such a complex book, Doing miniseries.
