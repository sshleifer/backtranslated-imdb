Now what happened to the actors who took part in this shit? Michael Dorn must follow goods Star Treck. John Diehl, anyone remember him in Miami? Liked him there ... Well, how - what can you expect from a movie with one of the rescuers from Malibu in the lead? Nothing, and this is what we get. None of the characters is not even cute, fun special effects (but not ridiculous). History (very bad) joke. There is no logic at all for what happens. I got the feeling that the filmmakers tried a kind of "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" kind of thing. Especially in the scene where all the important people discussing national security in some closet ... <br /> <br /> If you happen to see him on TV, change channels - your TV will always be grateful.
