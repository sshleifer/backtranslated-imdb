........ and very bad on that one !!! How long this train-wreck last ?? 14 episodes or something ?? I can see why now. <br /> <br /> I bought "Serenity" episode of the Amazon Unboxed. This was my first purchase, so was free. This is the only good thing about the experience (incident ??) <br /> <br /> I will not comment really on the action, as they were, I think, is enough new people who really did not get down to work just yet. At least, I've never seen them before in any type of main shows, theater or television. If I did, I easily forget them. <br /> <br /> But the effects were absolutely terrible. However, this is not quite the multi-million $$ project, but the original Star Trek did better than that, and it was thirty-five years ago. I especially got a laugh out of the bad guys (the reapers, or something like that) the vessel as he pursued a cheerful looking Firefly, with smoke coming out of the engines that are looking for something like a giant model rocket. I was waiting to finally see the Wiley Coyote riding on top, while chasing the Roadrunner. Modern jet / rocket engines do not do it so badly. <br /> <br /> And it's not even the worst. In the shoot-type wild west had me wondering if I actually watched a sci-fi movie or a Gene Autry. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the hype, do not waste your time ... I did ... all 80-something minutes catastrophe called "Firefly."
