Of course, these were some of the makings of a good movie. The storyline is good, if a little bland and the action was quite good, although I do not understand why Olivia d'Or was a distinct Australian accent when her character had to be raised in the United States. My biggest problem, however, with a wardrobe. I know, as a rule, the average American is considered unattractive pedestal any self-respecting European, but it goes beyond that. Anne color combinations were positively awful !! And that bag of potato as a sad occasion for the coat she wore throughout the film made me come out in hives. I believe that the idea was to be as realistic as possible (as many school teachers to go to Prada?), But just does not mean the absolute lack of taste. A word to the wise ...
