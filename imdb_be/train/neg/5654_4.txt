I've never heard about this movie Sesame he played part of the retrospective Robert Mitchum in the National Film Theater in London. Almost 60 years in the cast list looked tasty to say the least, with seven names - in the annex to the top account Mitch - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, long from The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas, and perhaps even better known as the daughter of the theater set designer Norman, Walter Brennan, who needs no introduction, Frank files sadistic orderly in The Lost Weekend and much better than a small town Mensch this Wonderful Life, Robert Preston ten years from Harold Hill in the Music Man with Tom Tully and Thaxter drawing rooms. Unfortunately, most of them spend their time. I looked in vain for any scene, "signature", given that it was Robert Wise on the megaphone. So far he has made about a dozen films and still find a style. The history of our old friend the range of war and Mitch must have thought it was almost cut over oaters Hopalong Cassidy, where he cut his teeth. There's no new twist - except incredible scene when Mitch Preston accuses Thaxter to sleep with to get information about the plans of his father to move his cattle. That's true, but Mitch know? We have seen or heard anything, to show how he opened it. In the end not much to be said for that.
