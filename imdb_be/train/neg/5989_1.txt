wow I paid Â£ 3,50 to go see this movie at the cinema. Bruce believe I wasted my time. Worthy act crawl at best, and the special effects are raw. Probarly worst-case scenario in the history of some very faulty quotes I've ever heard in my life. I swear to "safely" god is better than this. Madonna must be won and Oscar compared to these guys. A half hour of my life I want to go back. Honestly, people do not see it, even the baby find the film insulting their intelligence. I found this film very strange in the fact that it was difficult to say who is more wood, theses guys are the actual dolls. Pleas guys do not waste your time on this film, you will live to regret it.
