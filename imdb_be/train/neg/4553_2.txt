I read the book Celestine Prophecy and looking forward to see the film. Keep in mind that the film based on the book. Many of the most interesting moments of the book did not come out to the movies. This «B» movie at best. Many of the events, characters, as a character interacts with and is found in the book, just to change or not take place. The flow of events that the book is very smooth, variable and fed at a glance, as if you were a child. Character development is very poor. Personnallities characters are different from those in the book. Direction similar to the «B» horror movies. I understand that it will take six hours for a movie to represent all that is in the book, but they cover the base of the game missed a lot of points. Casting was very good.
