Oh, crying loudly, it should be Lamest film I've seen all year, and I'm sorry Average Country John Cusack was even involved in this stupid, Twitty piece of nonsense. Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to the same message, albeit at a more subtle, a little more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer, and then proceeds to rub it in mind the next tedious half hour or so (and this in an hour and half of my life I'll never get back, thank you very much !!). It's bad enough, the protagonists of this film have the emotional maturity level of the fourteen-year-old (in fact, I knew better, fourteen-year-old ...), except maybe Jeremy Piven, who was pleasant enough. Just the first 15 minutes or so of the film where the character played by Kate Beckinsale, that annoying stupid game of throwing all the sensitivity to the wind (literally) was my best friend, and I irritated beyond belief. I told my husband Rockstar was more mad, and, at least, the characters in Rockstar not half dysfunctional as idiots were in this "" fluke disorder. It's frustrating to watch the main character, who does not seem to have a clue about the choice of his life, and feel they are nothing more than puppets in the fate and the whims of fate. How very tiresome. I am confident that this film will be more likely used by those who would not participate in a chaotic messy to do more complex life choices, and then live with the consequences of responsibility. In the end, that's the movie where our hero and heroine live happily only after wreaking havoc and suffering in the lives of two other people (namely their respective girlfriends), not to mention other relatives and friends, only to get there. <br /> <br />
