I knew that the film would not be surprising, but I thought I would give it a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought it had potential. Unfortunately, many of the film's dialogue was very fake sounding and cheese. I think Aquafresh gave money to the production of the film, because they were seriously dropping some hints everywhere. There is a shot where Aquafresh sign sticks out to you that you can not help but notice it. Maybe they should have focused on writing and operate in more than how many times we fall Aquafresh products in movies without people annoyed. The film had its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
