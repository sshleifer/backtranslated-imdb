This film was the longest film and record a movie for sure it was 30 actors After Jaani Dushman (2002) I do not think anyone had the guts to do something like that <br /> <br /> The movie, as the name suggests is based on the Kargil war, but the problem is that too many characters and the romantic song and podagovorov many characters boring <br /> <br /> too many cinematic liberties, how to kill a man with a knife who wonder men do this? <br /> <br /> Direction JP Datta fencing front BORDERS music in order <br /> <br /> Among the huge cast of Ajay Devgan standing tall, Saif is very good in the part, and it is his first film with Kareena, Abhishek Manoj cute Bazhpai has its moments Sanju wasted, Suneil Akshay Khanna normally makes it part of a well-road Rani rest well, Ash normal rest patency
