Someone has to tell Goldie Hawn, that her career as a teenage Gamin age ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films released in years, an unequivocal disaster, in which two wires are given their exposure feverish tics trademarks in an attempt to compensate for a bad script and bad directing. This thing should be suppressed at birth. <br /> <br /> I hope John Cleese paid a lot for the fact that his name is attached to the crash. He is the only artist who has come through this stinking mess more or less the whole, his only fault is the failure to understand that the rest of the cast will sink picture.
