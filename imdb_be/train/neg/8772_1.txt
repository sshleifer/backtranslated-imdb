There's nothing new to me, saying, 4:00 people die over and over again in the same hill. The cast was stellar, but unfortunately, producer / director / editor / God goofed. He had eaten humble pie (if not for yourself, then for those who died in the Cargo), hired one of these brilliant filmmakers of Bollywood, has hired a real writer, hire a real editor, hired a musician was not associated with it some way (and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of "Apocalypse now" on some cheap Indian drugs), has hired a real professional crew, all thrown firecrackers and told the real story. Unfortunately, he, like the bosses of the Indian Army, decisions were made that were terrible for his actors, and terrible for your audience. We all died again and again. <br /> <br /> Please do not do it again, sir!

Of course, there are many Nepalese men working in Bombay - the last count was 40,000 to half a million.
