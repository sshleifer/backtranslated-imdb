Trifling romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the loving relationship that grows between the pretty hippie (Kay Lenz) and Los Angeles real estate agent in his golden years (William Holden, amazingly friendly in this highly-conceived arrangement). The script is small, but not without some deliberate moves; Nevertheless, such a scenario is now a middle-aged clich√© that most of the paintings off as children's clothes. It might have worked better, with different conclusions: Holden Lenz and do not match well (its growth is so small that it seems to be rising above it), which makes them less intimate scenes move than just uncomfortable. It dates back blurry romantic and largely unmemorable. ** from ****
