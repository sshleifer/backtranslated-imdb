Young basketball games genetics professor doing research on the genetic sequence, using human embryos. He hopes to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He pressure in the conclusion of the study, because it is not published, so that the university has a problem justifying the funding it (I think). <br /> <br /> He injects a test monkey that quickly dies.
