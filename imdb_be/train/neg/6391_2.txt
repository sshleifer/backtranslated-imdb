Mercury is usually exploitative, and it never bothered me before - I loved «Bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudo-science or play on heuristics. the whole film is based on a person with those caused by electric shock and witches. I am not against the witches, and I loved «Carrie» (novel and film), but this one bothers me. I think it's because the protagonist develops individuals from the power line. also a university professor to spend their time studying the cases of individuals. I was not alive in the 60s, to see first hand, it was not a particularly common misconception that, but I believe that any theory of this kind is simply discredited. what really bothered me was how police described the schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains that may seem like normal people 99% of the time, and then just snap. nothing could be further from the truth. I hate such things, because they add to the public idiocy. Many people still believe that schizophrenia dissociative identity disorder. the one who wrote this script did not know anything about psychology. <br /> <br /> were some decent concept to the film. I liked how the witch is used by men; it was a nice change. I liked how she could make herself attractive, but it was not when she was around her forced fans. I found it interesting how her second lover and burned his face. the script was touched up for a few weeks before production, and not focus solely on making your audience more stupid, this may be a decent movie.
