If another Hitler ever arise, it will be partly due to stupidity, like this film, distributed by the absurd idea that he was clearly deranged lunatic to begin with. Far beyond this individual and his election to the highest office in the country, sensible people to cross the street to avoid him, and he would die in a ditch, nameless and unknown. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads the accounts of Hitler's closest associates - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge, for example - will be surprised by the fact that people find it kindly, intelligent, generous man. He was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speech seems bloated and buzzing ears ignores modern times in which they were made when the bombastic pomposity were common in political discourse. The same excessive anti-Semitism, which was not a central element of the early Nazis - who were primarily anti-communist - not a rare or unusual for the time. The film makes it look as if the only purpose of Hitler from the very beginning was the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to determine the next person that will lead to the deaths of tens of millions, you can ignore one life Fleck lips ravers portrayed here. Look instead magical, charismatic man whose persuasive speech to inspire the whole nation, and whose political work is clearly and significantly benefits the country. I'm afraid that his identity will be a lot more like Barack Obama than Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for a lot here, and got nothing but a caricature. Fools who did this thing has committed a crime against reality. It is a historical equivalent of "reefer madness."
