After a quasi-gothic style, all-fruit music video, the film begins with the soloist Cassidy kills himself. In an ideal world, it would be that the end credits roll. N We do not live in this world. In fresh band members decided to go to some clown to contact her dead entity. When I say clown, I mean the actual clown. He told them that all of them will die within Cassidy ghost (spirit has Dora, one of a group of comrades) We could not care less, because all the characters sad, insipid, and acted very badly. Author Adam Hackbarth (incredibly BTW name if ever there was one), and directed by Corbin Timbrook (which, after duty, and the blood of the Tower, should know that he continues to do shit for life), this film is a constant struggle between the incompetence of the film and the needs of the viewer, not to sleep. Not enough blood to propitiate the Gore-hounds, nor enough nudity to satisfy Pervs. This film really has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone <br /> <br /> My rating :. F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway gets topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on demand
