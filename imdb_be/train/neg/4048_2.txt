Perhaps not, but it's horrible. Even the fantastic cast can not save it. Okay, I admit that it started pretty funny, but it seemed to fall down the slope as soon as they jumped the woman in the house of generals. Bill Murray turned from being resourceful, humorous guy in Gandon, shouting things at people on the street who just were not funny, its like he's trying too hard to be funny. His hero stole weapons (RV? Let's ...) and ends up being a national hero after the invasion of another country and killing God knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. One good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army, and shows how arrogantly imbecilic and they really, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt disgusted that this kind of crap advocacy can really be released.
