This film is a "riveting", but in much the same way a car accident riveting. It's hard to look away. Overall, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and useless, biased in this experiment. The filmmakers are manipulative and does not seem to have any problems, which go to the lowest possible denominator. The manner in which the money provided by Ted friendly operation. Intermediate steps that the filmmakers are forced Ted to participate in (the meeting with the so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any significant attempts to connect with Ted. On the contrary, it is painfully obvious that they are used to cover the posterior filmmaker and continue to use the situation of Ted. Worst of all, the filmmakers next stop Ted after 6 months; and seemingly cut off completely from the object they are so closely months earlier. If they cared, they would have found better "expert" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see that Ted will do, they have to let him spend the money without any interference. This film is, at best, a high brow Jackass stunt, not a documentary. It's sad to think much as $ 100,000 may actually changed the life of a homeless man he was raised in his right hand.
