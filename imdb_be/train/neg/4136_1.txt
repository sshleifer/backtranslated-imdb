I read reviews before I watched this movie, and I do not believe them. I love movies and shit, I waited one to be average. It was not. This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look great people. The film contains a bad action, bad sound, bad intricate plot, makeup- bad and sad for me so I turned it off. even nudity was rubbish! Perhaps they do not even have a budget for this film? I do not think they did. You can tell if your like this film or not within the first 5 minutes. if they want a good cheese to go and watch a bloody movie Toxic Avenger 4 or even blood camp. Avoid this rubbish - I watched it on TV and felt RIPed away, so do not waste it. The best part is probably the end.
