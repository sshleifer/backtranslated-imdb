In an interview, David Duchovny said he was not even able to watch the first hour of the film - and not necessary. The scene in which he asks the owner of the house where the murder was committed, when he could look around - change the name that he gives, and he could have raised the productivity of almost any episode of X-Files. He was on autopilot during the whole movie. Brad Pitt overacts badly.
