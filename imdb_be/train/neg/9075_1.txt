Loafers as titled in this film three college friends by Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel, respectively) that are going to graduate from the university without sitting through an honest examination, but to do so successfully. This goes on until the very end, when the unsympathetic, but the most likeable protagonist Nathan (Schwartzman) learns that they are up to. Nathan begins to blackmail to the girl of his dreams, he can not continue that in normal conditions. The only problem is, when the trio began to work on it, Dave falls in love with a beautiful and kind Angela (James King) Unfortunately, not a great film genre. Schwartzman makes it easy to watch a movie, as his work is brilliant. King performance is average, I think, that she was hired just to be close to its magnificent views. Idlers resemble American Pie from the other direction. Joking shallow as in American Pie. But they are not used? I think this film is a warning to the creators of the genre of the film, that they run out of originality. In general, a few smiley moments, but terrible film with the point of view of action (except Schwartzman) and a subject. * Since *****
