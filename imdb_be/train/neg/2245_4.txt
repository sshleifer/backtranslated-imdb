This film is not the same as the version of one thousand nine hundred fifty-four with Judy Garland and James Mason, and it's a shame, because the version of 1954 in my opinion, much better. I do not deny the talent Barbra Streisand at all. She's a good actress and a brilliant singer. I am not familiar with other work Kris Kristofferson, and so I can not judge it. Nevertheless, the film is poor. He walked slowly, it is gratuitous nudity and foul language, and can be very difficult to sit through. <br /> <br /> However, I am not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I would like Judy Garland version better. See the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris, and judge for yourself.
