Complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a waste of time. Screenplay and dialogue is poorly written, dull direction and effective border on hammy.This movie obviously tend to crowd Rang De Basanti but falls far short of the mark because it does not have even one of the elements that made RDB connect with his audience_great scenario, a stunning cast, good direction and a powerful social message which never preached but shown. <br /> <br /> compared with the near-masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step back, referring to scenes like a hero to cast a Persian carpet villain and hero teachers staring bullets in the truck no less! All this might be acceptable in the 80s, when I was a decline in the quality of films and bad films as DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits, but the film-making has become_should have become_more slim and thoughtful lately. <br /> <br /> Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director, and I understand that he wants to give social message in every film he does, but maybe he just does not know how to do it! He refers to the preacher, without caring to audience intelligence to understand what he is trying to say. Maybe he should just focus on entertainment and leave messages in social Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with everything I say, you will agree that during the screening you will be thinking that Rang De Basanti was much better and Mr.Santoshi had to leave the industry bashing to Om Shanti ohms. bashing industry? That's right !! Santoshi portrayed the industry as a place of back-biting, whining, and couches, that hero happily messing with sterlet curiously named Sania. There are some people who will think that these pieces show the true face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> In general, to raise their voice against such movies like this and not spend your hard earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * with ****.
