About 15 minutes, my wife has come back. Not so much because of the material, but his absence. They decided to fill in the gaps where the fun stuff was supposed to be with the same language and is absolutely vulgar talk, as they could. If this is to allow the (very rare), we'll sit back and watch (do not laugh, mind you) and wait for the next gross-outs or offensive remarks (s). After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything we read said how great it was. Trailer looked good, and Roger Ebert called it actually "smart" and said that it was not rough sex comedy. He went to the right movie? Along with Be Cool, the only other film I've ever came out ... and I have no regrets. I'm sick of trying to go see the comedy in America.
