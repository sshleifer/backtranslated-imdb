I never wanted to see this film, then one day, for a joke, I looked it up to see how bad it was; Prejudice has been confirmed. <br /> <br /> To begin, I would like to question the policies of the film. He hides behind the mask of the women, making it the biggest in the city, "but the only way that women can make it big by using their sexuality rather than their intelligence and skills. These women are no more whores. A little less attractive women can not be successful? It is not just the right wing message of the film, there are hundreds of pictures of American flags and huge wads of cash. A perfect example, once a powerful thing in America, capitalism and nothing spiritual, moral or artistic value even not allowed to look at the film. The money is referred to as the only important thing for young people. <br /> <br /> bar manageress stated that it does not allow drug users in its bar, and then it goes to the poor gallons of spirits down her own neck, and then the necks of its employees and customers. anyone who knows anything about intoxicants will know that alcohol can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And, finally, why the scene in which the protagonist is the point of sexual interest in the audience (if it becomes a chapter or with her boyfriend), her father is always involved? We have seen her get undressed with the camera almost caress her legs, she was one of her father's phone. She asked, "her father just as she" auctions "boyfriend. I think it's the strangest thing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is immoral, fascist, degrading women and, to be honest, concern. But what else can you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
