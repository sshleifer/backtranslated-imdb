Prom Night: The most important night for any small girl, which consists almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters are constantly reminded us every ten minutes, when some heads peckingly miserable event happened in their tiny lives. <br /> <br /> There's really no excuse for Prom Night. There is less than nothing original about it, and I really would give it zero stars or less, it was possible to IMDb. The only part of my view that I liked was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of "ghosts." It was much more exciting than anything that happens on the screen in front of them. <br /> <br /> The story was basically some guy going on a rampage. And it was, there was not even a little exciting riot. Maybe if the guy was remotely scary, and no manual Robbie Williams double with a baseball cap, I would have sat there feeling a little anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than I do about the movie carpet color does not add to the effect, either. And what's worse, the other characters are equally one-dimensional and not paying attention. The hotel staff did not seem to notice, or care, that one of these maidens disappeared, and provide further evidence that the killer is unrecognizable after he shaved. I was incredibly surprised that bitchy, stereotypical girl in a blue dress was the only person to notice who he was. She understands that it then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle themselves in a plastic sheet, and then topple the glass bucket of paint. Nice one. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was, I think the belief that the director was trying his absolute hardest. He really pushed all the boundaries, sun showing no murder is really going on. Shocking! And the music, do not even get me started. It was almost as necessary, stripping the funeral. <br /> <br /> I really want to Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. Not one, sane or otherwise, has no reason to see this film. Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill, and movies, as it will worsen the situation. If you get the desire to see it is absolutely awful movie, hear my request. Do not do it. There are better things to spend six pounds. As a sheet to play with ghosts.
