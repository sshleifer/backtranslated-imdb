I've never seen the movie Tarzan before, so when I saw him on TV, I thought I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately, I must say that I was disappointed. Tarzan has been more than 40 years, and more overweight. Nya I imagined would look like Tarzan. And if I did not miss it, making a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional warbling scream. Furthermore, there was a shaky Tarzan through the trees. - jumping from vine to vine <br /> <br /> Well, so much for expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - the monkey Cheeta was there. He was a guy with a guitar in there. Were thieves and the good guys and romance ... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing wrong with that, you do not understand, but equally no good <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie Tarzan enter :. 4/10
