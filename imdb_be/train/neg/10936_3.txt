I wanted to like this movie, I really did. He has some good actors, but ultimately falls flat. He tries too hard to be funny in some places (the daughters of a zealous cooking attempts), more than up to the other (the scene where they clear whose yard, so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that, while moderately interesting, really just filler (all works of the stage). And I did not find that the "villains" intimidating, standing hate, as I found them children, are annoying. <br /> <br /> I've met people like those in the film, playing church ball. And I say that the judges on the spot, however, in the end, I do not really care all that much about the characters and their quest for the glory of the Church of the ball. Perhaps because they were so one-dimensional, that I might not have minded so much when the movie was funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly in general. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm Entertainment, made some good films, but this is not one of them.
