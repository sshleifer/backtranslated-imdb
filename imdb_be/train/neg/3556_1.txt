You know that you're in trouble when John Cassavetes running at half speed instead of full throttle in a movie, and «Incubus» is terrible, the worst case scenario of a great actor going through the motions in order to pay the bills, in fact, watching unnatural scenario and the direction of "baroque" art by John Hogan, one can hardly blame him. The film has something to do with a series of rape-murder taking place in a small town, with a lot of scams in the supernatural combined. Either way, the direction is possible to suck the tension and interest of each scene, and Cassavetes clearly seems PO »ed at times. Incubus itself, which does not show up until the last stage, it is well-done creation, but it is not worth the wait. <br /> <br /> 1/10
