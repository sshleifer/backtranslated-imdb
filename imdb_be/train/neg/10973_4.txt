If you loved the "Pulp Fiction" and as a manual camera, you have to love this movie. I loved the brisk story (although I feel that «Pulp Fiction» was the most overrated film since "The English Patient") and the characters found unrealistic, but it is interesting. It is not "On the waterfront" and "Citizen Kane" and difficult European pretentious. But the worst, by far, is the hand-held camera. It's so distracting and annoying, I found that waiting desperately until the end of the film. I do not know why the new directors believe that this method of shooting is so great. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away, the hand-held camera would you sick about 10 minutes.
