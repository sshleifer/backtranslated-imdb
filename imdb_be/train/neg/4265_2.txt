I'm a big fan of the movie Warrior. Some of my favorite Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after watching the Mongols, which is absolutely strange, and which I highly recommend, I had high expectations for the film by Sergei Bodrov. But it was a terrible, terrible, pathetic even entirely a strong word in this case. The whole movie I was waiting for something exciting to happen, but this is not the case, I was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end, but even this was a huge disappointment, just some random running, swinging swords ... there are so many good warriors movie, this one is not one of them.
