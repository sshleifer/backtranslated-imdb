A call girl witnesses the murder, and becomes the next target of the killer. Directed by Brian De Palma exactly artsy roll here: his camera swoops around the corners in the museum (after preserved for a long time on the painting ape), divvies up in a split screen for the purpose of artistic, almost breaks his site with the sequence (again in a divided screen), where two characters and watching a television program about transsexuals, and the stages of its (first) finals in thunderstorms. «Dressed To Kill» tiring, especially because it asks us to swallow so much, and does not return anything substantial. Much of the action (except the young Keith Gordon) and an ordinary (second) final is plagiarism De Palma's own "Carrie" - not to mention the "Psycho." Explanation playing dirty deeds as a parody of Hitchcock, not tribute. Stylish steel cold way to the final results clearly half-baked. ** from ****
