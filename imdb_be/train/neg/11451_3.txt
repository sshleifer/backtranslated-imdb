Well, my friends, a serious movie buff, is expected to watch all kinds of movies, the bad as well, and this film has made me a test. I do not mince words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. Always perfectly Sissy Spacek did not do anything to make this film better. In fact, I asked myself why I even bother to see this rotten bad film? Why do I waste my time and money on something that I suspected it would be a bad thing? The answer, of course, that I am a fan of the film and, therefore, can not avoid what otherwise should be avoided. I will not waste time explaining what was wrong with this amateur film, except to say that the quality of the action was, to put it mildly, subpaar. Serious movie lover can take responsibility watching this movie. Otherwise. stay at home, do not waste your time, read a book, take a take out duties or have yourself a nice sandwich.
