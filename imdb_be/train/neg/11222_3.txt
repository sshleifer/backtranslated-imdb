Sybil Richards sends another Full Moon / Surrender movie masterpiece of erotica. This time Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in a rather flirtatious silver outfit) tasked to destroy all evidence of sexual activity. However, she can not resist watching the tape, and she kind of likes them. The sex scenes are well filmed and set a perfect soundtrack (at least, for this kind of film). Throw mostly awful and basically a very average looking too. Jacqueline Lovell is its extremely attractive self and between viewing files sex she manages to expose her breasts and pull down a bit. It also fits in a small lesbian activity. To be honest Lovell deserves much better than this kind of fare. Here she looks great naked, but it is actually much more attractive in her silver dress, which tells about the "drama." Through the trash movie with Lovell and the soundtrack only real redeeming features. Satisfactory even for the withdrawal and surrender of the new budget is clearly low for them too.
