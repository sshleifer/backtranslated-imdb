This is what happens when you live in China and the local video store works on the subtle name in English ?? you are blessed with this work that appears to be yes, Romanian cinema. Nevertheless, I think it has a real comic potential <br /> <br /> spoiler follow :. <br /> <br /> While I do not think it was really spoil someone viewing pleasure, to ask why the film is set in a casino there is a scene, beach archery, even in the memories. It's a mystery, puzzles and many others, continue to be used by desperate comedian, perhaps when they are stuck in Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Let me also wonder aloud why it is beautiful people allow themselves to be abused themselves on a movie like this. It's sad.
