Wow, this movie sucked big time. I heard that the film expresses the meaning of friendship is very good. And with all the Internet buzz on this film, I realized that could possibly go wrong? However, the movie was just plain bad. It was a sad and character development has never been. Space travelers as a terrible film, if you do not like this film there is no way you like it.
