When I started watching this movie, I saw a dude with Buffy, Xander, and I realized, oh, how good he still makes a living in the movies. Now the country is a film that I can, given that this is a good dose of weird, like David Lynch film, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, etc. And you seem to have to be in the mood for another. This one, however, made me mockingly recall crazy sites on there on the conspiracy theory that makes absolutely no sense. I mean come on people the Nazis, who had agreed with the United States, to the unholy trinity of evil forces? I was surprised that they did not mention the hollow earth in this film with Hitler flying saucers and lizards people. Maybe, if you're like 60 grams of heroin was with this film would make any sense, but seriously, I do not condone drugs, I do not condone this film. He should be burned, crushed and forgotten, so good old Xander could get another acting job. It was not his actions, though, it was good, but the script just does not make any sense. Sorry.
