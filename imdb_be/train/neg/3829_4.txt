Shchukin train robber about Hume hits his chain gang and sent to the resignation of the sheriff responsible for the murder of his wife (also a hidden cache of gold, which remains hidden due to screenwriter). Trying to bring the Western genre refined violent style of the 1970s and cruelty not even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns, emerged from the late '60s. It's incredibly simple and square, with only female characters around like a punching bag and possible victims of rape. As a former sheriff is back in the team, Charlton Heston gives one of his lazy, the least inspired performances ever (he has one good moment, trying to read the letter and feeling glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad mongrel, pretty much on autopilot, as well, but there is a way to turn Coburn even hoariest dialogue and situations, something prickly and irritate. It's his show all the way. * 1/2 ****
