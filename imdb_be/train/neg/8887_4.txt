Good movies are not based only on the beautiful garden and the top of the hill. I surprised that it won two awards. Extremely overrated. The first time I saw such films from China, visually stunning but really something spectacular to say, well, more than 10 years ago, and I'm sure that everyone else is more suitable. This is not one of them, I'm afraid.
