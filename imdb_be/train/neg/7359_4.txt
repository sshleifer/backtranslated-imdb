Anyone who has watched a few movies Lifetime Movie Network knows that story confidence is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table. So if obsessed Lara moved into the house Patti and methodically begins to drive her landlady hurt, I did not even blink. When Lara finally slips its activities to threaten poor Patty, and dares her to do something about it, I just nodded. You see, at LMN planet, people do not behave as they do for any particular reason, they just do it to keep the action going. Only on planet LMN can someone almost thrown out of the house of the owner of your own home with the help of his seductive powers !! Poor Patty - she just trusted too much, and Lara left her medication, and then there was this great battle at the top of the stairs with a full syringe of the death of the material, which is injected into the end something stomach and body bag out the door. The horror! <br /> <br /> But trust me, this product LMN Planet is a classic. You have to watch it once, only for big laughs you'll have. The incredible scale, I give this film 95/100. Make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices, too. You will understand later.
