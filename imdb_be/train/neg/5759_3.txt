This is the third parody scary movies and hopefully the last. At this time, a parody mainly on the Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some strange reason. In my opinion, this film was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed, maybe three times, and it is not enough for comedy. I really enjoyed the first two, but it was just stupid. If your jokes consist of corpses to get beat up, and people are constantly throwing things alone, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if you are smart enough to stay at home and save your money and please stop doing this kind of movies, they just keep getting worse than 3/10.
