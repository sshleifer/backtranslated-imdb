It is hard to imagine that anyone could find this their favorite short when they saw most of them are short, but I know that humor is very subjective. I saw all of them sound shorts (by far the best of them IMO material), and I found one of his weaker efforts. <br /> <br /> In the year it was made (1930) Stan and Babe with 15 shorts and one feature. They were extremely popular, and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage by keeping their work all the time. In addition, it was a time of experimentation for writers and Stana. I would say it was an experiment that did not actually work. As someone said, that does not play to their strengths. Too much dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The best part of it for me is largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes maid Thelma Todd and great to talk about things, "the girl." <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the boys in their most creative and funny finished Blotto or aprons of the same year. <br /> <br /> They made so many shorts in such a short time, I think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less than the nominal shorts. They have done something like 108 films in general. Very few (for those made on FOX, with the exception) was a complete failure, but there are some. County Hospital, Me And My Pal, the Living Spirit, fixer Uppers comes to mind as essentially weak. But other then the ones I find something wonderful in almost all of his shorts. Quite a record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and used all his other shorts, then by all means check this one out, but I'd be willing to bet that this one was the least memorable Stan and the baby.
