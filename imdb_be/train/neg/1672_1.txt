It's the only movie I've ever seen, which prompted me to write a critique on any website, and that is a significant statement from someone who loves "Next Monolith Monsters." This film is ideal for those who want a harmless movie. It is devoid of sex and violence, for example. I believe that this film is safe for children of all ages. This film is ideal for those who do not want to be entertained, challenge, or stimulated in any way. Adults can easily catch up in December in front of TV while the children watch this film. Not surprisingly, however, if you are waking up to find the children began to turn off the TV and a board game. As an adult who likes to be entertained, that uses everything from the mundane to the fantastic realism, drama, comedy and action, all the adult things that reflect the real life on the land and / or stimulate the imagination, this film has nothing to offer.
