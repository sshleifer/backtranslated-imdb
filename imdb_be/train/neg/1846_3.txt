Well, I wanted to be honest with all of the audience, I bought it because of the sex scenes Kira, but unfortunately, I have not seen a lot of them. All the sex scenes were short and done haphazardly together with all countries and patterned background music as well as all the other films B - it just does not look the same as two people who have sex. There is a modicum of the story to the end - new lover Kira is a killer. Wow !!! how shocking !!! Why do not we put forward this film at the Oscars? I can not imagine how bad the movie will look like if the R-rated (Mine is imported from the UK, assessed 18). The conclusion? Put it down and go away, so John will not end up being a moron like me <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 2/10
