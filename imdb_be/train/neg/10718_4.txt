Let's Tina Fey, you can do better than that. Once started the film, I knew how it would end. Sure, it was funny at times. Even laugh out loud funny. But not enough laughs to save this film. I do not recommend to buy it. At best, I recommend renting it, but that's all. Baby mom has some funny scenes, but predictable and have a friendly ending it seeks. <br /> <br /> Tina Fairy and Aya Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher both did great in the fact that they do well in it. But it was not better. A child my mother had a great supporting cast. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the grandeur of the casts. <br /> <br /> Another pregnancy film got into the world of cinema. After a great Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks pretty average in comparison. Raised and Juno cheerful, sincere and have the end of that leave you with a smile on his face. Ending mother baby was unfunny and dull. <br /> <br /> Oh, Mom was not the best comedy of the year, and he does not try to be. I recommend it, but do not expect it to be quite fun. The average wait for a comedy that makes great emotional end, he tries to be. I give you my baby mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
