Let the chase: this movie erotica pornography is sold to the masses under the name of the studio is milking every last penny from the teat of the American pie. Period. <br /> <br /> The whole story (and that does not mean that there is a lot of walking) serves as a vehicle to show the audience more tits and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you Tween guy, and you're too squeamish to buy the actual pornography, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, the film is not so much to offer at all. <br /> <br /> Effective subpar, the character development is almost non-existent, and this story is pointless knarl nudity, drinking and leprosy (none of which are particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> to buy real porn, if that's what you want to see, but if not, watch a good movie. Pets, children, or even the original American Pie all the great cinematic works, and they all contain the abuse of alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> Â«It is not how much, it's how you use it"
