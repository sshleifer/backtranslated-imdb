After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered if it was actually a product of an experiment to see whether a computer program is the production of a movie. It was that dull and formulaic. But US propaganda thrown in his face throughout the film shows - disappointing - this is the work of people. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but the quotation as, "We must steal the Declaration of Independence to protect him," it seems as ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicolas Cage spewing such lines: "I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip" with a straight face made me and my husband, I wonder whether all the actors of Valium before shooting each scene. "Discourse" for every twist and a new "key" is really ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a bonus side portion misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-chided all been party to "never closes." It is clearly in the film only for appearance, but they felt the need to slam the "Dr." title to its character to give it the force of gravity. At some point, Cage's character says: "You will never shut up?" And the camera turns to her, looking poutily at his hands, as if she were a child. Really grotesque. The only benefit to this film is that it's so strange is bad, you will get some laughs at him. Really scary is that most people are watching a movie with us seemed to enjoy. Scary ....
