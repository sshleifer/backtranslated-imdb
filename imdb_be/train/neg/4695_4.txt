I watched this movie several times and never thought it was funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> His women working in the company, and their boss is a jerk, and they ended up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and try to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> To act very well. Dabney Coleman is one of the 80 stars, plays a good bad guy is not really evil, just not nice. Dolly Partin is an attractive and fun to watch comedies and her down south wit really shines here. Jane Fonda is so-so and does little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this film, it has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times, you have to love it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone that likes 80's comedy. I love the movie, but he has a thing about it is that I do not like. It starts big and has a good flow, and then everything starts to come together all at once, and made me not care about the characters. They all have a little fantasy about what they want to do the boss, and although the "cute" I just thought that slowed the flow of the movie. As the film goes on it once again raises and funny things happen, and then slows down again, just wrapped in a rapid manner that is too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but give it a try if you have not seen. I think the one that may be more or less nice, depending on your mood.
