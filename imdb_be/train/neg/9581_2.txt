That's the only positive thing I can say about this film. Cleveland is a star, I was there and did not see the city look so good. Beautiful river and city views. <br /> <br /> This film is moving as fast as they hope that you will not notice the lack of real-world value. People are running around and shooting guns without any consequences. For example, there is a germ of a house character Rob Lowe two cars were stolen, and while the police did not appear there until much later in the film. Murder for hire has never looked so strange. <br /> <br /> Who wrote this film should be on the receiving end of one movie countless stray bullets. Many of the actors in this film is so much better than this. I check the date of the movie just to make sure it was not written during the writers' strike, but alas it is not. The film is currently in rotation on an HD channel that Universal, if you do not want to drool over Lowe there's no reason to watch it.
