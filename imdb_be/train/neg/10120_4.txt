This film Hitchcock bears little resemblance to his late Unknown movies and it seems much more like a very old-fashioned morality tale. A young couple inherits, which according to them, makes them happy. They spend money to travel the world and live a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while the excitement begins to fade, and the pair began to dissipate and pointless their existence. However, out of nowhere, when they are on a luxury cruise ship sinks, and they lose everything - and ultimately a much happier in the end, because now they appreciate life! What a strange, stupid and instructive film! Personally, I would like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me unhappy <br /> <br /> The values ​​of production are relatively poor in comparison with the later productions - coarse film with poor sound quality and pretty amateur acting.
