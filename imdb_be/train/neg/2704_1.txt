I do not understand why people would praise this garbage. It wrong, stupid, impossible, terrible, and almost everything else. The film is a look at life, racial problems, prejudices, and anything else that is strange is happening at the college. This is where it crashes. He has no grasp on the fact. With many questionable nonsense scenes in the film, such as, for example, <br /> <br /> The black man chasing a white man with a gun, the guard stopped blacks and handcuffs and held while the thug passes them. <br /> <br /> in the same white man snipering down people from the subject of the roof, which was stopped and beaten down the same black man then he stopped and gave the beating of Rodney King style while people gun work for free, and in a moment chasing down only one of the four guards. <br /> <br /> As one previous reviewer noted 230lbs few white men beat down several black males weight about 160lbs 105lbs including Bust A Rhyme <br /> <br /> Another important flaw in the film shallow uninteresting protagonists. By frightened and confused white and middle angry, and yet the law (?) Black people. It almost an insult to its both black and white people. I'm a white man, and I know a lot of black and Hispanic people who agree that this film is not to reflect the characters and giving them the characteristics solely because of their race. <br /> <br /> The storyline, which I'll explain revolves around three characters. One black athlete, another terribly confused white girl who questioned their sexuality, and the third is a white man who too embarrassed and scared, and then blames his problems on black people, whom he later became a Nazi in the film. They all have their share of challenges and adventures, including sex, rape, fighting, love, hatred, prejudice, racial war, and oh yeah do not forget education. What it all comes down to at the end of the fatal shootout. What, after they return to their sad life and think "bad to be white." Does this sound a lot like your college years? I do not think so. I do not think that the director was in college, especially if he were to make this awful mess. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very bad, bad, ugly film. If you want to see a clearer understanding or racial problems are going to see American History X. If you want to see a more accurate picture Rental Porkys college. Just avoid this confusion.
