I'm a big fan of Lon Chaney, but the screen to write the film just does not work for me. Story jumps around the country (I understand that the film is no section), and characters appear and disappear with the suddenness of annoying. Some of intertitles excessive explanations (for example, "Why are you no longer a child!" - cut to the picture for a long, slow rhythm - "you are a woman," so we got it for the first time), but there are several said sequences that ask for an explanation, that never appear. (Let's hear the arguments of Luigi and his blonde girlfriend, please!) The plot, which includes the incestuous desire (figuratively, if not technically) was interfering with the fact that it was difficult to watch. to honor of the author, this question was considered as direct Bloem and match from May to December is not specified how the rights and well-inevitably some of Mary Pickford films (such as "crane-fly") Chani gives a good idea, as usual, but I think he was better directed to the past -. He overdid this several times here, IMHO. I really enjoyed the clown sequence and was very impressed with tricks. Loretta young was a magical, though strangely the young. The film has its moments, but so far, this is my least favorite Chaney picture.
