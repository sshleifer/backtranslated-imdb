What made me keep track of this film down were observational Vampyres, I thought, I've got to get the other films of this guy (Larroz) did, I'm sorry, I tracked it down, this is a weak attempt at a film loaded with occult / satanic type sex and only sex (with ugly actors and actresses, it is an occasion for a song. The only factor is the sacrificial setting and atmosphere, to avoid this, too much hype surrounds it, not worth the effort to find it, it refers to the desired publication in Grindhouse. I I hope he's got some other movies that live up to the vampires, and the goat of the scene was very boring, I understand that this is what brings deception.
