. WORST. FILM. EVER. Done. <br /> <br /> After watching this supposedly gay made the film, I suspect that someone is rounded brain damaged half-blind neo-Nazis and forced him to do worse than a gay movie ever, all in some misguided attempt to attack the gay culture, I had to stop the film and call a friend to come just like that, I had someone to ridicule, when I stopped the film from the shock, disbelief and indignation at this apparent stupidity. <br /> <br /> On top of the terrible letters and actions, and illogical and silly story, it's just poorly made film. A dog with a Handycam, tied to its tail could churned better. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading several positive reviews this film here, I suspect that the writer must have a half-dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this film watchable even as anything other than a joke, a liar, or pay hard to say.
