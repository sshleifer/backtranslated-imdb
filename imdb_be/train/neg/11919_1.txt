this should be one of those movies where the trailer is 50 times better than the film itself.I first saw the trailer in 1991, he looked great.Since I always wanted to see him, but could never find it ... .. until today, so, after 14 years. <br /> <br /> lets just say that I was so disappointed with his unreal, I knew well that it would not be the Oscar winner, but still hoped that it would be fun to film non-brain Bloodsport mold. Unfortunately, it was not, it's Pooh <br /> <br /> As with all American rock 'n' roll and the action was so bad, it was pretty scary. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were rubbish and look fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD only cost me £ 5 and I guess I was overwhelmed at £ 7 <br /> <br /> Now it's hard, I know that I'll never get that hour and a half ago.
