The film crew did not have good access to the occupied territories as well as video footage of the Israeli side dominated. I was struck by the almost completely opposite points of view of the mother. Israeli mother lost a child who had the opportunity of life of great happiness. Palestinian mother lost her child, who had only the possibility of life of hardship and despair. With such a completely different point of view, any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of minds. The word "peace" has the same meaning for each of them. The world was a Palestinian freedom. Israel has the world security. With such an abyss, this kind of film is really worth a lot? I ended up with the feeling that I was watching a meaningless propaganda - both sides were inconclusive.
