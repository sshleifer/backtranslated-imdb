Yes, I know that I am one of the few people to trample on tight this movie in dust oblivion.So let me tell you why I feel this way. In fact, if it had been advertised as a zombie film, or the like, I would have enjoyed it.But now, I'm totally speechless. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler ... Although I'm not sure that the port * Let's start with the first huge drawbacks. If I did not know what the film is called "Darkness - Vampire version" and if I had not seen some sequences where there seems to suck the blood of some people, I would not see the connection with the vampires. I mean, lacking fangs ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> The second bad thing: that metal? It turns out that all the young people, but most of these so-called "vampires" are in various kinds of metal, judging mainly their shirts! Do not get me wrong, I was in a more extreme form of music for nearly 15 years, but no one "is not going to scare me, showing me some funny teenager in Iron Maiden (all groups !!!) T- shirts running around, pretending to be vampires! "Pathetic" is the only the only word I could use here <br /> <br /> The third weakness :. Actors. Wait a minute. The actors? You mean friends of wooden director! Words to waste here. <br /> <br /> Yeah, well, that the film is very bloody, but what difference does that make? It would be a strong side and something to enjoy when «Briliant» director chose not to create artificial vampire theme in this film. I would like to see the vampire, but entertained some stupid child perspective, I would love to use my baseball bat on. The filmmakers had just advertised a film about "cheap B-grade horror without any plot, but a lot of gore" !!! <br /> <br /> This film is blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And it makes me sick.
