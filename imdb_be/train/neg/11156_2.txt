Dark Wolf (Overview) Let's get right to it: It's a disgusting piece of rotten ROADKILL with cow dung on it. It's just a terrible film. This city werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and history as weak as any clumsy nerd with a dramatic 80th movie High School. To make matters worse, the poor Kane Hodder was cheated in the game giant evil werewolf. Kane Hodder e * Cking. Someone is trying to ensure that play Jason Voorhees height of his film career ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the former Playmate Jaime Bergman in the movie, and it eventually becomes a werewolf, too. It's kind of shitty police drama with the worst in the world, looking werewolf in it. But he has moments of almost rampant nakedness. But that's all. Want to know more? Well, the werewolf is usually ugly appearance black blur zipping around the screen. And if we are privileged enough to actually see a sequence of transformations, we are presented with something that resembles a full-motion video with video games made in the early stages of the Playstation. First Playstation. CG animation that really primitive. Only good for horror hardcore fans who want to see the little moments of nudity in an environment of rampant visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
