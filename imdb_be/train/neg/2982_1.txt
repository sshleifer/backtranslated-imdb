Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Interference ** <br /> <br /> Few films are in fact "so bad they're good", and Zombi 3 is not just bad, it's pathetic, inexcusably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may only be necessary to describe them all <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is a film deposited on Fulci, even by his standards it has absolutely no sense coherence, or the mind, but we can not blame Fulci, as it is not really directed at him, but Bruno Mattei, who did not even make sense FULCI in style to to help carry the movie. Mattei seems to have brought a bit of the film, but the stunning incompetence <br /> <br /> Yes, I am ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every minute of useless Zombi 3. It has no redeeming features -. In a genre known for thin characters, weak story, and the lack of film production skills, Zombi 3 pushes the boat, but it's even funnier Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> «Action" starts when «Death 1" gas stolen from a military base, and damage to escape. Who is a thief, why he stole, and why the US military believes that the establishment of cannibalistic legions of the living dead is a good idea? All these and other questions will not respond to Zombi 3 .... <br /> <br /> After hiding in the hotel, infected thief goes crazy with all the green plastecine grow on his face before the army tracked down somewhat reckless to decide the best way to get rid of his troupe will burn it, sending "Death 1" up in the atmosphere as a result of ... zombie birds! Who, then, attack people and turn them into zombies people !!! (If a zombie cannibals, why not a zombie bird simply attacking other birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we meet our "hero", a trio of horny G coachload and girls. There are some other guys with them too, but they are not important - no matter. You will be hard to remember someone's face, not to mention their name or find a reason to care about them. They end up hiding in the same hotel as the thief ( "a week ago, the place was buzzing with life, now it is the buzz of flies!"), But there is no escape from the undead. <br /> <br /> At this point, you will either be completely absorbed or you made damn thing. The script is so awful, even the biggest acts in the world can not save him, so it's just as they have some of the worst - and not only human characters, zombies, acting here constantly low. There is no maturity, like zombies themselves - some drawn on in the time honored style, others participate fully in fist fights or charging around with machettes, not to mention the zombies, who are still able to speak (a trick that gives the film TWIST is a horrible ending). They die from the shots to the chest (not the head) and even get knocked out a good left hook. How can you knock a zombie ??? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on poorly done 80th action often makes him look like an episode of V ... <br /> <br /> zombies and spend a lot of time on the run, seemingly waiting for a few hours in funny places on the chance of some poor sap will pass and get the fright of their lives. They hide in the bushes, in garages, in huts, on roofs, in water and even in the pregnant women. At some point, a zombie is a woman up the stairs. In order to kill and eat it? Nope! In order to push it into the water, these zombies and their wacky sense of humor! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of dried blood, though. Broken limbs, occurs early green pus, and there are plenty in the way of eating flesh and people get their face mushed. There's nothing to match the original eyeball piercing, but if you make bad effects of your bag will not let down. <br /> <br /> All of this, and I have not even mentioned the terrible music, unexplained flying head zombie scientist whose acting is actually possible to stand out as really bad, or final cooling climax .... in an inventive twist on the original radio station to be captured by a zombie, zombie 3 gives us a real zombie DJ !! "He's gone over to their side!" Our cry escaping character before vowing to continue the fight against the undead in the future that never, unfortunately, did not come <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 garbage. - it would not be a loss for the whole world, if each print was destroyed, and all records of its existence erased, but somehow I feel that my life is richer for having seen it. <br /> <br /> I said that richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
