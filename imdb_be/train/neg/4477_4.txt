That is empty and lacks luster performance of the classic novel. I really want people to stop messing with the classics, if they clearly have no idea about the real intention of the original or points. This version is no different. I felt that the version of Ralph Fiennes is much worse, though, as the casting Juliette Brioche like Kathy to be the worst decision of casting EVER ... anyway back to this version. It aims to make the history of the relationship to a contemporary setting and style of music. He is doing well in both, but this is high art nits. A one-time viewing on a rainy day can be ... The direction was average and editing badly. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma does a great turn as Hindley and in fact one of Britains wasted talents. Part of the hit game with a lot of charm and confidence, and I think the cast is a strong point of this project. Although a talented director would have made better use of all the opportunities he had. It is clear that he was the director of recruitment and instills the project with enthusiasm, which he deserved.
