... but it will make you wonder if we had any in the first place! This film is just as bad as any of today's terrible horror. Man goes around staring half-dressed at home, trying to decide which one to kill, so that he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves a man staggering around and sprayed out across the suite for three whole minutes to cover everything that needs to be more than ten gallons of "blood." The film also tries to create a sense of what a man does with his girlfriend and not against nature, but the film is so badly made it impossible for viewers drag any sense of shock and outrage. Aimlessly unimpressively dark and sinister, this movie can not even get his title straight-- newcomers loans they say, "a brain that would not die", but the list of end credits as "the head that will not die."
