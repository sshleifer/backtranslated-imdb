As someone who has read this book, I can say that it is much inferior to most American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. There are various reasons for this. Firstly, Emma too unpleasant. Yes, it has flaws, and it's not the easiest person like - but the viewer should not be just the same begins to despise her. Secondly, Mr. Knightly is miscast. His pensive and melancholy in this version better suited to adapt Bronte or Gaskell, than Austen, and throw temper all things "from". Third, Samantha Morton too strong actress to be attributed to the role of Harriet; and why she did to look so painful? Harriet has to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she was going to be brought consumption in the next scene. Fourth, the structure was cleared and cut scenes. In the end, when Emma decides that she loves Mr knight, he comes across as completely incomprehensible, because the story was not properly displayed and interested throughout the film. Fifth, what happens exactly with the emphasis Mrs Elton? She left sound like an American actress is trying to suppress your own focus in the beginning to all the American mid-way through, and then back into English at the end. Finally, the trailing end. The book and the large version of the film end with weddings Emma and Mr. Knightley. This version will be delayed mixing after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> In general, fairly chaotic attempt. Read a book or rent version instead Paltrow
