"So it's a bride, you see, and it gets crushed to death of this statue, which is fed to it on her wedding day. Then, get this, a year later, her ex-boyfriend falls in love with a beautiful psychic ?? and then that beautiful psychic gets haunted by the ghost of dead unhappy bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriend ?? it is he ?? it will be fun!. "A polite smile. <br /> <br /> This is, I would imagine, Jeff Lowell, the man who invented «Over Her Dead Body» presented his concept Execs studio there for New Line Cinema. A great mystery, as the same corporate cones could then turn right around and the green light to the project, allowing Lowell to direct the film and write a script. <br /> <br /> After all, if you think that the film could not ever possibly as bad as it sounds, this original premise, it is obvious that you have to wait for other people think. The only way it could work if the writer was simply gone crazy with it, and turned it into a no-holds-barred satirical farce. Instead, wanting to make sure he made inaccurate, innocent and heartfelt romantic comedy, Lowell in boring and half-measures each step of the way, tamping down the absurdity in favor sad conventionality. Indeed, «Over Her Dead Body» so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it is difficult to know exactly where Lowell thought he was going with it. Almost all the settings, joke and sight gag in the film flat feet and bad runs, even with the actors themselves, seemingly aware of their plight. How else to explain the limp, lifeless performance by Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /> <br /> I choose not blame the actors, some of which have already proven their abilities in the best cars in the past (that is especially the case with Rudd). But Lowell and the studio Execs sure have some «splainin» do.
