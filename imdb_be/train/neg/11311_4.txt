I vaguely remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s, I did a few interviews & bios of obscure actors / actresses, especially Ben, actress Jodie F Spain and Fair, who played Angel in 1961-ies young savages. Ben was one of the people in the low-key Sci-Fi horse in Chicago around 1970, when I had a good chat with him and his "career" and life. All of them have been published in some of today long forgotten fanzine days. I wish I still had a copy of the interview, but the clock is ticking, and any of these people, certainly will not "remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a really good man, ekeing to life (Prisoners of those days did not even pay his guest, of course, if they were not famous stars, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars in most! Important to know, Ben is still alive and legs How about a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! vile is lousy right now
