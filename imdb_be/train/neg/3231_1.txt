This film seems to have a lot of people say that this is one of the toughest ever. Once only considered it, I can say that it did not live up to these requirements. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is really crazy. But in general, the execution was not quite worthy to crawl. Even the final scene (the eyeball thing) is not so disgusting. I like a man possessed expect, instead it was of a lower quality than the gusset continued on films such as ultra low budget Violent Sh! T. <br /> <br /> Anyone want to see the actual movie will be disappointed, since no story at all (though, of course, most people know it). Gore supporters will be disappointed, since, in contrast to the faith, blood and guts here are few and far between. Not to mention the actress playing the victim may be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> No matter what people say, that this film is not that shocking, it's just all of the sludge. Avoid this.
