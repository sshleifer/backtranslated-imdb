This is a complete deception ... <br /> <br /> The film was obviously filmed in the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - vehicles Indians; writing the entire Hindi - the language used in India. Passing on the typical streets of Jaipur. In addition, the palace is in the Ameri - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmakers in them (the film) in the DVD Bonus, seem to make it appear that they risked their lives shooting in and around Kabul. Almost all of these scenes filmed in India. The scene in which they see a group of singing around the fire so fake that they do not even think about changing his Afgani folk song. They just recorded folk song Rajasthan. How do I know this, because I have traveled the area extensively. They are only on the band-wagon to make a big issue of this. I do challenge filmmakers to deny it.
