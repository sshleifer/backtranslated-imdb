After reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the film did not give me any of the feelings that the book is transported. It makes me wonder, when Kaufman even liked the book for which he successfully made it into something else.Either, or that it is simply bad. Most importantly, where it is easy! From the very first scene, music drownes most of the dialogue and feelings, and it goes straight through the film. I think that the creators thought that with upbeat music playing straight through the film, it would have made the story feel light-but they do not here. Instead, the music manages to give all that "the film feel" thus dramatizes the events, so that we dwell on them, so that everyone really feels heavy. <br /> <br /> Another example of how this device can not decorating the storyline, making it more dramatic. In the film we see Franz Tomas passing on the street, which is on its way to see Sabina. The introduction of this chance meeting / by the way, I'm sure there have been entirely in the book, giving Tomas' history more important than making it light. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed for the worse imo, but it can be done, because the book just does not convert well into a movie, for example, is a style of Kundera. This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site wrote their book and movie experience in mind, not only writing about the film. The film, which at that time, as uncompelling. For those who have not read the book, but I recommend just reading it. For those who have, I must say that you will just waste your time and probably end up here writing like stay pure prevention.
