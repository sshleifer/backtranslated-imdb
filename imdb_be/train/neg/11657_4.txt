Â«Scary Movie 2" is supplied to the Scary Movie franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4, it was all good, but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. Fortunately, they chose to have effect after that, and made two more horror. <br /> <br /> The film is about a group of teenagers who get tricked into going to their professor haunted house during the night. Things start to go wrong, and then they realize that they have to leave. <br /> <br /> This film did not get, but they could improve a lot of things. It's a bit of fun, and if you liked the other films in the Scary Movie franchise and then give it to watch - but I do not think you will like it nearly as much.
