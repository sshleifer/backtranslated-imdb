As has been said countless times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is not a remake (usually neglected) in the mid 80's the sequel to 1977 original Wes Craven. But wanting to give this postmodern sequel to-a-remake of the official stamp decreasing Craven himself (double threat with his son, Jonathan) has decided to make a film that has the same quality - in plain English, disastrous former director of the music video Martin Weiss takes over from Alexander Aja, and obviously in way over his head -. another question, somebody I could create a watchable ny film screen Cravens writing 101 scrawl. Not only the characters (in this case, the gang Goofball National Guard (Wo) men sent to study turbulent hills original remake) completely nasty and prone to really annoying genre trap (played without a lick of irony, mind ), but they are constantly joked, not funny. After watching their common inept during exercise, their fate against repels moved cannibals painfully obvious. Only this time - as in the original Â«80s later - scenario so simplistic (just there, in fact) that any potential overtones thrown overboard in favor of the raise bet pushes shocks (we were treated to a combo -murder sorts in the opening credits, plus gratuitous rape for those who are not released on DVD at the mid-point!). Even mutants in this outing are persons entirely free of the vagaries of the memorial growth - a sticky, rubbery-looking makeup FX seems like the rest of the film trying to hide his face in shame. I really groaned lame "surprise" at the end of another wonderful film the AJA, and producers just go for broke at the end of "Hills 2" plant - setting the stage for a very convincing - for the third installment ... yet Cravens and Weiss created a film that with ' It is a cynical bastardization that has made versions of the 1977/2006 work that they would be hard pressed to find an audience after insulting slap in the face.
