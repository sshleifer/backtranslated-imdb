I read posts here regarding the Wonder Woman costume for this TV movie. It should be noted, at the time the film was made, she was not dressed in traditional attire. The producers were actually stick to the concept of comics, book writer with WW to the early seventies. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, I have to agree with many of the other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a child, when he appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was at the right age to appreciate a film about the comic book. However, I was so "obsessed" with the storyline, I stopped watching it three-quarters of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was not at the right age to assess Kathie Lee! :-)
