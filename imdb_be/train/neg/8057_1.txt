What happened with this film? Many, many things. Editing try too hard to look good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer at the same time supplying him / her with a powerful headache. The plot is intricate and obviously extended from what started as a short (short story or a film). The plot is only less than ten minutes, a good story, and it's just stretched painfully, until it reaches a minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, is not it? Exactly. They become thinner. In the end, the plot is just paper thin, you could even skip it if you're not paying attention, it's hard to do when watching this film. Actions do not even slightly impressive. Symbols written bad and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things that's wrong with this film, which seems to be the one who was responsible for the score / soundtrack did not have any idea about what the movie was or what he was supposed to be about (not that I blame him, I could not 't understand it either). As a result, half of the music in the film is not suitable stage in general. Also, what was with all the sexual overtones between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Naturally, it was in order to attract young men, but it was just so cheaply made. And even the first scene has nothing to do with the rest of the movie? At any possible level? At all? Two horrible kids do not seem to have anything to do with the movie at all, they were just there to have some chase scenes. I doubt that anyone really like the movie so badly put together, and so shameless and terrible Hollywood as an attempt to somewhat interesting idea. But I digress. I recommend it to teenagers with low attention spans who do not mind a really bad horror thriller as long as some kind of sex and blood in it (although this may be true only for Killer Cut, which I've seen). 1/10
