What can I say about the cruelty of 2? Well, I can say, hand on heart, I'll just have to watch this film again, when I attached to the chair, and my eyes were opened clockwork orange style. <br /> <br /> The film "stars" Robin Dunne (no, I've never heard of it, too), whose disastrous appearance by Philippe made me start all over. In the case of terrible casting, Dunn attempts (and not) lead to play a beautiful charismatic charmer. So as an actor entirely beautiful, no charismatic or charming character is absolutely incredible. Amy Adams, (it was in an episode of leukocyte once), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar finished and bring treacherous Catherine life ... Nevertheless, Adams is not so good actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotions, it often looked like she reads cribs in the immediate vicinity of the camera. There were two good actors in the film, however, Barry Fletman (of Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington in Austion States) made a very good and entertaining presentation, parents Sebastian and Catherine, and the only reason why I appreciated the film as 2, not 1. <br /> <br /> the film itself is a bad version of the original, such as a minimum of tracing paper's dialogue and simulated scenes that lacked the originality of the previous film. <br /> <br /> I think the TV show, it might work, but if it was recasted with people who could actually act in the main parts.
