I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I have every seen (although my partner gave me a view of tissue in anticipation of Brendan Fraser moment ... * sigh *). It was nice to see, Cox is outside unceasingly gentle «Coxism state," he these days, when only brief moments. I also liked to try to put the episodes included on the length of the hair of the character (or height, in the case of JD) and the youth of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zack may be on the way to the most Chevy Chase / or that Matthew Perry? Prat drop caused by chemical slip (already recognized at Conan). A little side note, the song (currently stuck in my head) of the wiper-induced dance installation was «Diner» Martin Sexton.
