So why does this show sucks? Unfortunately, this is really the only question because there is no doubt that it does. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with the premise of the show, condemned-to-be-short-lived series Cavemen emphasis on a number of Neanderthals and their struggle for survival in modern America, and on the basis of the characters featured in the television series of the 'advert for insurance Geico. . The concept is solid and there is every reason to think that it can be successfully carried out <br /> <br /> I had to think about it for a while, but then the subtitle of commercials - something to the effect, "We" re not much different from you "gave me the key to suckiness show. Although, Cavemen / Neanderthals actually a different species than humankind, titular characters of the show turns out to be exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerk. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is my background as a game writer - but not heartless, hack, the committee on the basis of a writer from California - but the show was so great potential, and none of them has been implemented. Let's start with the fact that the producers should have focused on the fun things that would make us different from the cave. <br /> <br /> What can theoretically be funny, for example, to provide them with the profession, as an eternal grad student and furniture store clerk if they would have been more convincing was drawn to such things as underground utilities and guides employees in cave parks? Why do they play prosaic games like squash, when the whole episode could be devoted to them trying to license to hunt gets to go after the game with spears? Show how it could write itself, and it takes some willfully bad writing, to make it quite so crappy and boring. <br /> <br /> Another tedious aspect of the show is an attempt to reflect the cave as being subject to a number of stereotypes associated with different human minorities. Yawn! This has been done so many times, and never more sad than that. And, as noted earlier, the Neanderthals really different look, so use them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both the sign and uncompelling. <br /> <br /> The answers are welcome, including those who want to tell me why I'm wrong. I would like to enjoy the show and just wish I still failed. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Warhol, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
