TV pilots, you do not love them? Quinn Martin tried this one after being successful in a pile of other TV detective films, but this one goes nowhere, except in the area of ​​the MST, where it belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head, which takes orders from Aunt Mary to find a super-spy Lovejoy, I mean the tree. Zulu and Zuo-Tsing have ethnic comic and not much else. Wood sucks like a bad guy, despite his disguise, making him look exactly the same as it usually does. There's more unnatural fiber clothes here than you can imagine (required in the 1970s), and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why he did not go into a series? You figure it out, it's pretty open. Again, it is a pleasure for the MST, but not much else !!
