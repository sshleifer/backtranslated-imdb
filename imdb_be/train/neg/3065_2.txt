This film is the time it was made in the same way as the original, I suppose. That is very sad, because at a deeper level, the name «Vanishing Point» the original, so ironic. I'm sure it was not intended that way, but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971. REAL "vanishing point" was the end of an era, which largely ended in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this remake all countercultural elements were removed, and were made more than a PC in an attempt to reach a wider audience, apparently. "Sanitized for protection» <br /> <br /> Setting the Indian scene was gratuitous, and the idea of ​​the "noble goal" to the trip was the addition by subtraction. I am glad that I was watching, however, it made me evaluate the original, greatly more. Original cult and gold. This remake is awful.
