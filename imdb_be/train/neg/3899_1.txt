Where to start? For the title of this movie I was expecting some degree of certainty, in the end, I agree later. This is not a story or Lale Andersen Lili Marleen lyrics, and that Hollywood (or take your photographic film hub) story based on some real characters. I had the key, I heard a strong English accent gives an introduction to the film in German; blood red text (title, artist) was the second key. Story line is contrived (Lale was not deceived by the parent Switzerland Rolf Liebermann, then there is no information that Lieberman helped smuggle Jews out of Germany, the original song was recorded outside the NS control regime is not under control, the record played on the station was chosen in Vienna while the lieutenant was there on vacation, etc., etc.) suits poor and wrong for the time frame (SS black mold is used, where each of the guards staff positions, they have moved away from daily use, as soon as the war, and Mr. .d.) characters stereo type (SA lifts the club when they were mostly out of power). Do not waste your time.
