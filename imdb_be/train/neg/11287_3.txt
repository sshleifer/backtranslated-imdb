This is a film that had a lot to live down. from the year of its release of the legendary film critic Barry Norman believes this is the worst movie of the year, and I have heard nothing but bad things about this particular subject, which has been criticized for being too complex <br /> <br /> To be honest story something of a red herring, and the film suffers even more, if the word "land" is used, because as far as I can see, there is no plot as such. There's something involving Russian gangsters, a character by the name of Pete Thompson, who is trying to get his wife Sarah was pregnant, and an Irish guy called Sean. They all fit into something called a "story" I'm not sure. It is difficult to explain the stories Guy Ritchie movies, but if you watch any of his movies, I'm sure we can all agree that they all have one no matter how difficult they may seem at first view. Similarly, James Bond film, although the plot stretches from the scenes. You'll have serious problems judging RANCID Aluminum has any type of the central portion, which can be explained no doubt <br /> <br /> If you look at the list of the cast will ring bells enough warning as to what movie you watch. Ghanaian Frost appeared in some of the worst of British films made over the past 15 years, and it does nothing to become controversial. Steven Berkoff gives acting a bad name (and he plays a character named Kant, which sums up the wits of the film) at the time as one of the supporting characters played by presenter presumably because no serious actress will not be seen dead in this <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie, it's totally forgettable. I saw him a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long review critical warning people that they can afford for watching, but now I mostly forgot why. But it does not change the fact that I can remember, I dislike this piece of shit really
