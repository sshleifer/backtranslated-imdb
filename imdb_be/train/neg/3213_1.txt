Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time I felt the film that had literally no meat or a potato in it. The whole movie felt like it was just a salad, without the main course. The storyline was erroneous and ridiculous, the characters were one-dimensional, realism was out of the window and the animation was done by four-year-olds. Does that cover it? I've never been more embarrassed in my whole concept of life. I never read the comics or seen other programs with this character, but from the looks of the other reviews I am not against the base with my supervision. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the story moved too quickly. For someone new to this character and situation, I need more integrated in the creation of the causes rather than to find a solution. I've seen other anime (if you could call this an anime) that do great things with their characters, because they take time to develop them. There was nothing allocated for Lady Death. In just a few short scenes, we see her train with the arsonist, and instantly became so aggressive, she-beast hell. It was difficult for to swallow me, given the moments before it was introduced in this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father. Suddenly, it is immersed with hatred and can deal with the existence of which has been around for millions of years. It was absurd. Presentation of Lady Death was poor to say the least. I felt as if it was nothing more than an animated character, rather than a desperate woman with revenge on his mind. For me, it just does not work. It was no more than eye candy for prepubertal boys who want to see a massive amount of skin, she suddenly rose on her chest when training with an arsonist. Oh, I felt sick just watching her. The same applies to and the nature of the arsonist. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough, and instead I was left with a disjointed chatter than the actual development. This is a very sad day in hell, if we sacrifice the symbols to show more violence and action, especially in the cartoon. <br /> <br /> Then, there was Lucifer himself. Let me say that I think I could do battle with the king of hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was ridiculous, and it just did not represent the image that I had in my mind. It was as if Disney was in control and would like to make it gender-PC. He did not have the dark and corrupt character that embodies Lucifer. He was not a leader of hell, but instead just a lackey, that there were more places to live. Talking about life and death, how can you die again in hell? This concept, which is, of course, need more explanation. Most of the characters to worry about death, if they are not even considered the possibility that they were already dead. That is how they end up in hell. I think that this level of thinking that ruined the movie for me. I do not quite seize the idea that your soul was still in the solid state in hell, but that could just be me ?? or maybe it's because there has been no development in this story. There was nothing built, just getting ready. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were hysterically bad. Animation in this cartoon feel, as was done in the early '90s. There was nothing convincing about the fact that this film was made. Why do we, America, so on for animation? It's huge in Asia, and it creeps into hardcore here, because we continue to make films as Lady Death, who do not challenge or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap, and this film shows it. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was bad. Animation combined with a terrible voice work was cheap. I had head somewhere that the film, as well as in production for a long time, it is difficult to understand, because I think I could make this film on my credit card. Production was terrible, and history. Nothing has been developed, leaving a huge gaping plot hole that almost all fall into. The strength of the characters is not enough, and nothing was explained. I spent my time with this and would like to warn others, so that when death comes, you will not find yourself in my state and regret that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Class: * to *****
