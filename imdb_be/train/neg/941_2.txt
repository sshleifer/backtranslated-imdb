This movie is just plain bad. It's not even worth watching to make fun of him. Crazy Professor is just annoying. Even the suspension of disbelief to ensure invisibility (I glady make for good bad movies) and enables extremely stupid victims in a horror movie, this film asks more than that. If you are looking for women's locker room shower scene, and casual sexual encounters, getting porn, if you are looking for a good-bad movie, get something else. If you just want to spend time on annoying bad film, remove it.
