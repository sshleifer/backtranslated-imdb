I saw this movie last year in a class of media, and I must say that I really hated it. I was 10 years (and 15 years of age), so that may have something to do with it. But in English this year, 11 years, we had to read the animals and George Orwell. Apart from the fact that the book is based on the revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I hated it. <br /> <br /> But in 1984, I think it was the most exciting film I have ever seen, and I think that George Orwell was one of the most mentally ill people ever to live on this planet. I'm sorry to everyone who loves his work, but I, unfortunately, did not. Topics in the film draw well, but the way the whole movie was set, and the events that took place in it were not my standards. This is just my opinion, and I'm sure many, many others, thoroughly enjoyed this film.
