"Ask the Dust" look intriguing from the trailer, and we especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not convincing enough to be considered a drama, and it was not funny enough to be a comedy. It almost seemed to make fun of themselves, and not entertaining effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better, my wife and I went out, assessing not spending more time on such nonsense. It just was not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It seems that it was written, produced and directed at high school child; Even worse, it was a shameful waste of otherwise extremely talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
