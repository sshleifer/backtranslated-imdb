To sum up this film: No real story, the film consists of 80 minutes of mad characters or drinking or doing bad jokes. Music is just awful, humor is not funny, and all the female characters slutty idiots or just geeks. It seems to me that the film is actually a 14-year-old boy was written, who believes that a cool drink, a woman called to please men, and all that is opposed to this point of view techies. In addition, the film has nothing to do with the original American Pie films, apart from a few names and Mr. Lowenstein, who is a minor character in this. The only good thing about this movie is a nice looking girl. Do not watch this movie and not be fooled by the rating 5.4, because it is clearly overrated and does not deserve more than 2.
