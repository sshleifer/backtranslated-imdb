It is beautifully filmed and episode script was launched for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of 1950 to speak, but no one is left alone on the asteroid will not respond to over the years with such hysterical negative as a gift a female android. 2) It is not an android at all, but a woman, a beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of sex doll industry in the coming decades can trace its origins to date the episode, when they Â«d done properly. In fact, the modernization of sex-bots in the news, as I say. <br /> <br /> The robots were not new to cinema or television, when this episode was made, so that they could at least have her act as one, then added her fleshy terrible element. Instead, it becomes a beautiful love story about two people on the star. <br /> <br /> The Twilight Zone has always stretched the imagination and credulity. Usually, no one cared. But the episode seemed lame Calvinist morality aside, that would amount to masturbation with the machine or open negligence.
