While we were shooting, we were allowed to eat a few meals with staff and cast production. Mr. Nicholson was very memorable for the fact that one of the most ill-mannered people I've ever met. Quite a time, a young 20-year-old. But, of course, is not what student life was really like in the late 60's and early 70's, despite the fact that Hollywood may think. Trombone player from Oregon
