I do not know where to start, so I'll start with a fragment from the back cover of this film. "Live combines the power cube Vincenzo Natali with Kitamura own Versus.» I have not seen in comparison, so I can not comment, but I think that the cube was a great movie that I recommend to everyone. However, in this case, someone has obviously taken aback by "tension" with "anguish". <br /> <br /> I just go ahead and spoil the whole story, because apart from the fact that the saint Swiss cheese plot, it is also dried cheese, and the film is not worth wasting time on anyone, even if you do not advance the plot so that it does not matter. If I misunderstood the story, do not hit me - it's probably because I had to fight to keep their eyes open <br /> <br /> Thus, the US military in Nevada I once lost a UFO, Nambi desert .. it seems to make sense, because they are both desert, yes, of course, they are almost the same place. Different continents or not. Monkey broke into the UFO and the alien has acquired something which was adopted by the Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. Anything. An alien thing passed now, anyone who "bloodthirsty" enough to kill the current host. Japanese military wants to use it for military material, so they decided to do it to move from the current host (the researcher's daughter) in some other dude. But instead of simply select any of the soldiers, which is full of people, bloodthirsty and already on the side of the military, they have decided that it's probably a good idea to pick up some criminals to death row instead. Yes, and the reason why they choose this criminal from death, because he was the first person in history to die of the immortal defeat an electric current, which is the standard method of execution, because everyone dies from a placebo effect, when they get the electric chair, I do not know when they do it so that they can giggle in the staff as everyone dies, even if it is not fatal, or if they just want to reduce energy costs. <br /> <br /> Then the film turns into that Matrix would be if there was really lame, and excess struggle bored to tears for what feels like an hour. And oh wait, they now remember that they had a man who was infected with the alien thing, so the whole movie up to this point has been almost completely a waste of time and human lives. Then everyone dies. End. <br /> <br /> only one point in the film where I do not want to go to sleep or eat a sandwich instead, was when the dude was pinned to the wall with a pipe through his chest, and he was stuck there and another man walks. Man hanging on the wall says, "I am in pain, someone shot me." And alive man looks at him, and it's not like he was an average guy or anything, so it actually looks sorrowful and did not want the guy on the wall to suffer. Thus, he shoots him. <br /> <br /> (rhetorical pause.) <br /> <br /> The stomach. "Heap Gee thanks Freakin». "
