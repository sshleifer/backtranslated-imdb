I was subjected to this film for the class relationships in my school. As expected, it was nothing exciting and nothing new. While he is trying to be original, focusing on teen parents, and not the mother, showing the problem that the Pope will go to the end. It was an interesting side to it, but it just did not live up to its originality due to the fact, in this film was nothing original. We have a main character who has an older sister, who like in any other movie, as is the case against him, we have a stay at home mother who waits too much, and if he gives the more she feels offended and leaves it in the dust, it is the father who is always asleep. Girls there we have parents who want it all, and wait for it to be perfect at everything she does. In this story, as I said, it was interesting, but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of good writing or storytelling. All this fell into the clich√© little nerd child at school starts to be engaged to a woman, they get together, have sex, and then boom, we have a small child. Maybe it could have been better if the writing was well and would be better if the actor were improved, I got more serious emotions with leather and chain saw than I did with any actor in this film, and this is very bad What Leather see how shit movies and acted badly. Until now, the only interesting movie of teenage pregnancy I saw was Juno. Until now, the comic side of this grave situation has been more exciting at the same time giving the same message. As I said, that was the original idea, most of these films focus on the mother of teenagers, but this one does not chose instead to focus on the drama of the father, but again, originality does not save the film from mediocrity. I really hope that someone decides or re-make the film with the best cast and best writer or just to make another like the film because it is a wasted potential.
