I was waiting for this movie to play in anticipation. Assuming that it would be more accurately portrayed as a film, «The Christmas Box» based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent many letters to friends and family asking, please watch this show, hoping that they will better understand the small number of my "new" life. After watching this film, I was so disappointed. As a mother who has lost her only child in November 2003, and just knowing the pain, I was hoping that this film will shed some light on the father, who "think" that they understand the grief his father comes through who lost a child. This film was very light hearted and silly film Diane Keaton was a slap in the face of parents who buried the child. It was very surreal from start to stop. I've had several calls after the movie, every cause is the same, "It was so off the mark, and pretended that soon you are back on the road and listen to songs on the radio, and life is returning," What a bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton never lost a child, because no one would not have ever made a film to be so off the mark. I believe that this is Hollywood.
