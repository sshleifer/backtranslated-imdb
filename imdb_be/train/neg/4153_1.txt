I really do not know how to comment on the film. Special effects were dull, the effect was terrible, and if there was a conspiracy that is all that was on the back side of the box. I do not think I can think of a movie to be this bad in a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and fool !! ;) Even that could not save this movie from just a terrible reason to pay someone to stand (or lie in this case) in front of the camera <br /> <br /> I was pretty much summed up. the overall effect of "zombies." So, apparently, in this film, the zombies are so common, it is working on a couple here and there, and casually talk about it at a gas station (one with a windshield repair in the house, but no inner bathroom), the zombie movie genre ISN Â»don t even a factor until the end. Even a cameo dozen zombies ripping the clothes the girl is actually not a zombie movie <br /> <br /> On the vampire :. Apparently, all the male zombies and vampires floors woman, which is OK with me. I do not know how vampires during the day, or why / how from a vampire soldier began to stand in the middle of the road, still holding the gun with a stake through his heart, waiting for vampire queen to pour it all the way through. The last segment in the old convent was not any sense, and if one hot lesbian vampire asks another hot lesbian vampire "How do you think we did the right thing?" Killing two imaginary characters in the film that nearly put him over the top. <br /> <br /> Act and the special effects were at a record low, too. You can almost see the hoses that fake blood pumped out during a major zombie plan, which was hit a general. Speaking about the general, where they found this Kenny Rogers look-alike in any way? I do not know that he was a general in the direction, in general, is confusing and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> In general, do not watch the movie if you do not have anything better, or if you have a strong desire to spend $ 3. Just my $ 0.02.
