Watching this film was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks on rent in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, it will be the biggest regret of my life. Who had never even thought about this film, or funded deserves a kick between the legs, because there they were thinking when they made this movie. It is about an overweight person who is a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious nonsense that tries to give poetry. He joins his loving friend on a trip to the coast. Where they found the girl and such. Just fat young man does not get the girl. Skin clicks are not annoy me, I take it at face value. But this film is trying to be lighter skin movement. It is about Fat guy looking for love in some girl, but then meets another silicone bikini girl, who loves his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball, which receives money for his family and impress the ladies, but he's got a lady anyway. Dialogue super-afraid even a movie C. It supports tons of black stereotypes, no character development, it is famed porn film without any porn in it. Do not watch this movie.
