I have read all the "fold in" the book, and then I saw the movie. The film contained all the elements in the book, but the book has 190 pages and the film was 2:00, he felt really killed too many effects and bad acting. <br /> <br /> wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin must unite together to find her father and Meg escape from the island Camazotz. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film is really a bitch. Actions horrible, ridiculously direction, and still the situation is not necessary. I was really devastated, to see the same face of Madeleine Engle, he has written a book and made a film, did a great book and a scary movie. Action as well as any action on the video. Yes, I must admit that was cool effects. And if they do not seriously awful and serial in any way possible. If you read the book you will be crushed by the film. I wish he could give it a 0, but, unfortunately, I can only give it a 1. Half could be useful.
