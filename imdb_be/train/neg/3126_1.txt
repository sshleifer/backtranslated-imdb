Mr. VanHook took a good idea and feet like a soccer ball. Unfortunately, it did not end. Historical subject giants is good, but to pour into the Goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese. I say, take this drum circle and roll it off a cliff. I could not even watch the entire movie. That says a lot, because I rarely deviate from any film. I've always wanted to give them a chance at the last minute redemption. It is impossible to buy back something that's bad. Well, at least, the effect was good .... not! <br /> <br /> The only thing that "fall" in this film is rated. 1/10 and plunging into negative numbers!
