Despite the (in English) the name, it seems to have little to do with the devil, and many others, to make greedy manager who is looking for the philosopher stone in & wants gold, made of lead (and the blood of a virgin). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to be a slight problem with the presence of people killed when he thinks they threaten its position, or if it needs to be virgins for their blood. It is mainly warmed her lover and alchemist, that it works and is obliged to more greed and madness that seems to be his problem than the obsession with (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting as jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with a big stick, and the film at least has a good look at him, but otherwise little about it to recommend. Little in the way blood and fear nothing at all, and most unusual for Malin / Naschy film is not really any unintentional humor. Thus, 4 of 10.
