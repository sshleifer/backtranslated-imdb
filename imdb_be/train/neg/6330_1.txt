If you like the original SNL cast and the show, then avoid this movie at all costs. If the first out of my friends and I waited in line for over an hour to get into the sold out house cinema. halfway through the movie theater it was 3/4 empty. We refused to leave thinking that it will be better. When the movie ended, we were the only one left in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all the theaters and disappeared from sight. In an interview with "Mr. Mike" He declined to comment on the film. The film was a joke on SNL episodes that were released immediately after the release of the film and the closure within one day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by phone and email to obtain compensation, but were completely ignored.
