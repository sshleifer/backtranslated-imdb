How cool. Another film about America someone who has been here probably a dozen times a day a piece, and considers himself an "expert" around the country. Sheesh. I must take a trip to Germany for a week, then go back and make a film about Germany as "the land of the Nazis," or some such. Wim IL boy, you should get together with Lars von Trier and make ULTIMATE film about Americans. Of course, we all know that it takes a pretentious left "we peace" European make "real" film about America. <br /> <br /> Yeah, right. For a continent that started not one, but two world wars, Europe believes there are many opinions about the incorrect "foreign policy" of America. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not worry, Wim IL boy, there are many UC Berkeley Americans who just love the film. Of course, these are the same people who think that George Bush worse than Hitler, and that the picture of the banks' sheer genius "soup !!
