Somewhere in this film half-hour episode of the Dark Zone is trying to get out. While the Cube was a taut, well-done, claustrophobia and intelligence cooperation, I fear Cypher is bloated, tedious rehashing a few well-worn theme that just do not add to much, especially if you've seen almost any other halfway decent scientific fiction movie before. <br /> <br /> Cypher possible to drag the whole way through relatively short 95 minutes until the ending incompetent. None of the characters do not ignite each other, and for the film, shot in 2002, really bad technology. It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired film director with dice. This is not a bad film, but it's definitely not good. <br /> <br /> If you watched the grass grow and paint dry and sad your stick insects, then by all means watch this movie, but also other kinds of activity is likely to be more interesting.
