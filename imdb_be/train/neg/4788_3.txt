In the third recording fantasy series, Mike and Reggie continued to chase high people, with the assistance of a belligerent 9-year-old, black G.I. Jane and the spirit of the deceased brother Mike (who died in an original fantasy). Number 3 is a continuation of the rather disappointing, because blood and black comedy is much less inspiring and exciting, as it was in the fantasy II. I have a feeling that stress was just placed on the incompetence of Reggie as an amateur and his talent as a comedian. Humor in the previous film was a lot drier and depressed, which fits the story, as it is better. In addition, the options are not so gloomy here, plus the constant presence of Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious ?? There still is a lot of gore, but not twice as satisfying this time. By the way, watch out for highly abbreviated form, as he shows the most stunning murder of off-screen. The entire series of the Phantom of the lifetime achievement Coscarelli, who wrote and 4 episodes so far ?? fifth beings in production. The first of these is a semi-cult, the second holiday horror gore and violence, and the rest can be easily missed. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James Legros reflect his character much better in the fantasy II.
