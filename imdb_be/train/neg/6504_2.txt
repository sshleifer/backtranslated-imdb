Why do I spend 1.5 hours of my life watching it? Why this film even made? Why do I even comment on this movie? <br /> <br /> One reviewer said that this film took patience to watch and it's not for everyone. I can not understand who is this movie for. maybe after the fall of getting acid, should he, SOMEWHERE could watch it and make some sense out of it. It is incoherent, it is not experimental, it is clearly and simply trash. The film should not be no storyline at all, just when you think that there is something, well ..... not. <br /> <br /> I think that the end finally brought the film (no pun intended), the viewer gets an idea of ​​what might be happening. I do not think I put the spoiler here, not that it would be important. This film has to miss another filmdom in the world.
