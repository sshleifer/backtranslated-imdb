Of course, this happens in the West, but the name makes it seem as if it is a regular Western. Instead, it is a film female sheriff. Make no mistake, though this is a bad movie about a woman, Sheriff. It becomes sheriff, when her husband was shot; it is just a little bit upset about it. Its main goal is to go after the villain, who is also a woman, but a villain hired a guy to kill her. So this is what is happening, the hero falls in love with the killer, and vice versa. Utterly stupid as any killed in this film there is a new sheriff to thank. She was more than a couple of chances to put the killer behind bars, but I think, because she loved him, she would not do it. The killer also after the mayor of the city for personal reasons that are also quite stupid. This film is very boring and not really worth watching ... this is not one of the best episodes MST3000 they did. I can not imagine anyone seeing it without them, because that would make it much more painful. Corman is the director of low-budget, but even he should know better than those who go to one place and out the other.
