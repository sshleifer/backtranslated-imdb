This film is not as bad as most of the films Sci-Fi Channel. I used to see gray CGI clots and amateur special effects such as a large fake blood plan, which make it very clear that the blood of strawberry syrup, or some other variant syrup. Nevertheless, I thought I'd seen every possible lows that the Sci-Fi Channel may strike. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand in rubber socks glazed with syrup? These are the main Alien Vampires in the film. You can clearly see the fingers in a rubber sock puppets. Talking hand emerges from the bowels of the victims, and the vampires, who is on the team Vampire Hunter can talk to these dolls Rubber toe in Transylvania. Like Alien Vampires know Transylvania? And it is not Transylvania in Romania? So that they should not speak in Romanian? Why would any city, has its own language? If you can stop the gag reflex and go speak rubber socks with his fingers moving clearly in the minds of the natives; then you have to deal with other alien vampires. There are «Leatherfaces», who like to wear the face of their victims. Then there's just plain ugly that everyone seems to have a lot of scars on his face. Then there's the unfortunate Valley Girls and gentlemen, that human traitors and penetrate the space colony, so that they can sabotage protection, so that the space Vampires can attack. <br /> <br /> And finally, if you think all the above is funny and worth a laugh, you have to deal with the cast of the third speed network defective TVs that make up this team stereotypical angry characters who are constantly fighting among themselves. Why almost every movie Sci-Fi Channel is to use lead characters that annoy, humiliated, rough, or just completely nasty? I found myself hoping that speak rubber socks win.
