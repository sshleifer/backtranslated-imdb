This film is a confusing hodgepodge of clich√©s with recent movies. There are some promising ideas out there, but while the director is clearly trying to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film that he ended up with was a tangled mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job, but without the central theme seems to be that it does not have a lot of work. In addition, the film is largely devoid of panic (although, to be fair, there are some terrible moments on the background of monotonous). <br /> <br /> * Moderate SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> We are the mysterious death of the estranged twin devils of librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by wild monkeys, the oedipal conflict, abusive stepfather , sublimated homosexuality and gang crime connections. The only real commonality of these elements may be, it seems that they cause the main character, to express a vague sense of embarrassment and discontent. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is that, despite the death of his brother monkeys future heavily featured on the DVD cover, the act never painted directly. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be footage of monkeys. - not very scary <br /> <br /> * END spoilers * <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous tale of horror, check Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
