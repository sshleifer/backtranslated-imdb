I had high hopes for Troy, and I was so bitterly disappointed. The film was directed so much that made my stomach ache. Walking was so slow that the dialogue and funny film - well, apart from a good fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow <br /> <br /> And why, oh why. Hollywood has always insisted on rewriting history to conform to "the approval of consumers." Agamemnon died at Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris outside the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It annoys me that this classic story, as it turns into soap. <br /> <br /> And do not even get me started on the "no" chemistry between Elena and Paris. She was a woman, the war was fought over and did not even look as if the two of them cared much about the other. No spark, no emotion, no hope. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the protection of the movies Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O »Toole worked very well with a bad script, but this is not enough to keep this horrible film. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where the budget 200000000 £ went? Maybe in all the trees, which they used for the pyres - where they get all these trees <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed, that hurts.
