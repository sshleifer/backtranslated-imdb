The film was not a waste of some sad scenes in between.But woman thrown gave a pretty good show, than men who were laughable, except. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really rocked in the movie .Her voice was so seducing and sexy.The scene in bed with Kristen should be reduced, but it made it so watchable and sexier than either could on do.Krista this is actually one of the best in this roles.She also made quiet and the villain in the last 5 minutes, which is an interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not so good, and it was not his best as star.He actions could have chosen a better scenario than this.Ireally thinks he has done for the money.
