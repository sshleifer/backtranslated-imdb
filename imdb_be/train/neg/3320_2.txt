I honestly had some high expectations when I first started watching this movie, but it turned out that is probably one of the most boring films I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First of all, the pace is incredibly slow, so it seems much longer than it is (and it is not short) .I am sure that Jane Austen wrote the book, she did it a few pages long, filled it description, and people are not going to read in one day, or it can drag and lose the appeal, in which the "Emma", certainly did. Now, "Sense and Sensibility" had this defect at a slow pace, but at least it was a busy line, to do for him, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> This brings me to the flaw # 2, which, of course, acting. While I do not go to take care of basically anyone who is involved in this film, I am sure that they are capable of good work, but I have not seen a lot of it in this film. It was like people are trying too hard to be witty, too hard to be "high-end" too hard to be British (well, some of them), so they just come off as a bunch of actors, not as people ,. <br /> <br /> # 3. Toss, as I said, it seemed, only the actors, but not really like the people they were playing. Maybe it's good, because the people they played really not all that good. Why does everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Of course, she was pleasantly rich, beautiful people in front of them, but it was awful gossip behind their backs. If her friends were "ugly", it does not even bother to follow behind them. So, why this girl is so great? Why should people tell stories, "just to make her laugh?" Of course snob could not even do that right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow, Gwyneth Paltrow and her "Emma" just do not change their minds. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I did not like it. I'm sure this is a great book, and all, but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
