Let me start this review by saying I love vampire movies. They can suck (har har pun) and I still love them, because vampires are just cool in the movie. Van Helsing is considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap, it was enjoyable for me because of the fact that there were vampires. You may ask: "What's that have to do with this film?" The answer is that I am going to tell you about how awful this film really is, that even the sucker (harharhar) for a vampire movie, how do I despise film as it so much. <br /> <br /> film stars Van Helsing, a professor of college guy that is not very convincing. He's a terrible actor, like everything else in this film, and he wrote, to add insult to injury. I sincerely do not want to hurt him, and I'm sure it was fun to do this movie, but watching it was actually hurt. I do not know why I watched the whole thing; perhaps it was a morbid fascination, like watching a train crash is coming: it's terrible, but you can not manage to make myself look away. Its main error is that it's just so **** ING boring, and its plot is so damn funny, even for science fiction horror film. <br /> <br /> But, I digress. By the way, Van Helsing has sex with his mother. Of course, he does not know what it is at the time; he just thinks it's one of his students (which is still illegal and all, but not as nasty and horrible). <br /> <br /> If I was Van Helsing, I would at least pull Oedipus himself, when I found out, I did something so gross. This would be done for one entertaining things when he had just made some comments on it, but no. It is not even brought up at all, any of the characters. It's as if the writer did not even think about it. I would have at least had some character to laugh at him and say, "Ha ha, you've had sex with my mother," which is mildly humorous (although obviously immature). I probably do not have enough space, so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seen the film have a vampire ninja fight with the old. It would be funny, but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. It's not even worth it to watch the film to see how bad it is. Stay far, far away from it, if you value your time at all <br /> <br /> I will say one thing positive about the film :. The guy who plays Van Helsing is fairly smooth with this his knife. There's like, a minute long segment, where it swings around a knife and actually make some pretty nifty tricks. It would be sad in any other movie, but then, unfortunately, it was an event.
