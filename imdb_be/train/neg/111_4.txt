My interest in the Dorothy Stratten made me buy this video. Despite the fact that there were great actors / actresses, there were too many storylines going to maintain interest. In addition, he simply was not interested. Dialogue was a tough and confusing and the story just flips around too much, to be truthful. I was very disappointed that I believe was one of the last movies with Audrey Hepburn. I will always love John Ritter best a farce. He was too miserable here.
