I thought that they had to call the film "White" instead of "height". Godawful ... the kind of film that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so obsessed with themselves and think that their life is so important ... give me a break. This lily white cast that Glenn Close was the ethnic character of it, this film calls for someone real to come and steal it ... so they bring in, get this character even whiter than the rest of the cast (I I thought he was an albino on the ground), which is to be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher the accent! Intellectually dishonest ... this film is a kind of film that is able to deceive so many people into thinking that it's worth it, because it has the attributes of something more ambitious. It is better to fill the theaters of MI5-10, than this pretentious crap ... must have been better to play, because you can not fall to the floor.
