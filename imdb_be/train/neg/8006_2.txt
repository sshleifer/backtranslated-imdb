What this movie does well is to combine action and horror to comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion audience form than the typical horror movie. Unfortunately, incoherent speaking, frustrated the plot-holes and contradictory scenes of this film, mainly made me frustrated, and are unlikely to "the greatest monster movie ever.» <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the get-go, the film begins a fast pace and daring. The first stage - the origin of the monster - it's old-fashioned and quickly, paying homage to the classic "environmental" catastrophe that gave birth to so many other monsters. Walk quickly, which was a welcome break from a long and often aimlessly dramatic opening scene of the other clicks monsters and allows the film to jump right into the action. C. for 10 minutes, you get the "why", "where" and "how" the beast, and ready for action. This film provides <br /> <br /> After another short and well-shot sequence of characters entered :. lazy son and his precocious little girl, a good grandfather, and talented sister (aunt) and, of course, a monster. Characters are entered in the context of each other and their conflicts once it is clear that allows the audience to feel for them when the monster suddenly appears to wreak havoc in the area of ​​the river, where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster is he looks great: an alien yet familiar - kind of like a dog and a fish bulging through squid. Effects creatures are second to none, and although it looks weird is plausible and at any point in the film you could "see a string. Even the monster movement was awfully familiar, how to grow excited and rottweiler on the linoleum monster barrel through the crowd, slipping on surface grinding and there are those in its path. If a monster road intersects with the family and the tragedy comes this really painful time, and you may feel the need for revenge, and from there to the appeal of the film begins to unravel. <br /> <br / > After the start of dynamite film quickly loses focus and b sperapynnasts. Storylines introduced and then abandoned, the characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy are intertwined in dramatic scenes confusing intentions, while the obstacles appear and disappear seemingly randomly. <br /> <br /> as for the comedy that, let me say, I am ready to admit that a lot of humor, probably cultural'm not familiar with Korean humor so maybe it was lost in translation.. However, as Asian studies in college, and as someone who has lived in Japan for the last 5 years (still here) I'd like to think that I am better grasp of the Asian humor than the average white guy . It said there were many parts of the movie that I realized had to be funny, but it was not for me. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example, after the first attack, where a young daughter lost family is in the funeral; every mourning. A new character is introduced - a brother - and the tension rises even higher, it becomes apparent that the two brothers are at odds with each other. They both begin to grieve for their loss and the wind compete with each other for who laments difficult. This competition, in this nucleus, funny: two brothers who do not like each other so much that they even compete at the funeral - it shows the character of family love scratchy common in Asian comedy. This subtle slap-shelf comedy ridicule of family and ritual mourning supposed to be funny, but it seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then there are the plot holes. There are so many points raised in this film that are never explained, or, even worse, are explained and carved over only prove impotent and meaningless in the end. Detection of obstacles is not an obstacle can be a good thing for the character, but you would expect some comments on this nature. Instead, the audience threw moments of anti-climax when the problems are simply "not there" anymore, and no one gives an idea of ​​what ever was a problem to start. So I ask you: why even bring it up in the first place? <br /> <br /> It was spread through the film, as the problems have generated new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces, which are not addressed each other. Of course, the introduction of new and big challenges is time-tested story telling tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads to a forced reduction in other one would expect, at least, that a new arc is a full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead it was as if you get a few stories, each only explained 20% of the way and in the end, the details do not add up to complete the whole. <br /> <br /> Again, I am ready to admit that a lot of it can be "cultural". Maybe its in Korean tradition speaker Building put comedy in tragedy. Maybe this is normal for stories to go around as a child, color outside the lines on each page, but never finishes one. Maybe it is normal to present the problem in order to develop the plot, but then remove the problem at random without any obvious solutions or catharsis. Or, perhaps, all these signs of an untidy work and a bad history of runaway in the film, which seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
