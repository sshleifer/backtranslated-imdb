Well, no, not really. It's not a very good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I really did not feel ripped off of my rent money, and sometimes that's all you can ask. The plot is in order, nothing brilliant, new or acting very bad, but rather throw. The guide is passable, but the consequences are terrible, especially the werewolf effects that a werewolf movie is quite a big problem. There was quite a decent amount of nudity, this is a very good thing, but it was not all that hot for me. In general, it is pretty average straight to video movie, and not the worst film I've ever seen, and if you are unfortunate genre fan, check it out ever. I even watch it again. <br /> <br /> Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Voorhees in some of them) plays werewolf.
