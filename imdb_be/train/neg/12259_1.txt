The film is about a bunch of some filmmakers who want to make a documentary about a new form of surfing in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of the movie, including a vicious animal or a monster, I thought it could be my kind of movie ... it was not !!! This should be more guidance on how to do this! She has a lot of random humor in it, nor any ravenous beast incredible joke, in the final scene, she goes after the main characters * * rolling, legs, obviously, waving in the air! It looks ridiculous! Good for a laugh though. If it was only because of the lack of talent between the actors, infamously silly dialogues and funny silly crocodile, it would be at least worth a laugh, but it's even worse: I think that the people responsible for this film to see how it was weak , so they though to the old idea of ​​"sex sells" ... it is, I mean ALL, without any reason, one of the main actresses reveals her animal's chest. And somewhere to the beginning there is some meaningless "passionately". This is the last ingredient makes the movie absolute rubbish to me. It's incredible how people actually spend time in the production of such garbage! If you are looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie !!!
