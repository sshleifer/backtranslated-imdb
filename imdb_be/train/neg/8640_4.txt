3/4 I watched this movie, and asks why he received such awful reviews here. It was pretty easy to observe (at 3 am). It was a good casting - the role of Kevin Dillon sociopathic serial killer was very believable - it was like charasmatic and scary. The rest of the main characters was not so bad. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / suspense movie. The couple can not conceive, so they go to the infertility clinic for help. Sociopath "genetic material" donor records on recipients and, in the typical form of a stalker, breaks into their lives. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the film was pretty good .. we see, "Conan" are growing more and more obsessed in raising their child and create the perfect family with a mother. Of course, things do not work out as he had planned for him. Not a bad storyline. <br /> <br /> But, in the last 15 minutes were just awful. I'm pretty tolerant of films (especially at 3 am!) .. but, I was just amazed at how bad it was written the ending. I actually mocked the heat died down! <br /> <br /> In general, not the worst film I've seen, but I could not sit through it again (unless I missed the ending). The only quality redeaming here was the role of Kevin Dillon - - one of the best serial killers ever <br /> <br /> Try looking on other channels before watching it .. But if nothing better is not lit, I would. give it a try .. =)
