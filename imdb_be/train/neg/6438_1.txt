I really do not know what this film was about when I went to the theater to see it (the hype about Satanism, etc., etc., etc.), as the trailers in the last film I saw It looked quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, the Roman Catholic mythology? Not my idea of ​​a good fright, and honestly, I just felt like watching a really good horror movie, not some conspiracy of free religious farce, which is trying to score cheap thrills, with some chick getting fucking every few minutes! <br /> <br /> I'll try to stay away from the spoiler (!), but I found it very strange that an atheist who receives a string of rosary deceased priest, can suddenly be Christ's wounds (stigmata are not alleged to be deeply religious ??) I mean, it hangs from the losers, not the one who lost the material behaves like a typical rebel, etc., and here it shows the wounds of Jesus Christ ?? Come on! <br /> <br /> The scenes of her crucified, his head thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, it has become quite tiresome to see him ten times. It was not a terrible or scary, just off-putting. It was, however, was quite painful to watch - that flicking the scene was very annoying ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If a Catholic, defintly not see it. If it is not, I have not yet been seen.
