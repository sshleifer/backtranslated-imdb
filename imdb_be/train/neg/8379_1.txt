Like some other reviewers have mentioned, I would like to know what really MORON read the script and went "," Yes !!! This is it. This is the next film we'll be the green light !! "And whoever this person is, You must have his or her head examined the actual activity of the brain. Because the one who is responsible for actually Dishing money that is done after reading the script, well, I would like to give you their email address, and perhaps you would simply like to give more money. This movie is disgusting in every way. <br /> <br /> The Wayans funny, at least they can be. They made some good films and there were some incredibly funny performance in this way. But here, not only a prerequisite defies all logic and not just acting scared, not only the whole movie is offensive from the beginning to the end, not only the direction, as an amateur, as you can find, but they really want you to pay to see this movie. Maybe if it was free ... naaah, it would still be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Normally I would be inclined to write some long winded, detailed overview of why this film is so bad, but just enough to say that brevity let my do the talking. This is the lowest common denominator of film-making, and it's about how unfunny as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0 / 10..makes my top ten worst films of all time!
