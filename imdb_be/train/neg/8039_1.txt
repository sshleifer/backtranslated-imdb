This is a meaningless piece of shit movie and sad as a house full of repetition. For all people who want to see a big, exciting and cool horror movie should not even think about watching this pile of meaningless work. F- in my opinion. I have one question, what were they thinking? Let's make a list: 1) bad scenario 2) bad scenario 3) bad scenario 4) bad game 5) bad directing and last but not least, a bad script. I mean, I do not like grumping about each film, but I was disappointed when I watched it. This film should be banned in the drawer closed and fell into the sea. Therefore, please do not do something like that again, please, please, please !!!!
