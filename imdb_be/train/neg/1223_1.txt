What a weekend. Two days ago, I watched the first half of "War Games 2: The Dead Code" now "While she was with." I'm trying to come to a decision, which one was the worst in terms of the pain in my head while watching. I think, "While she was with" was worse <br /> <br /> It's all been said before in other comments :. unrealistic, illogical, and so on - the only thing that I really need to add that at some point I started to feel more for evil men than for women, because I would have recommended her for the award of Darwin, if she really died (only watched the first half, so I do not know). Soon I was in two Darwin awards (if at all) for her immense stupidity <br /> <br /> And, hey :. Made Kim Besinzher? Thus, not only does it know but the script was also responsible for the fact it's a waste of money for us, the people? I think people who spend significant amounts of money to be evil, because money could be used to feed and clothe a lot of people, instead of wounding 80 percent of those who saw it in a movie and give 20 per cent of which are morons, a good opportunity to show how they are an idiot.
