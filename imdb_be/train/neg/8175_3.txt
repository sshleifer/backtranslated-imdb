The mood of the film is quite good, and it captures the feeling of the 80s and with some good performances. <br /> <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The script is run with the mill except for a few comedic moments and comes off as a country where I would expect that it had to be stretched. Symbols completely over dramatized and incredibly full and right-wing clich√©s that script probably seen watching a panoramic documentary about the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie has no real history. He represents all the right "artistic" box, but nothing really happens, and in the end you are left wondering what it was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
