Ultimately, too stupid and pointless. Yes there is a gilded cage metaphor, but probably most children will not miss it. Forgotten. Instantly. <br /> <br /> The animation, as we have come to expect, super-real. Plot line can best be described as a thin but tenacious. Although the ending seems arbitrary to me. <br /> <br /> sewer underworld is suitable disgusting reflection of the world above, and, anyway, wealth, and money seems to count for a lot in there. Oh yeah, and there's a romantic interest with the women to be more intelligent, savvy and penetration of steam - this in itself is quickly becoming tedious (anti) stereotype. Perhaps your kids will love it, though.
