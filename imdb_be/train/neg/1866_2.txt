Cheap exploitation film about a mother's search for her daughter, who was kidnapped by people who make pornographic movies Snuff. The trail is the mother of all of Europe, as she searches for her child, and we have to fight the audience to sleep. <br /> <br /> This is one of the many soft core Sleaze movies that are made for people who want the excitement of porn because of the stigma and danger of his show on my credit card bill.Personally I would like to have a stigma, since these films They tend to be more interesting and honest about what we see. This is suppose to be a sexual thriller, but it is not. Basically it people talk about and then a lot of walking from place to place and lead to lead.Periodically through the film of different people, to undress and all my more than S & M touching the case. Material violence and fetish like to provoke laughter rather than fear or excitement, it all so incredibly fake. The worst poverty is not even enough to keep it interesting. (Mainly in the order of things for a lot of these films) <br /> <br /> You will forgive my lack of details, but it's just boring boring film that I was left with the end in the hope that something vaguely prurient happen, but there was nothing . The most interesting thing that has blonde hair thief with a huge bite on the nose and the size of a Buick. I watched her with painful delight wondered what she looked like a young girl, and I wonder if it was done plastic surgery, not the type of things you need to think about in an exciting thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
