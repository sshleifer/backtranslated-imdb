I felt, Rancid Aluminum was a waste of two hours, the story line was thin and confusing line of prestigious players had some terrible dialogue, and very doubtful accents. The camera work was somewhat experimental in places, and although it was evident that the director is trying to convey, it just made it even more difficult to watch. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the use of a narration throughout the film's almost like the whole plot is imposed audience. The best performances were nothing to do with the current. In fact, probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr all people, though admittedly plays a stereotypical office secretary. DO NOT under any circumstances, go and see this movie if you do not need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned money.
