I do not know what they were thinking.by they, I mean anyone even remotely related disaster.i've seen so bad movies I've seen, so it is really bad movies and then there I this.but I will say one thing.whoever wrote experienced to deliver what is arguably the most inane dialogue overwritten on screen.there there is nothing good in this film, from a technical point of view or any other standpoint.whoever allowed him to do, and then released were fired immediately.there some pretty well-known names in this movie.actually I Sar I use the word movie.it more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to the other and make less than 0 sense.anyway, I do not see why anyone with any dignity appears in this.I got it very cheap, and I still was frustrated of.even, when I got this movie for free, I would still have been torn off.this is absoluter 0/10
