It is overpriced, the series are short-lived (a measly two seasons) on an experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. I'm not quite sure what they mean by "innovative" and "original", when they are pleasuring all Lynch and his silly TV opus. What is their criteria for what is an original? Of course, compared with the "Bill Cosby Show" or «Hill Street Blues» is original. Determined. Next to the "Law & Order» TP spewing originality of the left and right. <br /> <br /> Supporters TP is often said that the show was canceled because too many spectators were not smart enough, open enough for the alleged "strange show," his alleged wild inventiveness, or any other. As a supporter of the quirks myself, I have to correct this error. There's nothing too off-the-wall systems; it's just watchable, rather silly detective story that goes around in circles, spinning webs in every corner, but (or because of it), ultimately nowhere. The apparent strangeness is always forced; the characters do not behave strangely just like they behave in a stupid way half the time. There's a difference ... <br /> <br /> Every time I look at the "strange dream" sequence in the «Living In Oblivion», where the Gnome criticizes director (Bush) for succumbing to the old tired, let consumer and -midget -in-the dream of a cliché scene, I think Lynch. You want weird? «Eraserhead» is strange - in fact, this strange, it is mainly abstract. You want a unique TV show? "The Prisoner" clock. Do you want an amazing view of the actors? Felini-Leon's and movies offer this. TP looks overly outlined TV crime drama in which all young people look like mannequins. The cast gives TP plastic appearance. Kens & Barbies groups. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the manufacturers of injection molding machines said that Lynch is looking for "unique person" for the series. Unique personality? Lara Flynn Boyle? Sheryll Fenn? As the feminine face "miser" right out of the men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Do not get me wrong; There is nothing wrong in getting an attractive shade, especially beautiful women like Fenn (as Madonna would look like if it were 1000 times more beautiful), but does not go around saying you're doing "an amazing show with fantastic-looking people." And I have never understood the fascination misinform Lynch Kyle MAKLAKLANOM (I should get a medal for the trouble to spell his name right). He was not unpleasant, but lacks charisma, seeming a bit too soft and polished. ridiculous "strangeness" of his character were not interested in only one of the many attempts to get Lynch weirdness struggled to justify his reputation - he was being completely lost the edge, but at the time. Mark Lynch made a post "The Elephant Man" was very sub-par compared to his first two films. This was followed by often mediocre efforts, which rely on a relatively small but fanatical supporters Lynch to keep him in the public eye by interpreting the meaning of his badly put-together stories that do not hold water on closer examination. In other words, Lynch favorite each IP in Wannabe. <br /> <br /> So, Laura Palmer was killed by his father ...? He was possessed by the devil or some such nonsense. This is the best is the "big reason" could think of ... You have a horror B-movies that end with great originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch is neither bright nor hardworking enough to come up with a fascinating history. <br /> <br /> By http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and check out my "TV and cinema: 150 worst case of nepotism" list.
