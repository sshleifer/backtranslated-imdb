Unlike most of the other comments about the "Syriana" on the website IMDb, my family and I found this movie to watch on a DVD at home waste of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a film on which the scenario writer was far too clever. Rather than tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear, it is assumed that all the time throwing mostly vague and difficult to relate to each other 30-second vignettes of different storylines of the dozen "storylines" in the audience aroused great interest and a clear image. No, sir, it is not. What makes for a great view is a total clarity, precision, plots and storylines - and characterization. - which have a beginning, a middle and an end <br /> <br /> This type of cinematic representations - seem dim sum experience in a Chinese restaurant. - pretentious and foolish in the extreme <br /> <br /> Thank goodness, then, for televisions and a DVD-presentations of Hollywood and British film noir of the 1940s and 1950s, whose authors, the director and the actors knew the value of clear communication history, diction and actions that mean something. <br /> <br /> This is one DVD, this family will not have to sit through again.
