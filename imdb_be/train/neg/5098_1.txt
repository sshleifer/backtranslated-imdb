This should be one of the best overvalued anima show ever made. And yes, I even showed "The End of Evangelion", and so far I hate him even more. Not to mention the countless rip-offs of the show! <br /> <br /> I do not mind, psychological and philosophical untertones, but Evangelion pulls him into the dirt like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones who seemed to be interested in was Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. In addition, substantially all of the others were a bunch of crybaby whiny losers. They have to go to psyciatric Center, Sun piloting giant robots against the aliens, called «Angels». <br /> <br /> Even bags and battle alien does not help at all. It goes something like this: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are robots, and they are really great because they bleed, they hurt, but they are not actually mechanically, but angels are captured, so sometimes (!), they go crazy and do what they want to minors pilots, and they must be better control ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I just I can not recommend any Evangelion anime otaku or not. For those who like this series very much, great, you have a right to their opinion, I respect you. But thoses, having "out of your mind" obsession to think that everyone will love this series, you're more selfish. <br /> <br /> I prefer «Macross», «Mospeada», «Run -dim» and «Robot Taekwon V" himself.
