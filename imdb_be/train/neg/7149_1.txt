Whoever wrote «Redline» as a large car film should be getting paid off Daniel Sadek promote this ultra crappy Flaming, steaming pile of shit amateur. Easily the worst road movie or any movie ever made. This makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take every cheesy cliche from the series 80th of action put in some really bad special effects and lame characters, which are not relevant, and you have living proof that Daniel Sadek does not have to write scripts and produce films, but must remain in real estate. <br /> <br /> It's a lame movie with such a lame story and the most far-fetched action sequences ever. What offends me is not what the makers of this film are idiots, but they believe the film publicity idiot enough to fall for this shit.
