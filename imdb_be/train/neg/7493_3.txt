I could not believe my eyes when I looked at the Nuremberg yesterday Dutch television. It starts very slowly, Nuremberg backgrounds became clear, step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but then, suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, the audience gets to see the most shocking, horrific images I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very important for people to see such footage (although I do not agree with the people that there is no minimum age at which children may be exposed to this type of material), but in this film he was completely out of place. It was purely designed to improve the impact of conventional television series. This was to shock the audience, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move us to the well-done stage, inspiring a dialogue or an interesting point of view years, the audience is attempting to horrific images of the skin-and-bone camp. He did not show any respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I am very angry.
