Absolutely the worst film yet Burton, who seems to be getting worse with every film he manages. Pathetic scenario, loaded with cliches only the first of many undesirable aspects of the film. This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout, "he lost his gun!" Or something to let everyone know. Carter really awful and so Wahlberg, who can not play it right and be convincing. Very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the form of John Williams Burton protege Elfman. Heston appears nonsensichal scene spout of his most famous catch-phrase from the first film. Very poor results. <br /> <br /> If someone is there, too, saw the "Sleepy Hollow", they probably noticed, as I do, reducing the quality of films Burton. I heard that this project has been prepared and others that Burton was brought in as a director, in this case, his decision should be doubted. But I think that he allowed any prospective vision that he could be at the beginning of his career, to escape; there is evidence in the films. In "Sleepy Hollow", he could not decide which movie he did was a comedy or a real horror film, and the population of British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) made you think, too, that this was the kind of movie monster rally (those never scary as a horror supporters know). The film can not succeed in any horror or comedy, because it was so schizophrenic, and the style was not designed to smooth out together. "Planet monkeys" is almost the same manner, and the result comes off a «Total Recall» or «Tango and Cash", rather than as a science fiction. He also got into a rut of many other "large" directors are trying to meet all possible audience. Word Burton, when you get there - pick something and do it right, or use some kind of style peice together (as in "Mars Attacks" or "Bitlzhus"), or you might as well leave because people like me that supporters your stop motion movie.
