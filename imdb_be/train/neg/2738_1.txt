Garbage / bad films, usually it's not bad, because I find them enjoyable. This one is so bad that I'm out of words to describe it - it below the "bad." There are instructions in the beginning of the film, which tells you what to do during the film. Needless to say, a beer and a dozen training can help me place throughout the film. One tagliner compares each KillBill, which, of course, unthinkable and insulting our intelligent. Obviously. tagliner it had a plan to lure you into buying this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting it, put it down! If you are thinking of buying, not thinking! If you are lucky enough to have this DVD, do not play it, throw it in the trash immediately.
