Is not it fun when the average Schmo leading miserable life suddenly there is something defiantly magic to happen to him, turning his life upside down and forcing him to learn some valuable lessons along the way? This formula never gets old, does not it? This is a sure way to make a classic movie! Just look at the major hits like Liar Liar, and more ... This should be a line of Rob Schneider's thinking when he made the semi-successful Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and secure it with the animal. Since I have followed the story through sarcasm, let me color it any more: Schneider plays a loser cop who suddenly involved in a tragic accident, but maintained the operation ... for a loop veterinarian who loads it with parts of animals, forcing him to neigh like a horse at the wrong time, run like a cheetah, etc. this film is a bit more likable than others Schneider starred clicks (for example, another lame same subject tracking The Hot Chick), but it almost feels like they want to make the audience hate him casting reality TV star as the romantic lead (Colleen Haskell with "Lost") and inserting a cameo Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. Sorry - nothing memorable good, other than the cost of production. I just want to finish this review by saying that the minor references to other movies in the movie can be good, but when it comes to the line delivered in the same way ( "You can do it!") There is a word for this - "milking . "In fact, here is another word -" cheap ".
