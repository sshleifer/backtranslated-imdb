Che's charisma and appearance have a lot in common with its fine growth as the misinformation that was spread propaganda of the Left (eg, the film) of his <br /> <br /> I do not know what's worse :. capture of one of the murder-squads Che or having to sit after 4 hours, as a rule, Soderberghian debris. The question is not why this animal project was done, but what took them so long. By "they" I mean, of course, left Hollywood and his "secret" love Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... take your pick). I'm fascinated by what took decades for one of the least talented directors of the Tinseltown liberal, to finally take on such a compelling biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan flour? George Clooney Barbra Streisand even? It's a mystery. All these inflated "artists" are often indulging yourself in such politically unilateral projects, but somehow Che Guevara, who is arguably the most popular and well-known communist, was not the subject of the film have yet. <, Br /> <br /> «Partizan" has all the hallmarks of American truth bending stories of epic proportions; eat as much as the actual item can be found here, as in other similar Hollywood mnogobyuzhetnom political fabulous bios, such as «Malcolm X» or «Gandhi», that is, almost none. Del Toro's movie star as the famous Argentine revolutionary. Nevertheless, however controversial and criminal acts of this man may be, one thing that no one could take away from him: he was a clever manipulator, who came from a wealthy family - because Del Toro fits the bill only visually. Del Toro can be exciting, charismatic actor, and he can physically resemble Guevara, but it neither emits nor intellectual qualities at all, so it makes Guevara comes off as too primitive. Casting such mediocrities as Bratt, Philips and Franka Incompetente only emphasizes the absence of the director's judgment. <br /> <br /> The film is in most of the very slow (no surprise there), and visually uninteresting. Even the director as great as if Kubrick carefully designed to release a film that goes beyond the 3-hour mark, so it is very significant that this Soderberg, who only made one or two hard film and at an early stage of his career, will think that it was the immensity of Oceanic to task. If you think the length of the film indicates that a large part of the life of Che has been shown here - then think again. Soderbergh focuses on the last stage of Che, and a lot of the film tedious jungle nonsense, full of idealism, supposedly Guevara. (Psychopaths have no ideals.) I am wondering which of the mind that it is a very respected director should have actually ignore some of the past life of Che. Had he really thought he was too uninteresting? Massacre of 600 people has no interest for the viewer, as well? Strange. Some are much better than the directors of the excessive boasting charlatan easily accommodate not one but two complete biographies in the 4-hour movie. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh, in a sense, becomes an accomplice, never resorting to negative, darker side - which is more than 90% - with Guevara. Spreading this kind of historical inaccuracies, deliberately ignoring the brutal truth (God forbid he should ruin the holy image of Che), Soderbergh is itself not a humanist - a false image that the majority of Hollywood and pop music people fight very hard for all their support career - but on the contrary: he cares only about ideas, never about the people, which tested these ideas (for example, on the guinea pig). Soderbergh and the like elitists of the worst kind; Such people often have a latent contempt for «proleteriat» (what a stupid term) they allegedly siding with. <br /> <br /> Half of all students across the world wear the figure of Che on the red and orange T-shirts, but not knowing why. He became a cult figure for the ignorant, uninformed, often young people, who think that having that person's face, chest, something makes them "sharp", intelligent, hip or exciting. In fact, wearing the shirt of Che only underlines its total surface and total lack of interest in self-education. (Do not you want to learn more about the person before you start to advertise his / her face to the world?) Wearing a Che is now a cliché image has become as common as a cup of coffee with Bart Simpson. All these "Che-wear" probably know more about Marge blue hair than they have ever read on the dead ally Fidel Castro. <br /> <br /> After all, that would have been done in the name of Marx, one seemingly nondescript these "ideals" will finally be buried. It seems that humanity will never know. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, the Iron Curtain, a hundred million people, destroyed more than a billion are physically and / or mentally through this system ... so it all does not matter, eh? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro won the Cannes award should surprise only those who are absolutely clueless as Cannes and other European festivals work - and the voice.
