This silent comedy really does a good job wasted comedic talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman abuse is bad here. I might have chuckled once or twice in the course of this film, but in general, it is a boring film with a little silly, thrown in for good measure. The premise, although the procedure so far was not bad, but after a site has been selected, the film did not go anywhere. Do not waste your time with this misfire.
