Well ... it was fun to watch the movie. The main problem with this film is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths perform. Like vampires, who are in the sunlight. Although there are parts that just do you like the way society makes movies. The scene where a vampire gets stabbed yelling "Ay it hurts ... It's really late." Then it seems that there can be no scene, but you get used to after a while. And there are occasional sequenes dreams that really do not help with the plot. Think about it, nothing really does not make sense, but I just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Think about this fight scenes were aweful, and the zombie was just fun to watch. Slowly, as I write more about this I like this movie more. But you know, in the end, you can not expect Schindler's List, but its fun to watch.
