There is not enough gay-themed films and not enough `go 'films. Each of them is a welcome addition to the genre. Although high production values ​​(the film 'looks good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks really good in a pair of jeans) is the bad one. This is a period piece: gay life under the repressive regime (East Berlin, 1989), a life that seems to be 40 years for the sunset. In a sense, we are seeing our own history; it can be as gay in the 40s and 50s here (he often reminded me of the `Last Exit to Brooklyn: the book is not a film) .But it continually oppresses and SLOW contrived in a way that caused the old SCTV send to Ingmar Bergman. It is so sloppily edited Interestingly, when the director is not just chopped at random. Yes, it's a miracle that it was filmed and released to The Wall came down and let life behind the curtain 'was difficult for gays. Good director could show all that without stupefying audience. A good director would have me say this as one of the great films of Becoming, and not one of the misses.
