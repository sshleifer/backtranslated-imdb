I want so much to give this piece of garbage zero, unfortunately not, so I had to give him one time to warn you about how stupid this is terrible imposter familiar cartoon really! The characters look like they were painted preschoolers, no, wait, I've seen better, preschoolers! I prefer "Misadventures of FlapjackÂ» to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I'd probably say that others have said two words: RIP OFF !! Remember that episode of Dexter's Laboratory, where they raced down the cards that volcano? Yes, Mr. Fellows even cashed in on this idea and failed! They even tore Shadow Lugia in that one episode that parodied pokemon! (He even cashed in on this franchise!) That one character is a cheap rip off Mandark Laboratory Dexter! Mr. Fellows should be sued for violation of the law for that piece of shit !! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who love Johnny (RIP-OFF) Test, your'e just lay yourself. Do yourself a favor, change the channel if it is trying to rip off the screen to shame!
