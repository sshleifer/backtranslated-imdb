Wow, that would be such a good film, begins with Brittany Daniels unions, Im thinking, cool, we're going to get a flash back, but nothing, the film begins anew with the baby pictures. This movie, it would probably be better if it was not for the action. I mean the action was mostly awful .. Although lines poor actors had to deal with, I guess they did everything they could..Still it really ruin the movie for me .. the twins were the only ones who seem to have some acting skills .. the movie drags a long time for an alleged shocking conclusion .. in general, I've seen worse than a low budget movie, but considering that it is the hype with 8 films to die, I was very disappointed .. By the way, I have made some observers say there was blood and stuff. I saw the same film .. Well it 4 out of eight, and until now only one was any good ..
