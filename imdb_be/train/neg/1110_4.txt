One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in the movie, and I thought it was pretty lame. It was right after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) falls on his horse from the tree to reunite good guy detachment. I was very confused by the whole Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 trick that does not translate into anything at all. It is clear that Coppola name in the credits could not do anything to ensure the success here, even with more than one in the list. <br /> <br /> If you do this before the end of the movie, you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions that I did. What is the hook with gloves? What's wrong with a script like that? Who was the stranger should represent? Why did they make this movie? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but it was drained May energy. See, there was already a western titled «Gunfighter» since 1950, with a guy named Gregory Peck as the protagonist. Watching it will make you feel as good as watching it makes you feel bad. This is one I can recommend.
