In his brief 40 years on earth, author Jack London managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible. This 90-minute film, presumably biography of a person's life, but obviously fictional, not even scratch the surface, and remains the story is very ripe for a modern retelling. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, reflecting London, and his performance is both durable and responsive. It is not a problem here. Not a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, playing with his future wife, Charmian, whose biography on London is the "basis" for this film. London Life has been broken here on a number of episodes, the film misses a little later. Thus, we brief cases with London as an oyster pirate, seal in the Bering Sea at the Yukon prospector and a correspondent during the Russian-Japanese War ... colorful events, perhaps, but hardly given anything like the entrance depth of treatment. And the direction of Alfred Santelli (he also directed one of the first films of Susan, "Our leading citizen" in 1939) is sluggish at best. Making things tougher here is very poor quality DVD with crummy that looks sources of print and hissy sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie box office, for me, was one of the extras on the DVD catalog of all the films Alpha videos showing hundreds and hundreds of full-color posters. Let us hope that these films are in better form than "Jack London"!
