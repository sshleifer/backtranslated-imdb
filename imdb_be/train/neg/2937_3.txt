Trying to crossover appeal to those who do not appreciate opera, using the reputation of being one of the greatest opera singers of all time, it's not bad. All that is desirable in the film opera, and one can find a better recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot of the novel revolves around a doctor who treats his throat, which suddenly became troublesome. <br /> <br /> Just because it happened so long ago, he was largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti decent actor and has a presence on the scene on the side of his singing talent, and anything that he does not deny that the opinion of this film. His guilt is not in denying the horrible scenario. Perhaps because great opera may have a silly stories he put up with it. <br /> <br /> Who knows, with the exception of those involved? we need to know to do? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and banal. This film as sunshields through cold dirt pick several juicy tidbits (opera music) hanging over mud. We have other ways in which to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this one is not one of them. Just get one of many of his greatest operas and vocal-concert recordings and to recognize the master tenor, where he is best suited. <br /> <br /> This is one of the 100 worst films IMDb, if more people remembered him and gave him some votes; it would fit neatly in the list, including several efforts singers, actors, models and athletes exploiting its popularity thanks to the film. Very often, it all goes horribly wrong because of incompetent actions or horrible scenario. Pavarotti would be a decent actor, if he did not show such a beautiful voice. Nevertheless, it is effective as an actor (Opera calls), not even Jimmy Stewart could deprive the turkey script. <br /> <br /> I give it 3 out of polite 10, because someone can become a supporter of Pavarotti singing and Opera because of this film.
