This film has a large step down form the typical fare of Bollywood through the concave. Performances were terrible. Even Bohm Iran, which always manages to shine is completely OTT as the villain. The soundtrack is not memorable either. And despite trying, women's wires can not be "sexy." Vivek Oberoi is capable of much better, while projects Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in a similar fare at the moment. But it is terrible even in its limited capacity as an actor. Ash Deol and Amrita Rao was in badly written cliche roles. It's time for Indra Kumar hang his directorial hat. I hope he never directs another eyesore like this. Hindi films are now in the future in the best hands. To sum up, stay away from celluloid waste.
