Not one of the best efforts of Keaton, it was probably a veiled attempt to take revenge on the family he married - in Talmadges. Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences leads Buster married with great Irish woman, who (along with her father and brothers) refers to his miserable until they do not think that he could be the heir of the state. Mistaken identities have much in here - and plugs are installed but the main thing is not paid back <br /> <br /> It is a short Metro has at least two real laughs. - Buster cleverly turning his absence lunch using the calendar on the wall, and his ignorance of the basic foster family literally bring the meat in a bowl. Other family photo with the whole group falls slowly to the ground, camera tripod becomes unstable. <br /> <br /> the overflow beer yeast can be a catalyst for a massive series of gags built on gags, but stops (for all swing) development. <br /> <br /> Kino print is crisp and clear, and the price is one for piano, percussion and sound effects. Not one of the best efforts of Buster, but it's worth a few laughs.
