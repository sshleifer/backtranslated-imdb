I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is without doubt one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he was thinking when he made this film. Usually, when he made a bad movie that I could blame it on the writer or director, but in this case it's all him. Suckiness this film all his fault. This proves that not even Heston can make the story of Shakespeare's interesting. I spent 2 and a half hours of my life in this festival half asleep, and I never will it recently. This is by far the worst Heston movie I've ever seen. If you're a fan of Shakespeare, maybe you will find this film interesting, but if you are not wasting your time, you will regret it in the long run.
