It was the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. Firstly, I'm from Kansas, this film does not have a bit of truth in it at all. Its like they took BTK name and made up the rest. In addition, it seems, someone I only got $ 20 bucks here and take it to make a film, and oh yeah do not worry about the BTK investigation generally just do something. seriously clean Dookie no one must ever see this movie. Slaughter cows scene and making his victims do not eat things and description of slaughtering animals BCI did none of these things, but the movie does it for the love of God will never see this god awful movie. We made for TV of a lot better and more accurate way
