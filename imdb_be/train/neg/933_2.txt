Undeveloped / incredible storyline (by the time I sort of figured out where he was going, I was no longer worried about) bad casting. (Let's ... William H. Macy as the killer ???) bad direction (you've ever seen Tracey Ullman perform so badly?) (I had to look after what happened to unethical incompetent, indifferent character of John Ritter?) Bad script ... (actually, I'm not looking for the formula script, but it was really awful) only really good thing, it was a child. Ten lines? This is not normal when your comment is less than ten lines? COME on-- rules which are those? Why can not I say what I have to say that in less than 10 lines ??? Is not that kind of tyranny? Why is it not normal to have less than 10 lines of commentary?
