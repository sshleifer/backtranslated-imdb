They say that this is a personal film Peter Bogdonavitch. He relied on his life, but it changed to match the characters that detectives. These detectives date a beautiful model and does not have a problem getting them. More like a playboy millionaire filmmaker than a detective, right? This whole movie was written by Peter, and he shows how out of touch with real people, he was. You have to write what you know, and he did it, in fact. And it leaves the audience bored and confused and jealous, for that matter. It's a souvenir for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was killed immediately after the shooting. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marrying Keith Richards, was also a model of how to Stratten, but it is much better and has a wider part. In fact, some Stratten seemed forced; added. She does not have much to do with the story, which is quite confusing to start with. In general, every character in this movie, one that very few people can relate to, if you're not a millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's annoying snoring Festival. That's what happens when you cut off. You will please a few friends from the inside jokes, and gave birth to everything else.
