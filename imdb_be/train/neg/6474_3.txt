It was a continuation of the first I've seen (except Return of Jafar) and I really thought before watching it, that would be close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The storyline was basically the first scenario with a few additional characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, music, who are not satisfied with life on the ground. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel kept his past from her daughter, because she wants to protect her, and if the melody finds out that she is upset and quarrel. And she decides to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. So she's happy swimming around, and Ariel goes in search of her, like a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad written, but clich√© and a repeat of the first film is just too obvious. And adding the fact that the melody, in general, very annoying, and the film becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There's also a whole load of other new characters-Tip and shooting range are two of them. They are not too bad, as the characters themselves-just try not to think about Timon and FUIB! The songs are poor too, they just do not have the same magical energy, as it did from the original songs. Animation is clearly not a whole load of work put into it, or part of his nervous and not much imagination is used for character movement. <br /> <br /> Another tip, try to forget about the original character of Ariel while watching this film. Beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has "all grown up" in a soft, dull wife and mother, and her trademark red hair are all connected. It is much better to consider if you have never seen the original, you will not have anything to compare it to. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, it could be worse, it's not as bad as some of the other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it is not in the same league as the original. But this is for your collection, if nothing else, but if you go to Disney, as they will lose all their old fans.
