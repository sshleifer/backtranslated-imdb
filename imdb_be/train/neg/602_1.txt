Another example of spending money the British lottery. As well as commercial to prove that this movie. Film Council, who financed this poor trash to be stranded in one of London's disused subway station, because it is the clich√©d, dull pattern be made into a movie, half-mutant things, made up of all the horror movies of the director saw and felt himself fit to imitate, especially Deathline. Among his many sins it is abundantly clear, the failure protagonist remotely nice until the last minute. It's a little too late! Of course, all these heads of development in the UK Film Council, may have noticed this in script stage. Add to that the horrible acting and ridiculous appearance of creatures, and you get a vivid example of how not to scare.
