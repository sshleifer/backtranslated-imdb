I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the film would not live up to what he promised me at the back of the body, but as soon as I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it out. It starts quite well, with the premise that snuff films broadcast by cable. However, the main character has nothing about it to make you feel sorry for her whatever it was, and at the end of the film actually leaves you hanging. There are too many unanswered questions. There was a big scene at the end, which completely took me by surprise, but overall it's very south steam film, but I think it's worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.
