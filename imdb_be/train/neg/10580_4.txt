I saw it last week after getting cheap DVD. I would like to see him for ages to find a plot outline is very intriguing. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought that the lead actor was very flat. This kind of parts required performance as Johnny Depp in The Ninth Gate (of which it is almost a complete rip-off), but I guess that TV budgets are not always drawn to this kind of acting ability. <br /> <br /> I also thought the direction was confused and dull, only serves to remind me that Carpenter has not made a decent movie, as the Mouth of Madness. As for the history - well, I was disappointed there as well! There was no way he could meet my expectations, I suppose, but I thought that the gain and the explanation was bad, and he finally got the movie disappointed, to say the least. <br /> <br /> It was written by one of the main investors in the AICN, and you can tell that he really loves his movies, but I would like to have a better result from such a good starting conditions. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD back to the store the same day!
