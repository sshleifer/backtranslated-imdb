Rex Reed once said about the film ( "Julie and Julia", to be specific), it seemed, he was shot through the pomegranate juice. I remembered that I snored through the purple butterfly. This one appeared to shoot through cheesecloth. <br /> <br /> The story was sad, and it did not help that a large part of the actors scenes faces were literally out of focus, or will come only in the spotlight after long periods of time. <br /> <br /> In addition, all looked the same, so it was difficult to distinguish among the characters. I call this "Dead Poets Society" syndrome. <br /> <br /> There was no one to take care of, no one is interested in sharply, and the film does not shed light on the history very interesting period of time and set of circumstances. <br /> <br /> A total disappointment.
