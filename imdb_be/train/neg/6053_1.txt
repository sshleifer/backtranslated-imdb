absolutely rubbish. I loved Halloween, and since then, Johnny was in a downward spiral. it comes to the pits. we get it, John. on-Lifers scary! You do not have to make a crappy movie that bothers the hell out of me "to say" I do. <br /> <br /> To walk the path from here. A feeling that John was not really work with here. to his credit, it seems, he did not write this garbage. There are countless times when the camera is just sitting and waiting for the actors to look stupid or say something dumb. I love long incision. too bad carpenter knows how to use it. it should bunk with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop fooled and boring me to death!
