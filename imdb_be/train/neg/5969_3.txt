*** Spoiler *** Do not read this if you are thinking of watching this movie, even though it would be a waste of time. (By the way: The story so predictable that it does not matter if you are reading this is not anyway) <br /> <br /> If you want to know whether or not to see the "Coyote Ugly" or not necessary, do not! It does not cost any money for a ticket, or VHS / DVD. Typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick", you might say. The story itself is fine, as it may be, is not critical and funny version of the American dream. The young beautiful girl from a small town becomes a great success in New York. A few desperate attempts to give the film any depth will not work, such as "tragic" the father of the accident, "difficulties" in the relationship with her friend Violet, and so on. McNally (Director) is trying to evoke pity and sadness viewers do not have to put any chance of success in this effort due to poor screenplay and superficial action. Especially Piper Perabo completely convinced one of fear "Jersey" singing in front of an audience. The only good (and rather funny thing) about the "Coyote Ugly" John Goodman, which is a small ray of hope in this film. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this film. In the first place, "Gone in 60 Seconds," and now this ... what happened to the great films as «The Rock» and «Con Air»? It was true Bruckheimer things. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a film surface with good looking women just have a relaxed evening, you should better go and see, "Charlie's Angels" (it's much more fun, entertaining and self-irony), instead of the film. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 of 10).
