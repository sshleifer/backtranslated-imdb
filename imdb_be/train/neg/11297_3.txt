Jenny Neumann (to Flicka lover sexploitation monkey American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) Helen Selleck, American actress who gets the leading role in an Australian stage production. She is a virgin, because as a little girl, she saw that her mother sex, and then accidentally caused a car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, in a black-gloved killer prowling around the theater to the people cut by broken glass. <br /> <br /> *** MAJOR Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> killer, obviously, Helen (she speaks in the voice of her late mother, washes the blood off her hands after the murder and saw the murder of a child bully with a broken bottle, like a little girl!), but it does grant panting POV camera-work and hides her face with the killer is not until the very end, as it should be some great surprises. <br /> <br /> All the cast seems to get talking, having or attempting to have sex, and, in one case, even blackmail their way into getting laid. There's quite a bit of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, photographing and editing turbid (Colin Eggleston, who is also the scenario and production) is terrible. Installing the theater for a slasher film Soave preceded by the same name and Opera Argento (both of which are better than this) for five years, although Neumann quite hot.
