My wife and I found this film very schlocky. He started well but quickly got incredible and ridiculous. Much of the action has been poor, with the exception of a little girl, of Abbie, which was really amazing. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and lame - especially Gideon angel. Also, do not give nothing, if one of the characters has a tragedy, it seems almost indifferent. At first we thought that it was a "shock", but then we realized that it was just a horrible scenario. We love almost all movies Hallmark and their heart warming stories, but this film does not rise to the occasion to be alone. There are so many great ones - do not waste your time with this horrible film.
