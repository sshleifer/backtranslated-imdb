Writer-director Tony Piccirillo adapted his own play on the direct people, recently widowed, training for the past three weeks, he is HIV-positive; He tracks down one homosexual partner he ever had, leads him into the apartment and connects it, causing a blood test for boys and promising bloody revenge, if the results come back positive. Intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays. James Marsden captured realistically cynical and snotty, but their own artificial mannerisms of the actor is confused - it's like watching a version Roadshow Tom Cruise. Speedman is to work with more complex role, but his personality turn from shy guy to the thief-on-edge is not convincing, and neither is the conversation between the two men have. Gay party boy Marsden entirely apathetic, of course - for a moment he sympathizes with the plight Speedman - but he does not react or behave like any homosexual would in those circumstances. The film is not an excuse, it is true but it's a scam, people with disabilities continue to poor editing, bad thoughtful retrospection, a low-budget production and a big final, which takes place pretentious and silly soapy melodrama. * 1/2 ****
