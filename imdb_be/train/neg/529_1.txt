This is, without doubt, the most offensive "chick flick" I've seen in years, if not forever. Preparation and characterization is so permeated with stereotypes, the film borders on parody. Before leaving the theater in an hour and five minutes in this disaster, we were subjected to the following themes: the birth of a child will solve all your problems, "artist type" miserable wall, and musicians can not be good mothers, unless they give up their dreams for a traditional way of life. Which is a waste of a talented cast and some big beautiful sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson, Toni Collette said that if she does not live longer dominant life, she eventually - shudder - "one", I felt sick. I can not believe that this film made it film distribution. This is your kind of fare one expects from these "female" cable channels, I always pass directly manages channel surfing. I am a woman and older than 35, so I have to be part of the target audience of this film, but boy, it's "Evening" to miss their target.
