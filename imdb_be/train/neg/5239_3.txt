I watched this movie, based on the very positive reviews that I read about it more here. <br /> <br /> They definitely saw something in this movie, I did not see that this is true. <br /> <br /> the film begins at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes, it is interesting, it starts to get down the entrance and draggy, not to mention the absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> At the end you will find yourself saying, "he's going to do it too just how far he's going to go with this thing? ?? Â»<br /> <br /> story begins with Jeff Goldblum, John, going into the grocery store to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new store clerk, Auggie Rose, was killed during a robbery. <br /> <br /> John gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with a guy. This seems to be a little bit more, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John becomes totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that are never made any logical sense, John, who has a very good life, beautiful, loving girlfriend, secure, well-paid job, a nice house, a nice car, expensive suits - He decides he wants to be a loser, like Auggie Rose, and the experience of living in a low-paying job, live in a landfill with Dippy girlfriend and possible links with dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Why is dim- witted, napavsyruyu film received positive reviews, I'll never know. Of course Goldblum makes a good acting job - it always does - and his appearance had improved with age - but if you have great enthusiasm and Jeff Goldblum have to see every movie he is, I would not recommend this turkey. It's about two hours of your life, you're not going to go back - and believe me - you will not have anything to be thankful for when the clock ran out and, in addition to being grateful you still sitting there watching this movie! <br /> <br />
