... mainly because Ju-2 boasts outrageous forty minutes worth of material literally taken straight from the first Ju-on - and if you think that the continuation of work for only 76 minutes, which leaves you with 36 minutes worth of original film. Ho-hum. I found that annoying deep - as if the audience just will not remember the same material! - not to mention boring, having to watch it again and again <br /> <br /> Well, that complaint aside, the author's signature for Ju-2, he had to explain a lot of unresolved issues with. the first film to be honest, for 36 minutes, just do not go far enough to make any sense of a very convoluted plot of the original. <br /> <br /> However, there are some really good new horror sequences that show how well the film could have been if it had been some time to develop; and some of the issues raised by the original - some, but not all - are responsible <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion. - If you loved the first original film and want to see some further development in history, go for it - but be sure to keep your remote control to hand with a finger on the button, fast forward within forty minutes.
