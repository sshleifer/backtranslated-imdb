We all asked ourselves: "Why do not they remake chopper movies that were just okay, not remaking those who were no longer, so they can only make it better?" Well Prom Night are altered in the middle, but bad fun 8 Jamie Lee Curtis movie and made it even worse. His paint on slasher numbers, which is clearly trying to attract young teens (hence there is no violence, etc.), a knife grinder in this flick is blunt.The director spends so much time focusing on how to make a very attractive look killer some terrible that everything else goes out window.The actors, which include Britney Snow (who was very rich in Hairspray) are trying their hardest, but the material does not allow them to do nothing but sulk and look scared.More annoying as death scene processed (we will hear al Aku, but did not see it). In addition, it seems the only place the knife in this film worked was in the suite of editing, as the film looks like it's been butchered (them anything remotely scary ended up on the floor of the room, so as not to frighten the children to guess) Nevertheless pours Americans sending money from this film at the box office number 1 !!! Slasher movies a lot of fun, but in the case of Prom night it made me want to download original.I've seen terrible episodes of The OC and Dawsons Creek
