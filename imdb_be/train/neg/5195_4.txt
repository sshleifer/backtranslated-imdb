I heard (and read) so many good things about the weeds, I'm looking forward to another great snagged cable series (eg, Entourage, Sopranos and Mad Men), but slowly eroded with each episode I watched from Season One. (Do not make it past the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was unoriginal, contrived and awkward figure Blacks. Dialogue felt compelled, as the authors are trying too hard to be clever and clubs. It was a rare moment when I actually emitted the sound of laughter. <br /> <br /> characters never developed enough for me to take care of them, they were selfish and unappealing. I absolutely hated the addition of brother-in (which was to be exported to Catch a Predator) and removal of Quinn Hodes daughter of the actors, by sending her to a boarding school in Mexico was so banal and clich√©, I had to conclude that the authors tested <br /> <br /> viewer loyalty episode. after the episode I liked the characters are smaller and could not get over many technical flaws in the storyline. <br /> <br /> to add that I have heard that the second season was not so good, so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect that this show will be an issue for you like it, of course, if you do not beat, then all bets are off.
