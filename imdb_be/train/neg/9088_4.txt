It has been said several times - not least of all me - to look in Eric Rohmer movie's like watching paint dry; it seems that Mr Romer resents it (he did not deny, but then, as he could, it just angers him) so much that his new film, which can also be his last, Inch Allah, is set so far back the time, it's like Wajda look dry. These wonderful people who gave you the Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema has named it one of the best movies in 2007, so that should give you some idea. Reality entirely on the agenda Romer, so that in the 5th century in France we are at one extreme to the Chateau, which would not be out of place in the Loire valley, while the only other property we find a crude wooden hut. The story involves nymphs and shepherds, and as he often does Romer left him with unknown who just happened to be passing by, so that the overall effect is that the annual class game at a school for children with special needs was captured on film by chance. One is almost tempted to say: "Come Godard, all is forgiven", but even this poor production can not force me to say the words.
