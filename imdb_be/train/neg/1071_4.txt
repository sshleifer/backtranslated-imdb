Very weak film, mainly because of the bad history, but also the poor action in the case of Robert Downey Jr., and irrational behavior of many characters. If you are someone who likes to switch your mind and just watch a movie on it creativity or action criteria, then you may like this movie. Personally, I can not do it with the drama and found it too far-fetched. <br /> <br /> I especially annoying when the main character, which must be smart person, constantly acts as a complete crackpot. In this film, when the protagonist acted as a man, as a rule will act in such situations, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> The first is very unlikely act as the protagonist, a successful lawyer named Magruder played by Kenneth Branagh, and leaves the party stumbles girl plays Mallory DOSS Davidtz, who cries out that her car had been stolen. They stood around in a tropical downpour, he badgers her into taking a ride home. <br /> <br /> She tells him about his strange father, who belongs to some strange sect and does crazy things. When they arrive at her dilapidated shack in a poor part of town, they notice that her car on the road. In addition, it houses the lights are turned on and some of the objects in the house were broken. <br /> <br /> Things are very strange, that it is strange (it looks like a tramp, she undresses in front of him until it is completely naked ?? oh yes!). In addition, parents are strange house skeleton - all should Magruder said, "hey, this is too weird for me, I'm out of here"! But Magruder, he sleeps with her, and then, guided by its history and sex, takes matters in an attempt to her father committed. He cries setting! <br /> <br /> Then, as the principal -flight attorney that he is, he arrives late at the office, wearing the same shirt, he had the night before, (the fact that all the women in the office posts). whether there is a likelihood that a successful lawyer will act as 16 ## - year-old? Magruder frustrated the police in some of his cases, so when he goes to the police claiming with sufficient evidence that the father terrorized them, the police ignored it. I could not believe grumbling assistance. But it does not help at all - probably not <br /> <br /> It is very unlikely.
