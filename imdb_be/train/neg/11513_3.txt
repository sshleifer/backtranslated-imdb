* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I have bent over backwards to be fair to this film. I knew that he starred Madonna. I knew it was going on for a week in theaters. I knew that there was a lot of bad reviews. I did not expect a deep and thoughtful study of class, culture and sexuality, as we got in the Italian original. doubts advantage lasted ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna played a rich, pretentious, nit-witted the Gorgon, who goes on vacation with her husband, henpecked and frivolous friends (brunette woman as bad as Madonna, showing some really silly facial expressions). Adrian Janine playing court first assistant who is interested in character Madonna demeaning and treatment as dirt in each scene they have in common. Why she's such a bitch to him? Just because the story requires, so that later, when the two of them get marooned on a desert island in the Mediterranean tables will be included, and it will teach her a lesson. Just as inexplicably as they fall in love, despite having nothing to do, and they abused two-thirds of the film at each other. <br /> <br /> «boldly" is silly, simplistic, superficial movie from beginning to end. Madonna gives usually a wooden performance. There are many dumb scenes: Madonna singing and dancing badly at the request of Jeannine, fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the example. Guy Ritchie makes it "stylish" editing, which is ridiculous here. The film contains some of the worst dialogue I've heard in cinema for several years. Ending juicy and implausible. It is basically a "Blue Lagoon" responsible "overboard" minus the nudity of the first and the last sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Maybe the ego of Madonna is so great that it insists on continuing to prove himself as a competent actress. Please let him, Madge, for us as well as yours. This is not her worst movie, though. That distinction still belongs to the «Shanghai Surprise». She did not do anything worse than ... for now.
