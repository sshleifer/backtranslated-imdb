As an independent filmmaker and a big fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I bought this film thinking that it finally sets the record straight about how talented and brilliant Ed Wood was actually. <br /> <br /> What I got was a disappointment, self-centered, conflicting, contradictory collection of bitter self remote are former people. <br /> <br /> where people remember Ed Wood Jr., people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with adhesive tape, which he knew who was in terms of Nine from Outer Space? <br /> <br /> It seems, however, very minute there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood, these people came out of the operation «Wood»! Just take in mind dashing swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when no one else would! After 50 years, I would suggest that many of these people have to let go of what they do not have $ 75 they were promised! <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant creative director who knows how to entertain. In fact, everything that he lived. You can giggle when you see Ed's films, but somehow you know what you're laughing with him, not at him. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... back to the film at hand. If you are expecting a movie about Edward D. Wood, Jr., you will not get it here. If you want a film about the capricious bitter old actor is the film for you!
