It is important not to be offended by the lack of logic and common sense, and those who have any questions, "gray" agree that this film just does not work. <br /> <br /> The problems lie in the direction of the cast selection and the lack of depth in building character. The word comedy was a very hard thing to say, when I expected to laugh, when these words are used. Let's look at the problem in the direction / screenplay. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister, both in their mid-30s, it seems to be well adjusted. They meet a complete stranger in the park and Heather Graham character walks up to her and ask the most intimate questions that even half sane person would work under a different manner or at least scream of a police officer. Then he awkwardly fits and makes stupid statements, and she falls in love with him. Then, after one date were they all come together, he falls in love with her and decides to get married in Las Vegas for a week ???? Hello anyone feel stupid yet? He goes out to thousands of women, and he replies that one person who speaks about 10 words that we see on the screen, and he wants to marry her. Not only that, there is no chemistry it just does not make sense. Of course, this is a romantic comedy and I want to believe that he could, but the direction is made completely flat. <br /> <br /> Currently, Heather falls head over heels with it too, and if Heather Graham and Moynahan (very minor character) kissing or more to the point, he was sloppiest kiss ever, that chemistry can be there. I found it unromantic and unfunny, and while many say that Heather can not act, I think the reality Heather was obviously not the man for this role. <br /> <br /> This is Sue Kramer's debut as a director and for me it was too much for her to chew. It takes a lot of ships, to make this film work and IMHO it can be done with the best writers and the cast and direction.
