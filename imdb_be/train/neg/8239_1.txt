It really is the worst movie I have ever seen. I just do not have the slightest idea about how someone has the nerve to put it in production. <br /> <br /> Standard production is brutal. There's not pretend here to cinema. The camera work, script, action and sound incredibly stupid. I think there is a plot, but it could be done within 10 minutes the budget your time to watch it. Hysterical neurotic girl in the center of this part there is no trust at all. <br /> <br /> I would urge anyone to not waste any time and money on this title. It's really brutal <br /> <br /> JDD. - December 14, 2008
