Unlike the two other game shows current US Endemol (in Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs 100), Shagan in this show is too slow for what is happening on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND 1 vs. 100 can get away with slow pacing, because the game can change the tempo - or end - at any time. There is the risk associated with every action the player takes, the rewards wildly variable, and it is difficult for a player to leave a significant amount of money. Gripping usually good use. <br /> <br /> Show me the money, on the other hand, is too slow. If the question is revealed and it is obvious that a player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that absolutely nothing interesting happens in the next few minutes. This will greatly help the pace of the show to reveal the correct answer, and then the player has to choose a dancer, instead of wasting time Sews talk about what happens if a player gets the wrong answer, as we all know that they are right , Random dance filler that actually feels like filler. Too much time is spent in a while is not enough, what is going on ... and the fact that players can not choose to leave the game early will ensure that there will be a lot of wasted time. <br /> <br /> Yes, and I have no interest in watching shat shake her groove thang, especially just after I ate lunch. <br /> <br /> I'm a lifelong game show fan, but even I had a lot of trouble sitting through an hour of this. It either needs to be significant changes or early retirement.
