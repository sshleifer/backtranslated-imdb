Many silly plot holes in the film. First, we see that he was watching his master the practice of kung fu, and die in the midst of their practice. That's fine with me. And then at the end of the film, we see him with the help of kung fu, he learned just by watching his master, when he was still a child. It is even possible? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This show just for fans of Jay Chou, and the film lacks depth in terms of character development, of cinematographic styles and deployment story. <br /> <br /> Does anyone notice that the captain of the basket team (forgot his name) and idolized player Li Xiao look so similar to each other, to the extent that you think that they were one and the same person ? Long hair, sun boy look, tall and strong. Two of them looked like they came out of the mass factory production, designed for products in large quantities, which makes teenage girls screaming wild orgasm. Not that the two actors had nothing of value to contribute to the film as a whole for the film industry in general. <br /> <br /> jokes were lame and not funny. <br /> <br /> scene in relation to the 4 artists Jay Chou returns to help him in the basketball court, it has degenerated into a meaningless plot, when they began to beat their opponent ala style Royal Rumble. Worst of all, when 4 of the wizard won the fight, the crowd began to applaud, and the match continues. It was truly a WTF? moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the match, all thanks to the excellent Kung Fu skills of Jay Chou. He acquired the skills of kung fu, it's a mystery, because the show somehow shows its acquisition of skills by simply observing your own boss. <br /> <br /> And then his long-lost father comes out of the woodwork to recognize Jay Chou, as his long-lost son, it seemed just a little too quickly wrap film director. <br /> <br /> In short, this is Jay Chou-Flick (instead of the usual "chick flick") See, only if your Jay Chou fan. If you're one of those whose tastes in movies much the same as those in the list of top 250 films IMDB all time, this film is not for you.
