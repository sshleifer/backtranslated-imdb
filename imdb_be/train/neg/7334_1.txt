I think Stuart Bliss worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The action was awful and ridiculous subject. I get the fact that the wife of the protagonist, leaving him caused a mental disorder, but he was so stupid and boring after a while I could not care about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The film kept going over and over the same ideas, without anything fresh or unexpected add to the story. All this with a Geiger counter was too much after a while after Stewart began to open its wall to see what was behind it after contraindicated something there. <br /> <br /> was then repeated scenes from the leaflet and confusing those where it meets itself. <br /> <br /> I should have known that this film was a flop, if I do not recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor, if the film comes, read the book! You will be better.
