I rented this DVD, to see him looking at something else. When I saw the title on the cover, I could not believe my eyes. I read the book in Yala about a year ago and loved it, in fact, interested in the work of Yala in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) I watched maybe 30 minutes of the film, and had to turn it off. I'm not sure if I can take much more. On a superficial level, fake accents, as others have noted, just distracting at best and annoying and fresh in the worst case. Actions blunt when it should be hot and the comic, when he must be serious. Image Lou Salome simply frivolous and brilliant Freud comes off as little more than a schoolboy. I see the spirit of the very few books are transported to this day. I was hoping to be able to recommend this film to their students. Instead, I'll call them in the book. Imagine that.
