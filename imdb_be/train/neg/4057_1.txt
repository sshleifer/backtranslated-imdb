This is a very sad movie. If you grew up in Vietnam, like me, you have seen and heard all of the frames of the film and the arguments here a hundred times today. But what really makes this film is boring story directed by Carlton Sherwood. Much of the film is removed from Sherwood to speak directly to the camera about his opinion, this controversial time in the history of our nation. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, you won "t find anything new. There's no new evidence to convict John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary about Vietnam. Young viewers who are interested in this topic should see a fine film of George Butler's Going! Upriver Stolen honor obviously meant that hatchet job on John Kerry, but fails miserably in achieving this goal.
