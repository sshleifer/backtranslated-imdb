"National Lampoon goes to the movies" (1981), in other words, the worst movie ever made, far lamer than even inept "Plan 9 from Outer Space." <br /> <br /> The film lampoon speak into three segments, each of which is supposed to be a parody of the usual movie genre, but each of them landing in our feet with a sickening thud. There's no rhyme or reason these heinous vignettes, and no notable storylines. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers on this site says that only the good moments of the movie nude scenes. However, mistakes Hansel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice it was too. But the filmmakers do not seem to understand that even T & A requires a good story to surround him. There's nothing of that here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is the latest showing Robby Benson and Widmark. Here we see Benson, as a young, eager-beaver cop paired with cynical Oldtimer Widmark plays. And for a moment, those of us who are still watching this odious cinematic exercise encouraged by the thought that we are going to see the life story of how young, idealistic policeman leads to a change in the approach of the old-timer cleaning up police work. But no such luck. As we have already said that this film has no redeeming value. He disgusting until the final elimination - which, perversely, stretched longer than it should go on the screen. Apparently, the filmmakers knew they were going badly, and wanted to lower it.
