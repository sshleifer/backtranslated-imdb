Very sleek modern (holding his hips sensually) update on the Dracula story (although staying with traditional customs) with a rather interesting, if not totally seized back the history of the prince of darkness. The first time I tried to watch it, I could only make it halfway before losing interest. Again it gets off to a good start (especially the scene with the thieves, and then they met with Dracula), but then for me it has become less engaging when it hits New Orleans, focusing on Van Helsing's daughter. Great place to install it, but I never took advantage of its setting (although etching paradise damn where Dracula can bloom). Made Wes Carven (and yes, they throw that name there), but it is written / directed by Patrick Lussier. He masterfully had his moments with some fantastic visual effects, but some kinetic editing and cheap bumps do not help. Dirty scenario really becomes much silly. Lussier makes polished work that remains quite glassy, ​​inserting a lot of blood (makeup properly made) and a lot of «Virgin» advertising. No, I do not mean the maidens, is a music company, as it does get numerous shots and Helsing's daughter works there. The fact that there was no obvious fit. The soundtrack is a fun range of rock music. Now and performance throughout the store, but there are a few familiar faces to spot (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Monroe Locklin). Gerard Butler as Dracula just do not come off, but not much of a presence was established. He was just thrown light luscious ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jerry Ryan brides of Dracula. Like Johnny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are solidly right. Christopher Plummer gives turn gray, as Van Helsing and Omar Epps have fun with the role.
