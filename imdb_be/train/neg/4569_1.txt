I can not believe that the city of Muncie is so difficult for the attention that they will embarrass themselves, allowing the show to be done there. This show, like a slap to the real hard-working law enforcement officers. I have never in my life seen anything so stupid in my life. If they are worth it as a comedy, that would be one thing, but to say that it is a reality, is nothing but a lie. I saw him only once and was shocked at what I saw. I would like to see the little guy to get into a foot chase with the bad guy. Which is a joke that would be. Nothing on the show was not even close to the real world. City of Muncie, the police chief, and all officers should be hanging their heads in shame, and never want to admit that they have come to this city. Not surprisingly, that did not go around on TV
