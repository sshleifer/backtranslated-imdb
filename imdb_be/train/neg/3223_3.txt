LOL! Not a bad way to start it. I thought it was original, but then I discovered that it was a clone of one thousand nine hundred seventy-six remake of KING KONG. I've never seen KING KONG, until I was 15. I saw this film when I was 9. funky disco music of the film linger in your head! Not to mention the leitmotif of the film from the Yetians. This is the worst effects of the creatures I have ever seen. At the same time, this film is the Holy Grail B-movies. Memorable quotes: "Take a sedative and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank, and you have a Yeti power." I remember this film MOVIE MACRABE organized Elvira There is one scene where she was, like King Kong in the opposite direction. ! in KING KONG, he grabs her and climbs up a building, but in this movie he goes down the building and captures a girl (falling)! also around this year was another clone KONG MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977), who came from Hong Kong. There is a lot of traveling matte scene and motorized parts of the body. This film will leave you laughing. It is, as I said, just another clone of KING KONG. PG Assessment for violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
