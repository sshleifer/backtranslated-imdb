A typical thriller, has been done many times before. Simple site plan; Cap Liotta becomes obsessed with the wife of Russell, and he's trying to soak a good Kurt, so he could have her. Is this predictable, it is not even trying to get you to guess the plot of the story and there is no thought outside the box here. I think that the only reason to watch this to see how it develops, but nothing has been done initially interesting. There's really nothing to say about this movie, it's not particularly bad, but there are no good points day. Russell plays Russell, and you know what you get when you see it in the film. The same Liotta. Stowe has an annoying Cher-esque voice. I read the plot outline, and I could see the movie in my head, it was so obvious, and the principal. I watched it and rolled out exactly as I had imagined in my eyes. I felt a drop of emotion throughout. I have no feelings for this film, it's as if I have not even watched it. With this in mind, it's pretty pointless movie is not it? Nevertheless, I'll give it a 3/10 for some reason.
