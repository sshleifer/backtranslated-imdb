Oh, my God. I started watching it, not knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I saw. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader that air drops in a man who was unarmed, and expect him to grab it and run with rocket backpack. If it were really that simple. Finally I found a film worse than "Plan 9 from Outer Space."
