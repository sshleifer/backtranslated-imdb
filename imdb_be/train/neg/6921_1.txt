I went to the previous screening of the film and was shocked how cheesy it was. It was a combination of every horror / thriller cliches, trying to comment on many things, including pedophilia, Satan worship, undercover cops, cases, religion ... and it was a mess. action has been quite a plinth; small and man, Jesus was all right, but apart from them .... Anyway. I admire the effort (though slightly failed) at showing to the Christian people in a different way ... despite the fact that they did it, the way he presented the gospel was a bit of action and kiddish. But then again, it might have to be, as he was talking to a little kid ... no. in fact, I thought it was just all around bad. music ... oh ... terrible ... toooo over-dramatic. All right. I felt bad for the people who made this film at the premiere; It would seem a bad student project. I'm going to stop talking about it now and says the bottom line, to go see this movie, if you want to spend an hour and fifty minutes of his life in a lane. there you go.
