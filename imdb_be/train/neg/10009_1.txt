This movie is one giant cargo pant. Paul Schrader completely lost in his bad scenario. And his directorial roughly the same as in a coma, it can be without actually being sleepwalking during the process. <br /> <br /> The worst thing though is Woody Harrelson, which I usually like, when it is properly cast. He plays a "walker", a homosexual man in DC who plays a social companion bored wives of the Washington elite. He could not have been more one-dimensional, if it had been carved out of the magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on popsicle sticks. His "southern accent" that "off the rack" version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end, he gives each line, as if the heat and humidity of the South still draining it every ounce of energy he has. It's monotonous. But it is not the worst accent in the film. His "boyfriend", plays Moritz Bleibtreau, attempt to influence a certain accent of the Middle East, which is so clumsy, he can barely deliver bad lines written for him. He was not able to throw AIR, despite the fact that in real life he was a German, and speaks several languages ​​- one of them is Italian! It's kind of a good reason to throw someone else to do, I do not think? <br /> <br /> From the history, to the script, to directing, to the camera work, to speak on the findings, this film is bad from start to finish. The only permissible moments in the film came from the three supporting actress Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only three managed to make it through this film with their dignity in tact. In fact, all three are excellent, despite be a really bad movie trapped. Ufortunately, no one could be enough to repay the infinite number of shortcomings well. If you like the three actresses playing them in something else. This film is not worth your time.
