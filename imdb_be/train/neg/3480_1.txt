This movie is terrible. SCARY. One of the worst movies ever. I can not even imagine Gigli be worse than that. Previews forced us to say "No" and then look for something on a background of dreck out there right now, we decided to go ahead and give it a shot. <br /> <br /> STUPID USA. <br /> <br /> Affleck is not an actor. He is the image and can look good with explosions, but not even the sight of Bruce Willis was in «Die Hard». If he is deprived of his shirt and ran around the fight with the bad guys, this will be a comedy <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara. - it is always good. Gandolfini flops again (if it were not for Soprano, it will be washed), as he did in "The Mexican» <br /> <br /> Affleck pigs each scene and as others have said. - no character have any motivation at all for their actions. <br /> <br /> In order to avoid this film at all costs.
