As already mentioned, this formula several times has been removed, for the last time, as "You've Got Mail" with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. From several options, this is my least favorite. The problem I think that the studio floated on the charisma of the stars, which is not quite cut it here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two leads never boils in this film. There's no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of daily donuts, pleasant, but bland. And if the wires boring rest of the film can only follow. Judy, in particular, has been disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I do not know when she had a problem with pain or something, but it looks like a turtle trying to pull its head into a shell, all hunched over and all. I could not understand what Van Johnson was getting so hot about. I would make a bee line for this cute violinist. And Wang was not great either. I always thought of him as a rather general Hollywood leading man, and he does nothing to dispel this image here. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the stars or in the early 1900s, then you may like this movie. But there is much more entertaining romantic comedies out there, and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confectionery.
