Return to the cabins on the lake is not in any way stand up to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returned for the sequel, the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I'm a big fan of the first movie, the plot and the action was very good, but this is one film that I'll never see again. It's basically exactly what SEQUALS in urban legends and Blair Witch were similar, but with a much worse effect. I have personally seen better acting in soap operas, so sorry, you just have to laugh. I, in any case, I recommend this film to anyone watching it would only detract from the first.
