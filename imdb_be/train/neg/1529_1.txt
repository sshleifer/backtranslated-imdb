If you see this turkey listed in your TV Guide, AVOID IT seems to plague !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> steaming great pile of stinking Dingo kidney doesn "t begin to describe how bad this film! There is only one funny scene (scene memory gum), but even that is only 0,001 to laughometer (1000) rates. Whoever wrote this turkey should be allowed to write another film for the whole of his life.
