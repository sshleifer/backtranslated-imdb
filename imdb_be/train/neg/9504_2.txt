The only reason I watched this movie because I recently read a less than perfect, but interesting, a fictionalized account of the life of Robert Hawke of Big Cat trainer Mabel Stark. Beatty sun appears as a character in the book, in a less than flattering light. <br /> <br /> I did not realize until check the film later on IMDb, he was originally a serial. Who edited the original time of 233 minutes to 68 of protocol versions available on DVD did a damn good job. Abridged version plays exactly the same way as any B movie period, despite numerous "Spirit then? moments. For example, we really have to believe our hero dug twenty feet deep tiger trap in the morning, not even his breeches dirty? Looking at the names of the sections that I see that the number five is called "Gorilla Warfare" and number eleven is called "Gorilla". There was not even in the film Gorillas. I believe that this is where some cuts were made. <br /> <br /> Historicaly interesting.
