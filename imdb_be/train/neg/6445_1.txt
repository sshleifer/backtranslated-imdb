In assessing the documentary films that focus on a relatively small group Ugly ultra-right and conservative groups like this, you should consider the following in the United States. United States with a population of 270 million people and its complex history, both seek democracy and its hope and the desire to promote human rights that it has its drawbacks and disadvantages. This, of course, it is expected that the extreme right-wing groups and ultra ?? conservative groups exist in large numbers, but in relation to the population, they are very small and isolated. At the heart of Europe's population, the UK and even Australia have similar right-wing groups are actually based on the actual size of each capta neo-Nazi groups in Australia are actually higher than in the United States. For these reasons, it is no longer justified to humiliate and denigrate the American people and their level of debate in American society formed a very deceptive way and deceptively representing the ultra-right-wing psychopaths pile as a representative of the American society. By doing so GreenStreet, deliberately chose a small and isolated group at opposite ends of the spectrum in order to build the image of America, which is a blatant lie and a deliberate sensationalism. This film is clearly designed for the firing up and indulge in the views of people who hide this painful subconscious and hate the American people and the way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable cliches and idealistic left-wing ideology. This film was made for profit, not for promoting the truth about American society and the human condition. Greenstreet can make documentary films that focus on the ultra-orders, military-industrial complex, but failed miserably to present intelligent and balanced factual debate not to mention alternative solutions failures living democracy. The film is exposed as an anti-American show its support for this garbage. Sensationalism in the worst anti -SSH shameful waste.
