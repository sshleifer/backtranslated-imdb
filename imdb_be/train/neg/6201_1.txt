I've seen it. This is not "good", but it is interesting to flashy. The boys in this very naturalistic, but ................ graphic / final gratuitous gang rape scene disgusting and -oh yes arbitrary introduction of the Second World War in the frames abusive as he tries to compare the real horror this misogynistic device. Real bestiality material this film is simply brutal. However, the film has a look that can attract you. But it seems to me that it is "The Emperor's New Clothes", but in fact the opposite. The film looks good, but the direction of the story, the final content and the feeling that you take away from this movie without content. If the feeling may be meaningless-this is it.
