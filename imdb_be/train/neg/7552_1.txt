The Wicker Man has done the impossible! It replaced the Cat Women as the worst movie recently in my trap was kind of a movie. Yes, it's really that bad. So bad that, sitting down to write this review, I thought to myself: "If I had a choice, either to see this movie again, or to have a red-hot needle thrust into my eyes," I could really go for a red-hot needle <. br /> <br /> Louboutin has created a rare film where Joel Schumacher was able to sit and talk with comfort and a sense of guilt free mind "Yes, something bad area right there.Â» <br /> <br /> I think that the first key I had the tag line:. "Some St. sacrifices must be made," of course, this may seem like its native heady Noah sinister line intrigue you, but the victim is all on the side of the screen the audience. Trust me on that the people responsible for this film should be charged with hate crime..or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment. Sur ' ozna! a film about an island where people are only there for breeding and I have so far, and with stuck on Gilligans island only with pictures of Condoleezza Rice, then find myself stranded there. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of this movie was the guy who ripped a loud bunch I have ever heard in a movie theater. This is no joke and is not fictional. I've never been in a "thriller" and had heard so much laughter through with the film. I can not tell you with certainty, when the laughter was deliberate in some efforts to facilitate the cinematic tension, or if they just really thought it was rubbish will actually fly. I honestly found myself routing for power outage, or perhaps a fight break out at the cinema, all to make it more interesting, which is quite boring, as Deez, powder, and I pounded 2 beers each before the movie for only a little mental anesthesia (soon to be law before all movies Nic Cage, write your Congressman today, do not delay). At one point, I actually thought that maybe this film is really a parody and Anna Ferris is going to show ?? oh how I want to. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage throws per frame as ham, I mean having a cholesterol test done today. To think that I ever thought that Sean Penn was d * skom for slamming acting on Nic, for it is still d * ck is simply less of one ?? d * ck yeah Sean Penn has been reduced because of this film. We all favor Nic to play to their strengths and to follow to be helpless losers and drunks. You can not play Superman, you can not play the role of a strong hard worker go straight to jail, do not pass go do not collect $ 200. His best moments in the film when he finally comes upset and really strikes a stout woman to steal her bear suit (like fart jokes or functional point in the course of this review), and then proceeds to run amok, Conan O'Brien's Masturbating bear, but half the fun stuff the bear knocks him around. Luckily, he meets his end shortly after, when it turns out that he will sacrifice the crowd at the new hybrid round show Burning Man and Lilith Fair. To !!!! I just ruined the ending for you ?? and if you knew better you would build a statue of me in worship and sing my songs of legends. I sat through this crap festival, so you do not have to. <br /> <br /> About half way through this little adventure, I continued to think of himself Jack Bauer would have wrapped up the case of 20 minutes of real time. .OK 35 minutes when Kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have figured it out for an hour ?? and you sir NO Inspector Clouseau. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you were taken prisoner, and you have a choice to see this film or the bullet, take the bullet. <br /> <br /> Where-Uwe Boll is laughing at all of us.
