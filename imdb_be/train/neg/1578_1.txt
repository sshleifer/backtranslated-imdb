Imagine it, say 12-1am - at your home, your bored, your not tired. This scenario came about, say, 4 or so years back..I turned on the TV and slid across multiple channels and found that this film was included. OH MY WORD is the worst movie I have ever seen! I escape a car that can not be stopped (because the brakes were cut or something) in his shelves down the freeway - What happens? This movie was so bad, it is really funny - I think the stunts cost about $ 2 to make, there was one case where a child / small child is being winched out of the car by helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - Conveniently located bridge approaching up ahead ... is the BEST movie EVER bAD bIT - it shows that the child is just not a bridge, but it looks so bad - you can almost see the brand dummy that they used - the general budget classic low! I can not remember the end of the movie, though, but I bet it was great <br /> <br /> I doubt that they will ever show this film again, so I'm glad I got to see this piece of garbage!
