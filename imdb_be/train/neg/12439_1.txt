The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest films of 90-ies. The second was just as funny, with the same cast and jokes! Now comes the "Home Alone 3". I was wondering how they could continue with the same story given Kevin would have been 17 in 1997, he can take care of yourself, are not you? So what does the director decided to do? He takes the child as well as annoying and makes him sick. The child is 6 years old, and his mother leaves him alone in the house? Which teams burgerlers these idiots? I do not want too much detail, if you want to, unfortunately, to see this movie. But, please, I would recommend that you would stay away from him. It's not worth your precious time. Go to fold a piece of paper, do housework, balancing a pencil on his nose, or take a nap! It is better to do something to watch "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
