I got this DVD more than 2 years ago, and just decided to see him yesterday. I do not know why it took me so long as I do, as a show of Inspector Gadget, and even a new gadget and Gadgetinis. Although it may have a bright color palette and all the technical sophistication of modern animated film, there are some old things are absent, that the swamp is a gadget straight to the toilet. <br /> <br /> First of all, the classic theme song Inspector Gadget and the music is completely absent. The composer is trying to compromise, making the score that sounds similar, but it's still just not good enough. Gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. In addition, it looks much nicer and round instead of being just cool. Sun Penny no longer has its own computer books, and she and brain barely makes appearance at all. <br /> <br /> The story does not exist. There's something about the conversion formula and Dr. Claw using some never revealed evil, but that's all I got. What the deal was with the short / giant Italian guy I'll never know. This has nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the name is anything to go by, his last case wrapped up in any way at all. And it remains on the force, so why is it called the "last case" is a mystery as well. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed at all. It degrades a large animated show, which oddly enough, is not available on DVD, but do not let that tell you to buy any Inspector Gadget DVD-drives, you can. I sold it a few seconds after finally watching. No child will not love or appreciate it is not a supporter of the old show with hate.
