The film, once sensational for his far-sighted policy and drawings of free love and sexual liberation, was reduced over time to a mere curiosity. It seems absurd now, it's basically a boring little film was banned and enthusiastic governments in many countries. Given that, as a socialist Sweden eventually became, the "radicalism" of its policies, when disputed, is naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And his sex scenes in his time sensational indecency test subject, look pretty tame in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and the accompanying documentaries detailing its many contradictions and influences remain negligible watchable as early river 60 youth rebellion. One part of the film, which still holds up: her self-consciousness in relation to the "fourth wall". Every once in a while, a movie the filmmakers themselves to make a film. Satirical playfulness is still evokes a chuckle.
