As a major German TV station can broadcast a mess like this? Surprisingly, as the main actors avoided each acting talent - even well-known Gottfried John works very poor - especially in the scene of a double murder - as an amateur .......! the screen layout is very, very extended - perhaps to fill 2 of the film. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! A lot of, obviously, very often a blue screen, F.G. scene on a ship with unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version of the sound and dubbing is very bad - probably the reason: in different languages ​​actors - but: Other international productions really deal with this much more professional. Tip: do not look - it's the devil's a waste of time!
