I just watched this movie today, and not only that, it is terrible and horrible, but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a film about a sick person. I also think that this film is kind of porn videos with this clear crisp shot just look. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness I work in a video store, and I do not have to pay for it cause this movie is crap x infinity..DO NOT buy or rent this movie !!!!! You would be better time to watch Dude Where's My Car, than this piece of shit! And it does not say much for this film too. <br /> <br /> To act disgusting, and the film just really unwatchable. I watched this movie and I wanted to kill himself during and after the film. <br /> <br /> I went home and threw it after watching this piece of film dirt, then I took a shower, and burned his clothes. <br /> <br /> If I was not against it, I would take from the film outside and burned it also causes no one should be subjected to it ... well, maybe members of Al Queda..especially those we have in custody, and child abusers who are in prison to life imprisonment with a parole .... just make the settings as the work of Orange clock, and then make the cheese head to watch it again and again.
