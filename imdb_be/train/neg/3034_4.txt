This film has lots of great adult stars, but can not get you interested, as an adult film should. Among all the stars you could not get your kicks by any of the scenes. The film was shot in a dream, like a middle-aged set, which is strikingly cheesy. Act worse than Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are just as exciting as listening to your neighbor talking about his childhood in the college, and the dialogue is worse I've seen in a movie. The plot also has been worse than ten times. I would stick to the amateur route. Audio comments were useless, as this skin flick, but even then it was too bad. If your a proud supporter of Jenna Jameson is not enough. 4/10
