Spike Lee is to be one of the most over the nominee directors I've ever seen. He is a favorite of criticism because it supposedly makes movies with the "message" or he's just so bohemian in its approach, which makes the critic who swamped the formula of Hollywood movies is his stuff up just for being different. <br /> <br /> Summer Of Sam, do not do it well. The cinematography and editing style, Oliver Stone, and so the story. The plot is a lot like "do the right thing." Image «Guidos» or PC installed Italian-Americans (of which I happen to be one) directly from the Eddie Murphy Raw. Only impression Eddie Murphy Mego Italian guy, picking a fight with a much higher African-Americans are much, much more plausible than the cartoon, broad Italian cartoon set forth herein (John Leguizamo character be a possible exception). <br /> anyone <br /> there who have seen this film, who could not understand how this happens in the end? Once Richie came in the film, I could see a fist in the face and kicked in the stomach, I could see his accused killer. This character was the most integrity of the film so, of course, Lee are going to show what happens to the people who stand out in the crowd (that the white bearded click!) <br /> <br /> Someone, please, please give Spike whether a lifelong pass all the basketball games that he wants. So, maybe he will enjoy himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time, and we should not be subjected to it myself nonsense important and, moreover, I will not have to see the critics (some of which I have the respect of ) Ooooh and Ahhhh the emperor with no clothes.
