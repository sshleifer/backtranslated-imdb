Fred Olen Ray lousy director, even as far as B directors are, but «Haunting Fear», probably one of his best films. Yes, it makes a big butcher Poe story "The Premature Burial" and so it went bad and uneven, but it is also quite interesting. Screaming Queen Stevens Brink better than usual, as the beautiful, gentle housewife whose husband is useless (Jay Richardson) plotting to do away with it, because he needed the money to pay off a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many early '90s soft core film, actually gives the best performance in the film as slutty mistress. You will also enjoy the small role played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clark as a doctor and Berryman in good cameo in one of the best scenes. The ending does not make sense!
