My friend has a habit of going to Blockbuster and a selection of movies, no one has ever heard of. However, from time to time, this led to some amusing discoveries. Often, the best thing that we can say that they will definitely start one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> She brought home "from Caterpillar's advice." She was excited, because the box said it was interesting. Fortunately for us, the propaganda on the boxes never lie. <br /> <br /> This film was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies where if you are not pretentious and shallow person who likes to watch movies about yourself, you will hate every character in the film. Prior to the introduction of good character. Which is a leading annoying pretentious character will fall in love and act in such a way that in the real world, would drive anyone away. <br /> <br /> Mild SPOILERS here <br /> <br /> so emotional bunch of boring, arrogant, pretentious artists vow to love and to find career success. Then they meet a kind, intelligent, emotionally mature and loves the character (almost perfect man). Then watch a woman, annoyingly pretentious artist (in her 30's?) Suffered, she falls in love. So she tries to escape from a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature person and stay with a married man with whom she was, which is great, but the empty floor. It is tough to person and does everything in her power to get rid of it. In the real world, it would have been very successful. Of course, I wanted to run away, and I was not even in a relationship with her! <br /> <br /> While it nice that people "fighting for their love," I never wanted her to have it. (Also not my friend), she did not deserve it. And I wonder why, since the director thinks that "almost the perfect guy" to be punished, to win with her attitude? If the artist asks "almost perfect guy" to go, we shouted at him to leave, too. There's a problem with the film, when the film's heroine is so annoying and dumb children, you want it to fail. <br /> <br /> In addition, let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh several times, even though his character was as pretentious point of irritation. As for the other characters, they acted well, morally bankrupt and annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy, and I can say that I did laugh a few times in the film. Unfortunately, there is not much laughter happened to the last 10 minutes or so. But by the time I had the laugh, I prayed for the film to the end too long. I need to get these fresh character of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the person you hate struggle with love for people, they do not deserve, then this movie is for you.
