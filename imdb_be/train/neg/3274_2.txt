Once again, as Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, TV series turns into a full-length film and gets destroyed for all the hundreds of people who were watching. Basically Duke cousins, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time behind the wheel very fast in the "General Lee". But they need to get their act together and stop them family farms are destroyed along with almost the entire city on the reverse of Jefferson Davis «Boss» Hogg (Razzie nomination Burt Reynolds), to make room for a huge coal mine. They receive assistance in the way of their sexual cousin Daisy (Jessica Simpson the Razzie nomination) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while being chased by the same average Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (MC Gainey Lost) and the police. Also starring Joe Don Baker as governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polycom as Deputy Cletus Hogg, kokner like Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Linda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I'm giving the film an extra star of several spectacular car stunts, and of course, gorgeous body Simpson (I recognize her feet not quite Catherine Bach, but still!), But other than that it's pretty boring . He was nominated for Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director Jay Chandrasekhar, Worst Remake or the Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Simpson & Her "Daisy Dukes" and it will be worse. Pretty poor!
