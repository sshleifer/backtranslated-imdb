I would like to see this for two reasons. Firstly, it was a remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two of the Bogart played Jack Palance, who can play a dramatic role with some subtlety of perception in a large knife. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder why they decided to shoot the remake. The film is worth the same site as the HIG Sierra; Only here, the actors are not all the same, the director lost in their thoughts, and who knows what the manufacturer thinks. Jack Palance becomes boring to look at and Shelley Winters Shelley Winters asks herself what she does in this movie. I do not even want to compare it to Ida Lupino in the same role. And, of course, they had to use the dog's story again! Of course, they could have come up with several different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it a pleasure to see in the same place where they were shooting High Sierra, but it certainly does not add to the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time if you've already seen before High Sierra. Otherwise, why not see the pseudo-noir film. As for me, I would rather die than see him again ...
