Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular simply boggles the mind. This show is not funny, it is not reasonable, it is not original, it's just a steaming pile of crap bull. I'll start with the characters. All one-dimensional characters morons with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like nails on a chalkboard. Postproduction, could have been better. Then there's the animation. GOD, my eyes hurt just looking at it. All that is too flat, too pointed, too bright, and too candy coated. Then there's the humor, or lack thereof. This is completely stupid! They just take the B-Class jokes are not even funny in the first place, and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some meaningless potty humor that sickens me. And finally, last and least, music. It's just annoying. It seems like it was written on the child's computer and does not generate any emotion at all. I wish that was a score lower than 1, I really do. This show is seriously should be abolished. This show I try to avoid like the plague. Every time I hear a song, I immediately turn off the TV. If you've never watched the show, it is not. Watch high-quality programs as The Simpsons and Futurama.
