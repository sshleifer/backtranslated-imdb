This film is a pure guano. Mom always said, if you can not say something nice ... but even my mother would say that I had to do their part to warn others about this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that this is a film that Geoffrey Rush desire to simply leave. I would hope that Greg Kinnear agent..from fired the gun to give him the script. After that, Ben Stiller, probably praying for someone to pitch, "There's something about Mary." I've always been a supporter of Wes Studi-x, thank you hold holy, that he wore a mask through the film, so maybe people will not identify the movie with him. <br /> <br /> It starts off promisingly stylistic parody film Batman movie and then just lose something ... as a coherent story and half decent effects. <br /> <br /> jokes telegraphed hour before the arrival of the climax, and even then they fall flat if you want to see an effective fraud comic book world to see "Chasing Amy." <br /> <br /> RUN! DO NOT GO TO «MYSTERY MEN»!
