Although it is usually cheesy jungle-adventure film, it does have some points - the settings are beautiful, and well-adventure walks. You will not get bored playing. <br /> <br /> Keith as fresh as possible to play the eponymous lead in the management shamelessly drunk jungle shanghai'd in accompanying rich boy Van Hoffman and his excellent wife Soul hunting expedition in the cannibal country. He never takes things seriously. Shower there as decoration and Kate extensive use of it - it really does not have much effect. She was not the only woman to show off her body and lustful aspects of the film make it about halfway to the T / A images. <br /> <br /> There's nothing in this film that I would like to pay special attention to him or away from him. Manufactured be shlock, it will be able to without too much fuss. Good 2am cable programmer.
