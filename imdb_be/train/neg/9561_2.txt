As many others have noted before me here, I have to say that this film is bad, but not the worst I've ever seen. There will be no direct references to sections of movies or sequences in this comment, because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I have a feeling that I was watching an episode of a TV show or something, where they got to grab some extra $$$ to spend on CGI (I've seen worse than) ... well, it's pretty insulting to the viewer, at least if you have some knowledge about computers and / or technology at all, there are too many of these moments icon to make me feel comfortable, and I found that simply asking for it all ends - soon - in the middle. In addition, there are countless "easy way out" scenario, which is also an insult to the intellect as a thinking human beings ... <br /> <br /> This film absolutely pales in comparison with the old "Wargames", and I think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel <br /> <br /> The two stars from me because of one thing and one thing only :. performances by actors is not half bad, considering regurgitated crap script they had to work. However, they should never be subscribed to this film. Not exactly the career move, but I think we all have bills to pay. <br /> <br /> For those of you who made this film ... the highest score you have to be at the studio salary or something, that's my only explanation <br /> <br /> For all of you who have not seen this :. by all means, look it up and make up your own mind. But lower your expectations on the floor (and then some).
