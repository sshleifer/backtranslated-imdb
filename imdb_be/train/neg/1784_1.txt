Well, I braid it from the TV and skipped at the beginning. The film was about 10 seconds or so in the names (I guess), so that if something happened to that I missed it. <br /> <br /> A lot of people say Hamill in this, I have not seen it. I did recognize, Clive Barker, John Landis, and apparently Stephen King does some really awful that act as a cemetery attendant. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige looks fine, except for the scenes where she has a cat person or a stranger is in full makeup k. <br /> <br /> Even with the opening titles he never really explained very well what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. Of the title sequence, I believe that they are two-legged cat living extracting life force from the people. I believe that they live a long time and these two are perhaps the last of its kind. <br /> <br /> Add to that a very large dose of incest (Yes, I thought it was a bit suspect too), Shapeshifting, cat killer and invisibility, and you have Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad story that has no real explanation behind the main 2 characters and cameos too much to try to divert attention from the simple fact that it is not enough to explain the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
