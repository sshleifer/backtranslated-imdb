This is the worst movie I have ever seen. This film really match the quality of such films as "they" and "Fever", but even those actors names, where one is not justified. "Beautiful" from the film looked like 50 a woman with a bad facelift. (Just an example of the quality). I would rate this film is in the negative, if possible. Ladies, I must tell you that the people were not bad looking, but not as much as. If you plan to go to see this movie, I would highly recommend saving your money.
