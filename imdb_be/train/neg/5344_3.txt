Do you remember the movie Spice Girls, and how bad it was (except for songs) and their manager Simon Fuller (also manager of this group) makes the same mistake, putting the S Club (another one of my favorite bands) in their own movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley McIntosh, Jo OMir, Hana Spirritty and Rachel Stevens (What happened to the seventh member Paul Cattermole) mainly to ask your boss for a break, they go on, and at that time they see yourself on TV! Three of them swap, and vice versa, half reveals that they are clones made by greedy scientists and the other half just to get yourself in trouble. Also starring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This film may have more plot than the Spice Girls' movie made, but, in the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin" and "never had a dream come true" is not sticky reason to see this film. Not too long after the band broke up for good. Adequate!
