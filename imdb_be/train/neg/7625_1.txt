This is your only warning spoiler. What a sad state of our movie if unprofessional stuff, as it is considered the "Oscar worthy". <br /> <br /> I divide the material into three levels. The first stage of the theater. Here the viewer is stagnant and the power lies in the representation of the actor and, most importantly, the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good writer, because he or she knows the way better than words. Most playwrights know how to create images that are barren stage may not show. <br /> <br /> The second film layer. In this environment, the weaker the writer can be used, but the audience does not sit in one place all the time. With film, the context can take on the quality of visual poetry and the meaning attached to strong writing. Furthermore, the film can be manipulated Everday elements such as sound and color in the methods, it is almost unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The final level of literature. In this context, all the imaginary author, translated into the paper, and then re-submit the reader. Much more can go into a novel than it can be assumed at the studio. <br /> <br /> Therefore, adaptation may go up, but not down. Novelization never better than the base film (see a dime a dozen in your local bookstore), while the film can not convey the same effect as that of the original book (Catch-22 and IR). Movies can rarely be made in the play and the play can always be made into movies. <br /> <br /> As for «The Last Picture Show», it crashes. This is a film that must be followed by stage, because the director is too stupid to shoot it right. Characters talk the same and act the same, it is a pure futility. Add to this an unpleasant soundtrack and you have a completely unwatchable movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it in my high school class drama about 20 other wannabe thespians. Instructor raving about how sad that the film was. The sad thing is how such work is considered stagnation upset when the material is very cheerful. If it were in color scene impotence, pool party, and old prostitute would be considered more of a comedy. See what Lucas did with "American Graffiti" in a few years. <br /> <br /> The American system of secondary education should start teaching about the movie, rather than trying to teach film. Two visually powerful DownBeat movies: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Rely on them, not the case. This "last" I want to see it. 1 of 5.
