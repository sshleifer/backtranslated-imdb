WARNING! Do not even think watching this film in any form. It's not even worth downloading from the Internet. Every bit of porn has more substance than is wasted piece of celluloid. The so-called filmmakers seem to have no idea of ​​how to make a movie. They could not tell a good joke to save his life. It is an insult to any person. If you are looking for a fun movie - look where <br /> <br /> It is hoped that this Mr. Unterwaldt (in the "junior" is a good indicator for its apparent lack of experience and intellectual infancy) dies. slow / painful death and never make a film again. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's even a waste of time to write something about this shit, so I'll stop right now and rather watch a good movie,
