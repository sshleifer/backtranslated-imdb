I'm sorry I bought this series. I was expecting more action, more objective picture and more consistency. It's just pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm or romantic, it's just nostalgia itself. I think that the actors work quite weak as well. O'Donnell may seem charming, Robin (from Batman), but in this picture it lacks any charm. Probably while he gets older, he loses his children's charm, but does not receive any charm matured. ,, It is not surprising that it has not been shown in many countries and is currently marketed in the UK by 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.
