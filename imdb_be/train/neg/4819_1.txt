This is a typical low budget 1970 mess. This should be a docudrama about a hunting crews Bigfoot through the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype of Native Americans to the cynical cowboy. Actions and narratives are complete joke. If you hope to see a lot of Bigfoot staff - continue to hope. There will be a lot, and that is, you could make in your backyard with a cheap suit and a video camera; it will look better than the movie <br /> <br /> This does not mean that I do not like low tariff Budge 1970. I do. Is that such a mess of bad acting, bad characters, lousy stories and thrills that you just can not enjoy it. He does not fit into the "so bad it's good" category, and you can get a laugh at how bad it is, without the help of banned substances. It is basically a lot of people sad video camping, hiking, horseback riding, and watch the wild life. There Yeti attack that completely stupid; Sasquatch supposedly our friend is throwing stones down on top of campers while they shoot their rifles at him. At this point, you are introducing a large extent to the Yeti to drop a few stones on the heads of filmmaker and stop all this.
