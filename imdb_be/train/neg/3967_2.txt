DARK REMAINS is a low budget film an American horror film, which somehow managed to win 2 awards. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be linked to 2 separate locks. First, the woman commits suicide by slitting his wrists in the bath. Secondly, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with its throat cut. Sad couple decided to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. Later it turns out that the car chase and the surrounding space. <br /> <br /> The film continues to 2 individual filaments stories eventually converge as would be reasonably expected. However, the execution irregularly and causes confusion, which can perhaps be solved only by the multiple views. . Unfortunately, the film is simply not tempting enough to attract the most viewers to watch it more than once <br /> <br /> Just about everything that can go wrong with this film goes wrong - and fast! And a low budget can not be used to justify all the shortcomings found here. <br /> <br /> I believe that it would be wrong to judge an actor involved in the production, since the material was simply too poor. <, Br /> <br /> characters are uninteresting as indicated by other reviewers on this site. Badly written script to introduce too many people, giving them interesting dialogue, not creating opportunities for characters to manage the situation without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> The direction of strain. Inspiration with J-horror movies such as Ringu, dissatisfaction and one missed call is obvious. Unfortunately, the leaders of DARK REMAINS not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on the fear of the unknown. Voltage is generated between the permanent shifts strange situation (ghost at a surveillance camera, which went to it, for example), and the reaction of the central character, which is facing him without warning. There's no humor or insincere elements in these films. All play so directly and without remorse or restrictions that you can not help but be convinced, and fascinated him. Premonition atmosphere creates intrigue and provides the psychological effects of terror, very much in contrast to the "jumps scares" is used in Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> Heads DARK REMAINS made a bold attempt to avoid the clichés of Hollywood and also managed to avoid the use of CGI. Tribute J-Horror can be well planned. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the audience laugh at the alleged "scares" on the screen. Makeup "spirits" effects were not too bad, considering the low budget, but their actions are simply defied logic. I scratched my head quite a few times in the movie. <br /> <br /> I could not give away the ending, even if he wanted. I just could not understand. All I could conclude that this was something an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> So what is left? The answer, as a reviewer on another site showed boredom. The film is sickening to sit. Fortunately, the pain comes to an end after an hour and a half. . However, most of them are likely to exclude long before the end <br /> <br /> There are only two positive things that I could find in this film - the successful prevention of panic and lack of cliche «F-word" in each proposal, as one would expect, as a rule, be found. This is what the Stars 2. <br /> <br /> Those who, as a supernatural or psychological terror associated with ghosts and haunting might do well to follow such films as The Legend of Hell House, substitution, or J- horror subgenre. <br /> <br /> If you think you've seen too many movies set and want to see a little-known ultra-low budget "R-rated" a horror film about ghosts, watch death GHOST HUNTER. This may not be the greatest horror film ever made, but it is certainly much better than DARK REMAINS and has some real surprises in store. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS, like the plague.
