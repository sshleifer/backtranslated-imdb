I saw this movie on its premiere at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> Since the film American Beauty, which is something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, many of the films that I've seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead Sundance is the only film that I ever wanted to get out early with. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with Towelhead is that it because, obviously originates from the collection of "provocative" ideas about cultural stereotypes, rather than an organic human drama. The script derives from the eponymous novel by Alicia Erian. Edith Wharton's famous quote comes to mind: I never knew the novel, which was good enough to be good, although it adapts to the political views of the author. This observation is particularly devastating for Towelhead, because of his political views are so callous and simplified. If ever there was a time when white men in the rogues Towelhead, indulgent portraits of blacks, ironic treatment of foreign cultures, and so on, were fresh, it's long gone. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional examinations available online. Almost all appreciate the film is bad and expose the petty and manipulative it is based fabric. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, fans reviewers seem more easily deceived. Reading the reviews on this and similar sites, you will often find in superlatives: "stunning", "exciting", "deep", "shocking" ... It embarrasses me to read them, but it does not surprise me. In fact, I have met many people who seem to regard any book or movie related to racial, cultural, gender or sexual matters, very touching, thoughtful, full of deep penetration. If you are such a person, by all means, hire Towelhead and navigate through it. On the other hand, if you set the standards above, you can safely pass on this.
