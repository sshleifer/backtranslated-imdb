Boring, predictable, by-the-numbers horror outing, at least, has a pretty good special effects and a lot of (nonsense) mayhem and blood to meet the (mindless) fans of the genre. Basically we are talking about giant rats chew character set, we do not care about iota. - if this is your thing, tune (* 1/2)
