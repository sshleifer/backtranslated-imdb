I understand the joke very well, they are just not good. Shaw got. I understand, and this is another terrible thing about it. The only cool character EVER there was a show that one homeless person in this one episode, but I see another episode, including the episode and the show got. It's not funny, entirely ridiculous! I do not want people to say, "Only the smart people that," because if they are so smart, why are they judged the people they do not even know and say that they are not smart or intelligent enough to figure it out It's like saying: "The sky is red," but never looks out. but in any case, this is absolutely the worst show I have ever seen in my life, terrible jokes, I mean, you can understand them, they are terrible, it disputes very limp, her fart jokes and jokes on other bodily fluids really stupid usually consist of very bad acting. I'm not sure that the "smart" people see the show, but to judge others if they do not know anything about any of us really smart comment.
