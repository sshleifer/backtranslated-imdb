Hey, if you have a little more than an hour to kill, and to find the paint too exciting, I propose it. If you happen to you like a cheap B-movies like me it is good for a giggle! Also, I would not suggest that you shoot, I'll wait until it comes on the tube say round 4 am on a free channel cable / satellite provider access. The group that did the soundtrack, by the way was on the road after a period of two years after this flick, and no they did not sound just as bad to live in accordance with the two small review of the city I could find them. So once again good, if you find the grass grow on a lot of fun, but it's good to see if you want to see how not to shoot the film budget.
