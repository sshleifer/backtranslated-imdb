When I was younger, I liked the show, but now ... BLECCH !!! It shows juicy, badly written, and rarely funny. Three wires were all good actors and funny people (Saget rise was much better than the material, this show came up, as it was better to stand Coulier and Stamos was better than the average actor). After some time, Stamos wanted to leave the show because he wanted to do more serious things (who can blame him?). Shaw ultimately were canceled, when many of the actors demanded more money <br /> <br /> Here are a few things that make me mind about the show :. <br /> <br /> 1. The catch phrases- How many times one man can put up with the tedious winged phrases as a "how rude", "You got it dude», «nerdbomber», «cut" and "mercy" in 24-hour period? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmitt Gibler- most annoying characters ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Writing- stale and formulaic like Oreo cookies. There is a good template to write bad template writing. Full House was a bad formulaic writing. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San-Francisco- said enough. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic stuff- Too many to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Fashion kids- girls were all the latest fashion shopping center, and you can see posters of trendy artists they would be. <br /> <br /> Currently, it shows on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved, as I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was so sickly sweet, I could not stand it after a while.
