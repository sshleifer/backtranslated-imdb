This film was supposed to be the worst horror film I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, terrible, and cheese and talk about predictable plot! I'll never watch this movie again and will not recommend this film to anyone. What a waste of time! Firstly, as soon as the movie started, I realized that I myself. All that they have done for this film was a copy of a scene from many other horror films there and grouped them all in the same film. Prank phone calls, Halloween night, crazy, and one knife! Its absolutely ridiculous. I was not afraid at all during the film, which I thought horror films were supposed to do. Regarding the creation of the film, it is quite fun as they all say that this film was so big and so scary. I mean, do not you see that the movie is a cheap rip off of "Scary Movie", for example. At least get a few good actors in it, and then maybe he would have been left as a good horror film.
