I will not describe the story as it was done in other countries. We're big fans of Clive Owen, and if our Netflix recommended the film, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that we have never heard of this "movie", because it was a film BBC Television in 1992. Thus, the poor production values, grainy, jerking the camera work and sound bad. <, Br /> <br /> But no objection to the mechanics, because the story itself will put you to sleep. It's an interesting human story, but not quite convincing, and is unlikely to have an end. You do not really care about the characters, their life as boring as your life is boring to watch this movie. Save for two hours and do something to make the time more appropriate.
