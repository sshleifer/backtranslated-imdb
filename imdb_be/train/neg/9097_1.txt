Who actually created this piece of shit is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, it's a waste of time and money. I hate how they create low budget sequel distinguishing D-Lister actors and the plot is so similar to the 1st. <br /> <br /> I found this film in the bargain bin sits directly next to the Wild Things 2, and death in the Supermodel of $ 2.99 that I was a fool really think it could be good instead I watched with disdain as poor existing stereotypes torn storyline and scenario 1st. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that this is just-in-video production was actually even half decent movies you should be on crackd or something, because I think that to a large extent, most of those who I am seen this movie thinking that crap !!!!
