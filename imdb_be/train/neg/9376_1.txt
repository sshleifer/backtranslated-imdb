while watching this movie, I fell ill. I grewing with Pippi and each time was a real pleasure. when my wife came to Sweden, she was looking at old people and had a really good laugh. but the American version should be renamed and will never be displayed again. it's awful from start to finish it. how they can manage to make it soo bad. Well, I think, someone accuses translation ha ha ha .. but they never close to Pippi. can this film had never seen and never sent to the broadcast. record a movie and keep the baby. if you want to look at Pippi then look at the original film and laugh. We love Pippi Inger Nilsson, sorry T Erin, you'll never stand to be Pippi .. Oh yeah .. if you read the "spoilers" explanation "," spoil "surprise and robbing the viewer of the unknown and the fun of the film. "Well, I think the director is behind it ... you see this movie at your own risk .. it's really a waste of time ...
