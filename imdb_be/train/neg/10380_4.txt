I do not think that someone sits down to watch this movie will be waiting for anything remotely like that is a classic ghost story, but you have to ask yourself, when this is over, if you've ever been scared. It really does not work at this level, but the cast is really trying, and the film does not tack on one of those happy endings. The history of American couples traveling in Kyoto, Japan, so Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book, and he brings with him his wife Loro (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), working at the US consulate to help them find a house to live, and he finds that does not rest. About 140 years ago in the same building, a samurai found that his wife is cheating on him, and he kills them both, and then committed suicide. Their ghosts still live in the house and when Fletcher arrive it did not take long before strange things start to happen. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> sometimes ghosts inhabit Fletcher's body, and they begin to act like the Japanese that they were before, and Laura begins flirt with Alex that leads to action. Meanwhile, Ted begins to behave in a more strict and after he pours the soup down his throat Wow, he is asking for help Monk. Unfortunately, the ghosts get by Ted, Laura and Alex play his death scene, as was the case 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Kevin Connor, who is known as a good television director, but he has done a horror movie and science fiction films, and to working with McClure on some of them. Although it never comes close to the scary atmosphere or developing it, there are two things in it that I liked. Firstly, this is not one of those juicy endings, where the couple hug after defeating the demons. Instead, he ends up in a very bloody battle where everyone is killed by evil ghosts. Secondly, it is Susan George in a cast! I've always been a supporter of it, even when it appears in the main schlock, but her performances are always at the highest level. In addition, it is usually naked, which she does here in two separate stages, and while it does not have the classic features it has a unique look mischievous like it, and it's one of the reasons why she was so popular. But after appearing in stupid movies such as I think that this has led to its exit from the business or to work only sporadically. This is not a bad film, but it is never conclusive and watch the ghosts wandering around, when a monk gives exorcism almost worthy of a chuckle or two. The bottom line is, it's stupid, and I hope that George decides to resume his career.
