I think Cliff Robertson, of course, was one of our finest actors. He's got half a dozen classics to his account. He is doing well, as heavy, but the direction is so bad and so tiring walks, he never strays sign. The story begins well, but it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging. Nevertheless, he is well and Mugs stuff together. Knell twofold. First of all, if we take the amount of time it takes character to walk from one room to another, or one part of the house to another, it would eat up about a third of the film. Add to this, the nature of Robertson sitting in bed in blue light, looking confused, he could add another piece. I agree with the fact that said half an hour shorter would make it pretty decent, albeit slight film. The biggest weakness is simply a confusing plot, which, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questions. I'm not putting in spoilers, but when it comes to an end, do not think too much. I can think of ten that without raising a sweat. It would be better if it was a ghost story.
