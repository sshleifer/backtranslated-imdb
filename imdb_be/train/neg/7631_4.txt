I'm not going to comb the more obvious flaws in peterbogdanovichian TLPS. Instead, I will look at the positive aspects of this overpriced pygmies celluloid film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich was able to make a film that can be endured in its entirety. This fact alone puts the film high up and all the way to the top of his lame filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovic showed how generous enough, some lucky boyfriends can be through the exchange of (his then-Gal) fabulous body and chest Cybill Shepherd with his male audience - and not just one, but two cases. Brava! The undoubted highlights of this cinematic Festa del siesta. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS little scene without stereotypical country music doodles in the background. (Peter tried to do the obvious fact that the film is set in the American Deep South (as if it was not Bleedin 'obvious) that he killed that point, and so on ...) How does this benefit you may ask? Well, if the film finally comes to an end, and the monotonous country finally stops massaging tired earrings drums, you start to feel a strange excitement: "The film is finally over," It's pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives all women who look like Leachman hope. I hope that they, too, may one day snatch a much younger and perhaps even a nice guy. <br /> <br /> 5. biography Leachman (which I understand is not technically part of TLPS) it gives hope to all women who look so that they too can one day win a beauty contest Miss Chicago. (Provided that they have enough money to bribe the jury.) <br /> <br /> (You think I'm kidding adjacent Cloris having won a beauty contest, huh? Well, check out her bio, and then we'll see who the last laugh ...) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black-and-Bele, who felt sorry for us because Lichmno person meant in its original, natural lack of fame.
