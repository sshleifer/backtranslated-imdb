I went into this film after watching 82 minutes of "Borat" tonight, and left very disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, and usually go to see animated films. That being said, I found, was nodding, and at some point almost left but stayed in anticipation of the film, to become better. It never was. <br /> <br /> visually stunning and the voice work is at the highest level, especially in my opinion, that Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself several times bulbous-headed lizard villain Magneto and Gandalf). The problem with this film for me is one of those animated features for the ADD-set. It logs after the fact as a funny slapstick routines others burdened with Molasses filled story that pulls out all the stops in an attempt to pass "an important message." It looks like a burst Oscar for an animated adaptation of the category, and considering how he scored with the critics, I I do not be surprised if the Academy gets it wrong, and offers to their equipment. But if you are looking for an enjoyable cartoon about the rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
