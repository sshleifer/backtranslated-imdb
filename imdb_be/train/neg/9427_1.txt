When I was "gone mad", I expected Gore movie. Box even claimed that the film had a very violent scenes that were cut from the film distribution (I now have serious doubts about this release in the theater). After the end of the movie, I wondered how he could even get the video release <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows :. A group of three young women in a car accident riding their car crashed into a tree. These women somehow manage to make your way to the mansion, containing extremely sexist woman. Beyond this point, the film consists mainly of useless scenes, which are intended to make a film for a long time for release. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this film is terrible acting. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, it looks as if she's reading her lines from cue cards. The rest of the acting is bad, but not as bad as hers. Another thing that makes this film a poor camera techniques. Many of the pictures taken with the camera attached to the ceiling. This becomes very annoying as the movie progresses. In addition to all that there is very little gore that makes the window very misleading. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this. My rate: 1 of 10
