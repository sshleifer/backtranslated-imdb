Very impressive. The "" twists are all quite predictable, if you've seen all the movies in the last ten years, and a few more interesting parts (where someone uses contextual clues to make a decision) are few and do not have much impact, as "secret" As already it has been shown before, these tips are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoilers, sorta) <br /> <br /> action quite decent. the story just is not very interesting. the whole "does not sleep!" the room becomes invalid on astral projection things (no kidding). <br /> <br /> surgery initial stage and tense, a little disappointing, but then it is quite commonplace. <br /> <br /> I do not terrible, but not memorable. Still interesting role Terrence Howard today so far, as I've seen. <br /> < br /> Type of sad, in general.
