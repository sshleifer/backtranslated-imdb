This movie was so bad that I had to fast forward most of them to get to the good bits. Hah, that the good bits? single bit, it's worth it the end of (those who have seen the film will know what I mean). I was expecting a lot from this movie like Underworld meets dawn of the dead meets Freddy vs. Jason, but what I got this shit. The story has been forgotten, the actors used the bad, and that the director was thinking when he did it. This could be great, but I was the most boring film I've ever watched. So what if there was a good bit of the T and A, I was after the blood, and I was bitterly disappointed. Do not wait for the movie is good, but if you want a bad cheesy horror, then by all means look at it and see how it should be done in a horror movie.
