"Well, Chuck Jones died, allowing the soil of his characters, adding cheap explosions, US turns to knock off the anime style, and give them superhuman abilities." "But sir, not all of us are willing to have a few shows in the works, which are already so? Much less do not blame everything on their original creators of dreams. " "Yes! And these shows make us a pile of cash, and we need more! ". "But not every man woman and child who grew up with this time fewer characters, annoyed?". "Hay, you're right! Set in the future, make them all descendant's original characters, and little change all the names ... but not too much, though, we should still be able to milk the success of the classics. " <br /> <br /> Well, that's the only reason I can think of why it even exists. If you look past the terrible desecration of our favorite Looney Toons, it seems OK to show. But then there is the teenage Titan, which is the same bloody thing. All the characters are dressed as Batman, they drive around in some ship fights supervillains, they have superpowers, the only difference is that they claim to speak as Looney tunes and have similar names and character traits. <br /> <br /> This kind of thing falls into the "it's so funny is good" kind of category. Think of the movie Super Mario brothers, and Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh for the wrong reasons, check it out. If you are the younger generation (what this thing actually is), and may look to pass greedy heads of shamelessness, and then run with it and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you like this cartoon I do not have a problem with you, the people who calculated this thing together, that I was mad at. You know how they say that piracy as carjacking; it shows how the desecration of graves. They could also dug all the people involved in the original cartoon, put them on display, put them ?? ERR pirate costumes, and bequeathed money. If this show does not use symbols (those who do not like the Looney Toons in any way whatsoever) that have already been made in the studio millions, then that would be great. But no! For shame Warner Bros., for shame. <br /> <br /> If I saw this thing as a 30-second gag in the episode of The Simpsons, or Griffin, I love it. As it is, I just can not believe that it ever did. I would bet anyone that 80% of people working on this show hate. But regardless of that it does not really matter for 10 years, this show will be forgotten, and the originals will live forever ?? or at least until the world ends. <br /> <br /> "Coming 2008 Snoopy and the Peanuts gang ago, and now they have a freaking lasers and can become invisible! Charlie Brown could defeat the evil alien warlord Zapar? Tune and see."
