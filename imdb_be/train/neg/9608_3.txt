Man, what the hell were the people who made this film? And more importantly, where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone of the film: a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire, turns into a werewolf. And that "American Werewolf" transformation without Rick Baker, people. We're talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here. I can only imagine some Italian stones Extend the glue on the bare Annika Barrel (who plays Daniel, protagoness film (is that a word?)), And ask her to turn in bags. That's how bad it is. <br /> <br /> From this moment it does not get much better. Minutes spent as scenery chewing male actors to certify about Daniele and her condition or something (I do not remember, but the dialogue is so bad, if you do not laugh at it, you'll cry). <br /> <br /> the most ridiculous, Danielle did not even a werewolf, she psycho who is psychic every time there is a person around (of course, because she was raped as a child), so she thinks she's becoming a werewolf as its ancestor (the opening scene). She can not help but pull out the throat of every man she meets, and she wants to be the only favorite! Things begin to look for by Daniela, she meets and falls in love with a buff stunt man, who does not call her "episodes". Check the mounting is one of the Cheesiest you'll ever see (laughing and hugging after diving head first into the window). <br /> <br /> luck Daniela is not satisfied, as the film takes a hard turn, she suddenly brutally beaten and raped by a group of bandits, who kill a stuntman. Resembles "I spit on your grave", Daniela extract bloody revenge on her rapists. <br /> <br /> This is a 100 minutes of my life I will never go back. But hey, it's a game that you play, if you are a movie freak.
