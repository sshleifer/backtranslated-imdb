Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) having fun on the lake with his friends, when her brother falls out of the boat and drowned. Friends Rachel think it's time for her to stop beating themselves and taking the blame for the fact that she had no control over. So take an infusion and something to chew on and head back in the same lake, which has been in constant nightmares Rachel. As expected, the bloodshed has already started, when two of the friends who spray before you even go to the party. This film looks like the middle school games where everyone forgot their lines and "winged it" ... very bad! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself a meatier role of a friend of Rachel Leo. Outside Fretwell and Gabriel have some pretty lame action and some characters you would like to choke the shit out before they «offed». Giving attention to a few players who had the audacity to come: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is one MEMORIAL DAY you would not mind missing.
