The murderer, a rapist insane cannibal killed a policeman at the scene of his last murder. On his tomb worship together with plans to restore it, piss on the grave. This, of course, works, and he wakes up the penis to tear the guy, and he returned to his old ways of killing zombies with an all new look. Two police officers who are going to one of the little mind to the city waste and has a drug problem, again in the case. Two of the original members of the cult also trying to stop a killer, raised some other kind of dead thing. Thinking they have submitted them go, but from the grave comes a plastic doll that was used in the original resurrection. It sounds a bit confusing, actually, but it's just garbage. <br /> <br /> action is not terrible, and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore faces a series of gore, and it just as badly as annoying cop in this film. Another policeman just about struggling to get his terrible lines from. Now I'm all for a low-budget film, but this film is simply awful. If it was not very easy on the eye and give them naked, I'd probably fall asleep. There is a bit of gore, but it is no more than a few animal gut, located on the victim's abdomen. Zombie makeup on the other hand, looks great and his foot long penis, which he uses to rape their victims like funny at times. There is also a half-decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. Doll with voice chipmunks is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on the line. <br /> <br /> The ending is very bad. You'd expect the killer to invest much more of a fight than he is. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
