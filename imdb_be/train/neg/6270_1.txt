As a woman who works with scientists to put round metal balls in the mouth of people who allegedly changed his identity, but actually makes them mad, like a zombie killer. In the "guinea pigs" for the experiment poorly dressed, marriage, young women in dire need of acting lessons. This movie is terrible, brutal, and surprisingly bad. He hardly has any logic in the script. You'll really have a problem after that happens. It does not have any special effects. Computer screen, which supposedly represents a huge scientific progress does not look more than the old screen Atari. And what is even worse is that there is a doll with hair strands felt (looks like a lonely child at summer camp made him) named George, who, as a personal servant / trustee Jessica (leading "actress"). Throughout the film you will be subjected to an idiotic, sophmoric utterings this doll. But wait ... You can also get loads, erotic unerotic, almost nude scenes with the girls with some guys a bar. All this time, the most annoying soundtrack plays in the background, as a kind of spiritual discovery occurred. None of the actors are not good. There are only varying degrees of bad. Gore and aspects of the "horrors" particularly ineptly filmed. The film really looks like a teenager put it together. It is no accident, Henry Salo, director by name, but not by profession, nya nya made another film. I was bored almost comatose watching this silly, stupid, dreck! And what about the ending? What happened? If you know, give me a secret, because for the life of me I can not figure it out. All I know is that I lost the time it takes to watch this garbage, which is made at the beginning of my weekend a real trunk nightmare!
