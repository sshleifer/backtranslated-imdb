Until now, Nightmares and Dreamscapes were chaotic and disappointing. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson may have offered little in the way of speaking innovative real horror stories, but at least it was well directed, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting William Hurt and very impressive special effects for mini- series. <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was just awful, and not in a good way. The script is bad, requiring small, unpleasant protagonists act illogical to move the plot, and the characters that have to wander endlessly clumsy purposes, unnecessary exposure. The acting is exaggerated and unconvincing, and I felt a lot more sympathy for cautious murderer in the first story, than for a young couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to try to make a scary story, but amateur acting and writing, the end result looks like a freshman-year-old film school project, with camera movements for their own good, and little in the way of plot or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be very pulled. I look forward to the party William H. Mace, and I hope that he gets a decent writer and director for the segment. Until now, the quality is too inconsistent to predict or otherwise.
