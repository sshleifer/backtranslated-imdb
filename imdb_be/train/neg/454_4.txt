As a general rule, over-rated film, which has a strong cast and some clever dialogues and, of course, Dean Martin songs. The problem is that Nicolas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher, and they are the central love story. Cher almost makes up for it with its response to the emphasis shifted Cage and the control of body language. Cage just never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think and comes across as an actor, not a real person, and that's what you want in a love story. The cell was the same kind of problems with performance in other roles that require more than a symbolic type of Jimmy Stewart. Cage continues to take the role, perhaps because he loves these kinds of movies, but his own energy, like an actor does not give in to them, although he recovered it after repeated attempts. He has to leave these types of roles less interesting actors that would fully commit to the film and spend their energy and considerable talent in more of a beat and movie roles, where he can be his own mind interested.
