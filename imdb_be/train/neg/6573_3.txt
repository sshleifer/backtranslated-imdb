I read the reviews for this and it is not waiting for Saving Private Ryan, I expected that the movie some substance. <br /> <br /> The film starts very awkward sided with the usual intro stories and how the unit came into being. But once it is one thousand nine hundred forty-four and you do not know where everything is. Accents, etc. very poor, as this device has to be Hawaii / Asian American, but everyone speaks in a very poor take on Harvard English imitation of the Japanese man. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 3 out of 10 and after 10 minutes I could not see more of it. The characters were one-dimensional, and despite the fact that they are most likely based on real people, I did not have any feeling for them, and it left me without worrying about them. Very bad direction very telecine medium, which will be shown at midnight at which the duct. I would avoid, and look out for the best efforts. <br /> <br /> It is a good story, but it deserves the best stories. Do you have the feeling the director saw a band of brothers, and thought that it was enough to sell your film. My advice is to avoid the clock and a group of brothers, the Tuskegee airmen, fame or any other film, as when the pipes disappear ...
