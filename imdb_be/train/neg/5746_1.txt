About the worst film in the distribution right now! I love zombie movies and saw it in the used rack, so I thought, why not? My God is a shame for the fans of the zombie genre and movies! Whoever made this film need to remove the camera and go to film school! There are so many Gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film is not a virtue. I know it's the right thing to make movies, and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in the creation of the meat market, but none of the money and time spent in, to do it well. You need actors, the script, the real camera, invest in some books on how to make independent films. I do not know how you got the release of the DVD, but the one who did it ever really a good friend or banging his head against the wall. In the blood, gore movies is the quality not the quantity but the effects are weak! I was so angry that it's actually in the shops and I could not get my money back. Please if you have already seen this film to write here and put an end shlock. I know that I have been very severe, I had only 10 lines, so I try to get to the point.
