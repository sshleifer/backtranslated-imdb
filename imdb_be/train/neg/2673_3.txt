Not sufficiently long to be a feature, not sharp enough for short, this thing is there for one reason, to have a three-way lesbian. There are worse reasons exist. One sad thing is that it might make a decent full-length film. Misty fits snuggly in her dress and very self-confident woman, and when people are so passionate about the game character Lara Croft, what they are doing nude calender of it, you know, that soft core flick is set to explode. Unfortunately, it's pretty pathetic. Especially painful fake sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you can see her hand touches the air. See, if you just can not get enough of Misty or the Ruby, which does a good blonde and has a Z mile Jerman Akcent ever.
