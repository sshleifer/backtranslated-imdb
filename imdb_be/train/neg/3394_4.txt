This film shows Ben Chaplin as a worker bored Bank of England, who orders a bride by mail from Russia, recieves Nicole Kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when, surprisingly, it is not what she seems. The story is quite predictable and Chaplin underacts too much to the point where it becomes somewhat anoying. Kidman actualy pretty good in that role, making her character a single thing in this movie is interesting. GRADE: C
