The Angels, who got a little icky were banned from the sky, and now reside in the British woods, where they seduce and crush the teenagers. It's about high concept. On the plus side it is a small mom gives us Savinte, but since his range of action is limited to two minutes of screen time, his presence five minutes seems a bit long. Angels run through the woods naked for most of the film, but, although they may have the body of an angel, their faces look like Joan Rivers sure a bad day. Satisfactory action and amateurish Gore-effects do not help and the fatal night scenes recall the most famous movie of Paris Hilton. So bad, it's really bad.
