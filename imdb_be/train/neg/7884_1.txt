Things I learned from the "list." <br /> <br /> A decent filmmaker, hot girl who can act and McDowell can not stop this movie suck. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster won 't give you your money back. <br /> <br /> Even if he reads the script and said, "Ugh! really? "McDowell still tries. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington desperate for a class action. <br /> <br /> Relieve writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus hates me, too, and punished me by making me pay $ 5.50 to watch this film. <br /> <br /> When making a movie, you do not need the ending. Just leave it unexplained, unresolved are not interested enough to make the audience fall asleep before the end. Genius. <br /> <br /> Any accidental death is a homeowner can cure just drawing a cross in the box. So friends. <br /> <br /> Your maid can sing you back to life. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs acting lessons. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will hate you and make fun of you when you bring home this film. <br /> <br /> Apology not accepted.
