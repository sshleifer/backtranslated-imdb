I think this is one of the weakest of the works of Shakespeare Kenneth Branagh. After such a huge effort as much ado about nothing, etc. I thought it was poor. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but it has the biggest gripe that they are confused with the work of bards and cut out some pieces to put in the music / dance sequences. <br /> <br /> You just can not do Shakespeare and then contact with the game. Sorry, but that's just wrong. I love some of Cole Porter as well as the next man, but God, do not mess with Shakespeare. Skip it and watch "Prospero's Books", if you want to see a brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's Tempest.
