This is just a fairy tale, but it feels very manipulative. There is no pathos for it leaves no room for imagination or their own opinions or time for reflection. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done, but I feel that it is too presentation. I would like more images for more space in the background and maybe then it will not feel so kitsch me. <br /> <br /> But it works well for the style of a Hollywood movie, but it's very derivative Aardman films, and it bothers me. Maybe more film will check to see if the manufacturer can do without narration. <br /> <br /> I think that the VO fight too.
