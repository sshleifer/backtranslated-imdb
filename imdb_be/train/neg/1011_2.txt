LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he's a star? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE. In fact, I did not know better. But at the moment of absolute weakness, I take the STV. If you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in ETS, you know, it's one of two things: indie or dog. As well as in the villages, on the shelves. What I did it. And rightly. The story itself involves detachment corrupt cop killers a la MAGNUM FORCE, and "journalist" Timberlake only one brave enough to open them. He directed his efforts - or perhaps I should say, for his horrible actions. I turned it off after one of the bad guys had been shot through the forehead and more prudent to ask him an arrow and a smile before falling. Just awful. The real tipoff to how bad this film to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the film sports unruly beard, looking like nothing so much as a tramp. You just know the director was not under control. Freeman obvious slums.
