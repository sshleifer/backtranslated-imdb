This is not a comment on the actual film, but RUSCICO DVD release in North America. I do not know whether the various releases and updates, but the wheels we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if it means anything. In any case, mixing sound on these DVD, absolutely awful. Level often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cuts to a panorama of the battle, orchestral track will thunder so loud that I did not know what would be the first blow - has eardrums or my column. When it came time for dialogue, the volume usually drop something under his breath. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley work will be loud while dialogue superimposed on a much lower level. My wife and I found that the only way that we could watch this movie on DVD of all of them was when one of us kept his hand on the remote control to constantly modulates the volume. And, as another user has already noticed that we have chosen English audio dialogue is maintained by switching between Russian and English languages; and sometimes, when the characters speak in French on a native track was dubbed in Russian, so you're SOL, if you know any. In the end, we gave up after the first viewing of the disc. Before you shell out the $ 50 + for this film on DVD for your own library, I heartily recommend getting your hands on the rent up to see if you can really enjoy this epic film, if difficult such a bad sound, especially if you have never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.
