I love this movie. acting very well, and Barbara Stanwyck is large, but the film has always seemed to me very banal. film making working class people look low and cheap .the fact that her daughter is ashamed of her mother and the fact that her daughter does not rise above it is always a bit awkward to me. Barbara Stanwyck, as a mother adores the daughter, and the daughter and the mother abstains love to find happiness with her rich family parents. Interestingly, like many others who have seen this movie feel that way about it.again acting was very good and worth watching. I actually do not like the story. just a personal preference .thank you
