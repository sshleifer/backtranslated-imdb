I've seen this feature in the festival of the American Asian cinema in New York and was horrified by the graphic, sadomasochistic, child pornography, what I saw. The storyline is hidden under too much graphic sex scenes - and no one in the slightest erotic - hurt, especially feelings. The director seemed to be going for the shock rather explores different levels of why these characters are like this. See if you can stomach it - I still have memories.
