I went to see it with my wife and 3 years old son. He seemed to be like a lot more than my wife and me. Drawing up a surprisingly poor Pixar / Disney trips. In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention at all. The film looks strange, but the story just becomes so strange and long winded, I was hoping that my son is asleep, so I can pick it up and get out. <br /> <br /> Not to say that the film is the ISN 't an interesting concept, he just said so strange (bad script?), especially when we "meet the family" for the first time. I know that we need to get the impression that the family is stupid, but good lord, they could shorten this sequence for a good 15 minutes (apparently, I do not really his time). Until then, I scratched his head looking out.
