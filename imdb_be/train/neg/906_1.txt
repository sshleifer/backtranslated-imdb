Yes, this movie makes me feel real horror when I realized that I had paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life, trying to watch. Bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho - Junkie Girl actor and worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me, if you value your time, avoid this film, I understand the film takes money to be made and some films do not have the money, but that is no excuse for the silly plot and bad acting. I always support the independent film, if it deserves to be supported, but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movie. I'm still traumatized. I will not trust in any good cover more.
