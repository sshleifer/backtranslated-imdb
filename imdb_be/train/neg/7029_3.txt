Phantom of the Mall is the film most suitable for "easily forgotten" category. It's a pretty lousy version of the famous story by Gaston Leroux, The Phantom of the Opera. Not a bad idea in itself, but the story and the production of this film is the way to weak to bring a worthy tribute to this history. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux should not roll over in his grave just yet. It could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall has too many useless memories in it and too much boring sequence to make it memorable. In addition, the writers want to give too much draft of history than is necessary. And despite the fact that there is a lot of mystery about the character becomes accumulated Eric ... the main story on a daily basis, and deja vu. *** SPOILERS *** It is about a young couple who rigidly gets torn because the boy is killed in the fire. This fire was installed in his house, because he and his parents refused to sell their homes to make way for a huge shopping center will be built. The boy survived the fire, and he disappeared into the mall to avenge himself. At the same time he keeps his girlfriend, who is currently working at the mall and trying to forget her loss **** END SPOILERS *** It's pretty simple - but very effective - the plot becomes thickened a lot of pointless and irritating elements of conspiracy theories . Although it should be easy entertaining horror film, he is desperately trying to be clever thriller ... and that's not what the fans are looking for. There are several innovative kills, but they are not enough to satisfy people who want to see a horror film relaxing. And besides, the Phantom Mall could use at least a little bit of humor !! All these products - casting kit - takes himself too seriously. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish the few positive aspects ... As an example, it stars Ken Fori !! Die-hard supporters of the horror, of course, recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! It's like a horror landmark, which has yet to find an equal. Despite the fact that his role in this film is limited and does not even need ... it was good to see him again. TV-movie fans also recognize Morgan Fairchild as mayor, she's a great actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore in it, but I can not stand him ... so my opinion of him may be a little biased. And finally, a little praise leading actress named Kari Whitman. She is very beautiful girl and she has a bit of flair ... too bad that she never made it to the top. In fact, this film is its greatest achievement, and that says enough about his career ...
