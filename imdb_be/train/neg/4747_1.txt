I thought that this movie was terrible. I am Chinese, so I thought that it was quite wrong. Many facts were incorrect. The only right of Chinese history in the film was when mother Wendy explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought that the action scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many of the actors and actresses were not very large. Some of the jokes that were supposedly "funny" was really stupid. I think this film should get the worst rating he can get. Disney really got to get more information about Chinese history, if they want to create an extravagant film. Mulla was pretty accurate. See this film if you want to spend some time.
