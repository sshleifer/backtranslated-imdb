I finally caught up with the «Starlight» last night on television and all I can say. ,, Wow! It's hard to know where to start - unbelievably fake special effects (Check the laser beams shooting from Willie eye!), The brutal action, ponderous dialogue, inconsistent use of footage, or seriously pretentious air that pours production. It really is a unique experience, and we should all be grateful for that. I appoint Zhonaton Kay as the true heir to Ed Wood!
