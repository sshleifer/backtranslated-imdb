Valve is an astronaut who goes to space flight to Saturn the first in the world, but it is, of course, be a horror movie will succeed ugly, and he returns to the earth as the only survivor. Struck by some bizarre condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose his mind if he regularly consumes human flesh, it kills what is perhaps the only nurse in the hospital, and runs in a neighboring city to pursue more victims. <br /> <br /> I liked the room and the monsters and dismemberment effects are actually very good, but space scenes simply glued shares of NASA personnel and hospital looks strangely like a warehouse. Very weak scenario, there is little character development and overall poor acting to keep the rise above that nothing but an ordinary slasher flick with novelty, having a live candle as a murderer, and more or less has only its gore effects to hold your interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, only for the most die-hard fans of the monster movie.
