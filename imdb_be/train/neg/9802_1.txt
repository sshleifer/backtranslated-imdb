Many here say that this show just for kids. Um, when I was a child (around 7-9 years), I watched the show first. It was disgusting to me. I talked to other kids about it and, of course, other exhibitions and guess what? It was a measure of the transformation, we would like to emphasize that something is stupid (or on TV, or anything else), we said, "Well, just like Power RangersÂ» and laughed. <br /> <br /> And before visiting the site, I could not imagine that there are actually fans of MMPR. It was so amazing to me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not like that view. But it dawned on me: Maybe I lack imagination? Maybe. However, this argument is not sufficient for me to appreciate it more than 1 star.
