Invading creatures stars will undoubtedly be in the category of "so bad it's good", if the movie is not quite as sexist or racist. The fact that it is just makes it simple bad. <br /> <br /> It has the same uncompromising stereotypical sexism, which you saw in the Queen of Outer Space, as well as the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case, the Native Americans) that you usually find in the thirties and forties B-Westerns. From the point of view, it is not funny, the same through Chagall Cave gag is repeated more than ten times during this relatively short film. Ray really makes one a good impression, Jimmy Cagney (but can not get it to work on two impressions of Cagney in a row, no handle, Peter Lorre, when he tries it). There really is no production values ​​to speak of as' Star Beings "do Ro-Man from Monster or bots Tor Johnson in Plan 9 from Outer Space look like Industrial Light and Magic's creation. <br /> <br /> This film was definitely one of the avant-garde, you have to call an early independent cinema ... not pretentious enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the latest features of an all-night screwing. <, Br /> <br />
