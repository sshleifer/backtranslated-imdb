I love all of Tom Robbins book, so I was very excited and curious to see the film, shot after one of his books. I knew that there would be no way that the film will capture even half Robbins magic, but after watching the film, it made me never want to read the book again. The film Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does not include the contents of the eighth in the book, and it seems to focus more on the bonds of love between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy, than anything else. Along with an incredibly weak story line in the movie, I think the best actors are definitely could be chosen to play the character. The only actors in the film, I thought, played their roles appropriate to describe Robbins in his book were friends of Julian, they have five minutes at the beginning of the movie clip. Those who have not read the book, can enjoy the film, but as a big fan of Tom Robbins, this film was nothing but disappointment.
