I'm not sure if the users should be able to watch movies only after sitting through a half, but I'm afraid that I could not stand another minute. <br /> <br /> If it's a miserable foundation for the film doesn "t have the late, great GP spinning like a wheel in his grave, I doubt that anything will. <br /> <br /> excellent overview of the above "is not a film for Parsons sums up most of the supporters of my feelings. How dare a (second course) director and writer try something to which they so obviously are not able to provide. What were they thinking? Where to start <br /> <br /> SCENARIO: I thought I was going to get a piece of Americana bitter that I was poorly executed farce, without clich√© left unturned Stupid hippie Check Stupid fat policeman Check terrible plot trick..?.?. ? Check. Embarrassingly written female characters? Double check. Total lack of attention to the history, the periodic You are trying to portray? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while, you realize that you are watching this soap is not very well written in it. A scene from Knoxville. The scene with the girlfriend Ex. A scene from Knoxville, which I not moved on a lot of scenes with Ex Girlfriend, which was a bit like the previous one, and so on ... <br /> <br /> Direction:.. My friends and I decided, after some hesitation, that watching it was like a bad Quincy episode, or may be especially poor Dukes of Hazzard. That's how bad the area was. Terrible cuts jump terrible camera work, awkward entrances and exits to the scene. God, it was cringeworthy. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman, who is the most significant development in recent years, the work is really lousy night BBC drama Sunday called Monarch of the Glen (believe me, it is the lowest common denominator TV). And then it all made sense ... <br /> <br /> RESPONSIBILITIES: We are now so important that if some random guy from the TV decides to go to acting, if he is not so bad, it stinks, we applaud his efforts ? Knoxville AGAIN ABOUT manage to pass through each stage. Poor Christina A. has no such luck. Her performance of a car accident (even though what you are doing with these lines, I do not know). "Hippie" in a hearse: oh, oh, my God. Are we not moved since Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you get my drift. What I would like to say that, like the other reviews have mentioned, no one in this film obviously does not give a flying damn for The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers and Gram solo work. They knew nothing about the American road movie, and they certainly do not care about trying to do something to advance decent story rock mythology. This film was a shallow, failed to investigate anything and jaw droppingly unfunny from start to ... Oh, wait, I'm not really an end. And I suggest you stay away too.
