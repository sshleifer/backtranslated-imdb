... it does not say Verson Bard that bad. This is still a badly minimalist production, Dutch uncle Hamlet inexplicably dubbed Spaniard (whether Montalbano or not subject to debate), and Maximilian Schell overacts, like never before. Much of the dialogue makes it a whole, and the fact that the version of MST3K considers it necessary to note that many times speech long * * Spirit does not seem to me incredibly funny. Basically it's just a bad game, though.
