Watching beautiful women sneaking around playing cops and robbers is one of the most beautiful guilty pleasures Among the films allows me to enjoy. Since The House on Carroll Street was not exactly a waste of time, even though the story is far-fetched scenario and uninspired and somewhat annoying. <br /> <br /> There are many allusions to the different patterns of Hitchcock, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the title role. She dressed up as Grace Kelly, and she was not far from the truth. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. The way it is introduced in the classroom, it should be someone with political convictions and purpose in life. After all the film deals with a well-defined period of time, real events and specific issue. But the story degenerates during the first minutes of helpless draining-mill detective story with incredible coincidences, high predictability and a set of two-dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable as the performances of actors are good, as well as photography and set design. <br /> <br /> At the end of Central Station, New York is breathtaking. It starts in the underground section, and then moves up to the roof. The film should be commended for the good use of architecture.
