This film was a confusing piece of garbage. You never knew what was going on. The characters were poorly written, and for the most part they were completely unsympathetic for Gus (played masterfully by George Eads), except. I hate this movie, but compared with other (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) he has won an Academy Award. It was especially sad to see talented actor George Eads in such poor and sticky film. Lifespan you tumbled to all new low. Someone has to make sure that this director will never work in movies again. In addition, it is to be a horror movie, because it was much more funny than scary. For shame Lifetime, shame.
