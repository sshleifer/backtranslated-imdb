In addition, more film miraculously James Wong Howe in the battle scenes, this film is a real bastard. <br /> <br /> This is the second film that I have seen in recent days, directed by Alexander Korda. The first was Charles Laughton in "Rembrandt". It was so bad that I closed it. This is one I'm afraid not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson as ugly as ever, as Queen Elizabeth. Maybe her performance as the Virgin Queen was good for the 1937 standards, but if you compare it to what Helen Mirren, it is absolutely not suitable. In robot mode, Robson argues its line. Her message of British troops battle so dim in the spirit. <br /> <br /> Even dashing Laurence Olivier can not save this extreme part of the bore. <br /> <br /> The future wife Vivien Leigh in a supporting role here, and it does not really convey anything here. Think that Scarlett in 2 years! <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the story of the Spanish Armada is made to be so boring in this movie.
