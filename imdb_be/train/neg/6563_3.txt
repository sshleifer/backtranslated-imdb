Bunny mistakes accidentally ends at the South Pole, trying to relax in Florida. Where he meets a little Penquin, which he is trying to save from the Eskimos. This is a short and tries Penquin adorable, but in the end it's a little too easy in the department of laughs. Huskies are not so great foil for Bugs, and I just saw a lot better than Bugs Bunny cartoons openly, even some shorts when it is paired with other unknown antagonist. So I can not in good conscience recommend this. However, it is nice to see him in the director's form. This cartoon on disk 3 "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My Grade: C
