It is a shame for all, and all used during the joke. I personally do not care one way or another about Jessica Simpson, and her talent, or is that so many people find fascinating about it. Just like in the movies, that's what will not even get a passing grade in film school. Scenario mess acting is atrocious, and the fact, Luke Wilson (co-author of «Bottle Rocket») did it makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. He made the "Old School" to call loudly! It does not even belong in the same condition as my DVD «Old School»! Please, for whatever reason, do not watch this! I see there is a comment that is so bad it's good, but, frankly, too good. When we cease to see singers who obviously can not act to keep trying, I hope, will soon be over. The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachael Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson), who are part of the landfill. As for the plot, well, almost does not exist, and so badly done and written (yes, I know that this is another rehash) I very much doubt that someone will remember anything about it. Select what you do, do not waste your time, but if you do, sorry ACTUAL actors involved in wasting your time doing this bomb. Jessica Simpson you're beautiful, but stick to singing, although I'm not really a fan of that either. And the one who made this film, I would not put it on your resume. 1/10, because you can not give zero.
