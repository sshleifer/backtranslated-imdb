I really like this show, once upon a time. That is, until I realized all the mistakes in it. It's so unreal. I know it's a fantasy, but it is not even the slightest plausible. Here's why. ** Spoilers ahead ... people ** Are we supposed to believe that a child like Yugi would have gone to Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt? Come on! He was the biggest idiot on the face of the earth. And with Pharaoh (AKA Atem and / or E) hair? Last I checked, the pharaohs were shaved (for a small piece of hair at the top, except for the head) and wore fancy hats. <br /> <br /> And, we need to make sure that the evil rich boy genius named Seto Kaiba, can legally run a successful business while still having time to go to the crappy small school as «Domino High »? Puh-leeze! First, he would legally be an adult to manage the company. And that would make it really not too much of a boy genius, as he was the only adult in the class. And second off, why would he go to school as «Domino High», when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend fancy snobbish Academies? In addition, the side portions with his little brother is so juicy and the lame. Every time you turn around, that the child was kidnapped by thugs for the villain. * Yawn * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joe is a poor child, who lives with his father, no matter what will not do. He says that Joe gets all of the money go to his school because his father was an alcoholic, but you never see Joey do anything resembling work. He did not even mention the work. And his sister Serenity complete moron. Why she chose a snob, as the Duke (who put her brother in a dog suit and publicly humiliated him on television) over a good guy like Tristan? Is it really that ignorant? Various characters during the show, get get demonic forces get their souls stolen by demonic forces, and become a victim of mental illness. (Oh, this child-safe, NO.) Tea is a typical view of a neighbor girl, whose only aim is to be a friend of Yugi / s in. And while it has some interesting points in it, it just does not have enough time to shine, as the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The animation is just awful. All the characters look frail and anorexia. Prospects terrible (especially if they are doing a close-up of someone's hand), and the colors look good, but not stellar. <br /> <br /> But the worst plot hole in the series was that Yami says his Millennium Puzzle can send the souls back into their bodies. If this were so, then how could he not have saved his grandfather Yuji especially when Pegasus stole his soul, and save yourself the trouble to get it back? <br /> <br /> All of this really is a commercial for yourself. The only plus side to it "Yu-Gi-Oh: The truncated series" on LittleKuriboh <br /> <br /> Please .. Do something more worthwhile. Like, look at an abridged version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
