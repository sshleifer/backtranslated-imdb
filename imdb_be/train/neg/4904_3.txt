Teamo Supremo three children, consisting of their rukovod- Captain Crandall, rope and Skate Girl Story, all with their own Battlecry (Buza! Chick! Woopa!) And gear and moves. They work for the governor, Kevin, and were recruited after wanting to be a hero and play this game. They lead a normal life, as well as family and school obligations, but most of the action takes place on the school combat villains. The villains are all very unique and special features, such as Mr. Vague and his people who never seem to know what their plans are, but to act one way or another. From the evil robot by wicked baron three have to face them and stop their evil, and often surprising, it plans to gain power, revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> The very animation quite nice and smooth, but the style seems to be just as intended. Backgrounds have the overlap of color and structure appear to be futuristic. Music is pretty good, and the show is not so bad on the whole, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> The graphs are almost always useless and ridiculous, but after all this is a caricature and no one can blame them for that. However, it would not be in the same rank as the Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
