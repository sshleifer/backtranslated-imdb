Julia (Christine Copeland) travels with her husband Stephen Harris (Steven Man) and their young son Alex to spend a few days with his family in Savage Island, the island on their own. The pair hopes to solve their problems along the weekend in a remote island. Waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven met two amazing people in the harbor, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that the family HillBilly squatters living on the island. Peter unreasonable smoke pot during a truck driving at night and turns the spotlight on to boast; However, he accidentally runs over a young son Savage family, but in the dark, he believes that he hit the animal. Later, Savage family argues Alex as compensation for a lost son. Young family does not accept the trade, and they trigger a deadly war between the families. <br /> <br /> «Savage Island» very low-budget film, with a dull script, amateur cinematography, but surprisingly good acting. Naughty story quite absurd, and there are many incredible situations. For example, how would two men leave two women and a child alone on the road at night with the threat of a mad family? The logical procedure would be to go directly to the continent and bringing the police force to save Peter. Then a young family vanishes; Julia and Steven to leave your car on the continent and their home and friends, and no one is chasing them? Peter calls his sister Julia Alex, when he arrived with the boat in the beginning. There are so many flaws in this film that I could spend a lot of lines of writing on this topic. I believe that this film was shot with a home video camera so badly that image. Good shot deserves better material to work with. . My vote is four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ( "Blood Island")
