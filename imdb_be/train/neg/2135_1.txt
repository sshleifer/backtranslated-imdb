Just utter rubbish. I'm a huge fan of Cusacks, that is the only reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see their presence was a reprise, in a full and depth of lower quality, their precise role with Grosse Point Blank. In addition, the role of films as a political satire fails miserably, as too obvious even to the most stupid there to serve any purpose. A bill as a satirical satire is just a shame even chimpanzees. Imitation, apparently, the highest form of flattery, but seeing as though it is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as the meet (the time when your a moron) Spartans in terms of political satire, lets leave alone, and let this one fade in obscurity, he absolutely deserves.
