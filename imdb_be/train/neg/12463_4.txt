OK Hollywood entirely liberal. <br /> <br /> Obviously, I'm lieing, because it is. Im a conservative, but I will leave politics in my opinion of the film. This film was anti bush, anti Middle East, against big oil propaganda, but that's not why it was bad. <br /> <br /> Fist of I will give credit where credit is due. I saw this film the opening night, because I happen to like these kinds of movies, and I Political Science with a degree in collage. The cinematography was excellent, and the action was, as far as I could tell, very well. <br /> <br /> The plot was impossible for me to decipher, however. I have been tested and have an IQ 138, but no matter how hard I tried, there was no way I was able to piece together the story of the film and what characters which do. <br /> <br /> In the history of the scene and the sequence it was completely incoherent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> If it's not one of those movies that are meant to be watching a lot of times to get the full depth pF stories that may very well be, I have no idea what is happening. <br /> <br /> it makes sense, because if you want to make a political argument and do not receive any criticism then make your argument can not be criticized! If you can not dazzle them with brilliance, then ruin their Bull S.
