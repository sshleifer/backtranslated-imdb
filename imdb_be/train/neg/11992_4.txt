I've never read the novel Harry Paulsen, Ax, whose "Scream in the wild" is an adaptation, so I can not make any comparison with the book. I, however, say that in the film, on its own, or adaptation without adaptation, it is underdeveloped adventure that does not provide any serious explanation of his multiple characters. <br /> <br /> Think about Â«A Cry in the wilderness" as a less luxurious, teenage mountaineer (was Quincy, California the only place where it was filmed?) version of "Cast Away." Jared Rushton not 13-year-old Brian Roebson , baby led a small plane to visit his father, while craft crashes on a deserted mountainous terrain, leaving the child stranded for some time, and in order to protect themselves. <, br /> <br /> There are basically composed of three parts of the film. The obvious is ten or fifteen minutes the introduction of characters, namely, Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> On the next third of the film (which actually consumes almost the entire movie) is that Brian "roughing it." These scenes do not contain particularly strange effect, nothing spectacular, besides many beautiful cinema beautiful scenery of the Yukon. Nothing to put you on the edge, no real meetings (except vigorous confrontation with a baby), and no serious dilemmas to initiate some kind of pleasure or because of the nature on the screen. You can even feel short boring over time, as we see Bryan deal with his situation through the first, primitive tools, and then all the better of them (with the help of tools, etc.) for its survival. It's more like the usual time it takes when you're really stuck in a situation, and it's pretty much about it. In other words, they do not insert meat in words Paulsen when they transferred them to the visual media. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part of the film of his salvation. <br /> <br /> There podagovor that constantly seeks to express themselves during this time, however. Some conflicts between Brian and his parents, who created the stony, uncomfortable relations between them. However, for the most part, this is due to a short, intermittent, minimal interactive flashbacks, which are more like the background music for the video. Any minute, the singer of Jefferson Starship, should call start to sing "Sara." In addition, the viewer can make out the consequences, or guess his own need to fill the gaps in the story, we get a very underdeveloped backstory, which was probably necessary to have at least part of the film and create a connection to the characters, whether or not he I had nothing to do with the adventures of Brian's survival in the third part of the movie. These shortcomings in the narrative that through the audience to a screeching halt as he struggles to figure out what the hell these people are out there on the screen doing and for me, almost made up to the point to shout at the television to say something and tell me more! <br /> <br /> Of course, this was not, for me, a good adventure tale. But for fans of Jared Rushton, it was one of the last films he made. Yes, watch it purely for nostalgia, if nothing else.
