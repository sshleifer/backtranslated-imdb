I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew that it was a Christian basis. The director was a good idea / intention of making this film, but it could be better. I can understand why someone would still have feelings, they consider the greatest love of his life. However, I do not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, medium and coarse. The main character went on to apologize to his friends when they were the ones mean to him. They did not understand at all, and they used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character, nor anyone else knew, when ex-girlfriend has been divorced, still married and so on, but they were against his decision of old feelings that need to be addressed. His friends were suppose to be Christians and were portrayed as support, whether they agree with his decision or not. So many times we do things in life where we do not apologize to those whom we have hurt in the past, and when he tried to do it, they were all against him. The ironic part was his new girlfriend accused him of behavior settle for just looking for an old friend, when she did a very strange thing to get a hold of his name, address and telephone number ... it seemed to be a stalker !. It did not seem like one at all, but only looked for himself. God is love ... and I think that God wants people to be with the person they were supposed to be with them and I feel that the film made a terrible injustice, making it seem like God does not care about true love. .. just you and someone you've made a bad choice with. We all make mistakes ... it's all about what steps to take to make amends. As I said, the movie was potential, but I'm tired of one-sided point of view is repeated constantly and stuck in the throat of the audience, his so-called ... well-meaning friends. This film is not a true Christian faith in love, but I give it a C for his efforts.
