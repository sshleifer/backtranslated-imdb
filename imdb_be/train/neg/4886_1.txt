Due to budget cuts, Ethel Yanovska (again played by Priscilla Alden) are released from the psychiatric institution (even if it killed six people) and delivered to the house on Hope Bartholomew halfway. Once there, she immediately falls in her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who stands between her and her food. <br /> <br /> HOLY MOLY! Is this movie suck! You know that you're in trouble when the opening credits begin, and they only loans from the first film, apparently shot from the TV screen. Nick Millard (under the pseudonym Nick Phillips) has decided to return to the world of a madman Fat Ethel ten years later, and with a budget that is likely to cover the cost of a blank tape and video rental on the weekend. Let's just say that the unique style in Millard does not translate well on video. Seriously, I made home movies with a lot of production value than that. And Millard tries to pull SILENT Night, Deadly Night 2 by applying half the time working with footage from the first film (which looks like it was filmed with a worn VHS copy). Alden good again, like Ethel, but the film is so incompetent that you start to feel sorry for her starring role in this mess. I mean, at least, the first film tried. Here we do not have any music, weaker effects (if at all), the shaky camera work, a terrible sound and editing, which looks like it was done with two VCRs connected. Avoid this at all costs!
