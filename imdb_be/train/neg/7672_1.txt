It is obvious that a lot of talent for the stage crew worked on the film, so do not even look at the credits at the end, you'll only hold it against them. Nobody seemed to be interested in seeing this film, only 3 were in the theater; Two cut down after 10 minutes, and they are the lucky ones. The "monsters" were unemployed worm from Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan, and rejected the project for space alien beings. The filmmakers clearly did not want to overshadow the monster movies of the third course, so they hired an actor forward rates, which, apparently, did not get to remember their line, or in some cases to learn to pronounce the words before filming. Some scenes are incredibly inept in the transfer only what is supposed to happen when something. If you are unlucky enough to be in a theater where shows this film, and you do not pass, you will laugh, that should be frightening or intense moments of the film. Fabulously several scenes simply stun you, and regularly spewing Stephen Dorff on the "Queen Mary battlefield" conveys the feeling of those who pay to see it. If you need to see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until he is in the bargain bin at the video store. If there is any justice in the film industry, one of the protagonists there will lease it for you.
