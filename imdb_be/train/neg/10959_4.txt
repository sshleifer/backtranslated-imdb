I am a fan of the series and read all 7 books. I would like to see it just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who need to see it are those who have read the series and wonder about it. Its pretty bad, and turn you to read them. Not to be mean, but Lucy's so ugly it detracts from the film. She was the daughter of the director? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the film were jealous of her teeth. It was the bite that would put any beaver shame. The film just loses so much in translation. CS books do not translate as easily as books Tolkien LOTR, or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing that they did the right thing! Aslan! very well done. Although other human actors from painted faces (beavers, wolves) look silly, Aslan was really well done, because it was not just a human actor to walk. (I believe it is, that old horse custume? 2 people inside?) Also, I would be interested in what the children think this film. Maybe they will enjoy it? But as adults, they will not be safe bet, even if the fan CS.
