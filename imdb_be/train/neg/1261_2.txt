I am a supporter of Jean Harlow, because she was the star qualities. I do not think that her films are good, and I do not even think that she was a good actress, but she certainly was great comedy. Every bit of comedy in The Girl from Missouri very well. But this film is probably more like a love story. Jean Harlow great in this, and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances do not bring anything new. It always amazes me to think a lot of that beautiful body Harlow was that a sick woman. Well, in this film, she looks beautiful.
