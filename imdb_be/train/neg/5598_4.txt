I saw him in the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Against my better opinion, I liked it, but it seemed to me that this action was a bit weak ... (mostly I noticed that the boy from the family of a teenager). I mean, the script was not stellar to begin with, but the actors will not believe the attitude. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> I liked Nonethelss. The characters are cute, and the plot is not complicated or care. This sweet, characters care about each other, and I do not think it's like fifty minutes spent badly. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend.
