This movie stinks! You want to return more than two hours it takes to get through it. Sliding doors, w / Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda and Melinda tries to do a lot better. This film was a clever, witty, and well acted. I cared about what happened to both Gwyenths - or, more precisely, the characters she has played - and performance, supporting actor was fantastic <br /> <br /> Where is Melinda and Melinda tedious dialogue contrived, and I could. I care less about any of these people - the least Melinda. One Melinda so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine at 10 o'clock in the morning - and so melodramatic it is ridiculous, and not in a comedic sense. Second Melinda good, but forgettable. <br /> <br /> previous ensemble films of Woody Allen worked because I believe he spent time on the script and the actors were talented. One piece of trivia for this film is that he wrote the script for two months, you can tell. And while Chloe Sevigny talented - those around her there, not enough to be in the presence of a whole. The film ends with Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people that you know what you've seen in other films, but can not remember which ones. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
