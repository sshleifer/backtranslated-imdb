I am very open to foreign films and like to think that I understand what they are trying to achieve, although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and the "intelligence" of the film was boring. I've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or period of time that does not really make any sense. Now, when I saw the film, I will no longer think along these lines. There's tones of society, racism, and some desires ... but South Park has something. And when I look at South Park is really moving me feel emotions. The closest I felt to the emotions during the film was yawning I felt after the first five minutes. I appreciate the typical film seven or above, because I love most every film. I gave this film alone.
