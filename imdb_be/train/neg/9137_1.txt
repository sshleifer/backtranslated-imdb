What can I say, it's a brilliant piece of filmmaking that has won an Oscar. A copy should be kept safe in a secure repository for posterity. A must view for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraavich genius, perhaps the most brilliant writer / director / producer / cook / nanny / the Walmart goalkeeper ever to decorate a movie world with his art. <br /> <br /> Where to start with this? Every millisecond Ben and Arthur was so exciting! And Mraovich, Arthur, wow, it is so attractive that I am surprised that he did not go to Mr. Universe. I could not contain myself during nude scenes. I borrowed this movie with my brother, and he called me on the phone, speaking as a nude scene Arthur turned him gay. I fully support, of course, because of this movie, and it's nice to make a lesson of tolerance. Why only yesterday I burned down the church and I wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in his smoldering ash. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was the best thing about this movie. Despite the fact that the Fed-Ex plane rose into the sky against a background of palm trees in Vermont, I cried! Why, I do not even know that they were palm trees in Vermont or for people could travel on the Fed-Ex planes for this film. He opened my eyes to a new world of possibilities. This movie inspired me to enroll in the school of Sam Mraavicha on screen writing, acting, directing, composing, casting, production, design manufacturing and real estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich. Thank you for this creation in the world. We will never be able to re-pay you enough. "
