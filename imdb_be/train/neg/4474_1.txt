waste my life .... the director should be embarrassed. why people believe they need to do useless movies ever it does not make sense to me. when she died in the end, it made me laugh. I had to change the channel many times throughout the film, because I get embarrassed watching such a bad effect. we hope that the guy who played Hit will never work again. In addition, I hope that the director never gets to make another film, and seized his salary for this shit. .02 {10}
