I was so excited when I found out that it was available! I could not wait to see it. Which is a waste of energy! It's kind of like that rarities CD by your favorite group you found in the back of the rack at a local music store. Being a hard core fan you are sure that this valuable discovery. But as soon as you heard it, it became clear why these dogs are never made it to this album. This DVD is recommended only for «completionists», which should have all made Lynch. "Six Men Getting Sick» more visually interesting, but short and repetitive. It lacks power later work Lynch "Grandma" is quite simply an immature work. It is hard and looks like a student film. But it was the 70s ... It is interesting only if you hope to psychoanalysis director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of his images of trademarks and sounds. «The Alpahabet» is forgotten (No, really, I do not remember this one at all!) «The amputee 'does not make sense. "Cowboy and the Frenchman" is just nonsense. «Lumiere» is the only one standing in a pile. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing story, comparable to his best work. I had to watch it a few times. But it works in less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth the rental issue or DVD purchase.
