this is the result. A piece of debris film that does not even deserve to be classified as a movie, it's just a bunch of things on the film reel, that makes no sense at all. Well, back to the actors who from the get go, it seems just a bunch of friends who thought that they would get a little money together and try to make a film that would be a great horror film. Well, it's a big fear in any case, be a film fig. There's plenty of hardcore action in "houses", but the worse the main guy named Richard, who is just too much even weakling Grades root for. Well, if you bring a bunch of friends and try to make a movie is terrible, on less than a shoestring budget, at least, that's what will happen. Well, at least, MST3K version has been fun. But it's still a terrible film that deserves a beating he received. 9 version MST.
