Harsh, yes, but I call them like I see them. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the late '80s, and it was truly one of the most horrible, sad movies that I have ever got to watch yourself. <br /> <br /> So, the cinematography is excellent. Czech setting is really stunning. The political background is tempting, but unlike these "historically established" stories (eg, _Dr. Zhivago_ (QV)), this one is not able to make policies related to the history, or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, Olin and Binoche beautiful. But this film manages to make even "erotic" scenes plodding and slow. I'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, I began to hope Russian will shoot them all and put an end to my suffering. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that if I read the book, the story would make a little more sense. However, life is too short to spend more time on it.
