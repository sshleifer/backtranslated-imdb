Took it for 50 cents at a flea market, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating for about 15 minutes and then just repetitive and boring. <br /> <br /> It's a neat seeing Mick and the gang in his prime, I would like to, there was not much for the dubbing of dialogue, so that I could hear what they say and play. <br /> <br /> in a parody politically dated and incredibly naive and simple sort poorly written Monty Python on acid. I spent more time looking at the end of the 60s in England falls again, and then what was really going on in silly skits. <br /> <br /> This film is a good reminder of that time really is changing and what was important to quickly become just silly. Good song, but now this DVD played to death.
