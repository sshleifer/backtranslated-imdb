I absolutely hate it when the film is completely falling apart towards the end, after you've invested in an hour with him. and that's what happened with this film. I was intrigued by his actors, and that Malamud wrote his history of the source. I did not go read the story, but I can not imagine that it ends like this film ends.Fortunately I did not pay good money to see or rent it, because my library has it. Ooooh such waste miraculous action (wife, in particular, was so perfect) .But Milo O'Shea as a Jew? !!!! Now that was interesting. I have not explored in his creation, but he played as a director lost marble or died 3/4 of the way through the film. Up to this point, developed the story and characters, there are a number of neat plot points and did not have too much time to waste. but oh, the last 1/2 chas- if it was not screwiest, most useless Denouement I have ever seen, I do not know what it is. I just hate it when one faith is so ruined like this; it feels like an act of violence.
