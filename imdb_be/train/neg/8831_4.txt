After hearing so many people are raving about this movie I thought I'd give it a go. In addition to being incredibly slow, I do not mind as long as necessary to wait, but it's just not the case. Like many others have said, there are so many inconsistencies and much of this film just does not ring true. Reaction 4 men transferred from the shock, the horror of the body to identify completely ignored, while they fish. Of course, if they were the type of people who would be happy to go fishing, they would have simply said body and said they only discovered it after fishing .... why on earth tie the body to a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone, that you found the body 2 days ago? It is so difficult to watch a movie, knowing that the behavior of the protagonists are so contradictory. As for the rest of the inhabitants, well, you'd think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who really killed a woman! The body, naked except for her panties .... what scenario leads to what? If she had been raped, then why are there still in panties? If she had been raped with clothes on, why remove them afterwards bar panties? If she was not raped, then why all her clothes bar in shorts .... leaving themselves dispose of the evidence? I really can not think of any real situation, which will lead to the fact that in addition to murder someone to steal their clothes so you can top up your mix sales stall! Well it watchable, but only and only because, in spite of the bad script, acting strong.
