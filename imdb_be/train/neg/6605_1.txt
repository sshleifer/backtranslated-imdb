It is only annoying (or fun) any self-respecting an intelligent man. If the intention of the director was for the viewer not to love the main character, then it would be good, but I know that there is no such thing as a Hollywood director, who would make a criticism of pro-Marxist movement 60th America, especially not a filmmaker from the 70s years. There are so many idiotic dialogue happens that sometimes I wondered if I was not really watching a comedy. You would not be guilty of thinking that it is a satire ?? Here's how naive is the movie. Spacek was in its share of left-wing films, which brings me to the obvious, the inevitable conclusion that the red-haired hiccups is one of those Hollywood liberal idiots. But, I mean, are not they all? Nice tits, but s ** t brains.
