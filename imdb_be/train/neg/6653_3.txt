I just saw this movie and I have to say that it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eve (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act at all. She read her lines very much in nature, and it was very nya-natural facial expression throughout the film. Ryazanov Munter, who played Peter, on the other hand, is a natural. She played her role with great perfection. <br /> <br /> spoilers! The story was simple - we have seen it many, many times. It breaks, he finds a friend, she is jealous, he parted ways with another girl, and they end up together in the end. There were no surprises at all, no one knew that Eve would fall apart, and that Adam "connect" with Petra. The only thing that nobody saw that coming of Peter told Adam to go after Eve at a party. It has become serious, which is a party Peter viewers have seen before in movies, and told him to win the heart of Eve's back, which was very cute. <br /> <br /> In addition, Ryazanov Munter, there ISN "t the only actor who gives a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre film with mediocre actors, so I do not recommend!
