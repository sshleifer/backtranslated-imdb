A terrible story (Amis at its worst), is pointless and shy "decadence", obvious shock tactics and spotty action make this film (more like "Rancid Aluminum") embodies everything that went wrong with the vaunted British film revival. Humor, at best, limping, and the quirkiness of the whole setup (including a kind of "Internet terrorist group" - oh, so modern). Really starts to rub <br /> <br /> The final summary - half-baked attempt to be "sharp" that does no one any favors. Nevertheless, it is always nice to see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
