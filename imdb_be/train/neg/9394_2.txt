Oh, man, how low the series fell, as 1952! This stupid thing is that the show, which is annoying Annie Wilkes (from Misery). Not only heroes avoid the trap of adding scenes that were not there in the previous chapter (and it could not possibly be there - tell me that when villains detonate plain in episode 7 and 8, they will not see the characters jump), but I think this series has a world record for the footage. I mean, most of them Footage! And not just because other shows (apparently, all the flying sequences are derived from the King's missile and steep "molten stones" episode 2 scene 3 from Captain Marvel Adventures), but from themselves! All "Journey to the Moon" sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, it's 30 seconds, and the characters never seem to leave the Earth's atmosphere) of the scene is repeated in 1 episode 8! And episode 10 is all the scenes from previous episodes! (Ever wonder why MST3K never Episodes 10, 11 and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9 so that they do not have to do it all again!). <br /> <br /> Do not get me started Factor Science. Get ready to see the sun the moon ever! And lunar people who can not breathe on their own world? What are they smoking? <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough, it's too Talky and tricks (usually the best thing in the series) few and far between. Visual-wise, I'm the only one who thinks that the Commando Cody bullet-shaped (or is it a lemon-shaped) helmet looks completely ridiculous? Rocketeer's was steeper, no matter how bad that movie was (and man, it was terrible). Tank, the vehicle is not much better, it looks like a bunch of kids did it for Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of that is that the actor who plays the hero instead of the usual dull muscular hunk (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then he is so unattractive ... <br /> <br /> Do not even look for the sake of nostalgia. See Marvel instead. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (By the way, pay attention to the section Memorable Quotes for real women Lib nacre).
