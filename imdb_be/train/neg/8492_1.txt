If you make it through the opening credits, it can be your type of movie. On the first screen image of a woman who keeps her hands to the face with the white sheets that blow in one recalls the background pretentious perfume commercial. It kept getting worse. <br /> <br /> starring in the main block of wood, which uses a computer to achieve in the past, and to restore the memories of the photographs speak overlooked genius of history, of Ada, who conceived the first computer language in 1800. <br /> <br /> low level of budget graphics could be forgiven if they were interested in, or even more integral part of the script. <br /> <br /> Poor Tilda Swinton wasted.
