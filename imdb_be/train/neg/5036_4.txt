Sweet Sixteen (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes, Directed by Jim Sotos Starring Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick McNeil, Dana Kimmell <br /> <br /> fifteen bad girl Melissa is new in a deserted city, and it's not long before people start dying around her. The detective has to collect evidence by their Nancy Drew good girl daughter played on Friday 13th of graduates are given Kimmelly. Local Native Americans are the prime suspects, as they seem to upset the preconceived inhabitant. These events all lead to the identification of the murderers on the sixteenth day of Melissa's birthday. <br /> <br /> This is below the average grinder is not very memorable. It has tv feelings, without any points other than your own templates theme song title character, who plays a few times during. Lines like "killer turn us into coleslaw." Fits into standard eighties slasher film scripts. Marcy calls Melissa a bad name, that somehow once they develop a friendship. Apparently Marcy see how difficult it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear makeup. This film will be hard pressed to be today with the main character is fifteen and the director inserts some gratuitous large its plan. Social commentary of the Indians was not developed enough to be taken seriously. I am also surprised quite a high rating this film gets. Both Sweet Sixteen birthday and Blood Ed Hunt had the potential to capitalize on this honorable tradition of birthday, to create an intense sequence of slaughter, but I do not feel able to deliver. But on the bright side releasing obscure films like this on the DVD it gives hope that others will follow.
