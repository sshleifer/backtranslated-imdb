Judy Holliday struck gold in 1950 in the film version of Cukor Withe «Born Yesterday», and since then her career has consisted in trying to find the material well enough to allow it to strike gold again. <br /> <br /> It never was. In "It's going to happen to you" (I can not think of a blander name, by the way), Holliday makes one more variation on the dumb blonde who this might not be so stupid after all, but everything about this movie feels like warmed over and half a heart. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe was his first film role, can not muster enough energy to revive the revised comedy. The viewer knows how to end the film from the very beginning, so basically it just sits waiting for the movie to catch <br /> <br /> Maybe, if you are in love with Holliday you will enjoy it. otherwise I would not bother <br /> <br /> Class :.
