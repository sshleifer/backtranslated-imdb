The plot and characters are funny and hardly qualifies as a "plot" and "character". The biggest problem lies in the fact that all the dark, out of focus and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the entire movie with fog does not help. On the other hand, it's all very strange and full of sex and violence. Contradictions quite interesting, one of the main characters says that he has no friends, but he latches on the new guy a minute of screen time, and there's a whole gaggle of women on the side. Although he shows his antisocial tendencies accidentally put the arrow in some of the poorest would be ***** d, which is only paying attention to your own business! Picture of blood or gore, passing to get more attention than the characters, but what do you want from Fulci, maybe he destroyed his career, but it was not actually much more stupid zombies. Worth a rental if you want the gory Italian clicks or desperate sword and sorcery or something bizarre. How do you sleep through someone involved in a hole 2 feet from your head and scream for help?
