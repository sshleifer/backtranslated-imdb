Competing for worst Kay Francis Warner Bros movie is tough. I've only seen maybe eight of them, but Comet Over Broadway is the worst so far. The best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and the mantle of Orry-Kelly (of course) all right. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis for fat-and looks much less attractive than it usually does. Gombelly mine I do not know, otherwise it is good as a half-hard "Burlesque" Dancer (it was more like a fashion show than burlesque). Closing Shot - Kay Francis and her baby (? If the child has learned that Kay Francis was her mother or I fell asleep) walked up the dirt road to the prison painted in vague contours on a sound stage fall are beyond ridiculous. The whole movie is so cheap, so implausible, and so casually that he feels infested sour cynicism on the part of all those who made it: Warner Bros throwing garbage idiots who do not know, in a cynical assessment of Warner Bros' of them, that what they get garbage.
