Just returned from a free screening, and I'm very glad I did not pay to see this film is extremely unsatisfactory. The theater was full and the crowd was a mixture of children and adults. It would seem that this is just kids who laughed at all the spanking-stick and fart jokes, though (good god, they love to hit these poor myshe in the crotch a lot!). The film is pretty juvenile, irrational, unpredictable, and generally annoying. The characters just seem to be thrown together to fill the empty space and the relationship between them seemed very forced, with no charm at all. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is about average, nothing that really stands out. They have done a decent job of simulating the appearance of clay from the Wallace and Gromit, but other than that it is a very forgettable images. <br /> <br /> Although I really bored throughout the film, I grunted a couple of times. It is not absolute failure, but I do not want to watch it again. If you are a parent with children (no matter what your children see senseless cheap joke), then do not hesitate to take them to see it, but everyone else should not spend their money.
