Genre suspense film really takes a dive in it. The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I understand that you need to create complex situations that would cause uncertainty and intense sense of what will happen next, but this film was so predictable, and it's just not true. I believe that the more I look at this kind of a movie, the more I always say things the actors to direct them away from danger. Continually making bad decisions just bordered on being silly. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I would have enjoyed it a little bit. Having said that, you might be better off staying away from it.
