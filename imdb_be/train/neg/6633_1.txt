Where to start? How better to describe how awful this movie ??? <br /> <br /> Let's start with a smug deaf humor. It's not very funny. Add a bunch of musicians posing as an actor - Meat Loaf terrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Pity the poor Art Carney, who should have known better than to make this film. <br /> <br /> And then the plot. Road whose life goal is to work on the show Alice Cooper meets a girl whose life goal is to be a supporter for Alice Cooper. At least, they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, when the film to end, they can not come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well, I will not spoil it for you, if you really want to see the film. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who do you know that it's going to be a «B» movie or perhaps even worse. Gaylard Sartain is one of them for me - and it has a prominent role. This is a sure sign that the film is likely to be not very good. If nothing else, the film lives up to low expectations - even surpasses them being worse than the poor <br /> <br /> Let's just say it .. It is a film against which compares all the bad movies. And none is worse than the Roadie.
