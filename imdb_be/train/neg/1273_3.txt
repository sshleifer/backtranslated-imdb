I have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful, and Peter Falk gives good results (taking into account the fact that he had to work from the perspective of dialogue and direction). However, that said, I found this film very tiring. Watching paint dry would be more interesting. It seemed like a lot longer than 97 minutes. Since the opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser repeats everything said to him on the phone, annoying film. The film is filled with cliches and chip, not to mention the endless cases of audible flatulence from Falk. In addition, the director seems to have been difficult to decide whether to seek to laugh or cry. There are some sequences that are contiguous, but they all played for laughs. If sugary, sentimental, and "cute" appeal to you, you'll love it. But if you were hoping for something with more substance, to see another movie.
