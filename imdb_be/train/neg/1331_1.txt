Conspiracy of course worse than the typical "evil white man corporate capitalism" movie of the week. This film is less pleasant than a toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good in his underrated debut film, The Silverbears, in which he gives an idea is with the demands of his nature. This film is so bad character Lena, hypocritical buffoon, less irritating than the character Morita, in sanctimonious fool.
