I usually use such films as this. He shot documentary style, but the acting and writing are simply awful. Act of wood and hard, and writing is just so clich√©, but not in a good way. By typing this, I am surprised that this is a 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I am sure that most of these votes must be from relatives of people in the movies. I believe that if this is the case, you can manage a couple of laughs, because it's always funny to see your relatives / friends are doing a movie. Well, in a sense, I think it gives hope to all and coming writer, director, actor, and so on, because if they can do it, you can do it. Although, maybe you should not.
