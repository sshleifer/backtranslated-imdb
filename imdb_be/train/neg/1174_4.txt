Eric Rohmer «The Lady and the Duke» is based on the journals of the English aristocrat who lived through the French Revolution. But this pompous affair, with its wonderful painted backdrops and mannered tone. In particular, this portrait of the era of terror takes place almost entirely in one away from the real action; one sees very few ordinary people in this film, and a bit of chaos, poverty and terror, which was developed from the living persecuted, but spoiled, aristocratic classes. As a result, often boring, and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes go public on the brink of destruction; it is disappointing film from acclaimed director.
