Unpleasant Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day, when the ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on it from the back of the truck and kills her. She then tries to destroy the relationship of his ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend, a psychic who can see it. <br /> <br /> Obvious unoriginal the film is not bad in a clich√©d way, except that the character Longoria hateful and unpleasant that it sucks all the fun of the film. Its like having their ears cleaned with sandpaper. To be fair Longoria nor anyone else in the cast or crew, it's not a problem, its god awful script that sinks production. It's just really really stupid.
