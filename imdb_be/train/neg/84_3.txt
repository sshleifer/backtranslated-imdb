As a child, I really thought that the weapon wielding killer was cool, but I was a kid, so I was a little dull. Even as a dumb child, although the movie plot was silly and a little sad when the killer did not use it easily knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the film has a very solid cast in it. Which script did they read when they agreed to be in this movie, it is the most well known and sad only a means to show the lightsaber on a very small scale. The plot is sometimes unclear and the end quite chaotic. The whole movie seems to revolve around the aliens, and one weapon. The plot has two children and some dude with an alien, flash years later, and there seems to be returning, as it was in the mix. Dead animals and those that will be studied and, for some reason, a man gets an alien weapon and continues to use it to go on a killing spree is very easy. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this film was made, if you are going to have a killer has a few good scenes of death, if you are going to have Inika show a surprising light vortex things, and if you're going to have light sabers then call yourself a star war.
