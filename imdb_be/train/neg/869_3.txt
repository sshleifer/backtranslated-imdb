Where to start ... If this film was a dark comedy, I would say that this FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and anyone else with leisure and expended regret (note that was the price I paid, got it from Wal-Mart), this film was supposed to be a thriller. Only THRILL I looked lousy execution Kirkland Ann Wilkes from Misery SANs snowy forest area. If you want to laugh on a rainy Friday night with friends, then I highly recommend this film. But if you want to see something at least halfway decent, it did not even bother. <br /> <br /> For example, I use a bad film, the worse the better in most cases. But yeah ... I intended WOW !! The only person in the whole film, which does not stink, it was a little boy, played by Vincent Berry. The only reason why I even give it 3 stars because it gave me something to do.
