I was not sure what to expect from comedy, drama, fantasy, Sci-Fi genre, but, considering the actors involved, I thought to give it a spin. The tone of the film felt uncomfortable passing through portions of each of the genres, but never felt balanced, so in the end I gave up trying, and focused on the film and individual performances, which I thought was good as a whole, taking into account each character is little depth because of the nature of history (do not give here). I must say that I felt a lot more than 96 minutes of execution and not in a good way. In the end, I sought the closure of some measure of satisfaction, but it failed to be clever or ingenious piece, I was hoping it would be. I think Tony mistakenly thought he was doing at the end of the movie gave us that ... but it was a tragic mistake to try to check the previous 95 minutes, with ill-conceived conclusion. In the end, I feel cheated. IMO it would be better to be without it, "the end" as a work of art ... just. Or ... I might have missed the point completely :)
