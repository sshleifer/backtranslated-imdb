Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Alice, beating Freddy at the end of the last movie, is now trying to adjust their lives. But her unborn child carries demonous Freddy Presence, trying to get into their world again. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the director, who got their big breaks directorial Freddie films- Charles Russell (rubber mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins ( Lost in space, Predator 2) But while Russell and Harlin made a good job of it, IMO Hopkins did something mess of this record, which should be quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> the story, as far as he can go obviously stretched here, Freddy himself ridiculous and funny father looking demon child. Even all this in about half an hour it becomes quite tedious, and, of course, not scary at all. <br /> <br /> Â«pleasant appetite bitches' catch phrase is the only point of the second commemorative wise very forgettable record. *
