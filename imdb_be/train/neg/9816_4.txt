This film was like a bad train wreck, as horrible as it was, you should still have to keep looking. My friend and I rented it and wasted two o'clock our time. Do not get me wrong, the current well. Just a movie in general just the two of us angry. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this film, I had to go rent something else that was a little bit easier. Jennifer Tilly, as usual, very dramatic actress. Her character seems manic and not all there. Daryl Hannah, although over the game, it does an excellent job playing in the situation she is in. More than once I have found that to yell at the TV telling her to fight back or become strong. In general, very violent film ... not for the faint of heart.
