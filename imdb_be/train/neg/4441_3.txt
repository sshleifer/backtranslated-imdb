"Triumph of Love" is a proof that not every author of the Comedie Francaise, using disguises disguised courtship, as Shakespeare is worth a look. <br /> <br /> Or maybe something was lost in translation this adaptation of Marivaux, in the Commedia Dell Arte-inspired playwright, who says Brittannica: «His nuances of feeling and common pun became known as marivaudage.» <br / > <br /> while Mira Sorvino fun dangling three mixed-up romances, her pants role was not to Cherubino in "the Marriage of Figaro." <br /> <br /> herky-jerky editing is annoying and just seems to show that many takes it took for each long speech. <br /> <br /> Best, Fiona Shaw, how to cheat the Virgin, as well as the costumes. <br /> <br /> audience glimpses we see and call closing wink curtain, that all this is fiction does not help. <br /> <br /> (originally written 5/29/2002)
