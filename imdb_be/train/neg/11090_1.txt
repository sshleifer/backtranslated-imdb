This film looks like it was made for television. For years I waited some film to make of Rubin Carter, because I loved to see him box in the old by MSG, and see this film was very disappointing.I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but it was awful and boring. there's really nothing good to say about this movie, except I did like the song.
