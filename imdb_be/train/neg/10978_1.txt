Usually when a film gets one vote that is because someone does not like, and annoyance he does not have a lower rating, and therefore decides to drag it down as much as they can instead just give it a low rating. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Bones is an excellent example 0/10 film. He does not do anything right, and it does not have a chance, because it is not really trying to do something. There is a thread of bad D & D a new type of story that does not hold together and the complete absence of any effect on the entire territory. It is clear that no one involved in the project did not give him any serious effort, because the hard work is even obviously untalented be more. Truly awful film.
