Woody Allen has lost the ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly different from each other. This is the case with "Melinda and Melinda", where all the characters speak with ordinary pseudo-sophistication and Elena have problems and points of view, not Relatable to anyone outside the radius of four blocks of where Allen lived. In addition, they are one and the same condition is interesting to be able to afford a multimillion-dollar Manhattan apartments, which appears to have been designed by professional decorators, regardless of their financial situation and what they do for a living. <br /> <br /> The only character who exists outside of this sad thought is like a mandatory Ferrell Woody Allen surrogate. Despite the fact that he is not simply comes off as just doing Woody Allen impression (as Kenneth Branagh in the god-awful "CelebrityÂ»), Ferrel lacks charm or charisma that the real Woody as he played himself participated in his best films . <br /> <br /> In the end this is another in a line of self-indulgent opening of the once great director that trades on its old reputation for many years.
