You can give JMS and boys pass on this, because they were at the beginning of the series and on a small budget, but the film is still subpar. Do not get me wrong, B5 series is by far the best TV series ever, but when I was Exec to see this movie, I would not have ordered a series. I do not like O'Hara as an actor, silly costumes, and there are tons of punches. The same can be said for most of the first season (except Squared and Survivors of Babylon); Bruce immediately fire in the series, and he continued to be a strange sight. If you are a fan B5 and there saw the movie, I see it. If you arent on B5 fan, you do not ... you do not want to watch the series.
