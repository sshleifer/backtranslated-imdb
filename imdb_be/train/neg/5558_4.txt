I will not be too much time here, just wanted to say that Darkman 3 is awesome. I have all 3 on DVD, add them to my collection of sets of DVD movies. Darkman ranks up there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, tenacious, you get the point. There are not so many good horror, thriller, set there. Many thanks for all the crew, and set for giving us a trilogy Darkman. By the way, if your wondering how I came across this on DVD. I bought it on the Internet, it is, however, the area 4, as you know, most US DVD-player has an area of ​​1. If you have a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD-player, as this entire region of the player. Just go to settings and then select the desired setting (1-9) witch area.
