Every good story should be "enhanced" with the addition of corny Broadway music? Apparently, those who can not come up with their own plots to think that classical literature is only there to rob. I admit that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, because it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you much shot, and it was a great example of that ... So, of course this serious story and add nauseating music and his camp with each character of the orphan boys jump grinder Bobby and suddenly it uplifting? Argh. Bring me a bowl. <br /> <br /> four stars in my rating comes from the casting that I could be likened to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films was cast that version of the game can be proud of, but then they have to go and sing (see above complaints). Unlike My Fair Lady, the songs here could really do it, and they graciously spared us singing voice Oliver Reed (sorry if I'm wrong, it was at the time). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint I've said. Why bother everyone but truly shameless putting silly songs in a very good story? Occasionally this was done to good effect. As a rule, it destroys history. He has done this. The jury is still on this story, is it worth saving, but for all that gadding about, it's impossible to say.
