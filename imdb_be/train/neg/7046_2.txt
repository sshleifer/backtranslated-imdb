I saw this stupid waste of time on the Comedy Channel HBO, so I am quite innocent and obviously, it is assumed that it is a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. Good shot mostly spent on the script, which I could write with my left butt cheek - after he was knocked senseless by the 15th century the Inquisition torturers. The first half is especially bad, since it has some of the most stupid, senseless dialogue I have encountered in a while, and zero point zero plot to speak. Just the fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones in this little film, and yet this film is less than 1,000 votes on this site, I must tell you all. A couple of good shots of waves that hit the coast of British cool, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of film that gets done just because the people who wrote it has good connections (family ties, mainly) and / or a lot of cash lying around.
