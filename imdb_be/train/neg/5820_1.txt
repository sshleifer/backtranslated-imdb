This film is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I am studying French in college, and thus understood the dialogue, so that the language barrier is not a problem. I must say that it is really difficult to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the film. There is only one professional actor in the cast, and I do not guess any professional filmmakers or writers. <br /> <br /> While I appreciate that 1 out of 10, probably does not deserve such a bad rating. This is just an attempt to reduce vain his current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. Maybe 4.3 will be more accurate rating, because the film is a real non-event 100 minutes or so in length, you'll never get back. <br /> <br /> The real shame that I'm sure some college student destroying it to make a movie nut twice as good and half the length. However, if you want to join the bandwagon, which seems to ride IMDb you can also go ahead to "Lost in Translation" at 10 as well.
