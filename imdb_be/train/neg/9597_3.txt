As much as I love Japanese movies this one is not just cut it ... A film that is supposed to be about the rebels and the survival of the royal blood line have been very slow pace of the film with a dubious plot. <, Br /> <br /> Pictures in order, although I have seen much better sword fighting scenes in other Japanese movies, fast camera and the way in which they followed the characters did not convince me. The soundtrack is so weak that you will not even notice it presence.But worst of all was the way the story evolved.I must admit that a few times, I was hard to figure out who's who and what's going on. ..Anyway platonic love between the protagonist and another was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> In general, if your looking for action Japanese cinema is not the case, it is very slow, with very few sword fights and a very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
