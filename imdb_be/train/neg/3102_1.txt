No matter how you look at this film, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> If you see this as a horror film it unscary monsters that are hand puppets. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a comedy, you will notice most of the humor falls flat and just lame. <br /> <br /> If it's romance you'll wonder why the guy would have stayed with the B ** h! <br /> <br /> When you look at it as an action, you can not really lead to a whiny character. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie is simply unable to deliver anything remotely entertaining. As already mentioned monsters appear obvious puppets, and this film was yet another attempt to type film Gremlins. This, however, is the worst-looking monsters of the genre. Critters looked pretty good, so did the Ghoulies, damn, even a doll with Munchies looked better than they do. The characters in this film thouroughly unpleasant. The hero is a whiney guard, his girlfriend is always complaining that they have one tramp who has jerk military boyfriend and another friend who is Spaz. At one point in the movie hero and a military guy fight with a rake ... this film is just downright silly. I like the scene when they are in a terrible scale of the club (which is obviously not a club, but it is more likely to snack), and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are not 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 and I I look younger than any of them.
