Slowly, slowly, slowly ... There is no mystery or excitement in this film. If you do not find out who the "mole" in the first ten minutes, you have to be brain dead. Secret Service should be too, because it took them a whole movie to put it together. There's no compelling characters in the movie (not the film). The pace of the film slowly, there is no voltage. Assassin excellent shot, if it is not directed at Michael Douglas, than all that he seems to be able to hit it big windows. The funniest scene in the film, when the president's wife said that the code word in the disappointing outcome. It is laugh out loud funny. At least six people got up and left the movie early. I would have joined them if I was not sitting in the middle of the series. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
