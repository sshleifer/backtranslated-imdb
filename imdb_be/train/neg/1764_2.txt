Although in many respects, I agree with the other reviewers comments. I believe that the story and the idea is very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this film by Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen, less talented "actor" How this person has never been in a movie or on television, I can not imagine. In my opinion, it would be better, as the majority in the Wal-Mart. In order to see people with this low level of talent involved in the payment of roles does beg the question ...... "Who does she know?" I would really like to see this movie made again with some talent. I do not blame the writer for the failure of this film is worth the time to view it.
