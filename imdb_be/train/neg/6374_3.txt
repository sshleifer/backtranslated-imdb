This film was littttle confusing at first. I usually like Gina Philips, but it is one I have to say that was a bad choice as well, as it makes the movie Ring Around the Rosie, that one is also not one of her good movies. Jeepers Creepers was much better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. It is completely creeped me in the end, it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cashier (Phillips), who comes to her twin sister's funeral. She stays in the house that her sister has her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is a kind of sacrificing their relationships, to stay alive, and as long as she wants to live, she can not die. Even if Jennifer is trying to kill her, she tries. The Ravens have a strange role in it. If the relationship is going to sleep, the Ravens have bodies there, so they can not go to sleep. But they do. Basically it's all crazy and Mary Ellen will never die, and her relationship will be buried, but not dead, b / c they have to suffer forever because Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yes, I hope it helps. If not, sorry. I love.
