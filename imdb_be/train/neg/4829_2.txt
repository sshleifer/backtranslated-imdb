As usual movie-watcher I can not say I enjoyed watching it. It's not too emotional for drama, not too exciting for a thriller, not too fast for the action. In addition, some moments of the film is hardly trustworthy. Well, I understand, the soldiers got a little out of his mind there, but it's hard to believe that people will risk their lives, CarJack in the middle of an enemy city, and after screaming wife professorial run without asking the question (properly). It would seem very romantic, if it was animation or so, but it must be a serious film about the war .. There are a few scenes like this, so that the whole picture gives the impression that it's just a raw preview of the movie, and she It needs considerable work. <br /> <br /> it feels like the film makers wanted to create an emotional image of the brave soldier, but all these "curves" of his psychology seem just unnatural. <br /> <br /> This picture has left a question in my mind: why? Why they gave him the Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO it is the most exciting part of the movie :)
