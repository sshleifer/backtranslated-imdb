Damaged worst so-called horror film I have ever seen. There's nothing remotely monstrous about it. He does not deserve to be in the genre so well. First of all, I do not understand how so many people may think this piece of shit such a big movie. If I wrote something as boring and quite ridiculous, as I would have laughed and too embarrassed to expose the other is stupidity. Secondly, the existing terrible and leading actress painfully ugly. Third: the story sucks, it is already used in the past, and the excuse that it cheapest film is not an excuse. Read Summery on the back of the case, he reveals the whole story. I do not recommend you to watch this movie, if you have 80 minutes to spend on something that will leave you wishing you were watching. I feel very bad for the crooks and the irony of their name. All hail Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
