First, let me start with a quote from a friend of mine said while watching the film: "The whole movie was supposed to be brave You know, like" Dude, I'm sure you could not make the worst film ever. "With the help of this. film, they made a good effort to achieve this rank. The effects, of course, bad. The story / dialogue as a collage of bits stolen from every horror movie ever made. The actors, I believe, is supposed to be in college. nevertheless, part of it (especially at the beginning) makes it seem like they should be in height hell or high school. It does not make any sense. Scarecrow going around killing people not in the least bit pleasant. (Spoiler :. In the end, if they chant the name of Leicester, and he re-appears, the black guy and the Scarecrow both laugh probably because of the help they were in last place, and cheesy dialogue)
