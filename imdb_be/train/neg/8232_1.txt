Five through the eye is not worth one of the wrist, I must admit to a certain point, I was really concerned about, in no noisy for about 30 seconds, and I thought that my speakers were blown, or that I was deaf to the constant shouting and high step scream, now I'm OK and speakers thanks for the question, oddly enough, that was the best bit of the film. <br /> <br /> I will not waste your time by telling you the story, read the other comments for that. <br /> <br /> If you have bought this DVD, but not yet unfolded it not to take it back and demand your money back, I wasted my not doing the same thing. <, Br /> <br /> I actually yelled at the TV, "they are here in the car, look at the world of camera, and the camera man to get first," I left the swear words from but you can guess where they're going. <br /> <br /> If someone would like to buy the film (a very good) it's your ten pounds.
