There is only one word for this film. Appalling. The director obviously has talent, but like his hero Robert Carmichael he throws it all away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has the potential, but as Cray, he can not be bothered to use it. Drawn into petty crime, and then descends into corruption Cray's vision of British youth. As British tabloids this film reflects young people without any aspirations and respect. Cray calls attention but deserves not. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by an act of violence that Cray chose to stick in the audience's faces. He believes that the audience does not know about the crimes of the world. As part of obscene graffiti on the toilet wall, it shows us the man's depravity with teenage fun. <br /> <br /> Some of the quality of the actors have small parts in the film. Danny Dyer and Lesley Manville how to make a short speech. Act differently amateur, young people, Joe and Ben are wince-making. Carmichael plays Danielle Spencer is terrible. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, attractive wife celebrity chefs Zhonaton (Michael Howe); she was able to expose themselves to such a test is beyond belief. The film is never thin and Monica were treated to the most gratuitous violence that cut war action. image of war is used to convey the idea that young people can not help themselves, that violence will occur over even "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and is a symptom of our changing society, where men are playing a less important position, but Cray sinks to the level of barbaric men it tends to put through its use of rigid and violent images. Female characters in the film do not offer any relief. They are either the victims or in the case of Manneville is washed mother. Community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is the first film Cray. I listened to what he had to say during the Q & A session on Edinburugh and he's not stupid, he just did not have enough experience and his film exposes his innocence. The film is due to be released later this year, but I hope that the company is bankrupt so the public does not need this kind of messed up the material.
