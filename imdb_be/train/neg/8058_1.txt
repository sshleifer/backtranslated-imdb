Seeing Dushku hot in fairly good Wrong Turn, I decided to pick this up, and the Return of the Living Dead, from all the movies. I have not seen that yet, but given that this is one of the most acclaimed horror films ever safe to say that I made the wrong choice. There's just nothing to recommend this film, and I'm talking about the alleged superior cut killer. He did not even youthful sexy mediocre bad movies, I know what you did last summer, or Valentine's or Urban Legend. He just does not make sense, do not keep the excitement, there were very few interesting acts or convincing letter. The release date has apparently been postponed several times for about a year in a row, and the reason is obvious. The entire film comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly, meaningless effect. Get Wrong Turn instead, if you want to see Dushku. I would like to see a movie with her super-hot Arnoux - but I do not think even that would have made the movie watchable. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunting, it's awful here - it seems to lack both wit and courage. That's enough on that.
