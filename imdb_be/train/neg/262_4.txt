Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. Nevertheless, I feel that he sold to get his first major role of lead budget. Foxx follows in the footsteps like Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Heron, who all saw their talents wasted stereotypical producer who think black men who commit crimes rather ridiculous concept (see: Money talks, Blue Streak). <br /> <br /> Well, I laughed a few times, and got all these funny comedian continue to pick up the role, but I would like to see these guys branch ala Wayans image Requiem for a Dream. Or Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans moving performances of live flowers in satire Spike Lee deceived.
