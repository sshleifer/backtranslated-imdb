There are often poorly matched pairs (in the general sense of the term) -in Huston film "The African Queen" "Heaven knows, Mr. Allison" "The Roots of Heaven," "the Misfits" ... "The Barbarian and the Geisha" (check the title) is another good example, so speak.It seems that Japanese stuff was fashionable while such works as "Sayonara is" "World of Suzie Wong" and "Teahouse of the month August" shows. Houston's efforts may be the worst of it is quite a lot of bad (except for "Susie" might be) .John Wayne fits perfectly into the world of the Ford, he was in Houston, like a bull in a china shop.His Japanese partner completely bland.Even dramatic scene (cholera epidemic) does not save the film from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those completely fascinated Huston every job you need to select it, among all its other remarkable films around.
