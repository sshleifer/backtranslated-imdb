Alone in the Dark is a kick in the nuts Uwe Boll to Hollywood after the House of the Dead Shot in the face. <br /> <br /> If something proves how uterine manipulator box. Artisan after forcing out of business after the flop, which was a dead house, one can only assume, as a rule, trust worthy Lion Gate Films just released AITD under contractual obligations after the acquisition of assets of the artisan. Since AITD is another great example of the total absence of a coherent set capacity, the plot exposition and just steal from other bad movies, because he was supposed to look cool, not because it is installed as part of the film. <br /> <br /> But then this thing is not it. Ball is not trying to make a coherent film, because it does not try to send the Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, as the House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are "declared" or "before the production." <br /> <br /> This is not the movies that will be sent, but the investment portfolios. Every one of them rushed into production on the basis that the tax laws Ball and investors exploit may be closed for the next 2 to 3 years. The more projects bombs he can release during this time frame, the more money he and his investors can get. Why make a good movie, if a bad movie makes you mint anyway? As a result, films such as horror Alone in the Dark. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, like all his other films simply cynical exploitation of the current Hollywood trend for lazy film. <br /> <br /> And those who support Boll, calling it misunderstood or next Ed Wood, congratulations, making a cult figure with a person, you just make it easier for him to get investors, but gives him fame. <, Br /> <br /> For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s = & threadid = +21699 as an aside, do not ask me how he gets his cast lists together.
