Okay, so, Chuck Norris had somehow found a way to get this extension is made. I have one question: Why? Those who have read the script and said, "Sound great! Original! "This film regurgitated crap that I would not sully his toilet bowel. Of course, that's another story, following the tradition of the Interior Ministry, the US invasion, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force, and so on, in which Chuck Norris, of course, is one person who can also America from some bad guys. He did not even need a gun in most cases. It's silly patriotic jargon that stales of mind. Big surprise, that the only one who will direct the film's son Chuck Norris, Eric. Eric Norris mainly worked on the films of his father, and television shows. Is not it strike anyone as a sign that he has no directorial talent? Afterall, it sends the same people as before, in the same story as before ... the only difference is the characters' names. If it is to make me patriotic and cheer for the US than our country is in a much worse state than I could have imagined. Hopefully, this will be the nail in the coffin of the current Chuck Norris.
