Oddly enough, despite the fact that he can make a "twine", Thomas full hard as an actor. <br /> <br /> This film is seared into my memory as one of the side splittingly cheese and incompetent movies I have ever seen. Thus, in fact I quite like it. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason it gets more than one star, Thomas great shape, and it's fun to see how his tiny, muscular body performs various gymnastic feats of skill in the unusually shaped rocks and poles, scattered about the Eastern European part of the country (including the infamous "Conan" in the form of a well cap in the middle of the village square, that Thomas uses to put his foot in the people of different crazy villagers). But let the poor guy to open his mouth and try to replay, and any illusion that he can have a film career immediately rushed to bits. <br /> <br /> Thomas at least had the excuse that he was not really an actor. Everyone else in the film - actors, director, editor, camera guys, and so, at least as bad, or even worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt entirely off quite as bad as you might think. <br /> <br /> I hope that the poor Kurt took the money and ran. If someone asks him to perform in the film of martial arts again, I'll bet that Thomas kicks the guy in the face.
