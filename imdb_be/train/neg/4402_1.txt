I usually like lesbian movies, even if they are not very good. I'm biased, I think! <br /> <br /> But this is only one pit. So, scenery and buildings are beautiful, and there is a short, but beautiful erotic interlude, but the rest of the movie is just a waste of time. Annamarie alternating between sulking and buzz / buzz / distributing any drug or drink comfortably, and Ella inexplicably put up with this disgusting behavior throughout the film. As soon as possible we have given any to understand why this is so, or even why Annamarie so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If at least it was some kind of closure to the (potentially romantic? We do not "do not even know!) the relationship between them may have been some kind of pleasure. But although Annamarie at one point asks Ella, "why do you love me?" Ella did not even acknowledge it. It is never quite clear whether something more than (badly behaved) lesbian boring road trip with a straight woman. < br /> <br /> Even the interaction between the two women and the locals they meet on the journey that might be a lively and informative, instead of flat, tedious and largely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is one good joke in the movie, although I'm sure it was unintentional. Women traveling in Two-seater Ford coupe with a trunk mediocre size. However, when they camped, they have a big tent, cots, sleeping gear, and even a desk, chair and typewriter! Also, when they board the ferry, we see piles of luggage, presumably, they apparently also carry in the trunk of a small Ford! <br /> <br /> And through the whole movie, we never see a gas station or anywhere that looks like it was on In fact there is any place to buy gasoline. Basically, they pass through endless miles of desert wilderness. So where do they get the fuel? <br /> <br /> There can not be too many lesbians films there, good or bad, but there are many that are better than this, and very little worse. Leave one rack.
