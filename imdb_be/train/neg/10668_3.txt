This movie had some great actors in it! Unfortunately, they forgot how to act. I hoped that the film would be better as it went, but the action was so robotic, he was doomed from the start. In fact it turned out that perhaps the actors read from the script all the time. Maybe it was a musical score or the director, but one thing is for sure Grimm artist should get another job! Face powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces! I would not recommend this film to anyone, not surprisingly, did not get in the theater. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods shame on you guys, not to give it your all. The plot was big just need a lot more.
