I do not know who is to blame, Miss Lee and her director, but her performance as Katharine almost impossible to watch. Ben Chaplin on the other hand, does a fine job - against all odds, as far as I'm concerned. His character entirely too charming and attractive. but, of course, it does not show how greedy enough to put up with the stupidity of the character Leia. Chaplin is confused by the fact that it can not be understood as Leigh shyness and lack of affection, and her orthopedic precariousness. There has to be some element of credibility to his advantage, but as played incomprehensible. Submission does not fit. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney, of course, well, despite all efforts to thwart them. The supporting cast is also nice to look at. What a pity, also, the wires do not work together, because the production of a pleasure to watch.
