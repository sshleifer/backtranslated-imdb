It was the biggest movie I've ever seen? No. It was the worst? No. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four children, nice to see something that was easy and fun. It was great, but it was cute. <br /> <br /> I think it definitely had some room for improvement, but he tried. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this movie deserves an extreme level of violence by another reviewer. They obviously do not care about Eva Longoria. I think it was better in this than in The Sentinel. I think that cinema is a matter of opinion. Actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop. <br /> <br /> Maybe the actors failed. Maybe there were too many things going on. <br /> <br /> I just want to talk to the average movie, but not terrible one. It may just be chick flick. Kind of like the movie Split-Up or French kissing. My husband still talks about them. :)
