Absolutely terrible movie. Complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> background music so loud that you can not understand it. Well, if you really listen carefully to what they say is really unclear. <br /> <br /> The camera work is bad, NO editing, background score gives a headache, the effect of rubbish, incomprehensible dialogue, acting pitiful and well Karina used to look like a fighter, now she looks like a starving fighter. Hell, you can lose weight, but you can not get the grace. <br /> <br /> After spending three hour preview of the film I want to like it, but this film does not even allow me the pleasure. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, go ahead to look at it.
