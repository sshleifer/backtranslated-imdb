About the only thing I needed was another film of the nineteenth century in England. That pretty much like a regular England, only nobody vandalism football stadiums.In a picturesque setting ruling, women and other randomly selected names, Charlotte Gainsbourg walking aimlessly, like Jane Eyre, this novel no one will ever read willingly.Jane usually dangles in the crib Mr.Rochester, where she tries to teach French girl looking at a blank board time.One all day, Mr.Rochester (William Hurt on autopilot) returns to fall in love with Jane and all that, but there is still the issue of his wife cake, locked in attic.Oops, that was not in some brochure.After eople throw around, and some carefully spread the fire (they probably rented a suite), the film finally comes to end.Everything looked exactly true, that's what I did again guess.But, nah.
