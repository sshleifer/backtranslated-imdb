I actually did not finish the film. You can say that in this case, I have no right to consideration, especially so negatively. But I, only because I stopped him on account of I could not look more ... I'm in the middle, and I was just there, promising myself that something good was just around the corner. This film is so tedious, so dim that I was really insulted. I have not read many other reviews, so I'm not sure there are other gay teenagers who are affected by it, but I'm gay, and I go through a "similar" revelations, day dream, problems, etc. etc. . It was perhaps two moments when I really felt that this film could go somewhere where I felt that it might have some hint of meaning, the theory of relativity, but these hopes were dashed at the moment , the following set of clichés chained narration came on. I mean, just look at the quote on IMDb page. Unfortunately, you will not be able to hear the creaking of playing back or echo-ey disappears, if you just read the quotes because they are just too painful / funny / stupid to miss. I give the film three stars, and all three of these stars go to the movies filmmakers, who did a fantastic job, which is trying to turn the tired "concept" Archer into something watchable. Mind you, I beg you, he was not the one who decided to include all the long shots television ... even close-ups unnecessary clichés already made in films like Gummo Karin ... I think it is very useful that the the film premiered at Sundance (only because Archer had ties to the festival through volunteer work he did, by the way ...), because the Sundance, it seems, is one festival where heavy cliché nonsense, as it is still considered " arthouse ". No, this is not art house, I'm afraid that's just out-house ** t. Do not look.
