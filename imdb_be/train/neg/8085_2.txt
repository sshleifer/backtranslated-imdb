About fun! Oh joy! Another film that is so bad it's good! Or so I thought. In fact, this one by "so bad its good" phase and is, unfortunately, just to "could be so bad, it is good, but they harmed and made it clear bad." <br /> <br /> To begin with it too long. Cut half an hour, and it might be more tolerant. Then put in these funny stories, as "a person who sabotages the mission to save the Earth, because it has all the food collected and it will be rich if the mission can not be!". Duh!. Or "speak bomb" plot device last seen in the Dark Star. Guess what .... the same as in the Dark Star, a bomb there is a fault ..... hmmm. Add a dash of "we can not work our way out of kindergarten games" and you have a sunny crisis in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> Easy terrain will be in the form of Jack Palance (jack or trousers, as we called it in this film), whose sole purpose in the film drive the child in the desert and on the phone baby daddy to come pick him up. ... in the end. Between management and phone calls, Jack gives meaningless nonsense and Leers and giggles a lot, but contributes little to the story, such as it is. In short, he's the best bits of the film. <br /> <br /> my award for "The most ironic reflected Straight-Faced" goes to Charlton Heston, who at a meeting of his eldest son for the first time in ages, said that his son is a bit "out of shape" while how he stands there with his guts bulging over his belt and in dire need of the captain Kirk corset. <br /> <br /> Also funny bad guy top henchman, which has a bright white hair that kept making me think of Andy Warhol, for some reason. <br /> <br /> In addition to these hilarities, there is little to recommend this film. The ending sequence is copied from (but fortunately shorter) end of the sequence since 2001 <br /> <br /> Tips to enjoy this film more if you're foolish enough to look like I did: <br /> <br /> 1. Every time a bomb says, imagine, this is called Tarquin (Trust me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. Every time Chuck Heston on the screen and say, beat him, uttering the line from the planet of the apes, such as "Take your dirty paws off me!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Every time a woman looking stressed lead (this is most of the time) to keep hoping that she aneurysm and die soon. <br /> <br /> 4. During the endless "ship again broke the" scene, continue to rely on the technical / engineering guys will spout on Scotty Ismail as the "Cannes you change the laws of physics!" or some such shit. <br /> <br /> In addition, do what you need to get you through it. I fell asleep halfway through and woke up to realize that I do not miss anything and did not have a story (funny, though it is) extended any. So do not worry about setting up a few, you do not miss anything.
