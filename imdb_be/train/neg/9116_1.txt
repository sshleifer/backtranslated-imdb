There is not one decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams provides one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. The guy plays Sebastian sucks, too. He was not even very similar to Philip. More Joshua Jackson. Two other girls were badly as well. <br /> <br /> Then dialogue and shit <br /> <br /> Sebastian (About to have a threesome). If you can not beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin: Who says you can not beat them? <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> ending is contrary to the whole plot of the original. In the first film, it makes it clear that Catherine and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons why Sebastian would like Katherine is so bad, except for the fact that it is played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, she was "the only girl he could not have killed him." She was a bully who liked to play with him. The fact that she never gave him increased his desire. Then in this P.O.S., this means that he can have it together with the girl on the side. What? And we do not even see the floor, either. This implies that it does not only stupid, pointless and contradictory, but it is worthless too. <br /> <br /> And in the first, Katherine denies Sebastian because he fell in love, that makes him a loser. Despite the fact that he won the bet that crumbled his chances. Then in the feces, he loses and falls. So she did not screw "losers", only total lost? Another thing: he said that Sebastian had never been in love, so that you call the thing with a virgin <br /> <br /> Then in the end, a virgin girl all of a sudden opened the evil lesbian lover Katherine? (Dun dun dun) and, as I have said, they go to the lame voiceover three. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other storylines contradictions. Perhaps the writer even see the first film? At 5 years old can show their stuff out. <br /> <br /> After threesome, Sebastian has sex with virgin blond, corrupt its innocent mind at the rear of the limousine while Catherine and virgin chiseled wicked lesbiyanki in Lame sudden turn sit in front of the plot, listen and smile crossly into the chamber. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> Seeing Sebastian became the anus, he was in the first would make an interesting film. I think, all it took to make a small Sebastian bad threesome with two hot girls. That's interesting.
