Richard Dreyfuss is not a star here. It has about 20 three second Kama and Gene Barry is doing in all this movie? I do not know the director was probably not his brother! This is a film that makes no sense. Improper writer / director (the same man) was divided into the talent of each of its horrible um ... work. I got the DVD for a penny, so can not complain! But it's weird! And it makes you feel weirded out, and not better. It was in the 70s, and looks like the director was in a bad acid trip, and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be in his head. It has some interesting and controversial concept, but as a scratched record, he quickly plays a foul. It has that "Manson family on acid" vibe to it. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the other reviewer got all that they have done from this film? Maybe they worked it back when? In any case, be prepared to lose 80+ minutes of your life you'll never get back. Yes, it is awful!
