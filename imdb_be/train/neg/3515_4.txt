Basically, the typical propaganda film for the last good war. But there were a few things that struck me. First, it was the use of epithets mouths. In two cases, the nature of their mouths Scott alone, once in the beginning, when he released the bomb from the target during a bomb-off ( «Dammit») and one time when he was trying to shake the scorer become a pilot ( "s *% t"). I I could be wrong about the second instance, but I replayed it several times, and that's what it seems to me. The third case, when the character Anne Shirley O'Brien wants character goodbye and good luck ( "Give 'em hell"), covering the roar of engines. it should Had she thought it was too unconventional, because it clearly says "the devil." I also found an interesting ha raktar having moral problems with the bombing, in particular the bombing of civilians. The meek senior officer assures him that only military targets will be surprised because of the accuracy of sight is used. Given what we know about the late Lemay strategy of bombing of Japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays a little irony. I remember McNamara quoting LeMay in the "fog of war", something that if the US did not win a conflict, it will be tried as a war criminal. Ending a way overwrought, according to the film. It reminded me a bit of the end of White Heat (I do not compare movies, only the ending!). Maybe it's just because it gets blown up. A blow to the very good !!!
