Its written S-A-A-C-H-E-P-C. I was happy when the protagonist flashed a fool. It was pretty tight. Before and after this film quite a lot of punches. It acts as E-sheet, and this is well shown in the film. Not to mention it is so low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are playing one and the same person. The whole movie looks like it was filmed with a video camera instead of half way decent movie. The only other reason I liked the movie because Chainsaw Charlie and Dr. Ripper was funny. They said a lot of stupid things that made me laugh. In addition, if you see this movie in Blockbuster do a favor to hide it for Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks that this movie is good to be mentally evaluated.
