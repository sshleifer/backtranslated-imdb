I thought I was pretty boring, especially when I look at the big touching and tear-jerking films. But not for this (which surprised me!), And it is also very strange to me to see how many people rated this movie so much <br /> <br /> There are some disturbing facts for films :. 1. In spite of the guilt -ridden real Ben intention to save 7 lives to atone for the past, I believe it is worried that the film seems to encourage this type of suicidal actions. Some people can take it a heroic act, and some others believe that he is cowardly, in the end, it was the action chooses for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The story line of the film to dramatize, but logic is overly simplified. From a medical point of view, the blood match is required to be an organ donor. Toward the end of the film, we learn that Emily was a rear view of the blood, which limited her chances of getting a donor in a short period of time. Nevertheless, it seemed that Ben had a rare blood type, the same as hers, which allowed him to become a donor and comfortable, despite the rarity of the blood of Ben, he was able to sacrifice not only my heart, but also kidney his corneas and bone marrow, which in all cases need not only the appropriate blood type, but tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why doctors allow Ben organs donated, despite the Medusa poison he used to kill himself? <br /> <br /> I could be more analysis of the entire history of how, after all this is just a movie. However, some disturbing facts set out above, we hope, will help you reconsider your plan to go see this movie. If you go for the type of soap opera movie, go for it. But you go looking for intellectual entertainment, to give it a miss!
