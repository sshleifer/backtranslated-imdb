Let me say how much I love the show. Despite the tragic nature of the middle-aged man, seemingly unable to continue their dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, he was incredibly light-hearted and fun to look at practice. In my opinion, this is without a doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The series has a rating of 10 out of 10 without reservations. <br /> <br /> This film spin-off, on the other hand, it is a real tragedy, in every sense of the word. Hardly anyone from the essence of the TV show successfully transferred to film. This film is very dark, depressing tone that almost touched me to tears several times. See Harold beaten in a pub (not fun), this is not my idea of ​​a comedy, but it's definitely one of the reasons why fans of the series will not like this film. The film was painfully unfunny for a scene where Albert bathed in the sink and saw the neighbor, except. <br /> <br /> romance between Harold and Zita completely with tons and it makes me wonder whether the film producers ever bothered to watch the show. In the series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not a stripper. <br /> <br /> Albert reactions to comments made against him friends of Harold were absolutely invaluable in the series. In the film, Albert does not say almost anything when the opportunity rises. <br /> <br /> Most of the films of British comedy side, as a rule, rather dull, with the notable exception of the bus on lines (which in some respects was actually better than the series!). But Steptoe and Son must rank right at the bottom of the heap, even lower than George and Mildred <br /> <br /> My advice -. Skip this and see the second spin-off, Steptoe and Son RIDE TIME instead. It has a lighter tone, more faithful show, and actually very funny.
