Prior to this release, Lastet had this to say about the original 1973 :. "It's amazing how many people say it is their favorite sound track I like, let you can not, like new, but if it's your favorite soundtrack! I do not know if I want * you like my film. " <br /> <br /> Neil words. You can sit down for it too; as the Lord says Summerisle, blows so much better absorbed with the knees bent. Look, Neil, the thing about the original that the soundtrack of Paul Giovanni is one of the most famous things about him. The creators of the film is considered a virtual music. Together with Richard and Danny Thompson and Bert Jansch, virtually kick the 1970s Folk New Wave. In order to blow it like presenting Jaws without John Williams. Or Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly. As a result, one of the most amazingly arrogant, pointless remake of the British cult, as Sly Stallone Get Carter. <br /> <br /> Initially, apparently, left Nicolas Cage's "restless within two weeks." So disturbed, during this two-week window that he pitched the idea of ​​again representing one of the most detailed movies of interfaith struggle ever devised for writer-director, formerly known her completely unsubtle image of male chauvinism. It's like a game parlor, what you get if Sam Peckinpah took Bambi? Gaspar or "irreversible" Noe remade Love Actually? (In fact, I would very much like to see that). Unfortunately, someone took this game seriously interior: All-LaBute's got to do torn from the bowels of the original, and saddled it with their stupid worries Paul War <br /> <br /> After a failed attempt to rescue a little girl and her mother with. accident with a fatal outcome vehicle, highway patrol Cage medication spirals in a stupor. Then he receives a letter from ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (these trades on behalf of the prestige of honor), now lives on a private island community Summersisle ?? that extra "s" means "extra" ?? and wants Edward to help find missing daughter Rowan. <br /> <br /> Summersisle, it turns out, is a female-dominated joint, which is a refuge for the oppressed women and refugees from the witches of Salem. Here matriarchs observe the way Olde, and few men are almost dumb rock-Mulla. It's like Lilith Fair on a large scale. The main export Summersisle is honey ?? symbolic and literally a headache for Edward because he is allergic to bee. "Beekeepers" exclaimed Edward. "They seem to be everywhere on the island!" Well, it's probably because the main export Summersisle is honey. <br /> <br /> In making their research, Edward overheard from approaching Mayday ritual called "the time of death and rebirth." He discovers the previous year's harvest failed; almost dying from bee stings; and eventually came to the conclusion (conclusion which admittedly can not be more obvious when the locals tattoo events schedule on the back of his hand) that Rowan would be burned alive in a pagan rite, to ensure a good harvest. He is also in charge of the hive queen, Summersisle sister (Burstyn), who has his own plans for his participation eponymous Wicker Man "drone must die.» <br /> <br /> Firstly, the good news is that any problems will be transferred from the Cage burning sponges wicker Man at the last minute fleet of black helicopters CIA may be buried: he toast. That's what the good news. "It's a story whose chapters were carefully written," announces Burstyn with sublime irony. While maintaining the basic premise of cat and mouse (loans and typography), which remain subject to the original scorched-earth policy. <br /> <br /> Crucial to the original script Schaeffer that his Christian copper, according to the ritual, came to the island of their own free will ?? and most importantly, was a virgin; perfect sacrifice. When the reduction in sexual matters, as opposed to the religious struggle for power, LaBute is inconclusive classifiers to collect the victim's harvest. By the time Cage was working, he was the bait, you truly could not care less <br /> <br /> And Cage is one of the worst things in this. lumbering, dragging ass ?? arsewit whose language seems just a little too big for his mouth. «Goddamit» he groans after he hallucinates Rowan drowned, with all the mental anguish the man who put him in the morning alarm clock for half an hour, an hour too early. It is hoped that this part of the curve of his character to the tablet, which reduced him to this state ?? alternately tired and then complete a neat, powerful Vim. If so, then that's great image with inconspicuous IQ confused with antidepressants. If not ?? It does not bear thinking. As Willow, saucer eyes Bihan is just as bad, presenting her line, as if in competition with Cage for ?? the most ?? a half ?? delivery. Although Burstyn completely absent mercury threat to convince. Who's afraid of Naomi Wolf? <br /> <br /> All the elements that made the original great ?? Careful detailed depictions of folk customs, brilliant score, dialogue (Lord Summerisle majestic "You did it beautifully!" Have been replaced by a much less attractive, "You did it perfectly!" Whoah, dude!) ?? They were replaced with winding battle-of-sex thriller with a few Wallop crash explosion. Namely, beating women; This film LaBute, in the end. Sister Beech bashing Cage only one of the most embarrassing episodes; helpless little men will be hooting with joy how their brazen hippie chicks finally got what we come to the «Em, hyuk hyuk. <br /> <br /> Closing the code to see the whole rotten mess of crumbling under the weight of clichés of the genre: the bar, two men run into a couple of Summersisle girls on beach holidays, flirty fishing fresh martyrs. At the time of their successful pick-up, you half expected the woman to turn and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera <br /> <br /> Another thing :. Captured credit observers may have noticed that movies sports an unusually high number (manufacturer's nothing to 10), as a rule, not a lot of Cop. The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total.
