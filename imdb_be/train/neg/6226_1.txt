I tightened all the way through the film. First of all, moronic story has little to do with their own history of Parsons. Hollywood has tried to create a sort of comedy car chase movie. Imagine Â«Englebert Sings Hendrix." <br /> <br /> Do not take anything about the movie, to be precise. Parsons name in the title and stealing his body is only used as a springboard for a low budget movie chase, the blatant attempts to grab a few dollars from the legacy of Parsons and his supporters. Gram's father died long ago in 1973, other global symbols are fictitious, all this has nothing to do with Grams of life or death. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Gram, I advise you not to see this movie. I would like not. It's sad to see something special treated as such disgrace feed. I swear I could hear Gra turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with the life and legacy of Gram, do not take anything in this film as a representative c. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram were alive and saw this film, he committed suicide. Then again, maybe he would have been afraid, if he knew that this film would lead.
