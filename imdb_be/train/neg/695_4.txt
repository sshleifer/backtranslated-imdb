I've heard so much about this movie, like it was a big chopper, and one of the early '80s films that most tenacious supporters chopper films just had to see. Well, I rented it and I must say that even though it all my attention, as far as the unknown is for most slasher movies such as "April Fool's Day", "Friday the 13th" and "the Prom Night," the film would have rights there from above only he lacked the enthusiasm and the true potential of the characters, as well as the transition of history. Characters that I found were unlucky to be in this film was a pervert guy with curly hair that kept creeping around the hostel and, of course, leading to his current role of climate in the end, he is faced with a murderer. Still dirty scruffy-looking guy with a denim jacket, he could play several roles in this film that could make the film more interesting, but the movie was playing this guy as just another loser to do there unknown calls while he is sleeping with his girlfriend, and then delivers it part and does not interrupt it until the end, which was a waste, I was disappointed in his turn, in the end. How true identity of the killer is when the person has been released as to who he was, I just laughed, but it was obvious, and it really made a real breakthrough in the same way as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed. This film should have one at least once to look for all slasher fans, but do not spend your hard-earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory.
