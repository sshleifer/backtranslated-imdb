Shazbot, it is inconvenient. In fact, here is a list of 100, which is confusion: 1.) an unsuccessful return of Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels basically plays the same role he played in a live 101 Dalmatians remake, which was not too juicy to start with. He sure has a funny way to promote his Theater Purple Rose Theatre ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4) another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn Disney that Jet Li was Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) Ray Walston, of the original Martian television series, playing a cameo role (see "cameo") in this film and died two years later of lupus. Coincidence? 6.) terrible effects. Seriously - awful. 7.-100.) That damn conversation, farting suit sounded irritable degree in Wayne Knight ( «Newman»). My favorite scene? HA! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ... Phew! ... Good one. You - You're a joker. Okay, let's finish this review with a minute of silence painful death of the franchise, and if you want, you can say a little prayer that Disney does not forget this travesty and do something stupid, like the film version of «Mork & Mindy," starring Tim Allen .. ........................................... ....... .....
