I'm not sure if the filmmakers were after drinking type of movie or 12 angry men (people bonding facts to get to the truth). Whatever it was, it was poorly made and not worth watching. <br /> <br /> I do not watch movies for blood and gore, but because this film was little else going for it, he would have to show the real murder more. Most of them were outside the chamber, minimizing the horror that we had to feel the death <br /> <br /> In addition, I was listening, that a police officer was among the victims. he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man who was in prison, having planted evidence (given to him by MJH) in the actual room. (And do not MJH and the prosecutor have access to this evidence - taking it and put the wrong data back - in any case, so that she would not have needed the help of the police?). The others, while often not realizing that it was this man, they were hurting, still played a significant role in its eventual demise. Gun dealer must know his weapon will be used for malicious intent. Insurance man rejected the person, obviously, needs, etc. But the offense COP seemed insignificant in comparison, since he did not know what he was doing. The filmmakers could take it a step further and made him to be the one who called MJH planted evidence that would make it a criminal. And MJH yelling that he (the police) got her that disorder does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> It would have been more intriguing when one person died in a way that suggested another clue to why he / she was there, and deserves to die. The insurance guy, for example, might have application, it did not take rammed his throat so that he choked them; Oriental woman she could have her eyes gouged out, because she was a false witness, etc. Thus, the stronger the gun death, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not witty, were not swirling, and the end was one of the worst (if not the worst) I've ever seen. End of knocked three stars on my rating. <br /> <br /> The actors do a decent job, especially considering the distorted lines and motivation they had to work with. <br /> <br /> In general, the waste of time.
