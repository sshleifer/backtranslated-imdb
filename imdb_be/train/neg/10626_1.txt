This film is based on a biscuit as soon as you put any physical evidence of this continuity is lowered slowly into the big pile of shit, for example, Bart Sibrel states that they must have had a few light sources, as the shadow seems to cross if it would not matter whether two or more shades for each object when the Apollo 11 passed through the van Allan belts of radiation that they spent 30 minutes there 90 min stated in the film, and they got a radiation dose of more the same , HP x-ray. <br /> <br /> seriously do some research to find out what really happened does not let a bunch of shit documentary sculpt their opinions about what really happened
