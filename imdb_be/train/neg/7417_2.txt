This film is so bad - the dialogue, the story, the actors and actresses - all! - it is difficult to imagine that we will see the worst movie of this year or in subsequent years. "Brother Love" (set in Australia among the Italian immigrants) has nothing but small clich√© of Italian culture to offer, and it is quite significant that even the Italians from Italy and speak English in the film. Message of the movie - ugly people should marry the ugly people, beautiful people should marry beautiful people - it's really disappointing. Giovanni Ribisi good enough in such films as "The Suburbs" and "Lost in Translation", but then his pseudo-Italian accent is difficult to bear. Watch this movie on your own risk. Trash in the trash!
