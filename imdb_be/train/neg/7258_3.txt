This granular film has a cult and one of these functions, by word of mouth, you just had to see. It may be hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwest Arkansas, Fawqa, he knows the legend is true. This story is told in a documentary style, narrated by Vern Stierman and shot in real locations, talk with real people that are involved. Legend changes from speaking, but at the end of 60th year, and most of the 70s Fawqa surrounding area visited Bigfoot-like creature, who traveled to Marsh Creek. Long limbs with three fingers and standing over 7 feet tall, hairy creature is periodically damaged and scared out «bejeebers» majority of the population. Personally, I crossed a small bridge Boggy Creek in 1974, and the hair on the back of his head made the rise. Of course, it was about 1 am in the rain. By the time I arrived in Shreveport, I laughed.
