This is exactly the kind of Saturday matinee serial I liked during the Second World War. I am ten years old. And this audience, this series has been developed. Looking at him now, one has to growl at his ineptitude and stupidity. The budget should be almost nothing, considering the labels and repetitions. Actions? Well, this picture republic, 1944. They read line .... and without a doubt it was one take to make them convincing. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars.
