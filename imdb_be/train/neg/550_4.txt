After a great Aankhen (2002), which was a remake of the game guzharatskoy it comes from the station, which also looks like a stage play <br /> <br /> In the plays characters we cry, replays are the same <br /> <br /> The first half shows Amitabh almost joking on 40+ Akshay Kumar, who works too funny, like a little wise guy <br /> <br /> film has a good message as not to spoil your son, but unfortunately, as Amitabh wants Akki responsibility to make absolutely false <br /> <br /> Even his reason for hiding his illness, his runnign from the hospital and melodramatic speech A ki is postponed <br /> <br /> Some emotions do affect you, but most of them are too over the top <br /> <br /> comedy is Razhpal oars, but it is too stretched in the second half <br / > <br /> direction of Vipul Shah's too exaggerated, even though some of the scenes of good music is good <br /> <br /> Among the actors Amitabh overdoes it in the first half, but perfectly in emotional scenes, Akshay Kumar is also doing its part well, but looks umcomfortable some too small river scene His chemistry with Bachchan perfectly Razhpalo is an event, it is ca. Chez you laugh without overplay and only his presence and his silent and peaceful conduct of humor he riot Bohm good in some parts of the comic, but too loud in places Priyanka is the heroine so do nothing, it is not her last film with acca still Shefali is awesome, she looks too young for the Bachchan
