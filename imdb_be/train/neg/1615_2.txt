The same type of Che. He completely ignored the really interesting facts about the true character of Che. Sodeberg remade the same sad story about Che. Silly seductive tale of Argentine rich-boy who was so overwhelmed by poverty he became a Robin Hood fights with the poor, yet in the end he was killed by the CIA. Yeah, yeah, we heard it all before, boring and lie!. The reality of Che Guevara is very different and much more explosive! These facts indicate that he was the Messiah totalitarian contract who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny in the world. He was so fanatical that the hottest point in the Cold War, he even asked the Soviet Union nuke New York, Washington and Los Angeles, and lead to the end of the world. Dream urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack on US cities. For the rest of his life, he said that if his finger was on the button, he pushed her. If Khrushchev waste and literally saved the world, Che was furious at the "betrayal". If Che's recommendations have been implemented, you would not be reading this review now. Like a maniac became an icon of pop I would have made much more interesting film. Incredibly, that no director was not daring enough to show the real side of Che and his posthumous transformation of media. What would make Oscar movie! I thought I was doing an independent film meant adopting the real risks and be GROUNDBRAKING! They only follow "safe topics counterculture", namely, "Che cool", "Wall Street's bad", "Republican = Nazi", "former Bush Hitler", "NRA worse KGB", "Christian bigots and stupid "etc ... classified ad nauseam. Ooooh as brash as scary. Tres anti-mainstream and stressful. I wish they would have had some real cojones and solve Independent Film oligarchy! That would be really brave!
