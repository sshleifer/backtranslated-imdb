I caught it on the screening test. All I can say is: What ... the ... hell? This film played about as smoothly as Mickey Mouse, reading the script for «Scarface». It's amazing what makes the least sense; and even if you leave your brain in the car, the film is still so strange, it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> The plot includes a crocodile hunter Steve Irwin is trying to "save" the crocodile, which includes the CIA probe. CIA comes after Irwin to get them back to the probe, Irvine mistakes them for poachers and sets out to "stop" them <br /> <br /> That's the story there. the rest is a top-lampooning of Australian culture ( «Didja see dat?" and «Crikey!») and amazingly choreographed action sequences. At some point, Irwin mounts excess rate RV and knife fights with a CIA agent on top. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin knife fights the guy on top RV. Let this be your guide to this ridiculously bad movie.
