Revenge of the Sith begins with a long sequence of actions, which strikes without being too scary, it becomes very sad for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dull dialogue and mismanagement that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the production is slow - and I mean slowly - increasing to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when he finally comes, it's very good. Not great. not even good. But very good. This film is much more than praise, because it does not absorb the high heavens, like the previous continue. Instead, he simply pompous, dull and routine. But you have to say, wow, these CGI environment is truly impressive at times. Bu in Lightsabre fight? They were all greased mess. I think that the dark side has Lucas, when he started the sequel, and no one noticed. This will make a lot of money, but, thank God, it's over, it once worshiped franchise was beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after that, I heard a group of very young children, they say, wow, that was awesome! But all older than eight years, all complained about the same thing, I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of sad. I just thought that saw the birth of Darth Vader will be better. So say we all.
