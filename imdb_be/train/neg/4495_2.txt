Interference of both this and The Matrix follow. <br /> <br /> I like the original matrix a lot. It was not a deep film, despite attempts Fishburne to philosophize, but it was a pretty good walk, fun, and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong fights. <br /> <br /> In the original Neo was the secret of life with a rather unfortunate cubes employee Andersen. In the afternoon, a corporate drone, and at night, the brave hacker. In the end, he finally forced to choose between the lives of their actions. - he becomes an outlaw fighting vehicle, or he goes back into the safe, forgets the world, he began to wonder if he discovers that once one devoid of illusions life, sucks. He has a girl next to him and his drinking buddies, but he eats processed swill Dress for sweat, and lives in a really skungy bit machines. However, the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of the first film was in "what if it was me," the issues raised in the mind of the viewer. What if _I_ can not possible? What if I was «The One . "he does not even important that you are one of the examples, with a cool name like this. <br /> <br /> in addition, agent Smith has made a great bad guy, he embodied all the power of fear, we carry with us. He was unstoppable as the terminator, and ruthless. <br /> <br /> at the end of The Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix, to share his good news freedom. <br /> <br /> This film is not able to fully implement the ideas of the original film, and does so with a lack of appetite, as bad as bad writers and editors, I can not believe that they planned these changes. If the dialog is in the fifth grade level, with a variety of long words dropped at random, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they say <br /> <br /> My short list of failures characterization :. <, Br /> <br /> in Oracle is moderately useful if false to completely obstructionist no real reason <br /> <br /> The main "face" of the matrix is ​​introduced without the need -. keymaster in, for example, it was a cute idea, but it just is not interesting character. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses his "advisor" role, and gets nothing to replace it. <br /> <br /> Sun Zion people especially nice, is not it really _want_ their launch world <br /> <br /> The special effects are a problem :. <br /> <br /> fight scenes and senseless intermitable. In a matrix, you feel Neo can lose, and that he was supposed to be something more in order to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, it is just a point of view of the nature of particularly bad constructed video games. <br /> <br /> The fight on the highway looked completely fake, and not that interesting. <br /> <br /> stimulation. problems <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the fight scenes are very long <br /> <br /> rave continued for too long. - all in my row in the theater watching the clock. Not because we are opposed to good dancing and good orgy, but because we do not know about the people depicted, and do not care. <br /> <br /> What would Haq wrote a monologue creator should be blacklisted from the business. She writhed, to use the words that the writer obviously did not understand, and it's a waste of time and stepping killer. We are the creator could be done in a tenth the time, and with greater danger, as "there is Zion, to give the rebels a place to go, so they do not destroy the Matrix There are currently too many people who do not believe ,. matrix in danger of crashing and killing each person connected to it. In addition, the land can not support the people in Zion, not to mention the other. You can choose one person from Zion, to form the new Zion, while I erase the memories of the people currently in the Matrix ". <br /> <br /> Instead, we got a long, drawn out a bunch of talk. If someone claims that is deep, ask for the transcript, and try to break the sentences. Each of them is too long, a few points, and use words with clearer, shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> So, in general, it is not necessary see. <br /> <br /> I saw a third, and, despite the fact that a number of the reviewers offer , Skip it. It does not save the turkey. <br /> <br /> reviewers, who believe that the second and third films were "deeply" should go out and see some really deep movies. Maybe read a book or two in the rhetoric and discussion, and perhaps a bit of philosophy. this film is simply not difficult to understand, but it's hard to stomach. <br /> <br /> Scott
