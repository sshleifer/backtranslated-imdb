This is the first time I ever saw a movie with Jamie Foxx and I bet it will be my last. I could not understand why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or saying "I'm going to take a showerÂ» <br /> <br /> plot is quite predictable. . the bad guy comes after a good guy. nice guy is a woman, so that the bad guy uses it. At the time of screwing officials. The final scene is absolutely incredible. you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing the guy, but you do not your homework to solve the puzzle trivial? <br /> <br /> There's no big d ny, there is not much plot or story and pictures are taken at MTV style. Do not waste your money on it. <br /> <br />
