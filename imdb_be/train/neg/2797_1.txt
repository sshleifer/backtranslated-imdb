I'm a big fan of the horror genre! I love horror / slasher / gore clicks all kinds. Some of my favorites are the really "good" bad horror movies. But this movie has nothing to justify this view !! I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that had happened to him. <br /> <br /> reverse scenario. Effective inverse. FX is not even worth discussing. "Install" is an absolute joke !! The sad thing is, I think there may be some real potential in the pair of actors, but this car did not leave them anything to work with !!! <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that I saw it on the "free" and feel like I was robbed !! The time that you would waste watching it would be better to spend flossing your cat.
