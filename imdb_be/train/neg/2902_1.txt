Spoiler: Bunch of passive-aggressive people with a family reunion. The script they say and do things that people will never do, at least, who are with the thread of decency. The hero falls in love with a woman he sees as his soul mate in a bookstore on the day of the reunion, not knowing that it will show up as the girlfriend of his brother at the reunion. He is trying to move to the claim of his brother, but she knew that our hero is clearly infatuated with her, she teases him mercilessly to wear sexy clothes and act like a stripper, rubbing around his brother to trick the grounds that she shows him how to stretch. At one point, she actually undresses and gets into the shower with him. He's trying to cover his eyes. His heart is broken. She thinks it's funny until she suddenly decides that she does not want to leave and brother reunion. <br /> <br /> The film really admire. The audience coughed and fidgeted his way through a long distance. Drafting stupid and unbelievable. We almost left, but thought, of course, something happens that would liven things up, but Nooooo. All the great reviews must be written Shills paid, to cheat the poor fuckers how I see shit like this. Comparing it to the Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, writers, actors, producers, as well as theaters for giving nothing wrong to do it on the screen!
