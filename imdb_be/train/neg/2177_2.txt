The first noticeable problem about this awkward under the name of the film is its cast. Ann Nelson plays a grandmother here. Three years after that, she will star in "Airplane!" As a woman who hanged herself while listening to Robert Hays pine for Julie Hagerty. I could not get that image out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is fifteen years with problems. He has headaches. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather was a massive heart attack. Chain smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the devil with this family. First, she hypnotizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells the story in flashbacks, which fills the entire first half of the film. <br /> <br /> She and my grandfather bought a RV, cheap, and drive it around all the tourist traps in the California desert. RV quickly has its own mind, coming from the road and such. Then large boulders start rushing at him. Mature pairs are respectively fear but stay in the car to move along the portion. <br /> <br /> In the end, Grandpa has a heart attack after the rocks on the RV roof, when he goes to another unplanned trip. <br /> <br /> Boston mom starts talking with some Indian mummies she was lying at home. She is currently an author, and makes numerous recordings of moldy corpses. Psychiatrist Read more records, and uses her imagination to fill in the gaps. We see that the mother half-flip, but her mental disorder occurs off-screen, as well as the heart of Gramps' attack. <br /> <br /> In the end, the patient de resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under hypnosis gun and tells its own story. He thinks spanking mom with (this was done in 1977). Apparently, my mother makes the astral body of the Indian mummies kind of fly through the air. One of the hits of Matt as a bee hits the windshield, and Matt starts acting all crazy. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist takes her grandmother and Matt in the desert. Matt inexplicable in a wheelchair now, and the trio confronts the invisible (and inexplicable) force. <br /> <br /> Flocker makes no sense to build a scene. One professional herein includes RV stranded in the salt flats in the desert. In the distance, the couple noticed some boulders rolling to the RV. It's pretty creepy little scene, which eventually overdone. As the boulders start rushing to the vehicle, the special effects are becoming apparent. <br /> <br /> scene where RV runs off the highway and then turn it on again, take forever. Scenes where Grandpa closed for RV roof as she bends down a dirt road takes forever. mother talking with the mummy to take forever. with Matt from the body take forever. This movie takes forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to push the rewind button to forward at least a dozen times. As the scene was delayed, it was obvious Flocker was packed. Cut the fat here, and it would have been clocked up in an hour. Definitive "explanation" that the mummies were trying to kill the spirits of those who are close to Matt never holds water. They live in the RV? Cinematographer never is the fact that the spirits are not any good ways to their slaughter, they never killed anyone! <br /> <br /> As I continued to think about Nelson in "Airplane!" I also thought about other movies, anything that I did not fall asleep during it. Boston terrible, like a child, playing fifteen years, how cute ten years, having alecky sensible course for all those adults who get themselves through love for him. <br /> <br /> In the end, Flocker wrote and directed a mess. The name is just the beginning of this exercise, with the result that the audience feel uncomfortable. It's not terrible, but as a ghost, you can also still go ... away from the tape in the video store. <br /> <br /> it without evaluation, and includes a physical violence and mild profanity.
