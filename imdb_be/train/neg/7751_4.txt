Firstly, CGI was terrible in that film. I watched it during the marathon bad movies on SciFi Channel. In the end, if the park owner gets killed, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI, I have even seen. Even Night of the Living Dead was better animation. <br /> <br /> However, the film is almost no plot. Why they were on the island, in particular? Well, it was not said in the film. And why do people continue to arrive in the region of the cat? It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> One thing that stands out in this film was moderately good acting. In what could be called the Â«B for the TV movie" movie, the action was very good. The pair Shen stood out in particular. <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on Saturday to watch this movie. This can be useful for some memorable quotes.
