When Edward Woodward was in the cinema to watch this movie, it's what he would scream with horror. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry people, but full enough. We had to get Carter, Italian, Alfie, and now this. What similarities? No, this is not a coincidence that three of the original star Maurice Micklewhite and other stars of another great British actor. The main common ingredient in these scripts is a British film. They were not made to impress Hollywood. They were cunning English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that simply can not be replicated in the United States. CULT word and that the best way to destroy the cult film than bastardise it with a remake or a sequel. <br /> <br /> 06 Wicker has been a difficult task before it even hit the road. Wicker 73 is even more puzzling that said other cult films; it defies genre, intelligent script, actor A-class score, a set of masks that defy description, and all the stories surrounding the film. <br /> <br /> So here comes the remake. Do not worry. Many originals were harmed in the making of this remake. Some basic aspects of the story need to be reworked for the modern US - communication, paganism, virgins. But this is just about the whole house. Thus, we give the COP injury last Nam style complete with shock music retrospection cheap panic. Then, without a mobile phone mast on the island, which sorts the connection is - but in the real world it does not happen. Cops just do not disappear. Give him a blood link to motivate rather than clashes of opinion and you have a remake. Ultra-slim, though, is not it? <br /> <br /> It's just that it was all laid out on the spatula. Name changes were simply Hammy, almost went on, there was no sense of community on the island, nor in the city center to catch bearings, only a few houses dotted about the forest, and that was it. Willow was just annoying, not giving any information at all, and Cage was useless to let her get away with it. When he walked into a well, you just knew that he would get locked it. The script has been specified all the way through - and you just wanted to hurry up and finish. Epilogue was absolutely hilarious and did not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> This is the end, is probably the best way to miss the difference between them. One ends up in the most beautiful sunset after the most terrible day. The other ends with the post-production to explain-it-all-to-thickies conclusion type. <br /> <br /> I loved the original, but went to a movie with an open mind and was excited to see the movie, I leave grateful, knowing that this film will probably end up under the highway somewhere only this time kindly to forget.
