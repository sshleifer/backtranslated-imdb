When I saw this movie on FEARnet, I thought it would be a horror film. Apparently, it was not. I have no idea how this film is allowed to be submitted on this website. FEARnet is a site that shows the terrible horror movies. <br /> <br /> To act perfectly with all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The film opens with a man with a scroll with Signia stamp on it. He breaks the seal and some disasters occur. The water turns to blood, oceans are dying, a month becomes red, etc. <br /> <br /> female character annoying as well. Many of the things that she did not make sense. For example, when she sees a piece of paper with the date on it. Coincidentally, this is the date, it is expected to have a baby, and she starts freaking out about it, and begins to explore it and ask religious people, what it all means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler alert * <br /> <br /> two worst things happened in this film are the execution of a mentally retarded person, who claimed that God told him to kill his parents and an end, where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her child and transfer her soul into it. <, Br /> <br /> That's what happens. Mentally retarded person gets shot and started the apocalypse. Demi Moore admitted to the hospital in the middle of a major earthquake, and gives birth to a child. She touches her child's head, bringing his own soul to the child and then dies. Then the apocalypse is terminated. <br /> <br /> Why did God suddenly has a change of heart? He gets angry when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded person, it's all about forgiveness time single woman carries her soul to her child? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> In the film a bit silly. This is another end of the world religious propaganda piece. Act on Demi Moore and Michael Biehn, and everything else is fine. That's all it is. <br /> <br /> I give this film 2 stars out of 10. Good to act with a lot of stupidity!
