According to people fawning all over Miike did his job. I sat through that movie tonight. I realized when it is half as good as Ringu, because I assumed from these remarks can be, what it will be worth my time. <br /> <br /> There is no such luck. <br /> <br /> I 'm all for staying next big director (or writer), but I do not think that Miike is one. I do not have the New York University Master of Fine Arts, but I know it's a lot: a horror film should have a walk. He must also give the viewer greater credulity than this film does. <br /> <br /> Shagan this film had me shaking my head. Some of the scenes towards the end pulled so bad, I went to the fridge and stayed there until Kou Shibasaki looked into the camera, seemingly minutes on end, wide-eyed and open-mouthed. The famous director once made a statement, and I'm paraphrasing, the film can be done by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and let him roll. Coe is not a good enough actress to do the job. She looks at the immortal girl paralyzed for more scenes than I care to remember. And she was not the only one who makes the embodiment of a deer in the headlights; other actors seem to feel the need to simulate this failure. The script gives them little room to do much else for too long. <br /> <br /> I like Asian cinema. click Hong Kong action of the last 30 years, the Korean horror film like "Telephone" and "Koma", the work of Ang Lee, some thin, but the fun of Filipino films with gratuitous sex and fighting, as well as others. Chakushin Ari I could have done without.
