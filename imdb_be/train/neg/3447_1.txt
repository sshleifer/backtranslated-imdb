This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen. It's not scary, or any of the other things, the proposed outline of the plot. This film is painfully slow, and I was bored for most of the 98 minutes. While the acting mediocre at best, the biggest problem is the script that is poorly written, plodding slowly and without any real direction. Sometimes terrible mood is set only to be broken some useless lines or events. I'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots, they still have to try to digest the terrible scenario. As a big fan of good horror movies, I always annoyed that something is bad it gets has done. Save 98 minutes you'll never get back.
