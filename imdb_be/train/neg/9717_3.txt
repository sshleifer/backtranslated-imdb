Quite obviously, a thriller, in rooms where the only possible turn is the repository to anything. I watched, mainly to perform in English Isabelle Huppert. It was not great, but then it was a strange role. I would not be surprised if half of its contribution appeared to have been left on the cutting room floor along with a few last minute script rewrites. <br /> <br /> action is the least attractive thing about this film, Steve Guttenburg looks like he is trying to flesh out its role with charm that everyone was telling him that he has. There is a sensationally stupid sequence in which he suggested that his sexual prowess to be able to help in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. This uninteresting work. Elizabeth McGovern big draw to the charm and character, but that is little consolation. 3/10
