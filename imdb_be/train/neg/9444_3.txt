There's only one thing I'm going to say about the cat in order ... as a film KIDS and good comedy it sucks ... I've lost how many terrible jokes in the film, which is not only sucked but weren Â»t exactly fit the child. Oh, and by the way, the cat in the hat said, irritated ... As for the plot, I completely forgot. Who cares he sucked anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined, but I think that the authors have tried to make it sound like it's Austin Powers without swingers and talk excessively succeeded-, but it was annoying. I do not see it belongs in the bottom 100 .............................. unkiddy jokes because it's funny
