Maybe because I was so young, innocent and Brainwashed, when I saw him, this film has been the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I have not seen since I was in seventh grade in a Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure what effect it would have on me now. However, I will say that it left an impression on me ... and most of my friends. It was to serve its purpose, at least until we were old enough and experienced enough to analyze and create your own opinion. I was particularly horrified by the fact that after the Rapture again converted Christians were tolerated, if not receiving the mark of the beast. I do not want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen, so I will not mention the details of the scene, but I still can then present them in my head ... and that was 19 years old.
