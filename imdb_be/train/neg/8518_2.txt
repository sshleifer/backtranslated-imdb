I'm surprised at how many comments on the show about how "real" it is. Maybe I am not a part of the same universe, because when Veronica Mars nothing is over in a big way. <br /> <br /> act chews scenery with enthusiasm and portions have openings can drive the truck through. This is not what I call real. <br /> <br /> so serious in their desire to be "appropriate", it only shows how cut off from reality, Rob Thomas and his staff. <br /> <br /> in general, I found it best to take a nap in the festival, and in the worst case, more than a little annoying. Kristen Bell looks like it might be a good actress, but it is difficult to say with over-the-top style of the show.
