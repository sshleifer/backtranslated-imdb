Here's what I found myself saying time after time in a surprisingly inept 3 act of this sad occasion for the film. First, the computer effects quite mind-blowing! These computer wizs' really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, though ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters do not act in a realistic manner, especially in the above-mentioned, the despicable act 3 (I promise I will not give it away, but believe me, it it is not necessary to keep a secret!). A lot of laughter in the film come by chance, for example, when they try to explain that the worlds of the invisible man does not work. Please give viewers more credit than that !!! <br /> <br /> Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. Whatever you do, in the end, if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These issues were considered much more reasonable in the classic The Invisible Man from 1933. There is a scene of violence, in particular, that is so incredibly ambiguous, and never mentioned later. If more attention was paid to it, a mad scientist Kevin Bacon could make a little more sense. <br /> <br /> The film is actually a much more successful as a porn, as the room can actually be performed in a unique and interesting way. But this part of the job ... go see something else. Or not, and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
