I'm a big fan of Porsche, and the car was the best star in this film. <br /> <br /> Chaim now dried drug abusing the child star of the 80s is insipid, as usual, and commenting back up from the minor characters / actors would be pointless; Needless to say, they were all very average. It's a great film, like a trip down memory lane in the 80s. - with some amazing clothes, some good shots against the backdrop of Colorado and is very harmless, though the mind numbing plot <br /> <br /> In general, please don "t waste your time watching this if you do not like the 80- movies, Corey Haim, or as I like old school Porsche (this one in particular, looks great), because life is too short to watch bad movies.
