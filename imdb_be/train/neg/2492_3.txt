I think I've seen worse movies, so I give it a 3, but it is a struggle to remember what they could be !! Perhaps XTRO (flip and dull), or perhaps, Creep (just boring), but it is a struggle to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say that a poor man's Under Siege, starring poorer man Jean-Claude Van Damme. The only mitigating saw Wang Ding - I always wondered what happened to him after the Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> On this site, it is stuck in the television film hell .... Casper, be more selective .... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just rolled over and have a half decent movie on criminal law is called ...... Now I'm starting to get really resentful about the last 1.5 hours !!!
