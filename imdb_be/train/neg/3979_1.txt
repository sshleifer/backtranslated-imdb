Well, it has 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 film that I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Like all other Olsen twins movie with the possible exception of New York Minute, the film did not have a history, disclosed the plot holes, rotten disgusting actions and bad filming even !!!!!!!!! in case you have not guessed, I HATE MARY KATE and Ashley !!!!!! The only reason I watched it because I was very bored and had nothing on. I wonder if the twins will ever make the same stereotyped films where they have incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day at this time to get help the two cute guys who drool over them immediately. At least, they could be looking for a Man 4 1 of them or both of them fall in 4 of the same guy. The plot of the story was so imbecilic and just dumb. even the boy could see flaws in it.Maybe they have to share and start making films individually or perhaps movies with all sorts of stories. Anyone who liked this film was not offended anyone really stupid, actually man-made or have not seen any really good movie. or perhaps they are really smart and simple cinematic bad choice. in any case, I would not recommend this movie is my worst punishment for a good movie experience .. the only thing it is good for a 4 rib splitting laughter at the pathetic attempts to cool. if you are looking for a laugh this is fun. I mostly give it to 0 or less.
