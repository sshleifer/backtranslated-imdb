** ** contains spoilers <br /> <br /> A truly exquisite Sean Young (who in some scenes, with her hair poofed up, looks like Elizabeth Taylor) affects its opening moments in this film. Sitting in the back seat of the police car, which waits for a signal of the bust, her face and body tense and distracted. Unfortunately, after the bust of the strained behavior Jung never changes. This is one fatally hampered by the actress. <br /> <br /> One has only to compare the young performers playing her colleague and best friend, Arnet Walker, to understand what is missing in the Young. Walker open, emotional and at ease at all times ... that there is no visible barrier between what she can feel her expression of this. It is an open book. Young, on the other hand, acts as a timid, shy, as you might expect your neighbor to act, they were suddenly cast into the lead role in the film. In principle, it does not have a clue. <br /> <br /> At the same time the main emptiness looms in the center of the film, we are left to ponder implausiblities this story. For example, after Young Miss stolen criminal it back and locked in a cabinet, it breaks down the door when left alone. Of course, she was dressed only in her bra and panties, but in this situation, with the psycho kidnapper must return at any moment, you head for the door ... or take the time to go through a chest of drawers, grab some clothes and get dressed? I would suggest that this and other scenes are trying to offer some mixed feelings about the character of Miss Yang is going through, but Yang can not pass this type of difficulty. <br /> <br /> There are several things that affect the film, such as a short interview with the police criminal past victims, but overall it is an aimless pursuit. It's too bad, Miss Yang was replaced during the filming of a pair of comic book style movie that could have exploited her stint with humor (BATMAN and Dick Tracy), because her floundering, trying to play a real person, it's surprisingly touching. Watching Miss Yang is trying to act, at least in this "thriller", it is a sad sight.
