Often reliable Maltin says that it is "a great romance" and that Sanders "excellent". Maltin should confuse this film with something else. Sanders pungent and beautiful and gorgeous as usual ?? You can imagine his line delivery with respect to adultery, "Sometimes chains of marriage are so heavy that they should be moved three" ?? but boring, wood and dated to describe this movie more accurately. The plot, an autobiography with Sanders as courteous precious stone thief François Eugène Vidocq, who becomes chief of police, but can hardly resist the temptation of fine gems, entertaining enough, but he has the same kind of hollow historic Hollywood treatment that clouded period epics such as * Marie Antoinett e *, and, of course, lamentable * Forever Amber * (who yells at a cool remake). Although, in his defense, Sanders is trying mightily to add some depth to his character that all this is useless. I'm shameless fan of Cirque, but it's 1946 and this is one of the first American effort Sirk, in the absence of many signature lines that define its diverse, chest-heaving hack. Sirk just gets his feet wet here, and made a series of unmemorable films over the next ten years, until he struck gold with * Magnificent Obsession *, and hit er course, bombard us with estrogen-festivals as * All That Heaven Allows * * Written on the wind * and * * Imitation of Life. But * Scandal in Paris * hardly his best work ?? a relatively low-budget affair with cheese sets and costumes ineffective.
