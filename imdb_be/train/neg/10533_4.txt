This version is shifted a little slow for my taste, and I think I have a problem with this game, to start with. But the first film, this is a typical version of a television movie of the play, which means that it has no scent of the original version of the film with William Holden. The fact that they can not afford to hire more than a dozen people in the crowd? Why move the film until 1966? So you can give to sister line of the Vietnam War protests? Why not one thousand nine hundred sixty-three and give her a line about the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> As for the casting, some hits, some misses. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character, especially in his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other side miss a lot of notes. He is believable as a former athlete BMOC, but it does not have the raw sensuality William Holden. I always thought that Brolin looks a bit like a gorilla, that all women in the city go ape over it (pardon the pun). Gretchen Mol was beautiful, but it seemed a little too wise for the character she played. She did not project the innocence or ignorance, demanding character. Maybe it's because she and Brolin about 5 years older than the characters should be. But then again, Holden ten years too old. Bedel was pretty forgettable, as a mother and Mary Steenburgen can not seem to remember if it was playing Blanche DuBois or Katherine with "The Taming of the Shrew." <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Inge play, I always felt that history, as young women are choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue. «The Twilight Zone» I think it probable offers an epilogue to the episode, "off the cuff", where a young Diana Hyland was being chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland, because Diana Hyland Jr. decided to run off with a guy like Hal Carter.
