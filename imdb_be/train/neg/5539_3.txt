Wimpy stuffed shirt Armand Louque (blandly played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins the group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret zombie creation technique. Armand falls in love with the beautiful Claire Duval (Fetching blonde Dorothy Stone), which uses a good-natured juice to get a colleague Armando Clifford Grayson (hopelessly wooden Robert Nolan) to marry her. Furious over the used and discarded Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of the fishing rod to get revenge. Sound exciting? Well, it sure is not. For starters, static (not) the direction of Victor Halperin allows winding and current flows covered stories are drawn on the painfully slow pace. To make matters worse, Halperin principle does not bring any stress, the atmosphere and the momentum to ugly tedious procedures. The main blah acting from a cast mostly tasteless does not help matters any; Only George Cleveland as a cordial General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as a short-tempered doctor Trevissant manage to liven things up a bit with their welcome and refreshing Hammy theatrics. Sentimental stock library by painfully obvious stagebound set, and crude cinema rather ugly and unimpressive as well. In fact, it is a weak excuse for fear especially so disgusting that even in the credits are not sharply alert eyes big Bela Lugosi can alleviate brain stupor of boredom. Depressingly dull rags.
