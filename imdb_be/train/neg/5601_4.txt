I watched it only because it was directed Fulci and signs Claudio Cassinelli, the actor I like. I, of course, disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that condemned prisoners will fight to the death for television ratings was overdone with Rollerball, the Run Logan, Blade Runner, and the new film, Death Race, which will certainly suck me because stars Jason Statham . <br /> <br /> It was only a hole for the most part. Action "To Kill a bicycle" was ridiculous. "Education" was taking a nap Festival. He just never grabbed me, and I wanted to take care of someone, including "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the other mentioned and you will be better.
