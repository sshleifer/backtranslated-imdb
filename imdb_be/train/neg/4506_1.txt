American filmmakers decided to make a film they consider the Japanese. The characters were all bad, the actors do not even Japanese, but a lot cheaper, is unrealistic, and certainly is not a Kyoto in the early 20ties and 30s. Who ever read the book to understand the writers Sun added extra value to differentiate the film from a script. Worse, they even changed the original storyline with a few inconsistencies. Rob Marshall uses for its two main characters of two well-known Chinese actors who have joined earlier in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Marshall probably seen one Chinese film and tho they represent Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors together again, even making movies funnier. The last scene Quentine Tarantino in Kill Bill # 1 ten times more in Japan than this film.
