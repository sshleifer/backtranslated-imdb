About the child: Why was not the big brother of the belief that he will be hungry for a bottle or any food or diaper change? He was screaming non-stop after that many hours unattended. Definitely better than to take a child from a safe place where he should not. <br /> <br /> And why road miraculously clear if anyone wanted to go somewhere? We did not have any uprooted trees falling on roads and block them? <br /> <br /> I can not imagine the police at a checkpoint not as soon as any young man who collapses it, especially when they were told that it was dangerous to travel. <br /> <br /> That being said, it was nice to have a movie kids could safely observe the change.
