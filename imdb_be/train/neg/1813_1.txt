If someone wants to make a really, really bad film, "The Wizard of the Lost Kingdom" really sets the standard by which to measure the depth of harm. <br /> <br /> Will start with a pseudo-Chewbacca, who stands around the main character ... Some poor chmy baggy white "fluffy" suit, which looks as if it was stitched from discarded pieces of carpet. Work your way slowly, painfully, through a not so special effects which are completely deprive the viewer of the suspension of disbelief. Add garden gnome (just for this). <br /> <br /> On a second thought, skip this entire movie and find something to do for a half hour.
