This cowardly and insulting film made me intrigued to begin with. The characters are familiar deprived young males are often to be seen hanging around bored in the sea town. Robert is an outsider, but he has his music, which could be his soul. Instead of clay makes Robert to freak who goes on a journey in cannabis and ecstasy, and getting in with the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in the "reefer madness" and Robert ends the film as a mortal rapist. I wonder how much real life experience of the young director. No one can save a poor Robert. Glue leaves us with the message that young British men of control. Very unsubtle reference is made to Iraqi insurgents; while nothing graphic rape we are exposed to explosions and images of the war. The film shows a male peers extremism pushed her outside. Young bombers in London to draw a parallel with the way Clay hated modern man. Clay has in mind that people just can not help myself from doing terrible acts of violence. It is surprising that the British film industry allows the money to be invested in the film, are in favor of such propaganda strife when in London we are still recovering from the recent attacks. This is the first film of Clay, I would be happy if it was his last.
