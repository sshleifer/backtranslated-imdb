It took 9 years to complete this film. I think that during these 9 years, someone would say, hey, this film is terrible. I've seen better acting in porn movies. History tired and played. Hazardous child turns into a serial killer. How about something new for a change. How about abused child turns into a flower shop? At least, it would be a new twist. Why is it that everyone with a camera and the idea of ​​the film (especially a film unoriginal ideas) believes that they can be directed? I admire the fact that they are stuck with this film for 9 years to get its completion. This shows that the tenacity and spirit. With this kind of drive, we hope, the next time they can focus it on a best-case scenario. If you want to see a failed experiment in the indie film from writer / director of the Michigan see hatred minutes. If you want a good movie from Michigan writer / director sticks with Evil Dead.
