One of the main disadvantages of this film is that while mocking pretentious yuppies satisfactory, he is unable to understand is that the filmmakers are guilty of one of those who deserve to be mocked. One of the features of these types is conceited yuppie misunderstanding that they (yuppies) are the only sufficiently complex to understand art. While the film ignores this feature, and instead focus on their lack of understanding of the dining room, I find it ironic that the only people who like this film boasts the same vain taste in films, the characters are doing in choosing lunch. If these pompous characters that were in this movie has a video library at home, I would bet that American Psycho least one of these films.
