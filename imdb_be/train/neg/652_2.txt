I think it was overpriced PG-13 crap! At least, Brittany Snow's performance was good, and some others, like Idris ELBA were also good, but some of the other teenagers in the exhaust as conductors friends were not so convincing. The killer was that stupid, and he looked so stupid, too. Deadly were stupid, sad and very unoriginals. The film was very sad too, and very overrated. He was not in suspense at all, I almost fell asleep. His second bad PG-13 remake, it's really scary movie IMO. The ending was so stupid and the culmination was very rushed and boring. The film is rather slow. Overall, the only good thing about this crap festival, maybe Brittany Snow, I think it gave good results and Idris Elba too, but other than that it was quite horrible and terrible movie remake. Well, that's just my opinion. I gave it a 2/10.
