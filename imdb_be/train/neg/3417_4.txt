Wow, my first review of this film was so negative that it is not released. I'll try this one down tons. Let's be real !!! No one wants to see a movie, Chuck Norris, where it is not the main character.There was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stinks. I have to wonder if the old Chuck just can not hang with the best anymore. Does he have slowed down so much that it must be rubbish like this and hopes that his reputation will carry him through the whole movie? Chuck is an amazing martial artist, and, as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a pretty good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his films, and this one does not. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, stay as the main character in your films, because it is not working for you ... Gary
