Sign of the classic film is that he is getting older, as an outstanding red wine. This film is not Cabarnet and, of course, there is Casablanca. I agree with other reviewers that the kids in the film are a bad mutation, which now torments us at night comedy shows and dialogue stilted and instructive. But let's look at an outdated theme of the film. <br /> <br /> With the passage of sixty-odd years of history comes wisdom. After hours on the Rhine, the author Lillian Hellman was exposed as a plagiarist Bidenesque with its so-called real history "Julia" with its books "Pentimento." As one of the most notorious of the many apologists for the Soviet Union in Western-based, obviously, its theme in the play and the film was a stir America to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin, and international communism from the Nazis, who had just turned out of their military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer correctly pointed out that this is not a pro-American games and movies, and Lillian went to the grave of American-Communist disgust. This film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elite, which was the American left, then, just as it is now full mooner left The Daily Kos, and Michael Moore bought into conspiracy theory and once again gave aid and comfort to those who destroy America.
