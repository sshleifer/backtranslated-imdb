I love comics. Although I have a full understanding of the problems of history ?? visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought that I knew what I was for. Surprisingly, I realized the main story ?? but some very bad decision, which made for its visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - really good «CG human actors» -in close the window? ?? Why? It does not work at all !! Horus - and other gods Egyption - has been successfully done in CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think that with real actors, this movie could become a cult classic. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
