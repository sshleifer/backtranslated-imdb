I will not agree with the previous comment and tanks Maltin on it. This is the second course, excessively vicious Western that creaks and groans trying to crank it up a central theme of taming the Wild West and feet away from the steady march of time. He would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," but lacks sharpness of this film and charm. Direction Andrew McLaglen is lame, and the last 30 minutes or so are a real failure, with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitch. (Someone gave me a holler if you can explain to me why they found that the slope of the hill on fire.) There was something callous about the whole rape scene processing, and women after the reaction, of course, does not ring true. Coburn reverse many as half breed escaped convict out for revenge, but all his fellow refugees underdeveloped (they like skittles, to be shot down, one after another, as the story bends forward). Michael Parks gives one of his usual run, sluggish, muttering performances, but in this case it was appropriate, as it is modern style sheriff symbolizes complacency that technological progress could result.
