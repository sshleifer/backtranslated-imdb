If you want to see the intellectual, philosophical discussions about human capabilities and potential, to watch "that never sleeps", which is brilliant. "What # $ *! Do We Know Â»is everywhere at its focus, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly acted, completely devoid of any artistic direction and totally annoying. It is not thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest degree. Enabling this chaotic freak "RAMT," in this film is sufficient reason to avoid this. Is not it strange how the filmmakers decided to look for what this woman worshiped around 2000 old Atlantis god or something? That scales the old chicken and what a complete waste of my time and money, this film was. Those responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another film ever again.
