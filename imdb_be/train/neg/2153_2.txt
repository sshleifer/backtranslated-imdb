3-D is shown in "The Man Who Was not There" is DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This comedy features inappropriate lousy 3-D effects, which makes the 3-D effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday the 13th Part 3" look better in comparison. Not to mention the movie asinine in the extreme. It was one of the many films in 1983 to show the effects of the pop-out screen. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor bogged down in this mess, but at least he did not kill their careers. Tambor to star in the HBO series "The Larry Sanders Show" and the box office smash Ron Howard's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", while Guttenberg was followed by a flop with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon." With them in the projects, instead of them here, in "The Man Who Was not There." If you do, you'll regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
