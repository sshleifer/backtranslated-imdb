After leaving the first you think the Wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. Although I do not think so. If the first was not bad enough, this one is just so bad that it hurt to look at. With all the actors they had in this film, do you think that they could come up with something more reasonable. Although they could not, they had to take all the same obscene, Sun funny jokes from the first and no way to put it into this film thinking people will laugh at him again. Despite the fact that I was not laughing at him the first time. They tried to make these films into a parody, but they failed on every level. Most of the time, it just happened inserted jokes that are so disgusting and careless, it's hard to see it and enjoy it. Then, when they're trying to do scenes that parody of the movie, they just end up making a 20 minute recovery on the one scene may be a joke within the scene. In addition, for the people, saying that it is not for the older and the real young audience, and I fit in with age, it has to be funny to. While people say that different people have different ideas about what is funny or not, if you find it funny, then you're probably not one of the more mature and intelligent people around. It does not take much skill to write such a scenario, though if you want a smart and funny movie to go see the movie Spaceballs. This is a film parody that is really good and well done, and it should not be used disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it a fun day.
