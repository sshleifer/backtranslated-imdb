As a longtime fan of the series Star Trek, I found this frustrating episode, and I wonder when the liberal use of "flashbacks" featuring the exploits of Will Riker, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (a lot of pain, and death crewmate c) was economical device, as well as many of these "bottle show" (episodes in which all the scenes take place in the enterprise). Maldur (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final appearance than it is for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the Star Trek world, there is another kind?) Were also deceived. This was the last episode of the second season; Thus, the season is over, "not with a bang," but with a "whimper".
