This is due to the lack of a better term, the movie is disgusting. Where do I start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - This was probably the worst that I've seen this year. It seems the camera was to be thrown out of the man camera man camera. Maybe they had only one camera. It gives you the feeling of being a volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a bunch of scenes, haphazardly thrown in without any continuity at all. If they made a "split screen", it was absurd. Everything was squished flat, it looked funny. <br /> <br /> Shades were away. These people need to learn to balance the camera. This "film" poorly made and poorly made <br /> <br /> The plot. - You're kidding. If I was an agent of the SS, I would sue the manufacturer. Marks looked like brothers with guns and radios. Sutherland was in his "24" mode - I can see it's free. Eva Longoria would have been better with a little less on, and many other shows. Action as a prostitute, she was not very much. <br /> <br /> I could not see the real story, except Douglas boinking wives of presidents. He never said why mercenaries were trying to kill Pres. I just do not see the United States of running for his life in the municipal building of tunnels, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-a-f-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This film is proof. I like the "big screen". Ever since I was a kid. Many more "movie" as it is and I'll quit going. What's up in Hollywood, made so many chick flicks, forget how to make a real movie? If I owned a theater, I would start showing old films. One with real actors good storylines -. And well Cinemaphotography <br /> <br /> This "film" dog. Do not waste your time and money on it. I appreciate this "film" Zero! Douglas entirely suitable for this role. I can look at his age, but it's just to much of a wimp to carry it off.
