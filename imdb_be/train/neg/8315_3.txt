What missed opportunities to actually make an interesting film about the difficult subject. There is very little research about what it really feels like to be straight (or gay) man who works in a gay-sex dancers environment.The continue to talk about his art as if it has no erotic component. They can not all be prostitutes for rent, but they are in fact sex workers play out their fantasies and sell private lessons, serving more than dancing. From the film could get the impression that they mostly refer to women who go to gay clubs, and then end up "dancers" recruitment for private sessions. Even the shots at the club show only woman in front of the stage and the "dancers" just playing with the women in the audience. It's just not the reality of these clubs. It would be very difficult to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what they really think about their gay fans and customers? We learn very little. Instead, we get a filler. Gay activist who adds nothing to the direct study of the dancers. The manager, who tells us about the costumes drawing acts, but does not provide information about the life of dancers and relationships. <br /> <br /> Stills Mexico is common. Phallic montage showing roasting sausages funny. <br /> <br /> This is a very simplistic film that should be of interest only to those who want to see some photos of beautiful boys dancing. The rest of the film is an insult to gay men.
