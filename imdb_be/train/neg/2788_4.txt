Much has been written about Purple Rain, the imaginary "Quin-EssentialÂ» musician bio film, but I'm here to tell you that the film does not deserve this high praise. <br /> <br /> First of all, let's take one thing straight prince great musician, and music is one of the areas where the Purple Rain excels. Even the cost is fascinating, and when it was taken purely as a concert film, it would be a great experience, unfortunately, is not the case, and as such the film has some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all, this terrible action / script, the character of the prince "Kid" is supposed to come off as some kind of mysterious single of few words, unfortunately, it just comes off as trite and incensere. Good single character must, at least, some Communicative moments, unfortunately, the nature of the prince rarely has more than a few words of dialogue in the film, and it's hard to believe that he will get a girl like that. Everything just seems a bit out here, which is a shame, because you can say that it is a sign that is terribly conflicted lives very difficult concert, but we are never allowed to get inside it. <br /> <br /> A surprising aspect of this film, as it happens consistently. Prince lives Morris seemed to take a back seat to the speeches here, I think it makes sense from a business perspective, but it is tedious to have a movie 2:00, where, apparently, half of them going on stage, especially if the history back character to get I pushed for it <br /> <br /> So, to sum up :. It's not a very good film.
