Hint, I think, can be assembled using a variety of comments on this topic. <br /> <br /> I was totally amazed at the number of people who loved this movie, who want to make it a "must" or "mandatory". <, Br /> <br /> I think it gives us a little insight into why this film is the question that lies at the heart of this is so polarizing. <br /> <br /> problem of global warming turns a lot of people who want to get others to "do the right thing." It refers specifically to the more "liberal" leaning people, because they do not have to do with sleeping morality that with ' is that usually gets conservatives who want to get you to "be good" going. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And it is very successful in this. it just does not may hold back from referring to those people who want to force others to do what they will be. The political attractiveness is simply too great. <br /> <br /> And we are left with a scientific problem that can make a big difference, it is reduced to a political issue attractive for those who are in the body politic with the passion to make other "do the right thingÂ». <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is, how can the environmental movement get hijacked by these people?
