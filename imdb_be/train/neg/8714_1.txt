I just could not stop laughing !! This film is incredibly funny and ridiculous! But, not to mention the fact that it's very interesting! In this film, you do not need to pay attention to something! Act the same - LAME! Dinosaurs same - Rubber (Oh, my, I could see a stick that keeps the T-Rex's head for a moment.) Raptor same with carnosaurs 2, T-Rex is also the same, but ... in some of the scenes of his head it looks like some kind of filling, and it looks like some kind of failure of the project with kindergarten. Action quickly, sometimes too quickly, in fact, I'm talking about fast editing, they are edited so quickly, so we can not see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! to the end, they were rubber! Well, the only thing interesting here to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... I do not rent it ... watch it on TV with friends, it's much more entertaining!
