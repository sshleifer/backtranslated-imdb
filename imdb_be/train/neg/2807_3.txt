Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems, however, should be seen as a perfect "catch" by any woman, passing through it; it could have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? He is the "hero", which are very difficult to empathy, so that the film is in trouble from the start. However, the problems do not end there. It has a production value of TV movie (check that the head is made of clay or something closer to the end), and the ending of Chita in such a way that I can not reveal, in case anyone wants to see the film (highly unlikely) . Let's just say that the killer knows more than we let know that he knows. (* 1/2)
