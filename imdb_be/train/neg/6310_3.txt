I watched this movie last night and was a little disappointed. Many "temporary facts" were excluded. At the beginning of the film, his grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when they hit 9-11. This film was supposed to take place in 1994. In addition, one of the grandchildren of friends was wearing a T-shirt Eagles Donovan McNabb. He had not even been developed yet. The storyline was good, but the facts and the relevant deadlines had been so far removed from the base, that he made the film seem cheese. My friend is an avid reader of books and WWII memorabilia. I shoot this film in the hope that it would be good. Act itself. The dog was cute. But so that this film was held I am glad that I only paid $ 4 to rent it out, in contrast to the 50 it would take me to watch it in the cinema. I hope that anyone reading this knows that I do not mean no displeasure to those who fought the war, but the facts and the time-frame should be a little more careful observation.
