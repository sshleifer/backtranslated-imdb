As you can guess, my ranking and my title of this review, I do not like Johnny Test. Now I think I know what people will say: "How do you know how bad it is? Have you ever seen how you do it? "I watch this show a few times, because I study film and animation, and it's just doesn 't hold a candle to my standards. <br /> <br /> I want to first talk about the animation, because it is one of the most confusing things I've ever seen. As in the first two seasons, or just the first season was hand-drawn animation. I thought it was a good show to watch when it was painted, but then switched to flash animation and quality went down on a huge amount. <br /> <br /> So this is another blow in my eyes, but lets look at the history of the show. He tries too hard to be like Dexter the laboratory, but there are differences, because instead of a red-headed academic, there are two and they are both female. There is a talking dog (why?), And parents relations switched a few. I have others, but I do not think I can write them here (I do not mean swearing, but I mean, I do not know if there is a limit of words.). Everything else, though spot on, even the character Didi, Johnny. He's just trying so hard to be Dexter, but it just seems to me like a heartless fake. <br /> <br /> And finally, I want to talk about jokes. Remember, Dexters Laboratory, some of the jokes that are involved cries? So, screams can be good for a joke or two, but Dexter Laboratory were also clever remarks that made me have to go back and check out to get the joke. Johnny Test just forget that and just scream 50% of the time and stop the music when there is a bad joke or a one liner. This is not a comedy, the comedy stupid (I know that some people think. Nha Three Stooges comedy stupid? See what Johnny Test back to back, and you will laugh more in the first version.). Sometimes the jokes are based on the strange situations that are soup, it makes me crazy. I have a rule for cartoons and comedies together: Many fancy is not a comedy, it makes you just think <br /> <br /> So what is striking on all accounts "that I see?" .. Nha watch this show when you have any respect for comedy in any way, shape, or form.
