This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and again returned to the world's eyes to the fact that very few "Wild Western Canada" remains. If Archie began to write their stories for newspapers; thought of the day was to curb the wild and convert / absorb First Nations Peoples <br /> <br /> The film highlights and asks a question. Why well-educated, obviously talented Englishman became an Indian <br /> <br /> Archie as an English boy dreams of becoming something, but capturing the entire meaning of this dream is unique and priceless - no mater what it is not , looks like the famous puppet stories is not <br /> <br /> I think I saw Archie became my way of life "cigar store Indian" very wooden in nature and not real at all. - very well done acting on the part of Mr Brosnan. It also depicts a wild Indian dance scene for the tourist. The fullness and reality of this or were not realized, until he met and married his wife, Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie Archie pushed in a direction that will lead him to the forefront of the world stage Englishman, not as yourself, but great gray owl -an Canadian native desert border. <br /> <br /> It's coming to get Archie to be a prototype of the noble savage. <br /> <br /> Mr. Brosnan's interpretation, as well as directors and well-made. I watched documentaries about the Great Gray Owl, and I think it's a nice big screen movie to add to my collection <br /> <br /> Spoiler. - I thought that the final scenes with Archie going to meet the Great Council of Chiefs was a big big moment in the film. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful Canadian lake landscape and real places, "Gray Owl". <br /> <br />
