Beverly Garland was born at that time. She was an actress ahead of its time, with the result that the strength and grace even a lame clicks like Corman films she starred. The Gunslinger, she was the wife of the city sheriff. He gets offed, so it takes on his job to pursue his killers. It is better than the material she works with to date. The film gray, unnatural, and mostly boring. There's some (unintentional) humor with tire tracks everywhere, people who work in one building, to suddenly appear in front of others (I've heard of false fronts, but this is ridiculous!) And a really stupid story line recently widowed sheriff in love the guy hired to kill her. Even if she did not like her husband, it was only something like a week or two, as he died! And she ends up shooting Man to death in the end, anyway. No luck with men, it is one. <br /> <br /> villain entirely different woman, salon owner. She decided to buy a bunch of land only if the railway goes through and makes it rich. Its plan of action, if it is not pretty lame she'll just steal as much of the city as it can and scratches. Damn, it's just her and her mercenary in the end against the whole city. Are you telling me that these people are not armed? Look at what happened to the real towns of the Old West, when the bank robbers came to rob the bank, and then were cut down in a hail of bullets by armed and dangerous city people. <br /> <br /> There'a a lot of meaningless talk and riding around, mixed with a few lame shoot outs. The ending is as gloomy as usual, in the Corman film, though, thank God, he lacks moral proselytizing in the end, which was at that conquered the world. Sheriff turns its icon on Sam Bass and rides off into the sunset, although the film was so gray that you have never seen the sun.
