"Visitor Q» is a failed attempt to black comedy that focuses on what may be the world's most dysfunctional family, including physical abuse from beatings to murders of incest to sodomy in necrophilia to nursing mothers who nurse her husband and adult daughter, etc. the film is so outrageous that received some critical evaluation, and created a small cult.
