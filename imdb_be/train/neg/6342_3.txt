I picked it up in the video store for recommendations Tarantino ( "If you do not like (it), go f & ^% yourself!") On the box ... it seemed a ringing endorsement .... I was expecting something a little more " Death Proof Â»... not so much real violence in this one tho, or plot, character, and dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. It's all there. Tricks and rock. He goes back and forth. After a week or so in the life of LA band that does the dirty magic show, at a level that you may see in one of the smaller casinos off the Strip, and a new Australian stuntman in the city to find his feet ... they are working, they meet girls, they party. End of story. <br /> <br /> The band obviously need all these things, because they open the second tier, and the style of play, which has been dated in 1978. This has to be said, that stunt bits in the film sincerely spinetingling - that Aussie guy is really something, and the film seems to be largely motivated by love and respect for the "art". I hung it there to see that the mind that he would do next. Just a pity that he could find a better vehicle.
