As an advocate of cheesy horror movies, I've seen it in my video shops, and thought I would give it a try. Now, when I saw him, I want him to no living soul on the planet. I get free movie rentals, and I feel that I did not get my money's worth. I've seen some bad cheese horror movies in my time, hell I'm a fan of them, but it's just an insult.
