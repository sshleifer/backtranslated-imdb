Where was his criticism of Democratic administrations and Republican? In the end, it serves to 17+ years in the body of the government, where his influence was unwaivering. Oh, I forgot about 8 years old, he was second in command of the most powerful nation on Earth. The film is happy to show pictures of the young senator Gore why NASA scientist was forced to change the output to his scientific work, but can not ask about the complicity of the Clinton / Gore global warming. Perhaps too close to the election year, or maybe it would hurt the chances of Hillary in '08. In any case, he is a political coward and a party member to the finish. He did not offer any criticism of consumerism or capitalism critics is no way to entirely history of industrial development, which has led us to this point in time <br /> <br /> In the end, this film was a lot more about Mr. itself than about any real problems facing our surrounding mountains Wednesday. Mr. Gore, if you really wanted to make a film company - cut it and call it what it really is.
