What a shame when a potentially interesting and refreshingly restrained story manages to catch the interest at the start, and then gradually lets down further and further, until you left scratching mystify the head by the time it reaches overdone conclusion, unfortunately, this is what happened to me at the end of white noise <br /> <br /> This is not the fault of Michael Keaton. it was nice to see that he comes back as a star brand new film once again, looking a little wrinkled, perhaps, but still manages to give a strong and sincere work. As a man, whose wife had recently died, he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife (not a new idea), it seems to be getting contacted by her through this funky electric fluff businesses you see on the TV screen when there is nothing broadcasts. <, Br /> <br /> idea of ​​spirits communicating through the air is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), and there are many people who actually believe in it for real, so I'm not going to make any comments about what I think about that, or them. Let me say that I am all for the suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying in science fiction films like this, but what I can not stand not knowing what the hell was supposed to be the case that as to where I It was left stranded when the credits finally started to roll. Many static accurately. <br /> <br /> There are sometimes movies like this that I really confuse, but if the film is not able to make himself clear to me, I am inclined to believe that to be the fault of the director, not my (if I did not see it until I was too tired to concentrate or something). Well, White Noise I did not sleep, bright-eyed and bushy tail - so guess who's to blame?
