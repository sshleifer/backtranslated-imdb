Who Bettie Page? Of course, I did not find while watching this film. From what I have gathered from other sources, Ms. Page was very popular in the post-World War II of time, like a queen "naughty" pictures, and that's exactly what this film depicts. I never know Bettie, a woman, though. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of education and evangelical Christians dirty domestic life, which is only hinted at. The film glossed over her private life and gets right down to the purpose of the film, "juicy" pictures. Characters are introduced and abandoned for a few frames, but there is a frame-by-frame with Betty in their genital bra, Bettie her belt and stockings, Batty in captivity ... etc .. Film Slides from black and white to color every time when Ms. Page is visiting Miami Beach. Then back in its shades of gray life in New York, we go. Gretchen Mol reflects Bettie as one of the most the recent lady you could ever meet. If Bettie secret friend, that it is missing to be her high school valedictorian, receiving A and not-A can only assume that there are only two students in her senior class. The most interesting part of the film, as the fancy of Mrs. Page's "naughty" photo, it seems, in 2007, really sad that he saw a woman tied up like a pig on a spit would not even get a hit on My Space and You Tube, I'm not sure if this film was written bad if some crazy editor cut the thing to shreds. I would only recommend it as a source for those studying the history of odd underwear.
