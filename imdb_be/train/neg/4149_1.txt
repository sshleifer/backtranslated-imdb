Oh, my God. Where to start? Papa is not anywhere near old enough to be the father of the girl. He corpses on the camera in the first 5 minutes of the film. Advocates cry in this movie, "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies clever, silly, and few and far apart. Motives completely incomprehensible, and the story does not exist. People "rush" to the destination in a jeep driven by 3 miles per hour. The world seems to be carrying as usual yet they have to be at the end of the day. Breasts are for the chest. Typically, such an approach can provide some redemption, but the rest of the film actually have no interest in the breast or in the future of mankind. There's also a dog for no reason and thin blood orange, which turns the stomach. The general and his catchphrase of "F ** K Shut up!" Is the only softening. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they did a decent job and killed themselves.
