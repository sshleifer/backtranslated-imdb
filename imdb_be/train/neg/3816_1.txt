It has a very bad effect. Bad storylines. Bad characters. You should never see this show if you see it. TURN IT OFF. Or do you cringe in the next 30 minutes. He never should have been in the air. It's not cool. You should never see. Never ever. So now, if you ever want to watch this show, please do not. Turn THE CW for Smallville. Or the Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, It's much better family shows. So trust me on this, I watched it before. and it really is, and I say frankly, the worst show I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TV. So if you please, and never watch this show.
