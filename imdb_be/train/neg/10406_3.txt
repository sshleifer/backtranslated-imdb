Warning :. This review contains minor spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, the authors first Tremble officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first film and the first two sequels are pretty good for a straight to video fare. Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, however, is a very dull movie. Where the hell are Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of Graboids through the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry in the series is suppose to be a "character study". Unfortunately, not a single interesting character in the movie for the character of Billy Drago, with the exception of that given too few lines, too little to do, and in the end, too little screen time. Saved the 2nd and 3rd film was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Homer. Every time there was not any action on the screen, you can be sure that Burt Homer is going to be interesting to listen well and / or playing. However, in this film he plays Gross Hiram Homer is very bad and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, if Graboids (Dirt Dragons in the film) are on the screen, they look good, but that's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I saw that Tremors 4 was included in the 101 minutes long. Pretty well straight to video. But after watching I am sure that this film a good 15 minutes too long. There are long stretches of dialogue, which is sad and not further the plot of some kind. There was a rush to get this film made? I think it could not longer and had to be spent on the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with .... A shiver !!! What luck, I thought, to pay for the # 4, # 1 will arrive free of charge. Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think that I paid for the original and got this mess free, I can not imagine paying a dime for Tremors 4. For fans of the series, it is better to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exist <br /> <br /> Tremors 4 :. Legend rates 3 out of 10 starts.
