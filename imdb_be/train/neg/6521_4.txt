I'm probably not giving the film a fair shake, I could not watch it all. Maybe if I had seen it in the theater, in its original submission, I would appreciate it, but it's too slow for me to move. <br /> <br /> I read the book about 25 years ago and the details of the plot have disappeared from memory. It did not help the film, because it's something less bright and clear in his view of events. <br /> <br /> It's really four related films or film in four parts, and, I believe, intended to see for four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found the part I be pleasant enough, but it was all I could do to sit through a second part which pulls indefinitely. Reading Tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing. If you get a good translation or you can read it in the original, his brilliant writing far outweighs any questions one might have with the pace of the story. On the tape, however, it is difficult to reproduce without ponderous. <br /> <br /> I have other issues with parts of the film that I saw. It is very bright, with plenty of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that requires attention to themselves rather than to serve as the story progresses. <br /> <br /> Obviously, I'm missing something, but I just could not enthuse crank parts III and IV.
