Dane is trying hard and extreme with all the yelling and going crazy, splashing water on themselves and rolling on the floor. Lot. Calm down, get yourself together and make us laugh. I do not quite understand it compare to the comic books and rock stars. Just because there are both on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to become a rock star. I am sure that Rodney Dangerfield was indeed that, when he was alive. He had a few good jokes, a joke Burger King, where people scream on the drive to the end. I also liked Reese Pieces joke. If the Dane just do not act, mental, he can be funny, and I could give it a higher rating, above, maybe eight.
