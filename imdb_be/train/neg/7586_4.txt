Summer vacation is a forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill Ah Wilderness and deservedly adaptation of the Broadway musical Take Me Along. Except lyrics Stanley Steamer, none of the other songs of Harry Warren Ralph Blaine do not forget, and even that one is doubtful. <br /> <br /> It was right after the release of the film that MGM let Mickey Rooney to go, and I do not think it's a coincidence. The film was shot in 1946 and released in 1948, so was Mickey 26 plays Andy Hardy, as a teenager. He was too old for the part of 17-year-old, who influenced radical ideas in the spirit of youthful rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, the killer McCoy remake of Robert Taylor crowd Roars, Love laughs at Andy Hardy and words and music. In all of them adult Rooney plays a part. Even in the Andy Hardy film, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy returned from the Second World War. Why was he in the Louis B. Mayer knows. <br /> <br /> bad casting Rooney makes a summer vacation all the worse because the original Ah Wilderness emphasis on the character of his father Walter Huston plays here. And in the Broadway show Take Me Along which won the Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Big One play inebriation-law Uncle Sid is played by Frank Morgan, and it is the central character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven steps for Judy Garland as a sweet and magical friend Rooney and Marilyn Maxwell plays a show girl who gives Runite adult education. In the original game O'Neal has her as a prostitute, but it was the Hollywood of the Code, so that all Marilyn does is get young Rooney get drunk. <br /> <br /> A lot of really talented people who had a hand in this one, and they are doing their best, but summer vacation is extinguished fairly quickly in cold autumn.
