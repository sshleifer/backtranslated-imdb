I saw this movie in the first place to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), I had a brief meeting in Los Angeles on the modeling show, in his first feature film. I was hoping to see her again, but thought that it works very well its role. Because she is so beautiful and balanced TV presenter and model, it is not surprising. I kept wondering why she was killed, and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it. <br /> <br /> I was not sure what genre this film, and although I liked the actor, I felt that it was for a college audience. I tried to survey the horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt that I grew gags. It seemed to pull in some places, to leave you to guess in some places that the powers of evil professor had, and, like many other films were unsatisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> After writing several scripts, I know a lot of it is tough and can be reduced to a personal opinion, how many movies you have seen and studied, and those that you are involved with at the time. <br /> <br /> In general, I was curious, but not meeting the plot and the ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would return through the portal in the end and kicking ass of everyone, that would be a satisfactory ending, and will earn a higher rating.
