A friend told me about the Phantom in the summer of last year, after we got to talking about Charles Bukowski. I did not know what Fante was my favorite writer Bukovsky - author with a similar edge and humor, with the exception of one generation earlier. "Ask the Dust" was the first book I read Fante, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about the sad, frightened young writer creates for itself and the world as a self-confident, artistically talented author, who had not the slightest idea of ​​how to write about the real world experience he had none. In the novel, the hero of the virgin, not knowing how to win the favor of women, which he desperately wants to write in journals. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' fans, and how he eventually there is nothing left but the history of its failures love bites and real, without touching the Hollywood ending. Screen adaptation stays true to the book for a while, but in the cinematic curves trap love hard by racism, illness and death. The heart of the story lies in the fact that Bandini and Camilla is a breakthrough e-ki crazy, and their love has never been and will never be the real thing, no matter how much any of them wanted to find each other. The film swept the true sense of history and replace it with a hack. I can not believe that the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a film about it, got it so wrong.
