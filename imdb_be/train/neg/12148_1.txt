Honestly, who in the name of God gave this movie 8.1 rating ?? I think that the people who actually made or played a major role in the film were the ones who voted. Otherwise, this movie sucks! This film is nothing more than an amateur, or perhaps a student film. I'm a movie fanatic, and saw the scary movies, but it was not literally sacrificed nothing here. History and action was the worst I have ever seen. Props, including using a toy airsoft with horrible special effects, where just as bad as the rest. I for foul language in movies, but F-bomb was dropped about every third word, and I think we might have a winner for the most use of F-Bomb in any movie EVER. The film also seems to have been removed with the use of cheap video cameras and not the actual movie. I've been waiting to get a reward for amateur film shown only on public access stations across the country, but it does not belong to a DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not make this film. All I can say is that it was a terrible waste of a free coupon video. This is valuable time that you can never get back. Unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this film, I think that this is my warning.
