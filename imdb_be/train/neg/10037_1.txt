I never thought that the standard Yashraj films ever degraded to such an extent! There's a nonsense story that does not catch any interest. <br /> <br /> Saif acted on. Karina improve the figure, but it's not a very good actress anyway. Akshay well. Anil also good. Can I say that the role was not good .. <br /> <br /> The great thing cheap is filled. I was surprised when it was to be "part of the comedy" movie. Just because the last few films were failures, which indicate whether Yashraj films have to do this kind of garbage? He has a history of so many good films. <br /> <br /> In general, I was completely disappointed with the film.
