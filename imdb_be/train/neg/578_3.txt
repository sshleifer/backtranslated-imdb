This is not a good film. Acting surprisingly tough and unconvincing.The film does not seem to know whether he is going to approach the real horror, or to go down the route of the camp and kitsch. I've never seen the first film, but this one is not on its own merits, there are a few unconvincing plot twists, and the viewer never aware of the importance of the female lead vampire. Not worth the effort to look
