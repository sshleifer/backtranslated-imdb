"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Given the people involved, it was several times better. <br /> <br /> Looking at this, if you are at least to some extent tied to the belief that it will be better, will likely make you cry. This is one of those films that had potential but was robbed this potential through a terrible scenario, and some is bad, not to mention the odd annoying and unnecessary character of George Clooney and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfus, but I care about so little that I do not even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> film is only saving grace is awesome crook Dictionary he introduces. I found myself thinking about it again and again as I watched more crime capers. This is the only reason why I gave the film 3. The plot boring, neurotic characters, nothing offensive, and very unpleasant. They are in a constant state of painful tension, and they are all so annoying that I celebrated my obstacles. They shout at each other and swear inappropriate. Dialogue insipid at best foolish and insulting in its low points. <br /> <br /> I believe that Stephen "TrafficÂ» Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for this. They should be tried for war crimes, if someone actually remembers this crap long enough to care.
