I just finished watching this movie. It was not funny bad, but I am very disappointed with him. I'm not really sure why anyone would make a movie like this. It was a little interesting, but I feel that the people doing it was much disagreement about what they were doing. Monday, the writer replied; Tuesday, Director; Wednesday, the guy who gets the coffee; etc. It looks like they really wanted to do a few different movies, but only had time and money to make one. <br /> <br /> Someone noticed that the effect was very good, but I would disagree. Again, if the actors were able to hold a closed face during filming, maybe they are better actors than I give them credit. <br /> <br /> On the back of the DVD panel gives the impression that the film will be a mystery ... something along the lines of historical law and order or national heritage. It starts like this, but then, out of nowhere it takes to turn a bad episode of Dark Zone, or ... it was another show that was not so good ... The unfortunate episode of The Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the film is that it just played. There's also an evil guy with spiked blond hair. There's a love interest, who, when she first appears, the wind is blowing really her hair. Seriously. Once you realize that this is a Christian film, the end is also quite easy to detect <br /> <br /> The cinematography was poorly done, especially in the initial stages. - a way to put your best foot forward. It was not brutal for most of the movie, but it was sometimes ridiculously bad shot of an old lady, praying, hands up in a dark room, while lightning strikes - the kind of thing that makes you just a little bit shy to watch a movie.
