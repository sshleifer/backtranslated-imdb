"Respect for the actor's" Ut Hagen is a standard textbook in many college theater courses. The book Hagen are two fundamentally different approaches to the development of the character as an actor: presentation approach and Representational approach. The presentation focuses on the actor approach the implementation of the character as sincerely as possible, by introducing emotional elements of the actor's own life. The Representational approach, the actor tries to imagine the effect of emotions, through a high degree of control of movement and sound. <br /> <br /> representative approach to acting is still partially in vogue when the hamlet was made, the British theater has a long history of this style of acting, and Olivier, we can say that in the end the king Representational school. <br /> <br /> Time has not been kind to the actor's school, or the film, almost every actor working today use presentational approach. Modern Eye, declared highly stylized delivery Olivier is boring, stiff and stilted. Instead of creating an internal conflict Hamlet, Olivier did recite, conceit megaphone with the melancholy Dane - acting style, which would be well laid back on the large theaters of London, but is too starchy to draw a modern Hamlet. <br /> <br /> And so the film creaks on ungainfully today. Olivier trend of e-nun-SI-eating makes some of the lines of Hamlet's unintentionally funny: "In-stead, you should ac-quire-and be prepared in the purr-Anse, which could give it ... Smooth-Ness!" instead of crying at the meeting the ghost of his father (as well as any actor could properly), bright fill light in the pupils Olivier give us that impression. <br /> <br /> Eileen Hurley actor is the only mention in this Hamlet, putting in good essay queen pain despite the obvious differences in age (he was 41, it was 26). Other actors in the film there is no chance to get anything else done significance, given the tendency to want to keep Olivier! Camera! on it! at all! time! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, you feel unsure Shakespearean stage actor who lack confidence, to reflect that beats incorrect Hamlet, and instead chosen to reflect the sort of Elizabethan megaphone. The final analysis: "I would be the kind of guy whipped for o'er-shrew to do it-Herods Herod: I beg you to avoid it."
