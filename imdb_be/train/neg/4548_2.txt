Sad. Minimum plot. No character development. I went into this film with high expectations from the book. This might be a strange movie. It could probably become a cult. No, it was a huge let down. It was a bad cast and special effects were terrible. It was difficult to determine who the bad guys were rebels or the military or the church, or all of them? I still was confused by some of the mini-scenes from the movie. I left stunned as to some aspects of this so-called "prophecy" that never really fully explained. I felt like I was watching a banal episode mini-series on the sci-fi channel. It seemed very much like a film made for television. Do not go see this movie. It's a waste of time and money.
