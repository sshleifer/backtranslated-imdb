I saw a comment capsule said "a lot of action." In my opinion, these two great actors giving a terrible idea, and with zero chemistry with each other, for a great director he kept the worst efforts. Robert De Niro has to be the most brilliant and soulful illiterate all times. performance of Jane Fonda uncomfortable drifts all over the map, as it clearly has no handle on this character, mainly because the character is so badly written. Molasses-like adjective is too fast for the painful stimulation of the film. Although the intention of the film is to be surging history of treatment literacy, seeing it is the truth "bummer." I give it a 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies to his budget level that I have ever seen.
