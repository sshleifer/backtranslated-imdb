What a waste of time and money! My hubby and I have seen this movie - after seeing the previews and think that this "can be fun." Wrong! This film is about 90 minutes too long. Actors trapped in poorly-written script and can not get out. Jokes weakness and fatigue, and even without seeing Wilson's naked behind can redeem any part of this film. Special effects ..... not. I half expected to see the harness and holding Uma her flying scenes. And if the effects of people, apparently, could not learn more quickly than-a-speeding-bullet flying superhero and fight scenes, they have covered all over with a twisted swirl blurred screen - which concealed the terrible consequences, very nice. sidekick Wilson was an excuse for a man, and Wilson did not have any chemistry with Uma or office co-worker. The sex scenes are not sexy and funny scenes are not funny. I guess I just expected too much from these actors. None of the characters were not really responsive, so I end up not caring a flying fig about any of them. Only memorable performances were children who played Bedlam and G-Girl, as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. In general, the film is super screwy - I would not even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!
