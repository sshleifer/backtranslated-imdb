This film did not have something I could not put his finger on the ground: the charisma from the leading actress. This inevitably translates into a lack of chemistry, if she shares the screen with her leading man. Even romantic scenes come across as merely actors in the game. It may very well have been the director, who calculated that he needed from the actors. I just do not know. <br /> <br /> But it could be the scenario? Just exactly who I was in love with the cook? He seemed more fascinated by his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately himself and his youthful exploits, than anyone or anything else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this film. But do not forget, he was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
