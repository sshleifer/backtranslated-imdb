Four years later, after making his directorial debut with the arthouse snoozer «Welcome to the notice", Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wants from Hollywood was to be one of the guys. «Roadie» is brotherhood boy brawl complete with Barroom brawls, horny harpies, Art Carney in the forced a wheelchair ... and Meat Loaf at the wheel. Meat Loaf (played by Travis W. perch!) In fact, quite a magical presence on the screen, and perhaps to a lesser role (the best film), it may actually be bland, but the script Zalman King full of stereotypical redneck humor and helpless Meat Loaf retained wide-eyed and weak-minded. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr., Blondie and all were - and they all look confused. They certainly have, «Roadie» is one bad trip. star is not from ****
