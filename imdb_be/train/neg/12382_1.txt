Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew it was Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was a rip off really in theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton these four brilliant actors did a great cultural statement with the 1967 master piece of director Stanley Kramer. This day is a rip off joke. So white guy with too stereotypical Italian family in Rhode Island brings his black girlfriend home (Insert here the SSP) for the funeral of his great father. His family members reaction was, of course .... predictable. This movie was so painfully telegraphed from the start to the end of my friends actually started a fake snore signal to me that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and remove the original. Take a pass on Wake.
