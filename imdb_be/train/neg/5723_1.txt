Anyone who says that it is better than Hostel says shit, believe me, I do not advocate Hostel, but this is ridiculous. It's just one more shot on the camcorder directly to DVD, low on the idea of ​​a waste of your time, I can not believe how many of these films have, and I have not seen decent. In the 80s video nasty, Gore and horror movies were made not budget, but a great story and loads of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director, who was supposed to say something. Now they just seem to be evacuated in an attempt to fool people browsing the Blockbuster to rent a copy, as long as people do not stop doing it, then I believe these films will keep popping up. This film is so small ideas, it's just amazing how it's ever been done by acting too scary place quite flimsy and the soundtrack is so annoying it hard to believe. It's a waste of time, has absolutely nothing going for it, unless you're on a quest to make a list of the worst films of all time. My best / worst part of the film, when a female character shows the gun at someone and threatening to shoot them if they did not back down, you can see that it does not even cover the cock with her finger just holding grip. Absolute joke.
