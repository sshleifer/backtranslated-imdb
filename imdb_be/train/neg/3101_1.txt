This is a rip off from 1984 hit "Gremlins" is quite possibly the biggest train wrecks film ever made. Even for a full movie «B», all the other cheap horror movies on the same platform, completely overshadow this film with the point of view of the story, acting and kindness. <br /> <br /> It starts with a random old guard and the younger rotten guard, whose name does not matter. Why? Because in a few minutes in the film, he is part of the "forbidden" safe and killed while living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> This is just an appetizer for the excrement with filling main course. The protagonist, Kevin struggled at different times, to prove himself as a total pussy. Perhaps he could in the film, but the audience he showed himself as nothing more than a bad actor. Kevin gets a job with the old guard, and sent through a security change in (wait for it) gave up the studio lot. So why do a set, you can just use the very studio. Back to the film. Kevin opens a forbidden safe and free of buildings. Power brownies people live out their wildest fantasies, and then kill them for some reason. They must be returned before sunrise or ... or what? Absolutely. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Kevin "macho" Army SPC friend Nick "woman" Daphne, whose character has no more substance than a bitch-whore and prostitute relationship worthy outfits. There is Kevin manipulative and "reserved" girlfriend Amy, whose deepest desire, seem to be poorly drawn Cher look-alike fishnet stockings with a pair of blue underpants Grandma top .. Do not ask me how it works. Quite possibly the most entertaining character all KYLE. As such a group of friends made up for question. Kyle distorted creep, which can not go an hour without self-stimulating. His hobbies include calling sex chat lines from other people's houses, and, most likely, to sniff underwear <br /> <br /> The story unfolds as the characters search for house :. (. AKA hand puppets) golfs beings who, for whatever reason, do not try to go no further than the limits of the local area. Each of the characters at the end of their lives wild fantasy that will never have anything to do with the presence of millions of dollars ... or a film that has a large budget <br /> <br /> WARNING spoilers GO :. Twist the end of the movie watcher will leave wondering "What?". The Hobgoblin returned to safe ... on their own. Perhaps they have lost patience in waiting for the sunrise, to wreak havoc, or possibly a narrative writing got cramp writer and decided not to worry about the final. Upon returning to the safe, the old guard shows "The fact that he had learned in the army" and detonates the explosives, destroying safe, signaling the end of the evil goblins and the end of this roller coaster; better adapted to travel on an escalator. <br /> <br /> The very badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears. If you plan to watch, I recommend a few alcoholic drinks in advance to accept any serious consideration of the film with the mind.
