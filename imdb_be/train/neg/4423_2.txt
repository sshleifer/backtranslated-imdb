Another one of the many almost forgotten films cranked Poverty Row in 1930, resurrected DVD magic. <br /> <br /> Cast action Universal Player Etuill (often actor in numerous films Frankenstein) as a pair of twins, which are involved in killing racket. One kills the victims (stockbrokers involved in a scam) and asks witnesses to the exact time and the other deaf and proved "not guilty" because he could not speak to witnesses. <br /> <br /> Of course, where it breaks down, if it is congenital deafness, they are both entirely deaf? Oh, well. <br /> <br /> Atwill does a very good job here, pretending to be deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no one here can really act worth a darn.
