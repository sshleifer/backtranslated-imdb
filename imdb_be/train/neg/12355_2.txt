After reading numerous reviews, I do not know what some people are watching a movie, but apparently it's not the one I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Actions primarily Moore, it's just awful. A woman can not act. Nice tits, but she just can not act. At no point, she came across as an actual character. Instead, he was spoiled Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play for fun with the boys <br /> <br /> And that's what this film ultimately is -. Hollywood make-believe. Training sequence from the top. Policy - the top. Political Correctness - the top. The fight scenes - you guessed it, over the top. Your mission is to get in and out without being detected. So what do you do? Why shoot as many rounds and make as much noise as possible, of course. About G.I. Jane, you can be my wing man anytime. <br /> <br /> The room is good, but as soon as Hollywood seizes it, we end up with a Top Gun with tits. <br /> <br /> What else can you expect from the US commercial films anymore? Not much, I think.
