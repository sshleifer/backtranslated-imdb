And he did it in the production of amazes me. The protagonist of the opposite show off, which is not the least bit funny. I can not stand the character at all. He has nothing to offer the dumb ass show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst caricature of the surface over the last 10 years, not a joke. The storylines how poorly written and executed. Jokes as bad as in Disney's The Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not help but like this show anymore, it's awful and should be abolished. Even a bad song. Name worse. <br /> <br /> It's as if the show is written for a couple of 15-year-old, who on the basis of the nature and thinks that they are hot stuff when they really are just arrogant and lack of creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go far and fast!
