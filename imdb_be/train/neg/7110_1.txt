Well, one has to give credit to the director for the way he was fearless. Fearless is the correct term. Not only that he used in the overall complexity of the cast of five people (with no additions at all), but he also decided to use a sub-par special effects with confusing and boring story, it too, and I'm not kidding, put a warning at the beginning of the movie you You could die of fright !!! However, they promise FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN. In order to have a terrible lame gardener is always a good move. Yaaa unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you watch Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have already seen this. They love to show terrible movies, just so you know. <br /> <br /> A good gift for someone you hate.
