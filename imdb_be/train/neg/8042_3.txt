Secret ... This film blowing. Sorry, but it just did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this poor riff on I know what you did last summer and SCREAM, Beth, played excellently by Dora Barton joins a few friends on a trip during spring break. The Group leases fashion houses and trying to enjoy a fun vacation. Then death begins. First one, then another, then another of the friends was killed, which leads to a sad and banal climax with predictable results. <br /> <br /> One thing to note, Dorie Barton pauper Reese Witherspoon ?? it looks like Reese, acts as Reese and Reese could go to the police warehouse. Maybe they left her? Anyhoo, decent cinematography and fair actions could not compensate for the bad dialogue and horrible letter.
