Take the main Frankenstein movie, bring some Reanimator (but not the good part), and you have a doctor Hackenstein. Of course, it was obviously inspired by the aforementioned films, but it never materialized nothing special in its own right. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife, so that the entire film takes place in one night, as he tries to revive his wife. In order to revive his wife, he decides to cut off body parts of some women who have been stranded and, coincidentally, decided to stay the night at his place. <br /> <br /> I can not say that acting is not bad, and the guide. Everything here is just too standard. The few attempts to have a joke actually work (check out the scene when Hackenstein continues to hide behind him deaf assistant, because it will certainly be very upset if she saw him holding a woman and a needle), but it's hardly enough to I recommend this film. Music decent that the blood that there is decent, and the cast looks pretty good. And half the time, I even entertained by this film. But I never felt that it was something more than a time waster. You can be avoided. <br /> <br /> Try instead Frankenhooker.
