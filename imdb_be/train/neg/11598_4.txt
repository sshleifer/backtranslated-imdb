If you look back on another bad nightmare continued as the Freddy's Revenge, you should at least give him some credit for trying something new. Although the child sleep more enjoyable it makes absolutely nothing new in this series. Yes, there are creative death, as usual, as the child becomes part of the comic book and face «Super Freddy», but even scenes like that is not being used to their full potential, and parts without Freddy simply boring. <br /> <br /> This marked the official death scariness to the series. Freddie seems comic relief now ... but what <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
