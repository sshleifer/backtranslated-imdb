2 This paragraph is devoted to the intelligent performance of Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood films are not very eager to be realistic, but please Walt Disney production is more realistic than this story. Father dies, and does what he is doing any good father ... kick his son out of his son with his pregnant wife. A few things that were too difficult to swallow 1. Priyanka "cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom," and go on to live hungry in her in-laws garden shed ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got a job as a stunt dog gets bitten rabified, so you just walk away. This film is an insult to our intelligence, I really can not believe that I made a financial contribution to the "people" who made this film took my family to see, as we left the theater with a frown, please do not expose discover this mess, to see this my advice and do not waste your "station".
