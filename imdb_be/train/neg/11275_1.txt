This is really a bottomless `clone 'Lock, Stock and with a stellar cast and a scary scenario. I have no idea why so many leading British actors subscribe to this garbage, they have been bribed. Slip game storyline goes on forever and ever and ever, and if I would not have paid good money for it I would eliminate it after 10 minutes. Not the worst movie ive ever seen, that honor goes to this would be a pity that there bogroll ?? film "(I use the term loosely)` Gummo Â»(I feel judged, so nazyvaemyy` director chas- lost half of my life), but this trash almost right there with him. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen. Things like this is reminiscent of Hollywood, that they do not have a monopoly on really horrible movies.
