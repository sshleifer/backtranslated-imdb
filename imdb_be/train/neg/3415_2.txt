In standard form, it is purely a terrible film. Nevertheless, it is estimated almost a perfect score on a scale of unintentional comedy. I can think of several real comedies that make me laugh as hard as I watch this movie. Andy Griffith ghost, dressed in Indian attire dancing sends me into hysterics every time. I would not waste gas or energy management in the video store to rent it out, but if you happen to be lying on the couch at 3 am, and it comes on the TV, check it out.
