The first half hour of the film had a steady pace and the characters entered. But suddenly everything happens too quickly, cause the lame Akshey Kumar today 3 girls, very loudly over operating from both Akshey and John Abraham. Nehuy Dupia was the highlight of the film, Paresh Rawa did well, but not as good as its performance in Hera Pheri. Overall, this movie was the biggest disappointment of the film does not do justice of his trailer. Sun to save money and do not watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again <br /> <br /> In summary: cheap stage show and an appearance in the film is no history or substance, the plot was extremely non-human feel good music Preetam, who bought us Dhoom! Continue! film shot all in one room, the newcomers (woman CAST) were in order, as it was their first film, but the actors as defined Akshey and John as the director Priyadarshan totally disappointed installed gives his worst movie ever!
