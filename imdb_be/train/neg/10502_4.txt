The film has several storylines that are several different characters. Different storylines do not feel as one complete part, which makes this comedy very incoherent and one even gets annoying sometimes see <br /> <br /> This may seem weak and clich√©, but it's true. You are much better to watch Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery Channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more fun than the movie. I am sure that the actors and the crew had a lot of fun making this film, but the film does not give us the viewer a lot of fun. For comedy is simply not funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin just not good actors, even if they play themselves! Their antics is simply not good enough to make the whole film around the scene and feel for a long time, distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times. <br /> <br /> The film was quite some potential, I mean Steve Irwin that one character in a strange way at the same time intriguing and fun to watch, so that when I first heard that they were making a film about the "Crocodile Hunter "my first reaction was; brilliant! The film, however, is largely affected by a weak story and incoherent story lines with boring and unfunny characters. The film does have a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make the film watchable at least once, but all the same I must, of course, would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this film feels like a waste of time. However, this film can be watchable only once, when he gets on television, on a rainy day. It has some good moments, but the story line is really completely destroy the film and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
