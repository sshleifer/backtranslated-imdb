I had no expectations other than to have fun for 90 minutes, and that's exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is old-fashioned, of course, some of the dialogue was not perfect, of course, "special effects" were a bit sentimental. That's why I enjoyed the film so much. It's perfect for this genre 70s Horror classics. <br /> <br /> The talent must begin somewhere, that goes for the actors and crew, and that the best piece of material to hone their skills than it. <br /> <br /> I'm at a glance forward to another film of the producers and directors.
