If you do not see this movie, if you value your mind. At the end of our collective views, my friends and I estimated that each of us has lost 5% of our brain in the course of it. The only person connected with its decisions, there was no clinically mad was the set designer. <br /> <br /> Most of the films leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Now I understand that instead of disgust, this film has generated a deep hatred in me. I hate this movie very, very much. <br /> <br /> Some might say that this film is not meant to be taken seriously. If only it does not take itself seriously. But it does. The plot is heated on a version of Blade Runner-esque universe blended with cheap rubber suit, so common in bad movies dinosaurs. Dialogue is not only frivolous and meaningless, but often literally sick. Whoopee Goldberg does not even try, but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex-as-nails soul. And whether or not it Landua Juliet with her again, again a British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Val) as the raging Commissioner, you will be immersed in an ever-growing sense of skepticism and disappointment. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film only for those who want to see the depths of stupidity to which humanity can fall.
