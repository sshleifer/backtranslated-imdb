My friends and I rented it from Blockbuster, because we saw the name of Nana Visitor in the box. This film is a parody I hope it nullifies her resume. <br /> <br /> «plot» was lost and lethargic, which operates mainly dry and unbearable in some parts. The film does not make sense at all. Rough plot of an alien species parasite that infects humans has been done many times films with much better scenarios than that, for example, the invasion of the body-the kidnappers and faculty. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the misfortune to come across this movie, I suggest you write it down. <br /> <br /> as it classes itself as a horror film, when there was no use of fear, suspense, gore, terror, or any of the usual horror movie techniques that I do not know, but if you do find a desire to see this movie, I suggest you a lot of sugar, before hand, so you can find it funny part.
