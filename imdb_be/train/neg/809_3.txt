I was expecting something out of "K-911", I mean it looks like a cute movie that I could get into. I've always loved the dog comedy movies. But it seems that it was to be a film Jame, not Jerry Lee. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests did not really have the chemistry to begin with. Not to mention the fact that James seemed to be a common sight in the film sexist, even though the writer is not going in that direction. James just really ticked me more than half of the film. Dogs were the real stars, and it is very sad that they are covered with the actors. <br /> <br /> So I'm glad that it's not just me on IMDb, who agreed that it was a pretty stupid movie. But I hope that James would understand that it was his brother Jim, who was a talented, do not be offended, but not everyone can be the star of their brother. You do not want to Ashlee Simpson same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
