Racers say 100 miles / h seems to be fast, as long as you drove 150 and 150 miles / h seems to be fast, as long as you drove 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> Andalusian dog seems breathtakingly amazing, as long as you have seen Eraserhead Eraserhead and seems breathtakingly strange, until you saw the Only Begotten. <br /> <br /> Only Begotten and seems breathtakingly strange, until you've seen the work of Frederick S. Hobbs. supporters of the race, there is nothing in the whole world of cinema, as the works of Frederic S. Hobbs. <br /> <br /> Alabama Spirit comes as close as any of his films, with an agreed timetable, and it involves only the hippies, rock concerts, magic, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations , elephants and Mystery gas. And Fabulous Woodmobile, cruising the Sunset District of San Francisco, of course. <br /> <br /> What is really strange that someone gave him a lot of money to make a ghost of Alabama. There sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. Somehow that makes the Spirit of Alabama so wrong. You see some terrible cheeseball as night horror or plutonium Baby, and at least some of the oddities excusable on the grounds that they are obviously making a film with a margin on their Discover card. But the Spirit of Alabama was made with a real budget, and it is evil. I mean, I have a script about a tribe of cannibals who live in Thunder Bay, Ontario, is building a secret temple in the woods with Twizzlers, and no one beat me in the house, waving a checkbook - how did this guy get the funds for FOUR with flakiest movies ever made?
