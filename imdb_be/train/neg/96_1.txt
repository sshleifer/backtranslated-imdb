..Oh wait, I can! This film is not a typical movie snob if you do not want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions as "continuity editing" and "geographical match." I could not tell where I was in this movie. One second they are now, the next minute they were allegedly in the 70th years of managing a modern SUV and wear something similar to me as a 80-style clothing. I think. I could not devote sufficient attention to it for a long time, since the action was just awful. I think it only attracted attention because it has a 3d, which I was not looking. If you b-movie fans, and for b-movie I have in mind a bad film, this film is for you. This home cinema and all the nonsense style will keep you laughing until you can not sleep. If your tastes are more for Antonioni and Goddard, though, just skip this one.
