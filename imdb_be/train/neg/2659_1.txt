I'm sorry but it's just awful. I talked to people about this film and some bad actions that were therein, and they almost did not believe me. There's nothing wrong with the idea, the modern day Japanese troops drawn back in time to the days of Bushido warriors and their modern weapons is a match almost anything. When the troops first to realize that something strange is happening is each person in the rear of the vehicle it is necessary to say "Hey my clock stoppedÂ»? Imagine a line like that is repeated 15+ times before they say anything else, and you have a lack of greatness of the film in a nutshell.
