Spoiler Warning. ,, I agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad film, for such an interesting and true story. It was such a promise, but the action was laughable at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Another is that some of the theme park. I have found that laughter, as I observed that it was suppose to be a serious scene. I really wanted to like this movie, but I could not. The best part was the fight between friends, which ended with the dying "King." I liked Queen punishment. And the last shot made a beautiful picture, though. There are so many of the best films to watch. I do not recommend it.
