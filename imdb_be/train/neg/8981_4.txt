This version of the Paramount / robbery of Oklahoma! / ANNIE GET WEAPON / Disaster JANE is not all that unusual or innovative. Marketing and intro comments may be there to save what is actually a very bad movie Western musical shot on a sound and as a live TV show. I do not think the use of background cycloramas lit in various scenes with yellow or pink or red, or .... all that innovative. As already mentioned, it looks to me like the film, which was made on a TV budget: All sound, with a minimal set of supported lit cycs! (Compare with new faces (1952) the actors come off quite well, although the style was much better understood when Paramount fired Li'l Abner in 1959 couorse, this film offers a frequent question .. "What were they You think? "
