Superdome is one of those movies that make you wonder why it was done. The whole story comes to someone trying to sabotage the Super Bowl, and all attempts made to stop them. Tom Selleck and career Donna Mills managed to survive it for me. However, the most disappointing thing about this was NOT BEEN football at all! Avoid this one if possible.
