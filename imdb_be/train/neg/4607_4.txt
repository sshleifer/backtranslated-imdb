You can not imagine how I looked forward King of the Ants. As a big fan of Gordon, I expect the European premiere of the wicked anticipation.especially, since I loved Dagon - the latest achievement Gordon - so much. King of the Ants premiere here in my country, and it was he, Gordon, who came to present it. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulate him for it later. King of the Ants is its most uninspired and mediocre film to date. Indeed, the level of quality never exceeded the usual TV-thriller standards. The contours of the plot is very routine, and except for a few scenes of the poor, a typical touch Gordon never recognized. In addition, the already weak script has more holes than a Swiss cheese bowl! It includes a young wannabe-cheater who is hired to commit murder. Thus, he does.and, of course, they do not pay it him.and, of course, falls in love with wife.and victim, of course, he takes revenge .. only the sequence in which the man of madness spiral descents are saying, and they the only ones that remind you that you're still watching the movie Stuart Gordon. Operating performance below average McCenna as the heroic, the bottom of the life of George `Norm Peterson" Wendt as a chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the good-natured sex bomb. Extremely illogical things happen all the time and the history of blunting becomes irritable very quickly, while the make-up effects were not enough to satisfy even the amateur horror fans. I have read several other comments on King of the Ants, arguing that it is better to Gordon, as he finally is thinking and constant film.Well, if it is to remain immature and case.I to Re-Animator another review, thanks a lot. Well, I think every good director exhaled and inspiration eventually.too bad he defeated Stuart Gordon.
