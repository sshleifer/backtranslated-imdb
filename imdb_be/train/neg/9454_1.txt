When my own child begging me to leave the opening show of this movie, I know it's bad. I would scratch my eyes out. I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. This is one of the few films in my life I have observed, and immediately wanted to «unwatch», if only it were possible. Other films as "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious", and that is better than this shit in a hat. <br /> <br /> I can get drunk to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget that I have ever seen it blasphemy to a good name Susie. <br /> <br /> To Mike Myers, I say stick to Austin, or even resurrect Wayne World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, it does not mean that Susie is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
