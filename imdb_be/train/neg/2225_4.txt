Honestly, I can not understand why this film is so good bet here, and why he Bakshi thought it was his best film. I'm a big fan of the early work Bakshi - especially «Heavy Traffic» and "Magic", but to be honest, "Magic" (1977) was the last good movie, which he did after that, he turned to the mainstream, starting with the devil "Lord. rings "and then knuckling down with a sword and sorcery weight Frazetta for" Fire and ice »<br /> <br /> I can say is history giddy animation quality TV -.? I insist that it is much worse than his 70-things - and while "Magic" had a real idea, whimsical, some beautiful background art, and under the earth, adults x sensuality, "Fire and Ice" is simply designed for a 14-year-old boys, and has intellectual influence Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> So, if you liked the GOR of the book, you might like it. In my opinion, though, it was just another splash in slide quality after the "Magic" of which Bakshi never moved (although he did some decent things TV recently) <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10
