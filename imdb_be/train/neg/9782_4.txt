This film was a promise !! What a great idea, outsider paintball team is struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose its speed due to poor Dialoge, poor editing and half-written story. Characters at the beginning was interesting, only to lose steam halfway through, to become one-dimensional human beings spraying with tired jokes. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spent more time in the history of Dialoge and it would have been a great film, almost as an afterthought instead of effort.
