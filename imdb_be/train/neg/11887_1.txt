The world may end. Unfortunately, this film survived another indication of the failure of Canada to make films that go beyond disgusting. Maybe it's because all of our really good people (Zhuison, Martin Short, etc.) in Hollywood.) In fact, this is very bad Short was not cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film. He could give him some confidence. The Canadian government needs to understand --- and this film is an excellent example --- that shovel money into the trough does not lead to a good movie. When people are lapping these public funds have been forced to compete, they may have been forced to come up with something worthwhile. How are they another awkward giggles.
