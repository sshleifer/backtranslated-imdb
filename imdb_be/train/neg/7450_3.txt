I saw this movie in the theater many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively, I could not see any redeeming virtues in films: Dennis Quaid was cast in the role of a cop who never smiles or a smirk, while his smile and smile are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover has been cast as the bad guy, but - again - the representation of the majority of viewers can not go far enough to believe him in this role. In addition, it included Jared Leto is not believable as a former medical student. The tension was simply non-existent, since the killer was known very early. The final was, again, no drama, no time, no one around me did not care about what will happen next. All we could expect was the end of the film. In general, disappointing evening spent in the theater.
