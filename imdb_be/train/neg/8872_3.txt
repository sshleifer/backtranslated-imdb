Major Payne really was not very good at all. Despite the fact that funny here and there, the story was funny and the acting was poor. voice and temperament Major Payne was particularly annoying. The idea of ​​a meaningless and that the boys had to do was even more ridiculous in this film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
