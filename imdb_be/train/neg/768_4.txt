I agree with the majority of fans of Colombo, this film was an unnecessary change in the format. Columbo is a unique non-standard methods of the police with the police. This film looks like a remake of any other conventional detective dramas of the past. This is an anxious moment, because it is not an ordinary detective Columbo. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in this film that left me intrigued. Firstly, I can not figure out the name of this movie. This is misleading. Perhaps a better name would have been «The Vanishing Bride» or something like that. Secondly, Columbo hides part of the evidence, without offering the reason (for the audience, at least), why he does it. <br /> <br /> I do not feel betrayed, just disappointed. I am delighted that Peter Falk is back to normal Columbia. <br /> <br />
