I, first of all, completely and surely do not agree with a customer who calls it "a travesty". Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally presented the film at the screening I saw in Chicago. He worked on the film for many years, and this is the first of a certain trilogy. "What is it?" Crispin Glover is an attempt at a feature film in the spirit of those whom he worships from Duke, Lynch, etc. <br /> <br /> I've heard a rumor about the film years ago, "epic porn movie with all Down syndrome litho led by Crispin Glover." When he finally came out I looked online the trailer and read the synopsis and I was foaming at the mouth with anticipation. ... I went to Chicago to see him, and it was a big disappointment. When he got goofy sh * t, for example, pot smoking grandmother and dancing dolls, it will remain with something much better, but only about 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Other words just watch the trailer, have fun, and leave it at that. There are some amazing images and fantastic mapping and phrases, but his lack of attention comes down to frustration.
