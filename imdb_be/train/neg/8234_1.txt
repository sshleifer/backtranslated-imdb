Writers and producers of this little picnic plummeted new depths of depravity. I made a writer's block is set so bad, that the ideas are so exhausted that they were forced to include the hideous scene where a young woman defecate in the back seat of the van, and then immediately throwing feces at the rear car (mind you, at least, it It summarizes what this movie is worth). We have already referred to one of the other women urinating on one of his friends at gunpoint, as well as numerous episodes of vomiting graphics; times would be enough ... we got the message! It really takes toilet humor to the next level! If the script and the acting was better than I could easily forget that I was watching a film shot entirely on a low-budget video. It was quite an original story, with reasonable (only) part of the direction that we only ever have to take a point of view in the van; in a way that makes it feel much more real. We should never see in any other place, for example, in the shop or in the field where few women have disappeared, and it might be added as necessary voltage. <br /> <br /> The script was deplorable. Lines like "I do not feel too good ... I want to go home" after one of the girls was continued psychopath; exposes rape with a screwdriver and shot at, it seems a bit undercooked <br /> <br />. action was diabolical (except maniac). They knew all the basic 5 actresses in this learn acting, taking a correspondence course for a long postal strike! the sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with subtitles. <br /> <br /> the director seemed an easy job of it. it seems that the only direction to be given was: "Scream GirlsÂ» <br /> <br /> AND HOW TO Screaming ...... If you look at it, please make sure that some paracetamol at the ready!
