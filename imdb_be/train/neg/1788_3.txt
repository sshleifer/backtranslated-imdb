Providing credit where it is due, only throws, costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the lowest point in a long career Bing Crosby in Paramount. The script is about as awkward as you might imagine, and neither accidental nor Bing, William Bendix, nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do a thing about restoring it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks very silly boy wig page. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a margin suit the heroine role that requires it to look at the adoration of Bing and a little more for a pair of uninspired ballad warbling voice, probably christened about exceptions. <br /> <br /> Just awful! the wit of Mark Twain is not visible in any of the scenarios. Only die-hard fans can Crosby possible to evaluate this disorder this uninspired direction of the film. Even the extras to look as though they do not know what to do <br /> <br /> In summary :. Dumb as dishwater. It not recommended, even for children.
