Danielle have some problem brewing under its attractive appearance. She begins to lose her mind when she learns of a distant relative (which it resembles), which was burned for being a werewolf. It goes a little wild when it beads horny men and gushing from the throat. She finally found a man who helps to keep its domestic animal, but if others destroy their happiness, she takes her revenge violent and fluffy. <br /> <br /> Â«Werewolf Woman" not very goof film, but it does not pose as a good mob movie. A fun time can be obtained by harping on the bad actor / dubbing / translation and just cheesiness production. But by itself it moves slowly but has enough nudity to keep you wake ?? bit.
