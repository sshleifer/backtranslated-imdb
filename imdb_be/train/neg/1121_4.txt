During the first few minutes of the Dutch thriller, we learn that Crabbe is gay alcoholic writer who sleeps SANS linen, fantasizes about killing her roommate, trying to steal the magazine from the newsstand, and lust after a studly young man he It meets at the railway station. And he's the hero of this ridiculous movie that all dressed (except Crabbe at least one scene too much), but nowhere to go. The main plot is very simple, but it was delayed for almost two hours before reaching conclusions meaningless. Of the Supreme has a pleasant visual flair, but drawn to scenes of wild hallucinations, open symbols and free of blood, when he runs out of ideas.
