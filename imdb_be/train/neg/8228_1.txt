The problem with this film that he shot at an inappropriate camera and the film is blurred and grainy. Maybe it's just the fact that the one who was holding the camera could not move, because they were a fit or something. There is also too much food, and vomiting in this movie. There is someone vomiting every twenty minutes, and it makes me think that this was done some bulimia or something. It was disgusting. Then there's the annoying high-pitched scream that goes on and on and on and does not stop until the credits roll. I do not like it when all of its members were shot (or not, I do not know), and it goes into the van and puts patches on. It was just a really stupid even in the movies. How many people could siphon gas to get the van going? This should be a whole lot, because they do not run out of gas for the rest of the film. It was a terrible movie and I highly recommend seeing it in the whole of your life.
