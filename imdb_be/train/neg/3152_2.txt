Poorly structured, poorly written, loaded with clich√©s and flat dialogue. Neither scene shines. Actors fight the pain dull script that manages to completely avoid any surprises, twists or conflict. You know from the first ten minutes of where it occurs. <br /> <br /> For the film, set in New York, he has almost no feeling for the city. There are dozens of other indie films that manage to do so, it seems, magically on a small budget. This one seems like it was filmed in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you play Henstridge, why you put it in baggy sweaters? Why Vartan look boring and monotonous? Where's the attraction? I felt like I was watching a movie of the week poor Christian was so sexless and moralizing. <br /> <br /> Steven Feder great success is that he persuaded the people to make the film soft.
