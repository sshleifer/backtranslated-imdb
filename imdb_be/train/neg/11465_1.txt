Without a doubt, this is one of the worst pictures I've ever actually paid money to see - kind of clicks you choose out of desperation, the mall theater during the Christmas holidays, if you missed the start time of no good, but still dead set on watching the movie! And this is exactly what I came to see this stink bomb ... <br /> <br /> At a distance of mostly three decades, I can still smell the rotting fish, which make up the storyline. Incredible story - that the killer whale has a grudge against the person is not on the sea - it's ridiculous. And that's all for completely out of place, "the theme of love," which plays over the finished film devoid of love story, but. At least, Charlotte Rampling is beautiful (in a two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris simply chew the scenery. He was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw), and it is not "Jaws". Fortunately, I put most of it out of sight, and when I run through it on the air TV casts I go immediately. "Danger, Will Robinson!" See the current TV Revenue Sharing wife whales ( «Orca - I love Orca ...») - at least it is more for sixty seconds. The film is 92 minutes of my life that I will never go back.
