Very bad film. Very, very, very bad film. It's rare, but defenitly not worth hunting down. This Italian Jaws rip-off makes little sense most of the time, and there is no sense to others. "Alligator" is not very convincing, and many of the sub-sections go nowhere. If this is a local video store, you can see it if you're a fan of the monster movie, but it's not worth hunting down.
