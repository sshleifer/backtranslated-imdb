I gave it 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting topics many here have already mentioned. Domestic violence, sexuality and taboo in many of them. Beyond the gore, I really would not call this horror as I have science fiction. <br /> <br /> It is a grim, sad and hopeless. Although I am not against the less than cheerful end, I'm really tired of "people suck" clich√©, it's a central place in every film. I know that you can not get the humanitarian level today, not bowing to the altar of hatred as a member of the human race, but as "a fight as a writer / director and we pretend that different than everyone else in the package and note that ALIENS Killing the evil of the human race! Right now, as you read this, and think that humanity deserves to die, just to go out, find a lake and swim, as long as your hands get tired. Thus, you will not be around to direct the next film, or write the next book, telling me that I deserve to die for being alive. It's stupid, Sun thoughtful and sad.
