I am sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a C-class porn with one major difference :. Many porn <br /> <br /> The story and dialogue do not need a major overhaul. Maybe the bad game would not be so noticeable. At least Shagan was chosen. <br /> <br /> While I recognize that this was a low budget and the director did a good job, given the fact that visually little resources he had, he would have spent more than once in the history or better ask someone to write it. Many of the scenes were just pointless. <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of my time.
