The infamous Ed Wood "classic" Plan 9 from Outer Space has outraged alien to challenge the human race, "... stupid! Stupid, stupid stupid! "I would have to say, exhibits in this trial, probably this film, ridiculously silly sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> The fall of the action star Jean-Claude Van Damme returns to the hit role for him in the hatch of the original film, the former Universal Soldier who now works doing really good universal soldier. While Van Damme was too large to reprise the role in the first two sequels, it was too small to do anything else until the fourth film in the Universal Soldier series came around. So, probably, cursing under his breath all the way, he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks. You will find a lot of senseless violence, but I would advise you to get a check for your brain coat at the door when you start watching this thing. Otherwise, you are liable to forget where you left it at the time it was over. <br /> <br /> Luke called into action against more universal soldiers after a really evil computer named Seth (HAL does look like Ghandi) makes all of the other soldiers in the universal evil, ruthless killer. Of course, that's what these things are programmed to do, but in this case they kill their creators, and not "the enemy", so that this is a problem. <br /> <br /> I love stupid logic of this film. Logic that says that the supercomputer will be to create a body for itself, which looks like a shame as Michael Jai White does to be in this movie. Logic dictates that the creator Seth have blue hair cyber stereotype bastard spouts cliches more regularly than Old Faithful makes steam. Logic that is the culmination of Karate FUNCTIONS two characters fight each pushing, at least ten separate panels with broken glass within three minutes of screen time. <br /> <br /> The film also has a daughter in danger nature, wrestler Bill Goldberg as a wrestler under the guise of universal soldier, and romance as clips, I should think, the authors thought tacked songs were actually a good thing. And if the movie ends, it ends. Not a minute after the giant towering explosions style final credits are running. A lot of the epilogue, or where they are now, not a final kiss, a blast, a hug is over. Even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible <br /> <br /> While it's not Plan 9, the United States :. TR is a silly little thing thriller that will be fun at parties full of rowdy Van Damme fans who love to see their hero really reach new depths. Not seen in a serious stomach.
