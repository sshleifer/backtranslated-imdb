This piece of dirt is almost impossible to follow. Sound shit image quality again goes from bad to worse for the good to bad! Things happen reason not to appear and disappear for no apparent characters. Was a director suffering from a massive brain injury in the course of its production? <br /> <br /> The poor film makes to the side, the story simply disgusting vomiting evil shit If you like rape, murder, self-harm, and it is right your alley. And if simulated murder scene is not enough, then you can enjoy music videos performed by real people. I watched almost all of it, but had to be excluded after I saw whose brains beat out. Never before had I seen a movie that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty.
