I thought the zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was pretty good horror film When the body of the terrorist, chemical infested stolen, recovered in the US armed forces, then the corpse was cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere on a small island. Soon infected locals turn into flesh-hungry zombies, and a group of soldiers who are on leave, must team up with a group of tourists and catch yourself in an abandoned hotel, they are trying to deal with aggressive living dead. I have not found this movie to be as good as the original film, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still OK horror film with some good action. I do not think that it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
