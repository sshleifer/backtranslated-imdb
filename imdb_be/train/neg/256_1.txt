What? It is assumed that funny Jamie Foxx? Whether it is actually think he's funny? Well, it's funny watching his confidence, funny.The man has no identity at all ... I mean, you can immediately see who his idols, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he is trying really hard to imitate they mostly movies.The the only problem is that it makes it bad, unevenly, and that leaves some part where he looks more like Denzel, this macho-s ** t ratio, and then abruptly goes to of Martin Lawrence, funny and clumsy, stupid comic. There's no personal touch to all that, I mean, it does not contribute anything to the person he is trying to sell, and I am sure that he has nothing to say in person. He's actually Mr. Dull boy personally. <br /> <br /> I really hope, Hollywood, and the black community in America will find someone better to start in the super stars like Don Cheadle, for example, but perhaps the best is pathetic Jamie generation remixes of old .
