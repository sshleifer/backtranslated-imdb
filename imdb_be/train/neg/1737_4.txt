Final film for Ernst Lubitsch, Preminger completed after the premature death of Lubitsch during production, is juggling with grace and silliness, romance, and musicians, and costume fantasy stage. In the castle of the 19th century in the South-Eastern Europe, the countess falls on her sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian uprising; it contributed to her ancestors who painted the image of magic comes to life. Grable in a long blonde wig, decorated with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this scenario (as Samson Refelsona taken from the operetta Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is flooded with a variety of ideas that are not network - or entertain. The results are good, but unabsorbing. * 1/2 ****
