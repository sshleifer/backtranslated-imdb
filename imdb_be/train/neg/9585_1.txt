I remember watching this movie back in 86 'when it first came out & that is a terrible film. The action was brutal story was so flimsy that it would be or what should have been blown away in a breath of wind. I think he put me to sleep on more than one occasion, and I'm not tired, I remember. Please avoid at all costs is even better to have all your teeth pulled out without any painkillers owls, it would be more interesting. It's just a pity that I could not give it a zero or negative score. I wish I had not wasted my money to get this one out of the video store is all I can say was that it was the tape was still brand new, hardly surprising since the film was so poor. If I remember correctly, I sat and watched it with a girl I really wanted to get out and the fact that she was sitting next to me was still not enough to keep me awake, how bad this film.
