I ordered a movie from Korea, because I was an extra in it and it was interesting to see how it turned out. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I can say that I am ashamed that in any part of it. I feel uncomfortable, not only for ourselves, but for everyone else who had any part in making this a mockery of the British "comedy." <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end of the film is predictable, tedious, boring, monotonous and fit to crawl to the fact that a few times I actually looked away from the screen in disbelief dis. Until then, until you actually see the film, it is difficult to imagine how a non-romantic and non-romantic comedy comedy can be. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad story, but poorly made film. In one scene, you can see the director or assistant runner showing S.A.-x, when cotton. I will post the details of this, see "mismatches". <br /> <br /> On the rising side, it fills me with emotions (disappointment, anger, embarrassment ??)
