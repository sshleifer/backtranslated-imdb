Pathetic attempt to use science to justify a new age religion / philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other, and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports the idea in Eastern religions, that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the world of subatomic, you can never predict the location definitely a particle at a given time. You can only give a chance and it is in one place at one time. In addition, the act of observation seems to affect the event. The solid particles may pass through the barriers. All this, so far, is accurate. But they argue that this means that if you believed, quite honestly, that you could go through the wall, you could really do it. This is complete nonsense. Instead, the theory states that at our level, it is possible for you to go through the wall, but it was only by chance and has nothing to do with faith. In addition, you must continue to go to the wall eternity ever even the slightest chance of passing through the wall, so the odds are astronomically against it. <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how they distort science. But it is much more annoying story involving the unfortunate photographer played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture becomes so confused, unclear. What to do with the negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-loathing. There may be some truth, but quantum physics has nothing to do with him. <br /> <br /> In addition, string theory is the hot new thing in physics today. Instead of wasting your time with this dreck, I suggest you rent Elegant Universe, a strange series made for NOVA on of PBS, which gives you the history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M theory of 3-hour episodes. Quantum mechanics explains it very well, if you want to know this without assigning metaphysical mist.
