There are some good shots in this film, it picks up some scenery with beautiful light, in fact, the cinematography, it's probably the best asset. <br /> <br /> But it's basically more of the made for television movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it interesting enough view, there is no subtitle and key plot events are not presented in Spanish, so which is not Hispanic remain a little loose. <br /> <br /> I had it as a gift for Xmas, as this is a family trait to work through the actor's film we find talented, and Matthew ~ d Mconaughey was just amazing in "A Time to Kill" and «The Newton Boys», so I suggested I would like to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> However, although it says on the DVD box is a film by Matthew Mconaughey and uses it as a marketing tool, it has a few lines, and the screen for the not so minutes at the end of the film, it is mainly an additional and it really does not light up the screen when it is switched on, so die hard fans, re-ally, it is not necessary at this point. <br /> <br /> In the film star, though, Patrick McGee great though and very easy on the eyes, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint about the guy, he is well written in the ROM whom . <br /> <br /> Thus, for the present McConaughey acting glitter ones I've seen, I would recommend, "A Time to Kill», «Boys Newton" "Fragility", "How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days" "TFC" and "Amistad" and avoid too "Larger than life" and "Angels in the outfield," if you do not feel like a movie kids or have kids around, none of them, which testify to his talent, but rather funny films for children, again MM is really nothing more that supports the artist only a few people, if all the lines. <br /> <br /> regard Scorpion Springit-x is not a bad film, but he also did not escape the theft either.
