My God, Jerry may be the undisputed king, but a talk show movies a completely different ball game, and he's way out of his league. The script for this film is so poor, that should be seen to be believed, and it is sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as Michael Dudikoff (80 steps ?? B'movie King), Michael Jai White (last seen in the Sci Fi flop? ? Spawn "), as well as survivors Games William McNamara (which is involved in only half of the fun of the situation in the whole film!) to bend it low for the job. If you are a fan of Jerry then stick his TV show as a waste and a half hours. After how I ended up sitting behind that I was able to catch the last Rocky 5 for half an hour on TV that looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison, I think that says more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
