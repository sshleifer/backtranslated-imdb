I still do not know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This "film" is not worth Memorex DVD-R was burned on; I thought I was looking at the end result is a group of middle school students are stealing their parents' video camera. This is definitely the worst film ever made. I really, from the bottom of my heart, I want to sue Aaron Yamasato two hours he stole from my life <br /> <br /> So, apparently, it must be bad on purpose. However, if you need to finish in hell and have to watch this 90-minute round of doo-doo, you will see that Yamasato really trying hard to make an amazing film. Actors try awesome dramatic performances comparable to Crimson Tide, but to get closer to the sea. <br /> <br /> shit works just the tip of the iceberg. The angles are terrible camera. The history of C-film on the story best-- not even good enough to be considered B-movie caliber. Dialogue is trying to be dynamic and witty, but this shit, like everything else. Rumor has it that hard copy of the script actually attracts a fly. In addition, the assessment of techno annoying ... not because it's techno, but because it is NON-STOP. That's right, music plays in the background all the time, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad the case. I do not care, that states that disclaimer, I do not buy it. BOTS was done deliberately is a bad thing, because he takes himself WAY ​​too seriously for what it was :. The joke <br /> <br /> This "film" was a very low budget. But that is no reason for his record suck factor. Big movies are born of the substance, not the budget. BOTS was no <br /> <br /> Let me further formulate prevail this 90-minute waste of time. And if I'm having a three-way with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of TV and Blood of the Samurai came, I would be out of there faster than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision. <br /> <br /> Sure, some people will try to protect the film. Secondly, maybe three. They will say: "This Grindhouse chop-socky" or "cheese in a good way" or "that's so bad it's good" These people are idiots film is either good or bad there is no such thing as a good bad movie!... but there are things like the idiots who love bad movies do not get me wrong,. have a lot of cornball nya-to-be taken seriously movies out there that are a pleasant and interesting one Slither BOTS no <br /> <... br /> this suckfest employs about one and a half hours, and, in my humble opinion, it is 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this "movie" is the DVD cover, t ah, the next time you're near the bargain bin Wal-Mart DVD, look at it-- Do not touch, just look-- and quietly leave.
