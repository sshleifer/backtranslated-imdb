I am glad to see that most of the other people here do not think that most of the film, either. It has some big names in the cast, but it's true. There's nothing else to recommend that the ogling some pretty women, you can do a thousand films. <br /> <br /> The history does not include anything other than a nasty, self-centered, who smokes, "hip" character, the national film critic everyone seems to like it .... and most people can not stand. <br /> <br /> Accents Oklahoma so fake, they are funny, southern racist stereotypes directly from liberal Hollywood 101 and depressing story.
