I made this film for a few laughs. I've never seen the SNL skit, but with hits such as Tommy Boy, and Waynes World, it could not be that bad, right? Answer: It was. This film could not have been a means of relaxation after a hard day at work. I just kept waiting for the storyline and fun part, but there was not. Particular attention was paid to Tiffany Amber thieson, and that's just about it.
