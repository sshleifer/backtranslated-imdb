When was the rating of 0 stars, I would be happy to pass it in this absolutely monstrous pile of waste. The fact that the actual resume is perfect, and that if this were done different would be brilliant make it worse. The main task of the closure of a group of people in the camera experiment is good, but Wheres EXPERIMENT? All that I see a bunch of ignorant blonde surfers and chatted about music and culture, I do not know, want to know about ... Problems helpless and stupid. The whole point of a reality show, to show the reality. If you set the "call" does not make them play with exaggerated food props and stereotypical cultural elements in the "night games Friday. Make them do a real problem. And as to" earn "the prize money, it's great when they really earned it! These people are nuts. If they only make the show better, the very idea would have been nice. But it's not going to happen!
