Seriously, I'm all for romantic comedies and adhesive are drawn into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas ... but this film? It makes no sense !!!! And I'm not even talking about the kind of suspension of disbelief is not willing to make sense. Why her family live in England? Or at least, why it does not have a British accent? She is confident, comfortable with her father, and he is surprisingly lenient to her, not being around for the last two years. (On this subject, no one makes the most of the deal about her being away for so long). And what was with the stupid outfits on the bachelorette party? I'm not even going that accompanies it paid for falls in love with her - it may have been overcome by the best film-making. I'm just saying that the characters, settings, and plot is not fleshed out enough to make a few more cohesive story. Yes, and the worst, in my opinion, is the consistent use of the director of the most unflattering angles on the nose Deborah Messing in - I would have sued the creators of the film, if I were her! I mean, honestly, I'm all for women to be who they are, but for some reason, in the seven years of faithful watching Will & Grace, I never noticed how incredibly strange, her nose? Oh! Because these manufacturers are kind to her! This film, as well as my other least favorite movie ever, Armageddon, the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors. I can see how Messing and McDermott in these roles with the best script writer, director and producer. <br /> <br /> This is easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies I've ever wasted time. I'm just glad that one lent me a DVD, so all I had time to waste. If there were a way to make this review ZERO stars, I would do it.
