"A Damsel in Distress" is definitely not one of the best musicals of Fred Astaire in. But even bad films Astaire always had good moments. <br /> <br /> The "Woman" Aster Jerry Holliday, an American musical star, who is in London on a personal appearance tour appearance. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), excellent English heiress who hops into the back of the cab it takes to avoid the crowds of fans. <br /> <br /> Jerry thinks that Alice is forced to marry her rich aunt. He's trying to save her from the manor house of the family of the country, but soon discovers that the staff home mortgage rates, which the groom get married Lady Alice. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the obstinate boy home, each in turn, and in turn helping to sabotage the romance Lady Alice Jerry, to make sure that they win a bet. <br /> <br /> This music has a lot of problems. Firstly, there is a story based on the novel by Wodehouse resident (who was co-writer). History is slow, painful and nerve-grating. If Fred does not dance, we have to endure endless annoying stage (a) Fred takes care of Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert indulgence towards them and with each other. <br /> <br /> The butler and the house of the boy are particularly annoying. They are one-dimensional characters stock villain, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You want to, they would have received from the screen, and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Aster suffer in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a dull leading lady in this film, and miscast musical. It is not enough for her, character-wise, but her beautiful face and a beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen located along for the ride, as well as publicist Jerry and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some much-needed chemicals for the plot, and Grace has some funny lines, but it is also very annoying sometimes. <br /> <br /> The direction of George Stevens' film is not very well done. Sometimes, cinematography awful and out of focus. There are a number of exterior scenes set on a very foggy streets to try to convince the audience that we are in London, Sun Hollywood. (They had to use a ton of dry ice in the film.) On the positive side, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin's terrible and became a classic song standards. And, of course, dancing in the film is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and choreographer, Hermes Lord. <br /> <br /> But the music and dance poorly used and poorly placed. Sometimes, the cast seems to begin to sing and dance, because, well, it's time for them to start to sing and dance. Musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the winding station. (. At some point, steps butler outside the manor and breaks into a solo operetta no reason at all) Numbers include:  «I dance, and I can not be bothered now," - Fred dance well on a foggy traffic filled the streets of London . He makes some great 'cane-pricks "with skating umbrella - but the number of ends too early, when Fred jumps on passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical "Crazy For You," Harry Groener made a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.) <br /> <br />  "Put Me To The Test" - Fred, George, and Grace do a tap dance in the trio English cottage. George and Fred Grace match, step by step, but the number of ends badly with all the legs to each other for no reason <br /> <br />  «Stiff Upper Lip» (The Fun House Number) -. The amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Grace fun dancing on a rotating floor, the rotating shaft, and a fun house mirror. This is the best movie room, but it gets a bit sad time <br /> <br />  «Speech Looking Up». - Fred and Joan Fontaine to make them one dance number together in the film, to prance around the woods in the back country manor estate. Fortunately, it's very simple dance routine, because Joan is not a great dancer <br /> <br />  «Foggy Day in London Town" -. Fred haunting misty master's property at night, singing to a foggy day when he first met Joan in London. Sometimes it looks as if he's not sure how he was going in the fog. - as well as himself a musical number <br /> <br />  «Good work, when you can get it" - great song, overused in the film. During a public event in the palace, Fred gets dragged into a chorus of grim faces of singers who sing this song haphazardly. Every time Fred joins other singers looking at him, as if they want him to leave. (Again, Harry Groener made the best dance number with this song in the «Crazy For You»).  «Drum dance number" - Fred and Joan are run, Fred has to stop and take one last tap dance number while banging drums group. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there is absolutely no need for it, except to extend the film. <br /> <br /> The most contrived moment in the film occurs when Fred decides to jump off the high stone balcony in the office to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he jumps from the balcony, it is conveniently located trapeze - a right, * trapeze * - hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, stunt clothing Fred) grabs a trapeze and swing to land on it. <br /> <br /> The film should possess a DVD for some dance numbers, but you feel you owe the guy who invented the button to fast-forward button on the remote control. >> FF button lets you skip through the other sad scenes in the film, to get to the dance numbers.
