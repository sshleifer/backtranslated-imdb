This was shown in the framework of the 59th International Festival in Edinburgh, although for reasons best left to contain. It seems that a lot has been made of the fact that this is the first Thai film, made with Thai actors and crew, but is aimed at Europeans. We do not need to work to be honest, because this movie is boring, boring, boring. Why did hint at why envelops the idea of ​​a secret, so subtly evoke the feeling when you can drive a point home with a terrible voice overs apparent arrows and over the top of the stage> Nothing remained in view as again and again the director Spurrier ineptly churns out endless clichés. Lot hinting Sun divination, it is not all on the screen, no need to use our imagination. Interestingly, when the "scary" bit comes? No, you will not, because the soundtrack will become more and more frightening, rose to a crescendo ominous. Hell, I cook a word to describe how bad it is. Interestingly, there is a real or imaginary demon created? Why is the tax on their own - this is actually a snake, and yes, it really bites his crotch, and has blood spatter all over the world. it is strange, awkward film for several reasons. He must be a horror film, but it's not scary - tremors are marked and obvious. This may be a scathing attack on the seedier side of Thailand, and the director has a sleazy, raunchy style when it comes to showing little pubescent teenagers. Maybe it was casting himself as a Westerner taking her virginity, which planted the seeds of doubt in my mind. Or maybe it was just his pants. Uninspired, insipid, repeated, trivial - all candidates for a better description, but it seems to dim the most appropriate and fair. All seen it before, probably better, often with a lot of thought, rarely with less imagination or flash. Sorry. Thumbs down on each account. Indeed lamentable.
