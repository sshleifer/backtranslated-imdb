As is ever in existence? I generally like Sci F / Bigfoot regardless of films, etc .., but I'm still waiting for that they should be written without as much cheese as it is. Effects were sad, the lines were sad. Avoid at all costs. I just finished rent, because it was in the case of a wrong (I was looking for a film with Snow Henricks in it - still have not seen that one). The idea of ​​the film is really good. There was a lot of potential to make a great little film here. I just do not understand how this eventually, like this. Go talk to the cinema / art / English language students interested in any high school, and you will find people who can write the best script.
