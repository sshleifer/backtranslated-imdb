It's such a strange film, you can call it awful or if you sit with your friends it can give you a killer laugh-Aton. Surprisingly, it comes again and again against. Shot unprofessional acted worse and direction, maybe not. The special effects are laughable, but the music that accompanies the flying demon child will definitely be the biggest hit. See if you have time to kill. But no, do not even try to take it seriously. I intended to be a tribute to "Porno Holocaust" ,. Since I have not seen it, the tribute I can imagine it would be so bad. If 1/10 gave him, but he gave me a good laugh or two, so he receives a 3. Excessive blood, only that someone worked. Stay away if you're squeamish, more gore than laughter. Interestingly, when the producers laughed does it?
