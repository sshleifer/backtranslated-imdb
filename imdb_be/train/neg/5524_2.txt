I did not like this movie for many reasons. During the first ten minutes of the film, I grew very frustrated and came to the conclusion that if this movie is going to save yourself, for me at least, that it will have to pull itself out of a huge hole he had dug, unfortunately, this is not It happened. Two draws of the film for me was to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about the work of Lindsay Lohan, was interested in the fact that it will lead to the film. After that, I was just disappointed in myself and all three of them, even if there were "moments" in each of their performances. I believe that for each of them to find their "moments" was a very difficult task, given the fact that there was a strange lack of character development and uninspired dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the film as a whole is so bad writer, director and edited that tie performance as an actor is going to suffer and be spoiled by them. Disrespectful way in which it deals with sexual abuse and vulgar and offensive point of view of small town America, I think there were two main reasons why this film failed to hit this mark. As one reviewer said, and I agree that the film is almost impossible to market given he finished form. I suspect that, at least, I hope (for the benefit of the actor in any case) there are some real gems on the floor of the room. Sadly for us, but if it is true that the actors can take solace in the fact that feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time for such a flop. Oh, and one more thing ... I wanted just once I could go see an American film that included sadly disappeared but surprisingly bucolic settings such as the one in the movie where the protagonists were not distracted and / or disrespectful clogging of the village with pop cans, broken CDs, and other such rubbish!
