For those of us who lived through those weeks of filming in and around the valley - that we do not forget the tedious days of road closures and "shooting". As a reminder for those who live here - the locale include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, a large bowl. etc. The bank was BC firehouse; chase scenes included Moon Drive off Highway 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most affordable, Matthew Broderick was above all of us - even then. As far as the film is - a joke script and even more laughter in relation to the action and the plot - but who cares at this level. Good time capsule for those who enjoy our coast and valley landscape <br /> <br /> Additional Notes. Joe Bar (Tavern of the Jedi in the film), the original title of the film was Welcome to the Buzzsaw - Parking Old Erb was in the town square, in the backyard of the shots were off Grove Street in Boulder Creek; eliminate the thinking cap and see a few of the actors in the early days.
