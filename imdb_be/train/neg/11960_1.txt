I actually left the Asian horror film some time ago after becoming quite tired of seeing trash samey ghost story. However, I am more and more in the exploitation flicks in recent years, and so I decided to give them another chance. My first port of call was highly appreciated by the director Takashi Miike praised the "Visitor Q". I've seen Audition, and while I do not really like, I evaluate it as one of the best modern Asian horror films. So I got into it with reasonable expectations; and, unfortunately, we found only boredom. I believe that this film is actually very smart, and he just went over my head, but that it seemed to me simply a collection of violent and unpleasant scenes with little or no coherence between them. Any comparisons with the work of Luis Bu√±uel and David Lynch's blasphemous, as I understand it; All Miike did make a film here; Any exploration around it was implemented ambitious supporters, desperate to find some sort of meaning. May headache set in about 10 minutes (after the father had sex with his daughter for some reason) and it did not stop until the film finally expired; at least twenty-four hours later, or so it would seem. Do not get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most famous films around; but while it may be strong, it is also pointless and sad, and I did not get one ounce of pleasure from it. Takashi Miike can have a lot of fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope that this is the last time I'll get in touch with one of his films.
