Phew. What about Gimkate that already has? This is nothing like a pure halarity from start to finish. If you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing, this is the perfect film to get. From wild-type mullet / sweater combo Cabot in Parmistan (and that four billion sorted Ninja), everything about this film stinks of shit. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Klaus, a notorious mind that brought you to the mirror scene in the game Bruce Lee's death, he once again demonstrates his complete lack of directorial talent. A few others you probably will not recognize will be for your enjoyment, as well as from the tank to the Kartalian Tadashi Yamashita, although you will not have to remember them and care for them after the film is made. <br /> <br /> Presumably, based on a book called "The Last Game", which, if I could find any trace of its existence anywhere I would be interested in reading, to see where it went wrong. Instead, the book is probably the result of Gimkata imagination. Perhaps something Clouse was to sell his lame idea. <br /> <br /> Choose one of them and Yakmallah it for yourself. This is easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that is saying quite a bit.
