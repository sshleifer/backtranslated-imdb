But this film was boring. The history part was good, but the musical part was not. Not one song that I cared about and not a soundtrack to be heard. <br /> <br /> If Sweet Jesus "was suppose to be a comic never work. When John Adams was assumed to be unpleasant irritating one, the other, they tried to throw him in every scene. <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only reasonable characters in the whole film. <br /> <br /> historical quotes and debate about slavery in their historical context, it was sufficient, but not interesting enough to overcome the lack of music in the music. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be singing songs after the musical, in a few chirping besides, it was not worth the breath of nothing.
