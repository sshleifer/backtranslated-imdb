By the numbers Toddler history (Prince), the singer, on his way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife's father beats (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater in 1984, I was not a big Prince fan, but I did like the three great songs from the film - «Purple Rain», «Let's crazy," and "When Doves Cry ». Concert scenes in this film are great - full of energy and risk. Unfortunately, this is a very small part of the film <br /> <br /> The country's history is evident, and many times it was done. - and much better too. In podagovory will be put into good, bad processed. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Day Maurice was so predictable and tired that I actually became offended. Beating his wife's father needed for the story, but the scene is so badly handled (in acting and direction), I could not believe it. a horrible scenario - lousy dialogue and some really painful "comedy" procedure and there are tons of misogyny here - the baby's mother getting beaten;. Kid hitting Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river is also Williams Princes characters and. It refers to women in a terrible way constantly <br /> <br /> action where this film really can not Appolonia sweet and nice -... but not an actor, and the Prince (easy) Worst actor I've ever seen it empty. face and wooden dialogue delivery is so bad, I could not believe it. this f lm only comes to life during the concert scenes, but there really is not much. The "dramatic" scenes so badly acted and processed, they do this film makes me sick to sit out. They should have just done this concert film. I give it 2 - only for music.
