Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk, his show is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing Lopez has never been funny. I watched him standing and never said no resemblance to laugh. <br /> <br /> His stuff comes across as vindictive and hostile to white men flows from each of the body pores. <, Br /> <br /> I laughed at the white people jokes by many a comedian and loved by many of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a tooth that will not end. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for Latinos, who have only this show to introduce ourselves. <br /> <br /> shows graphs always stenciled with Latin American accent. <br /> <br /> canned laughter in the most absurd comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> It may be why this show is always at 2 am in the repetition.
