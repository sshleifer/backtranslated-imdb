When I was a kid, we always have to baby-sit, and we always rent a movie or watch a movie in the cinema. This is one of the movies we watched. This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, I think it may even be a movie Walt Disney Pictures! Martian fell to the ground, turns into a human, friendly person, and tries its best to return home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the earth. The only good comment I can give you the choice of actors, Back to the Future Christopher Lloyd as a Martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber, Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah, Lizzie. But apart from that, it is full of shit. Too bad!
