... from this terrible movie! There are so many things wrong with this film, acting, writing, directing, editing, etc., it is strange that something rises to the top, and has established itself as the worst. Music! I noted that the film has two composers in the list. This must be the reason why each frame is music, the absolute worst «D» in the style of the movie nonsense. They had never heard the expression "less." It became so painful to listen to, I muted the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so good. You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Boss, I'm sure they have not seen the role, as it is in the twilight of his career. Watch it at your own risk.
