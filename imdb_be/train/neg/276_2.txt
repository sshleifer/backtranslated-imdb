Patterns of characters and predictable, with each to be either pure white or pure evil completely. Action is too unnatural to be bad in a fun, on-top way. This is twice as frustrating if you're a fan of Bette Davis, because her character is not usually fun Bette Davis character type; It just gets a lot of frowning pensively. <br /> <br /> In general, neither my wife nor I found the film to be entertaining, moving or enjoyable at all.
