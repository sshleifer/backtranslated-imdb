Pay attention to all the mad scientists around the world: if you're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, you should give it a name worse than the "Paul." I do not care if it is a scary hammerhead shark stuffed with dagger sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water and on land. Give your child a decent name as "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon." Because even if he eats me, I'll probably just sit there laughing, "Ha! Get a load of this !!! Sex monster tearing me to pieces !!!!! "This is the worst part of this film, this shark thing referred to as" Paul "throughout the film. This makes what could be a decent, scary horror film just seem silly. Not that there are no other mannered and flimsy parts «Hammerhead:. Shark Frenzy» Scientists spend the whole movie wandering around this island, and all of a sudden one of the girls starts to itch madly from walking in the magnificent forest, and just HAS to pour water on it legs to relive itching, which, of course, allows you to "Paul" out of the water and kill her. One SciFi Channel has made things right in this film, babe let live. But it is a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing film.
