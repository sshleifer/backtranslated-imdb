I came to this film with high expectations. I knew about the work of Greenaway and "Storm" and was interested in adapting. I first wanted to exclude ten minutes, but I felt that it would be unfair. It was an idea of ​​the storm, but somewhere in your mind if you imagine a little boy urinating on a toy boat? It is symbolic that? I continued for another ten minutes my finger twitching on the "off" button somewhere something would grab my interest. It's not Shakespeare, it's not a movie. There is a time and place for it, but I will not waste my time or the place for this in my Shakespeare studies. Twenty-five minutes, I gave up and it was the end. Then I read all the comments on this site and pretentious film corresponds only to his client. "His painting ..... and then put it in the gallery," "is a ballet ..... keep it on the stage, then." Shakespeare can be done wisely, and plays were performed for a mass audience, they were available, and this version is helping to drive a wedge between Shakespeare and the general population as a whole - and I do not think Bard will be pleased.
