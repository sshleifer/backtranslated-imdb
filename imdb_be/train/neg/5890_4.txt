This romantic comedy is not so bad. There are some funny things that happen here and there, and there are some pretty memorable characters in it. <br /> <br /> action, however, amateur (except banker). While some scenes are really fun, others just a shame. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the story of the poor. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it's worth a look if you love football and romantic comedies. It's actually not a bad movie, and the ending is really feeling pretty good. But nothing out of the ordinary sun waiting. It is true if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
