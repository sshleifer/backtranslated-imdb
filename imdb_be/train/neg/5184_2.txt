I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip-hop, but was disappointed on many levels. First of all, the story so much redesigned to make it almost unbearable. Secondly, the installation of which is acting and the plot is not very authentic or believable. Thirdly, there is much more good black actors to choose from than the standard of the church. How about originality? Third, there was very little hip-hop song playing entirity - if any. Many seemd really central. In general, the film was a big disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worth it.
