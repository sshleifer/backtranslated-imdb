I do not really like this movie that much at all. It was not very funny, but in some cases it was just downright silly. Rob Schneider is certainly one extremely talented person, and while its effect was good at it, it just seemed like a real loss for him to stardom. I mean there were some parts that were in order, and a few humorous in a nice sort of way, but that's about it. The only thing that really caught my attention during this test over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking women there, and I'm not one to watch a movie just because of this, but in this case, It was the only area where even the slightest case of redemption can be found. Overall, it was a pair of expression lower than the average movie <br /> <br /> Final Query: <br /> <br /> theaters: Yes glad that I was not to waste too much money on it <br /. > <br /> DVD Purchase: Um, let me think ....: no <br /> <br /> Rent: If you have a pre-historic sense of humor, then why not.
