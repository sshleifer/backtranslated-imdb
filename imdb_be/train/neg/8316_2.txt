Cedric Kahn movies are character-based, rather than actions based on (I mean L'longing and Feux blush) so jarring to see this series really experts car chase interspersed with some attempts to give a plodding character Succo, I do not think Stephen Cassetti be interesting actor; He reminds me of the athletes who persuaded a movie like Brett Favre. This is a blank stare looks really perverse deer caught in the headlights. This actor would make us think more about Succo personality, not to admire his skills on car theft. <br /> <br /> The small cast there comes mainly from Isild Le Besco as requiring schoolgirls Succo beret storm. Interview at the police office this miracle soft persistence with little fear of the future, mixed in Leh. Besco from each other, there is little to recommend this film.
