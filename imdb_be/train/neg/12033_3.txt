The film is about a small town with an equal number of Mormons and Baptists. The new family moved in, rewind overwritten dialogue, mediocre action, green salad with grated carrot jelly and all the other "inside Mormon jokes" known to man. Any outside Mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this film. Anyone within Mormon culture will be a little pleased with a chuckle here and there. You'll be much better to watch other movies Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, etc ..) than trying to sit through it. Acting mediocre. Jared Hess had his hands on a much higher quality films as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite." I would recommend as movies on this groaner.
