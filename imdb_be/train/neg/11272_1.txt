... the first film that I had to go to. And it was cast and pre-selection team (not that I was involved, I hasten to add). I made it through the first hour, so I guess I'm just qualified to comment, but it was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other comments here, how did it get through any kind of QA. The accumulation of the worst in the dialogue, the epitome of wooden steps, terrible casting, all wrapped together without a plot. <br /> <br /> Cast Tara Fitzgerald was a strange, almost comic. It has the worst Russian accent in the movie history. <br /> <br /> When I walked out of the screening, the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the theater. They obviously could not sit through it again either. <br /> <br />
