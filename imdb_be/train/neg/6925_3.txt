I feel much less generous with this film, other than his family. Image crazy in this century is always done with them being so completely strange to have a different look. Their antics are so outrageous, to be completely fictitious. Each Napoleon or any other historical figure; or they have a fascination with chickens. They are on the brand or beat each other. It's as if the writer said, that I can do for them to do, without feeling that insanity or mental illness. See a great human image in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", where the disease is believable and real. I once worked in a hospital mental. I have not seen any of these guys. They are too clever and calculating, to make them come to life.
