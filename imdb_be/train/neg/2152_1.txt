this film tries to be very clever, and Tarantino as <br /> <br /> before you try it, though, you need a solid cinematic framework. they include a good sound, editing, set design, etc ... <br /> <br /> lets talk about the sound in this film. absolutely brutal. I've never been more distracted by the sound track ever <br /> <br /> and, before we talk about the low budget film, shot in Chile, etc .. lets keep in mind that the sound desent these days are much more accessible than it ever was. anywhere. and more information about the technology can ever <br /> <br /> sound in this film is clearly bad. Foley, in particular, the ridiculous and the absurd everywhere, the ATMOS equally terrible. I heard at least four loud clicks during the film, which are the result of poor sound editing. awful sound from inside cars, the sound of the car door closing terrible. the sound of a lady singing properly. Foley or overboard, or simply does not exist as a sound man just got bored and gave up. Space incorrect. everything about it is wrong <br /> <br /> And yet, without giving limits of creativity to get in the way, while at the same time, the film tries to be clever safely. such as aquarium sounds are used in a street scene. we hear, when we should not. audio visual changes precede cutting. every trick in the book is used and yet the basics do not exist <br /> <br /> editing wise we have a scene with heavy cuts jumps, we tinkering around with the line of time, etc. etc. and so on, yawning. All these methods adopt a superb low standard <br /> <br /> a whole mix of shit, shit sound. and so that the film is crap. How can a film with so many major shortcomings considered for the awards and appreciation? cinematic new wave of Chile? best creative outlet that Chile has to offer? I hope not, and I do not think so. <br /> <br /> my theory that Chile more selective and better talent to avoid this film like the plague, perhaps because of his risky content. equally, the film is likely to get much unwarranted critical acclaim from enthusiasts, the so-called "world cinema" for the same reasons grubby. they are likely to revel in it trashiness. known film critic rarely pays attention to the technical details and the quality of <br /> <br /> This film is rubbish. is a full mouth and no trousers and never deserves a 6.8 rating. the film has all the qualities of the production of cheap Tarantino, it inspired a new wave of porn!
