I unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for some time in Mill Creek Collection, and one night I just decided to watch it; although it did not expect much. Both novice loans are falling, I was surprised to find that the film was made under the company Filmirage. Filmirage brought the world such strange ugly types like "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "In Search of the Sword", so I was forced to watch. <br /> <br /> In the movie I started it was the potential to be pretty decent, even if it was unoriginal. Mountains scene could be improved if they were distributed and more. But after some time in the film, the pace pulled and I thought, "Well someone better to kill in the near future," or "Someone better to mutate." At the beginning of this resistance, when I thought this, though someone might have gotten killed or mutated, however, as noted above, blood and the effects were not very good. That worsened was that transitions scenes were confused; Example: first Dr. Hausman will be at the zoo, he would have to flash back on the possibility of killing someone, in the end, he woke up in a cold sweat in bed-- make viewers ask, "Was he dreamed he was in the zoo? ". As the pace of the film, the scene transitions got worse and worse. <br /> <br /> I might try to say, the development of the character of Dr. Hausmann was pretty good, but by the end of the film, that is, as soon as you "saw that the Doctor went on, I hope you laugh--, which on In fact, the only reason to see this film at least once; this film unintentionally acts as a long-winded joke. <br /> <br /> suit um, things that Dr. Hausman is also becoming possible to see in Joe D Â»Amato" Sword Quest ", which was made in the same year. You have to love Filmirage movies, they always re-use the same stuff!
