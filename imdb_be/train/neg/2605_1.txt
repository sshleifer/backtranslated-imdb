Although recently I put it on my 10 worst movie list, I have to say that it's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in "unbearable" or any of the "Who's Talking" sequels. However, it is quite a chore, even sexy Drew Barrymore plays something out of a horror film response to Holly Golightly, moving from New York to Los Angeles, but to find out that she is being persecuted for lethal double. Poor Sally Kellerman, nimble actress with great success in the 70s, there are reduced to support the role of a void, and the leading man Barrymore, George Newbern worst type Comedy actor, always pausing for laughter after each line. The picture swill, but bloody shower scene Drew has circuses and psycho identity (though straight from the episodes "Scooby-Doo") is interesting. But for the final ... get real! Someone has to clean that mess? * From ****
