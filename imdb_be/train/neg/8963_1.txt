Murder in the film is not so bad, but I'm sure the film. It's even worse than that. It's not even worth wearing it can lead, if you move it to the DVD-Player. <br /> <br /> I do not wear it is on your shoulders, carrying it with DVD-shops, not to mention the money and time you spend in rent and watch. Horrible. <br /> <br /> It is understanding how someone can say something positive in this film. It was just a bare shaft masochistic tendencies that made me stop watching, add to this pressure group of my fellow-observers. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is terrible, the guide is even worse, and acting. plain filthy <br /> <br /> I hope you do not see it as a spoil your fun, I would prefer to see it as a fair warning: do not waste your time watching this garbage!
