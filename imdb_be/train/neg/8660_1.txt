This is probably one of the most feared animals Giants movies I have ever seen. It follows the typical space laboratory experiment went wrong and the giant crocodile with the rapid growth of the chemical in it escapes. The monster looks the way as well as a dinosaur, have large Tyranosaurous-like hind legs when he should just look like an oversized crocodile. Everything about this film is not original, and it is constantly exudes a "clich√©", minute by minute. Why always two drunken Redneck hunting after dark, stop? In addition, there is always a man and woman who share a lame, obvious love interest while they are in life-threatening situations. Much has been said of me, and I feel like I'm wasting my time writing this ...
