This film is another excellent example of the fact that Jerry Bruckheimer, about 1997, it seems the best - hyping the cinema a year before its release, and is not coming through with the film's quality. I'm not a film critic, but this film was predictable as they come. Every attempt to joke, every attempt at touching moments, and pathetic attempt a love story, it was exactly what I predicted in my head. Do yourself a favor and save your money on it.
