If this book has remained faithful to the book, we can only assume that the author did not know about the history. Marc Anthony has ever died from wounds received in combat, as shown. He died a coward's death, committing suicide, and even then, he asked his servant to do it for him. Slave decided to kill himself instead. The true story of Mark Antony hesitate anymore valor servant and decided to copy it. But even in death, Mark Antony was drunk and did not fail in his own suicide attempt. He cried Cleopatra, and was brought to her bleeding. She towed his litter on the ropes and Marc Anthony died a short time later. If you want the story did not watch this movie. If you want romantic nonsense, then you will probably like it!
