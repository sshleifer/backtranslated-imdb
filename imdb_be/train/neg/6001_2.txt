It may seem crazy to even people who remember the show ... But I remembered it as a live action. I do not think I ever seen the cartoon. but the film? It can be. I remember it very well. The guy was in the building as a kind of show. He even had a red jacket. It was dark, and it turned into a red car, and there was this guy on the second level, looking down at him. Auto / man turned around and ran into a large salon-type window and out into the street. And then continued to drive away. That's all I remember. I really hope that someone out there remembers it, too. If not, maybe I'm still mad. But I hope I'm not.
