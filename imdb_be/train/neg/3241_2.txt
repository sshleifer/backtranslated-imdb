This film had the potential, but what makes it a very bad effect Lindsay Crouse. I've never seen her in anything else, and perhaps there are some supporters Kraus that there, as it is something else, but her performance in this film is bad. <br /> <br /> Its robotic delivery. When she delivered her lines turned out that she was trying to make sure she had the right line and just reading the list in her head. Thus, her voice has very little inflection. I can not believe that someone has bad acting got the lead role in the film. She must know someone in the business. <br /> <br /> Now I hate to be that is about it, but a comment should be "it" for a long time and its performance that sticks out more than anything else. <, Br /> <br /> However, I liked it, where the story takes place, so I kept looking. The first part of the script has the makings of a good film. But the end was disappointing as well. Maybe, if its effect was better, I would have liked it.
