It was a popular movie, probably because of the humor in it, fast moving story of an outsider character who stops all screamer, etc. It's funny, you probably can not make a film with this title, if someone replaced but "white", like all the rest would be considered racist police computer. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harrleson like a white guy who turns out to be just as good, if not better, than any of the black players, wondering how his main colleague Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> Snipes had a lot of funny lines to put down, providing much of the humor. The bad part of the film - that does not bother a lot of people - this is an extreme profanity here and sleaziness of all the characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There is not really clean, kind people in this movie. For this reason, I can not wholeheartedly recommend this movie, at least not to friends or those who insulted profanity lotof
