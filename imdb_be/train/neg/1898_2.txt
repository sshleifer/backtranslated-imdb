Remake H.B. The chase classic seventies movie Halicki is just awful. Along with Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 seconds represent the quintessential car chase movies. A remake of the original and worth taking it on the head. While Halicki gave us 75% of the car chase and 25% support the drama, in the GISS 2000 we get 25% of the cars in the chase, and 75% to support the drama. Cell as a super man, rescues his brother, kissing a girl. MTV editing, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least, Halicki did not live up to their child (he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the movie "74") are degraded in this way.
