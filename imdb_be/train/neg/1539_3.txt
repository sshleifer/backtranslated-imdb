I'm a big fan of Westerns, but this one .... Phew, that bitch! I think it turned me almost immediately bat was meaningless dialogue. I think I could write better than the dialogue, when I was in eighth grade. And the poor actors! Given this terrible dialogue, none of them caught looking anything but funny. In fact, I'm not kidding. For some it is a bit better than what you want to get in the film Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably a "big" star in this film, which, if you call it B-West, you have to abuse the praise from him. This is what should be called a B-minus Western possible. Sorry Sterling Hayden, who appeared in another time with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other major talents. For it to appear in the vehicle of the poor, it should be that he was trying to humiliate the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> One of the annoying things about this film, all men look like they had not shaved in a week, and their faces are all fat. I know that in the old West, the guys were not always well-groomed, but man, it's a movie that makes you want to just go 'EWWWW! In fact, this is contrary to the West. Denver Pyle was also to live this down, especially after the appearance of so many great Westerns. Bad, bad movie.
