This film, like real life, I mean - not much going on in available 2 hours or so, and not much to the game plan or plot shows often invisible plaster (their invisibility to be associated with the "experimental" lighting, as mentioned many reviewers). <br /> <br /> large trunk. Not surprisingly, that Altman Helms is - it is very volatile singer (and we all loved "Gosford Park", but «Pret A Porter» who Kansas City Dr. T. and the Women Aaargh ??), but the fact that Raw is John Grisham tale, and a great cast that you perceive through the gathering dusk of your persistent nap - does this really bad movie masterpiece. And no, it is not "so bad it's good." <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
