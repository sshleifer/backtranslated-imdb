My God, this film very boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I was shooting the film, I was expecting a romantic drama and some great performance Gershon. Gershon great as always, but it is not suitable actress for this role, she is too good for Sherbezhii Council. The romance between Gershon and characters Serbedzija is too flimsy. And I absolutely hated character Serbedzija (in organizer wonman), he is not just a magical way or another in the film. Like Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) is beyond my comprehension. Maybe Sean Connery, Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford would have done a better job on this role, but they do not have a European-ish looking, I guess. In any case, I was so sad druing the film. If you are looking for a good film Gina Gershon, check Bound, her best film so far. If you are looking for a romantic film about a young woman and an older man, to try some movies Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. Gina Gershon so underrated and deserves a better chance than this, I wish her to make better choices in the future.
