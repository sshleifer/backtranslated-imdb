I thought it was a continuation of some species, and this means that the original from 1983. But the sequel does not accept the original story, and destroy it. <br /> <br /> I really was very little hope for this film, but I just wasted 95 minutes of life. A lot of the unknown - I actually feel like a clairvoyant, poor acting, and so full of technical errors, so I like computer geek just could not believe it. They tried to make the connection between a conventional war movie and 24 hours. But it is not even worthy of a low budget television movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie, it's a waste of time. Instead, to get the original. Subject remains in force. Do not let a lot of energy in the car. And the action and the story much more convincing and exiting.
