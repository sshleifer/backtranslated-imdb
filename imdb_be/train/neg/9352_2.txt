You can often say, the film does not work, as it should be heavy use of the narrator. This film shows the device around. Richard Jobson not quite content to write straight and even finance a portion of the film adds to its credit, read excerpts from his own semi-autobiographical writing that manages to conceal the fact that it is a sad depressing tale in combination with some pretty editing, which he must be mistaken for this art-house. McKidd put a good performance. Everything else is fine. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints have meant that all the scenes filmed in the daytime, although the majority of them, obviously, meant that at night, even if you know they are mostly serious alcoholics work per day, so it adds to me. a touch of realism <br /> <br /> funniest part of the film waitress who does not age a single day in more than 20 years, after between her performances - more extreme option McKidd problem is who is going from 18 to 30 years without changing More than his clothes. Bless.
