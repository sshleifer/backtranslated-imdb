It is depressingly small, naive and mostly unfunny look boar incredible relationship between psychotic editor Harold Brooks and his sweet girlfriend. The two have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is not able to do anything, except a breath at this stage of his career; but also because the nature of Brooks is neither interesting nor likeable. There are 15 static, agonizing minutes in the beginning, where Brooks, just broke up with Harold, he stumbles over his apartment in the suppression of narcotic state -. Unbearable <br /> <br /> Sappily and devoid of imagination bookended Joe Cocker's "You Are So Beautiful", there is simply not enough material here for a feature film. There is hardly anything happening on the periphery of their relationships to create the appearance that these people exist in the real world. I'm sure that Brooks intention was to shine the white hot light on the case and, therefore, the deconstruction of it, but if you are going to do that writing and action should be much better than what it is here.
