The more I think about it, there was nothing sacrificial about it <br /> <br /> cinema. I saw him 9 months ago, so my memory may have done it <br /> <br /> worse than it was, but I know that it was at least as bad as 4 of <br /> <br /> 10. <br /> <br /> After watching the film, I met with the director. he seemed so ignorant <br /> <br /> about what he does or what he did, and, as far as I <br /> <br /> could tell that he did not care about any movie. even he agreed that it <br /> <br /> did not really know what he was doing, and he was forced to do <br /> <br /> some things, because it was filmed in digital form. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film tries hard to fit into a formula that <br /> <br /> built for himself: "9 people should all be related in some way like. <br /> <br /> we can get from point "a" to point "Bed and '' so as to obtain from the <br /> <br /> prostitutes we see at the beginning and go back to it in the end they were 10 < br /> <br /> minutes on each character's relationship to another person. it <br /> <br /> makes one feel suffocated by 2 demensional, mistreats <br /> <br /> characters. <br /> <br /> I just remembered one redeeming part of the movie ... Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi there is one scene where he is awesome. that's all. I <br /> <br /> say ... 4 out of 10.
