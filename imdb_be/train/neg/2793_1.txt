It takes way up there on my top list of the worst films I've seen so far on Starz on demand. They seem to pick up every shit straight to DVD Festival they can find and put it here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Apparently, someone with a digital camera and poor budget may come up with a horror movie and get it put on the TV. Frankly, it looked terrible from the moment I saw the trailer - but I give it a real chance <br /> <br /> I always try to have an open mind about the low-budget films .. Some of the best movies I have ever seen, were the films that have worked around them low budget or in other cases requires only that the low budget to be great. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. <, Br /> <br /> you know the plot now, I am sure that if you are reading this. Or you heard about it on Starz on demand or for any reason, you find yourself on this page of boredom. We are talking about the pathetic and whiny girls we get to know all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad "heavy metal" music video. Whoever put it together, I must have thought that it looked really interesting, but really, really do not. Anyway, she kills herself. Then she has someone. Then begins a killing. It really unmemorable and as absolutely secondary and boring as possible. If the first shot goes in my apartment quite seriously it sounds like a piece of popcorn applause. Was it the best sound effect they could come up with? I could find a better sound effect used for free (without copyright) online ... right. Now. <br /> <br /> Do not let the other reviews claim it's 10 movie star fool you. They obviously or film distributors, or possibly even the director is trying to frame you have in mind this piece of junk is worth buying. <br /> <br /> ridiculous.
