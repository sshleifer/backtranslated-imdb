Stuffed seem spoiled horror film supernatural encounters. Group paramilitary thugs to steal, robbery wages at Camp Pendleton in California. They are high jack to steal the cargo plane pilot and his daughter, demanding to be taken to Mexico. Along the way, a greedy robber decides to bailout money from the landing in a cornfield under the supervision of the amazing kind of stuffed. This is not just any ordinary scarecrow ... they can kill. Actions are not better than the awful dialogue. And the attempt at humor is not funny. Very low budget and shot entirely in the dark <br /> <br /> Cast includes :. Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Christine Sanborn,, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
