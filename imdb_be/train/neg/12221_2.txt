With the exception of the sound, none of the above is really critical for this type of budget is not (true), the independent horror film. Makeup effects, and blood is very good and the leading actor was effective, leading actress, although attractive needs some coaching, she was particularly poor. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Frightworld is its length, in the 108 minutes of his half-hour too long to be effective as a slasher film, the story of the wise, only about ten minutes of the first fifty overdue. <br /> <br /> in places, it is visually attractive, and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the film is simple. However, if it is combined with poor sound, as is the case with most of the large sections of the film is difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> This can certainly be an interesting, if not a genuine "serial killer from the dead," a movie with some clever and ruthless editing, in its current form, it plays like unfinished drafts.
