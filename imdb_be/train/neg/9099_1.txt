This review also includes a spoiler of the first film - so if you have not seen the movie, and want to, but do not want spoilers, please do not read this review <br /> <br /> While it! the film should be about the Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the film is a bad copy of the first violent. Actors that they had to reflect Christian Ryan Philip and Catherine Sarah Michelle Gellar very poor substitutes for sure. Can not pull insinuating that causes small rich attitude that made the original actors. It is absolutely appalling that some dialogues were literally - not so much between the Christian and Catherine, but if you listen close enough you will find it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if it really was the first meeting of Christian and Catherine, why is it that Christian fell in love with the girl at the end of the movie? He allegedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original film (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> In addition, the tie-in photo / "You could be a model" comment at the end was quite lame and do not add anything at all. All in all, this movie was a waste of time. I can not believe that they did Brutal 3.
