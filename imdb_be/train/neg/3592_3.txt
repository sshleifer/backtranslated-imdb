Fan series, I must admit that the Hidden Frontier is not so bad. But, considering this series it can not be based on whether it is a fan of the series or not. This initiative is in itself laudable. Creativity as well. I think it's people with ordinary jobs, and a large heart enthusiasm for Star Trek. But to do all this work. Pulling all of these resources. Taking all this time, and still have all of these disadvantages. <br /> <br /> First of all the action, and the lines are terrible. For the majority. Dialogues belongs 70s military show, and not Star Trek. Captain (Mr. Squinty) looks as if he would burst out laughing at any time. And most of the characters simply read their lines. Managers should be aware that the "win" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also think that the series made in the form of «Two Takes Frakes," I could not have directed many episodes and films TNGA Also, do not think that most of the actors are typical Trekkies. Without going deeper into this assumption. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern about the project is the quality of releases. When they first decided to spend so much time and resources in this series - why they do not make it available in a decent quality? Using the quick time format is a waste of talent with low low resolution. Even scenes «higres» are considered poor quality compared to the standard series product quality. Using the Xvid codec, higher resolution and file size would improve the experience massively. If a group of problems was the problem, creating a torrent tracker I would have thought. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that the team decides to clean up the series, and possibly release it on DVD, giving it the quality of the project deserves.
