I really wish I did not write this review. I am a Christian, so I'm looking forward to see this movie. It seemed great - Christian film with some pretty well-known stars and the plot that seemed intriguing (not that I buy myself the Bible Code -. You can make it say what you want, I nonetheless believe everything inside Bible ). So I'm sitting on the edge of his seat, enjoying the previews when the film goes on and managed to ruin my mood in a matter of minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the written form of the dreaded and acting while I was in the theater (I would have been torn to pieces by the people welcome the rather clumsy, but most sublime scenes and breathless on the insanely obvious and predictable tension of the scene, I'm sure). After the final credits rolled, however, I could muster. There were many parts of the movie I liked - some largely unexpected plot twists, some of the effects that were really special (I'm not counting Visions Those were poorly made.) And also some interesting technical work - freezes kits that type of thing. Unfortunately, the impression I have, if I read the book of Revelation and the monkey set monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could have got a better scenario. And the music was for the cheese (even fan Bond, who loves his native cheese of Music in action scenes and intrigue). So I would like to be like everyone else in the theater - as people who come from weeping and choking due to the fact, as it was incredible - but I'm not someone who can be soothed by a writer who throws a few more words the Bible shell and pops Christian printing thereon. I need a good story and believable dialogue before I can enjoy most of the films, and it just was not. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And it is a tragedy. If we see some intellectual Christian fiction? He must be out there somewhere ...
