I just could not finish the film. I passed out after that, I would say, my candidacy for the unsuccessful attempt to award a sexual suggestion: the scene in which Pia Zadora, at a picnic, standing between two boys who want it. One (good boy) prays for her to see the error of her ways. The other (bad boy) just asked if she wanted a hot dog, which he then hands her. At the level of the crotch. I hope that I have anything to say, she turns and takes a hot dog with a smile, without spoiling. Just pathetic.
