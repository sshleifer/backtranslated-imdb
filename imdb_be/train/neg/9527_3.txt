I tried to find this film just googling bad phrases about "teens seduce and kill a man in his house," and the like. I think the first time I saw a part of this movie when I was about 10 years, if it works on the cable. He impressed! This kind of film that children know that they should not see, and change the channel if their parents come. When I saw who was cast, I could not believe that some of these good actors were in such a terrible film, again, if you would like to see people who cheat on their wives, killed, then it's an interesting movie. Also, if I remember, there are some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably blunt end of all time, but still ... memorable.
