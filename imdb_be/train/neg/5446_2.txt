For loyal fans of Duran Duran, who want to look good music video, you can skip this one. Producers decided to get creative and make this 80-something video of the history of science-fiction, with the participation of the evil villain Barbarella, from which the group derives its name. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea failed in that in the center of a large 80-Duran Duran songs, confusing and annoying cut scenes take place featuring the fictional antagonist tries to stop the group at one of his concerts. This is not only good music repeatedly interrupted, but we have to suffer a cheap spin-off stories organized by the evil Dr. Mario. It's almost too much to bear. 2/10
