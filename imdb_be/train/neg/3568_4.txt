The truth is that the film is based on a Harold Robbins novel is not going to win any awards. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is the cleanest in the picture in the budget, cast and performances. Technically, it looks like a film made for television. Action is very uneven. Joseph Cali particularly scary. Anthony Holland difficulty. As one reviewer said certain performance Katharine Hepburn, its range is from A to B. Ms Zedora manage to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and vain in their roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserves better. However, all this can be a lot of fun in a bad sort of way. As expected Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you are looking for some fun ... and you're not too sober ... this could be for you.
