This may be a very poor example of amateur propaganda ever made. The authors and producers need to learn German films of the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even in Soviet-style awkward leader as godlike father figure was better to do. Disappointing. The loss of faith in the church restored in the last second, just in time for the Pope to be "rescued" Hoover / God is not so bad. Unfortunately, it seemed rushed and not enough melodramatic. Several shots of misty heavenlier angelic Hoover up in the coal-shiny screen and nodding- would add a lot. The best aspect of Hoover only preserve a decent family and children, which "proved" its value. Unfortunately, the other poor homeless people were portrayed as good and even more well- Hoover-God does not help them. It would be better shots of them drank alcohol to show the validity of their condition. And finally, the bright and cheerful recovery stage (after Hoover saved the country from depression) must be rolling in the end. We could see how God saved Hoover-not only in this worthy family, but it really deserves. Amateurist at best.
