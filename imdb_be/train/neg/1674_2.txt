The room was intriguing, but unfortunately, this film just does not do any justice to it. Casting was very good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically most of direction was inconsistent (overstylized fast editing was done there, that there is no effect .... I was expecting Steven Bochco run in the credits followed by the commercial), the characters were determined exclusively on the screen the use of coke (and almost everything else is left to Boogie Nights for character development) and not representative of characters to draw the viewer into the story. Very forget the movie.
