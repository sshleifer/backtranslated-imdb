I love musicals, but as a supporter Dickens Hate it. Moderate ** SPOILERS ** The hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in wages? Poor out of London to sing? Fezhiny Pluto and walk off into the sunset? Not quite accurate novel. As far as I remember, Pluto was publicly hanged and Fezhin gone mad in prison. END ** spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, does little more than a growl to show his evil. Worse, however, Mark Lester as Oliver, who often comes across as awkward and passive you wonder if he really is the protagonist. His image is not helped by the fact that the best they could do, if he sings it in his voice dub girls. Guess they do not understand that boy triple can be found in almost every church in England <br /> supporters Dickens respecting <br />:. Follow David Lean's 1948 film strange or 6-hour BBC adaptation from the mid -80's. Avoid that bloated white musical.
