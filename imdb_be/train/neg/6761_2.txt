Let's be honest. In film school project, made without a budget, and "real" actors, it's an interesting movie terrain. Once will be released on DVD for the innocent spectator, it's too bad the product is made. If I would idly changing channels and happened to catch this film by chance, it is likely to arrest my mind and attention for some time. As someone who bought this DVD under the impression that I would be getting a cinematic tribute to a product that is in the film, I feel deeply disappointed. This videotape TV game, something along the lines of the old TV series of the sixties, but without this particular charm. In addition to leading man, Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors seem a Tale of the campus (a bit too old for it actually), or households of directors who appear in front of the camera without any assistance is not only existing sofas, but also make-up artist or hair stylist (hood over outgrown constant bangs or a cylinder of the mullet is a very long way from the creation of the 1840s). It's all shot using a fixed camera is installed in a small bare studio, sometimes using a blue screen for outdoor background. Synthesizer generated uninspired score lame "period" inspired romantic karaoke insult the viewer tabs on more than one occasion. The film tries to be a "fabulous", while in fact it is just conceptionless collage of the cadres who made his editing (and believe me, standards are not too high to begin with). Have interesting conversations every now and then, but overall it's pretty lame, and two-dimensional production in more than one way, without a flash of genius from any director or any member of the crew. That's how "artsy" movies have tried to look into the 80s. Mr. Redfield makes the work much better as an actor than director.
