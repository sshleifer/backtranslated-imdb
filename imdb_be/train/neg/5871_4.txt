For me, the only reason was to look at the remake to see how bad and ridiculous it may be. It was no doubt that it is ridiculous and bad, because I've seen «Voyna and Peace" (1968). Shall we begin? Here we go ... <br /> <br /> Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison Pierre Pierre - skinny guy who lacks the depth of the original; Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison Natasha Rostova - effigy, its image can cause insomnia; Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison Andrei Bolkonsky - KI embodiment is as lean guy (see above), lacking the depth of the Russian soul and the "struggle within"; Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison Napoleon - quite unimpressive leader; Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison Prince Bolkonsky - a turd from English person; Dornhelm and Count Brendan Donnison in Bezuhov - spinelessness freak show ... <br /> <br /> The other characters are not much better <br /> <br /> Movement of the actors and the way. they look and speak often brutal. They behave like a modern EU citizens dressed for a day in the masquerade. It looks cheap and never approaches the standards of our Russian men and women in the early 19th century. <br /> <br /> good piece of entertainment scrutinize and ridicule. We had quite a few giggles at our office, recalling that a modern product, which was shown last night on our TV <br /> <br /> «Rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I think ,. Many young people have never watched this movie ( "Voyna I MIR" 1968) or have a strange sense of quality "Tarantino, Spielberg." Remember the scene when our hussars saves his friend, turns, shoots and the bridge goes boom? It seems, CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is no meaning, no craft to make the best version of the novel, which has been shown properly in our country once. But I would be happy to see the Russian remake of "Gone with the Wind." Hey, directors, wake up and get busy with that, instead of spoiling our classics. <br /> <br /> Now, back to common sense. Jokes aside. What I have mentioned above is nothing new, though fatally exaggerated. <br /> <br /> To ensure that foreign actors are trying to convey to the Russians (while participating in a very serious epics and dramas) is a gross mistake, and the filmmakers make this mistake again and again. Of course, this leads to many laughs - especially poetry is uncomfortably funny and her singing and dancing make the Russian audience to think, "This sucks so much that it's funny") <br /> <br /> In order to say something!. New, I would like to mention the pace of the film. In my opinion, this new version is very uneven. Narration and scenes, of course, do not flow - they stagger and surfaced as a modern video. Again, I have to remember our "Voyna and Peace" where the action is so natural and so easy narrative that you just sit back and enjoy a "go with the flow." <br /> <br /> I thought that perhaps the battle of Borodino would be great (though somehow rehabilitate many flaws), but it turned out to be no match for the military scenes, filmed in 1968. <br /> <br /> there must be something good in this movie after all. And there is. The actors seem to be struggling to make it all work. They had no chance from the start, but they are still joined to the "losing team". Plus 1 point for this unreasonable. This makes the Russian viewer uncomfortable - some scenes ironic funny, although they are designed to be much more powerful, and the actors are doing their best. All this is a pity, and sometimes -. Bouts of laughter <br /> <br /> What I still like about this series is the last part of it. It shows very clearly how everyone gets his or her "salary and taxes." Moreover, judging by the trailers of the film, I thought that the film will have a sex scene for adults, which will surely kill the entire project. But, fortunately, it does not have such garbage. And it's a big plus. <br /> <br /> «Voyna I World" no "Harry Potter" and now we are even here, in Russia today, do not have enough ships to film it properly. Do I have to say that the moral quality of life has deteriorated very much? Fortunately, the correct film was shown during our Soviet times. The American version of the 1950s was justified to some extent - our own had not even exist. There were excuses then. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point are given from the beginning, one point goes to the folly, and 2 points for the last part of the show. Thank you for your attention.
