I love these actors, but they have been wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> I can only guess what they were thinking consent for this shit ??? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger just called him in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were cartoons. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you like "Breaking the Waves", you'll probably like it too. I hated both. 3/10
