I will say one thing and Janet Nelson - even when stranded in the bleak, brainless, painfully inept musical as it is, there's still that gleam in their eyes. Thus, the chemistry between the famous duo is, even when the material is thin paper. Even when the score was almost blank, there is no one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes. And even when the circumstances are so incredible. - yes, even for fantasy <br /> <br /> The truth is that it has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own real-life husband Gene Raymond smile in a way which, however, was much better than the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I love Janet Nelson, and as much as the next fan, but it's the bottom of the heap. Janet more awkward in her one "GPU" Room with Binnie Barnes. - and Nelson can only come with a blank stare when faced with the absurdity of the situation <br /> <br /> One can only wonder what it was like on Broadway in 1938, of course, he had to have more intelligence and style than clearly the weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton in exhaled unfunny roles and none of the supporting players can not breathe any resemblance to the life of this mess. It's like amateur night in the studio, even sprinkled with a few professionals among the supporting cast <br /> <br /> In summary :. It hurts clumsy rendering of Rodgers and Hart musical. I can not recommend it, even for fans of MacDonald and Eddy. And even if the close-up of Jeanette still lights her gossamer beauty, this film is jaw droppingly bad.
