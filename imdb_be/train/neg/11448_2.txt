In any case the movie as bad as "Perfect Stranger," but it's just not funny he could not stick to one type of comedy -. He jumped out of the SNL, Adam Sandler, squire to the romantic to the little man score big to farce to "Loser" (movie) types of comedies. Although there were some pretty funny moments of slapstick (falling down the slope), no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way. "Schindler's List" was funnier (and felt shorter) . you never knew if Samberg was supposed to be in high school dropouts college or just a loser at home with his mother -.. Sissy Spacek, at its worst role choice and poor Ian McShane, serious actor, when I only had to name one, given the shit to read in the history of the camera and pulls predictable up to the end (no spoilers here, in Adam's case studies mom Samberg never want to see). Do not waste money going to see this film, and perhaps Lorne Michaels will get the hint and start to produce quality (yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy qualitative) movies.
