The film begins with a couple of tourists, men and women, presumably together, hiking alone in a vast wilderness. Of course, a person hears something and torment him so he goes to investigate it. Our killer meets him with a stab in the stomach. He chases the girl and cut her throat. Camera during the opening scene from the point of view of both the murderer. <br /> <br /> Next, we meet our four protagonists, two pairs, one in which there is on the rocks. People joke about how a woman will never be able to cope with the camp alone on a double date, sparking token blonde ambition to leave a week earlier. Surprisingly, the men leave on the same day and their car breaks down .. They eventually arriving in the evening. When people come, they warn about people who disappear in the woods madman Ralph double. They ignore the warning and invade the darkening night and eighties song playing in the background with texts about to be murdered in the dark woods. Men lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we understand that this is not just another clone of burns, but a ghost story! Women are scared and lonely huddling together fire. Two children appear in the background and decided to play the radar. Well, they obviously ghosts on the way their voices echo! Their mother is with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asked the two ladies, when they saw their children before disappearing, of course. <br /> <br /> Children run home to Daddy and tell him about the two beautiful women on the river. This causes a lot of noise, and it appears, clutching a knife on top of the fireplace. "Is Papin hunt," Little girl cries with bad acting. It is obvious here that the pope is not a ghost, as his children. <br /> <br /> flecked with something in the woods, the token blonde splits, running blindly into the night, carrying a knife. She meets his father, who explains that he is hungry, and it will be soon. It does not make sense because a panther growl we heard earlier (Maybe he's allergic! Panthers honest, even in California?) It ends slightly wounding him, before a knife in his head. Thunderstorm explodes and people seeking asylum, which is where the Pope lives. It is clear that someone who lives here, because there is a fire and something strange roasting over it. Children are Pa and notify them that shows up moments later. They disappear as soon as he arrives. <br /> <br /> For some reason, our killer is only after the woman. He invites people to have something to eat and tells us the story of his ex-wife. We are given a flashback of his wife cheating will fall. The old man tells them, however, that he kills her and her lover after, but dreaming about it. We did not give the cause of infant death. Men go to bed and remained unharmed. The next morning, people find an empty campground their wives. After a brief discussion, they were divided. One of them is to stay in the camp, and the other goes and gets help. Anyone who intends to return to his car breaks his leg. Then, we were reunited with their children as they explain the surviving women, that they are ghosts, who killed herself with longing for his mother. They agree to help a woman to be reunited with his friends <br /> <br /> The next scene defies the logic of the film, the father kills the guy who is waiting at the camp. He also meets or married to a blonde. Once children understand that he had been killed, and tell the woman about her. She decided to see it for myself and obviously ran into a killer. Fortunately, children do to stop him, threatening to leave him forever. You know where this is going. <br /> <br /> In general, the film deserves four stars out of ten, and it is to be generous. For all their misgivings, the music is well done. It's still watchable, too. There are some angles that look professional, and some of the sets are well done. The plot is incredible. There is such a thing as a desire to suspend disbelief, but with a toad 6 miles; I can not imagine would be the token blonde take off like that in the middle of the night. I mean, come on <br /> <br /> - Alan "SkipÂ» Bannacheck
