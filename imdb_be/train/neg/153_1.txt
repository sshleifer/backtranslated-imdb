"Spielberg likes the smell of the morning mood. But the mood at the expense of the narrative integrity? No one should love it. "- Lucius Shepard <br /> <br />« The Color Purple »takes place in the Deep South during the early 1900s and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African-American sisters. The film begins with the girls playing in the field of purple flowers, idyllic refuge that quickly broken appearance of their stepfather. This motif ?? Innocence interrupted men ?? It permeates the entire film. <br /> <br /> film then runs into a series of shorter sequences. Celie disclosed twice imbues her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty shed, has a newborn baby taken away, and he is forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson, violent fool who rapes her repeatedly, causing her to cook, clean and look after their children. <br /> <br /> All of these horrible scenes, this time a little screen, and instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinema in the symphonic score annoying, ridiculous comedy and overly rich in the camera. The cumulative effect as a merger of Disney cartoon movies and rapeseed, in the aesthetics of the uneven caused Stanley Kubrick noted that «The Color Purple» made it so disgusting that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. Ten minutes later? It lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> The film often says thing which "racism," "sexism" and "black culture", but it is not. Alice Walker, author of the novel on which the film is based, claims that he is bisexual, but in fact closet lesbian. Her book is a lesbian fantasy, history of women's liberation and self-knowledge that draws people like a violent animal, which prevent a woman. For Walker, the only way out of this labyrinth for women to bond together as a lesbian utopia black sisterhood and women's independence is celebrated. <br /> <br /> Spielberg film, but history repeated frames Walker through the lens of American mythologies comforting. This is a film in which the saving power of Christianity overcomes the natural stiffness of the people. The film, in which Albert finds himself in a variety of ridiculous situations, moments of absurd comedy inserted to make it look like a clumsy fool. The film, in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast consists of depraved men (always beaming with a devilish smile and bared teeth out), the stereotypical fat, jazz creativity Draws groups and gospel choirs. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which black people, of course, child-like, easy and fun taking their social conditions. The film, in which black people are overly sexual, physical sensationalists dominated by violent passion. The film, in which the problem of poverty and class completely invisible (Albert lives in a big house) and black people are completely incompetent. This is not the old South, Old South is derived from "Gone with the Wind», MGM Muscals, «Song of the South», Warner Cartoons «Halleluha!» And banned films Disney. In other words, it is the south, as seen in a child raised on '50s TV. It's all so cartoon as racist as it reduces the human being to a one-dimensional ethnic stereotype that black novelist Ishmael Reed famously compared it to the Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Of course, in typical fashion Spielberg film ends with family ties are cured. This reconciliation was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg is going on, with each character in the story come to terms with their relatives. <br /> <br /> In addition to the letter of hatred Walker to black men and exposing Spielberg bizarre black life, we have not shown anything of the black community. We have only vague ideas as to how any of these characters to make a living and do not understand how they interact with other people in their community. Instead, Spielberg camera jumps about, desperately fighting for our attention (one of the kitchen appliances Celia, it seems like it belongs in the «Home Alone» film), every emotion of the play, directed by never stopping to just watch something or allow a little life just pass by. Couple this with Quincy Jones to the ridiculous "white" music, and you have one of the most amazing films in cinema history: Angry feminist tract Jewish white shot in the style of Disney and Griffith, killed a black man tries to emulate John Williams. <br /> <br /> A problem is also the lack of white marks. Consider this: people in this film are not indicated as rude to each other, they do not dominate women, because they are subjected to abuse by a racist society, which reduces their courage. No, they are rigid in nature. And the women, whether silently suffers as Celie, or naughty and hard, like her sister, survive and survive only because people are too stupid to destroy them. Best film would not be focused solely on the oppression of women, as is the case among the oppressed, rather, it would have shown that this social violence which led to domestic violence, which a minister black women have to perform the same tasks as their male counterparts (while still performs the traditional female roles) and African-American domestic violence is mainly due to economic factors, women are unable to feed themselves and their children alone. <br /> <br /> and so there is a hidden ideology at work here. At the end of the film one character says to another that, as he has no respect for his wife, she wound up getting brutally beaten and imprisoned white. The idea that blacks should go back to its African roots to regain their dignity, and that it is their fault that white unfairly crush them. IE- Respect each other in a poor minority community, and you are not interrupted by the dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Inability to resist sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, infinite sequence loaded extraneous visual Pizazz, inappropriate comic business, distinct musical cues and wildly overblown emotionality, facilitates the provision of "The Color Purple» anything not worth it.
