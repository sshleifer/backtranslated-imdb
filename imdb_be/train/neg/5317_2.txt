For the initial 20 minutes or so (I watched it on the PS2, so I do not have the slightest idea, really, how much time it took) the transferor establishes an interesting premise. I do not think I saw the chopper film with an alien from another planet, as a villain before. However, the interest soon turns to stunned disbelief, you know, "another" huge body builder woman in bikini steel. Thus, the transferor is patently ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I believe that against him. In shlock-horror world obviously ridiculous can often be a good sign. Nevertheless, the open space all the stupidity of his film will be really good. The transferor's funny as hell, but it's also messy suckfest of the highest order. Actors heap on the unsuccessful attempts to severe, potentially brilliant line of pure dialogue cheese stumbled with unnerving incompetence and direction can not even sum up one or two decent set of masks. By the time when the film is finished it is possible to see the original concept through a common stack scar team dumped him. <br /> <br /> Add to that the fact that the "Aliens" just kill people, vaporizing them, as opposed to the performance of any "" reducing as such, and you have a huge throbbing bunch of good ideas, rot. You will laugh at the transferor, but he, and not with him. If this is your thing, then go ahead and check it out.
