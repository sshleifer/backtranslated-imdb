First of all, this part of the way overdone - she wants to do it, everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost, she'll pull through, all over again, etc. Throw in love with her in the fitting in things, attractive man crush on the character, plus one of their parents in trouble and it's so predictable that you can almost be read in conjunction with it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate how they keep dissing classical music. They send the message that everyone involved in classical music uptight and snobby and inertia - in fact, I do not remember the exact quote, but I remember at one point in the movie, Holly says, "Why would they be so busy ... so that classic? "This is really an insult, as the classical music label in such a way. <br /> <br /> In the third place, I went over it many times, but only because I can think of making this film is to promote Britney Spears. there just is not any point at all. <br /> <br /> And oh yes, while the actress who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not) was quite a good voice, it is not so surprising, as they did it is to be - especially when she was belting. She oversupporting constantly. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
