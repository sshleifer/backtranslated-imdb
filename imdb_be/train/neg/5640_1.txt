I'm a huge fan of Willem Dafoe, and was looking for this movie (I had to get the Chinese region 5 DVD it!). But, it's really one of the worst that I've seen in quite a while. <br /> <br /> The current (except Defoe) terrible. Dafoe and Colagrande both wrote and it (although it will not count as a director), and they have different talents for writing or directing. (Stick to acting Willem, Giada go out of business, PLEASE!) <br /> <br /> absolutely nothing happens. With the exception of the series completely unconvincing, completely without plausible motivation, operates the two men (who had just met) in the house. Colagrande-th sleepy, I could not care less expression almost never changes. And the sex scenes are completely inaccurate. I actually shrank twice on one of them. Ugh! They are definitely not the least bit sexy, and so far the only time when the film does not put you to sleep. Then he engaged in mirroring you. <br /> <br /> Just awful.
