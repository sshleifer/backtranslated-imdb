The premise of this long-awaited sequel was really good, and I expected a lot sincerely after the huge success of the remake. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this film is really absurd and inept. Situation and stupid beyond reason and action really badly. <br /> <br /> At this time, not charming characters or violin in contrast to the remake. In addition, blood is not too much, and when that happens, it's really bad. <br /> <br /> violence is minimal, and it is a shame, because there are many arguments that make you think that there is a place for serious violence. I mean, there is a SWAT team that hunts family cannibal mutants. Of course, you expect something else! When I watched it on the movies that I wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a vivid example of how movies are ran a brothel and show poor quality in all aspects. <br /> <br /> A mess, which descends a supporter of a remake, like me. That's why sequels never welcome; at least, this movie is not as bad as in 1985, the sequel to the original.
