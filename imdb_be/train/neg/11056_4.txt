I was so disappointed in this film. I do not know a lot about the true story, so I was ready to see that play movies and educate yourself on a small piece of history. With such a powerful and large true history actors seemed as error-free combination. Well, somewhere in the script I failed them. He was so distracted - it is a film about his childhood? his love of life? his own disability? his ability to speak? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there is a way to include all of these things in a good story, but the film was not him. I left the cool characters, who observed, which were not due to unpleasant their disability, but because of their identity. Other small complaints: 1. oppressive soundtrack. It seventies - we get it already! 2. If it is such a phenomenal speaker, why do not we treat a snippet here and there - and even then, mainly in the assembly?
