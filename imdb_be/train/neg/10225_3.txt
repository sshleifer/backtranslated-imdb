Now I'm the first to admit that when I say something that might be blasphemous or unfairly, so I would like to apologize in advance for my talk about how much I loved this film. <br /> <br /> It's about missed it too. I did not like this movie. To be more specific, I did not like the concept of this film. The cinematography was good. The mood was pleasant. And the action was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the story is meaningless, unacurate and misleading. It is also offensive. <br /> <br /> I quarter Cree Indian, and for some reason I feel insulted, on a personal level, the nature of the character Whitaker. First of all, it is a black guy. And this is not a racist remark, I swear. The idea of ​​white, Latin America, or even Native American shaky skating on the roof offends everything that is skiing. Katana is the soul of the samurai, absorbed with the souls of their ancestors who guide and protect the samurai. For the Dog ghost to use his gun instead of a katana blade and as an insult to the soul within, and where the hell did he get Katana anyway? He must be one of those remarks which offend the samurai caste even more. <br /> <br /> Additionally, Ghost Dog did not show honor. Toward the end of the film, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through the window, and then kills a man by shooting him in the face through a drain valve. Not only that cowards way to kill the enemy, it's more like a Ninja way; silent killers; group samurai deny it exists, but hates or less. <br /> <br /> Then, he tries to kill his boss when he finds out that his boss is a villain. You know what makes a true samurai, when he learns that his boss proved bad or shameful? He kills himself, to prove that he would prefer to die, then stooped to the level of the owner of the dog <br /> <br /> All of the character was a giant contradiction with the actual code that all samurai to follow :. bushido. <br /> <br /> so we have a great film, great atmosphere and because doing so covering satiricle land and premises (which, unfortunately, is the most important aspect of this), making it a poor overall film, and an insult to all honorable bushi (samurai) values. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
