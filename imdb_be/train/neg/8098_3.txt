This is one of the most disgusting I copy I have ever visited. If they want to make a movie with lousy history, they should refrain from granting him the title of a wonderful book. There is hardly any connection between Wolfe and book this film, except the title. I am not against change, if they help to plot the flow on the screen. At least, these changes should not hurt the final product. The last scene in the film painfully unconvincing. Actors miscast. Director and / or screenwriter, obviously, could not decide whether to make an unsuccessful comedy or preach a sermon unconvincing. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the movie and do not like it, try to book. If you have seen the film and liked to read a book.
