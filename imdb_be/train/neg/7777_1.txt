It can be a cute movie for kids My grandson watched it once. he watched it a second time, when I saw some of them with him. <br /> <br /> When the bear lost on the ice burg, and he is in the water, he's trying to get to a piece of ice, he said: "Come back silly ass fool." <br /> <br /> I do not want my 3-year-old grandson to watch movies with the words, as in it. <br /> <br /> That is why his assessment for children. It should be adapted for children. This is what I would expect. put out by Warner Bros. and G-rated, I would expect it not to swear words in it. not even put words movie in most places, as it seems to be added later. And the film drags in many parts.
