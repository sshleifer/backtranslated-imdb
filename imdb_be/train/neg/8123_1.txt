(Spoilers) Wow, this is one bad. I did a double take when watching an old episode of Star Trek the other day, he was alone, where every infected with this disease space, then go a little nuts, and was Stewart Moss, who is also an unpleasant "hero" with whom he lives at night! He played the first infected, the crew member who was dying of terminal depression. All I could think of, he watched his own movie too many times that this is what caused the depression. This film is full of really bad people. There's no sacrifice of the character in the film, rather than one. It is very difficult to feel bad about the turn of Dr. Beck to bat (or what he actually turned in) because you just do not like. And you do not like his poignant skinny wife sloppy or reverse Sgt. Ward, and Dr. Uss Love ... So why would you invest at any time and energy in this film? Where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to worry about taking care of him. Not to mention the sinister cinema, which made it look like they would have made a film in the urine, and five per cent of volatile special effects, many of which seemed to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate the hordes of bats flying. Not the worst film I've ever seen on MST3K, but there is in the lower ranks, of course.
