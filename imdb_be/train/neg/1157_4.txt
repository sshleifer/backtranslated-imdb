I thought that the film would include a typical array of related behavior and way of Snoop Dogg often seen in clichés turnip video. However, my generalization for the most part wrong.

The film tells the story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg), who are trying to create their own individual masterpieces. Their polar lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but very complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship is moved throughout the film, as wild bitter - most of which are contributed by the nature of bloodhounds - like someone with a severe form of multiple personality disorder.
