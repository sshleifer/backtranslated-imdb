What a disappointment, especially in light of the budget as long as the available technical resources and talent assembled. It is not the main rule for the sci-fi / drama, to create in the audience willing to suspend disbelief. 2001 POA plausible beginning, suckering us, but Mr. Burton on only forgets that his audience already working brains. Above the upper libertarians chimpanzees Helena Bonham Carter, the futility of braking the people, ease their escape, their unusual riding skills (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt), massive and immediate uprising of people all too incredible. Mark Wahlberg had not projecting any sense of real fear, danger or answer turned in this world. Compared with the original, in which nudity is Chuck Heston figuratively captured his utter helplessness and surprise turn of events. Wahlberg uniform retains its modesty, but also his clear sense of management and control is inherently silly situations, and we never wonder about his welfare. Unlike Heston, he does not seem to never be in real danger. Tim Burton is to use some of the E / X budget for a competent writer. In fact, after this fiasco lower, I wonder why Hollywood producers ever bothered to settle the scriptwriters and directors threats strike. Let go. Trained monkeys could do the same as they did in the Planet of the Apes, 2001. I'll bet repeated views of these efforts will not be there. He could become a new franchise and a great new step for the imagination. Another opportunity lost.
