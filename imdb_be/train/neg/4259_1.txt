I knew nothing about this film before I was persuaded to see his friend, who had heard it was a "non-stop epic battle scene from beginning to end." This could not be further from the truth. It was one of the most frustrating, poorly written, unprofessional, aimed badly acted film that I have ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on. I would rate it up there with the film, I believe, to be the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There basically is not a story, it is hard to believe that the filmmakers thought it was cheesy soap opera shit be taken seriously as an actual historical fact. It also has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... The guy says the girl: "You smell like the moon.". The girl responds: "What does the moon smell like?Â» OMG! You must be kidding! The scene where the guy was quartered got good laughs from the audience, as it looked so ridiculously cheap and Sound FX from a guy breaks reminded me of someone doing a fart sound with their mouth. If it's playing in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This film is so bad that I actually made a decision to 45 minutes later that I need to catch up on my sleep ... and I did. Awful.
