So «Thinner» ... Yes .. It Stephen Bachmann (read Stephen King) yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from Gypsy Elder that he had just killed, the story itself is, no doubt about it, but I do not know why I did not like it more than I could. I think that really distracted me were the actors. I mean, who could it lead? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And fer crying out loud, can someone please stop Joseph Mantegna hiring for every Italian role ever a Mafioso? And while we're at it, make every mobster should have pasta preparation of an Italian mother? The only good acting job done here under 10 pounds makeup, Michael Constantine, as the elder Gypsy. He's very good. But the rest, I will make you all, "the best actor ..."
