Many people seem to have liked the film, so I feel a bit bad giving it a bad review. But after sitting through 96 minutes of this, I feel that I should do it. Where the hell is the story in this film? I must have missed it, I expected a scene unfold and nothing happened. Of course, the ending was "more shocking", but they did not build it. I forgot who was who half the time, so they do not actually develop the character. Act itself, most of the time it was plausible, but I was able to see most of the time through. So ... without giving anything away, I have to say that if you do not like an actor in the film, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be wrong, but I just do not understand why so little, or too much of the film. I can not decide which one that would be, so I say, judge for yourself. I do not even know if it was the rent would be a good idea, and the cost of all ... <br /> <br /> The plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Overall score: 3/10 I'm feeling it is too high, in fact, I'm staying with my vote on the top.
