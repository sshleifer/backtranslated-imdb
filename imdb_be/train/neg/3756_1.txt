It's really so bad with the film. My friend rented it because it is, well, an idiot. But then again, I have to be an idiot, too, because I watched the whole damn! Actors were on par with the high school drama geeks who think they are going to place. The only place where they will go back to waiting tables in Luby's. All I could think of as I watched this "stone" was how it was actually done. I mean, a "writer" actually thought this room was fresh, original and profitable. Then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to fork over some money with the naive delusion that he was going to make a return on it. The actors were cast, the seats were in the exploration, make-up artists were hired computer animators fresh from Al Collins Graphic Design School were introduced and this turd began to take shape. <br /> <br /> There's obviously been a ton of things I hated about this movement, but one thing that drove me crazy was the most excessive use of music. Every minute of this flick had been killed. There was not a single break in the music. And sometimes it was mixed higher than a dialogue, not that it made you miss some vital plot point or anything. <br /> <br /> After it was over, we decided to watch the Mystic River. It was like running in 1980 VW Rabbit Diesel then switch to the 740iL BMW. You could not get two more opposite films in terms of quality.
