Remakes (and continue) were staple movie from the beginning of the media. It's pretty much hit the company, though. If we take what is good and original build on it and update the key features of the existing standards too, you can have success. Please note such films as The Thief of Bagdad (1924/1940) or King Kong (1933/2005) failed in their attempts. Others, like King Kong (1976), not with a bang. <br /> <br /> Short ENCOUNTER (1945) is the template for this film. It is as perfect as could be done on such an issue, and we appreciated his IMDb ********** ten. The story is simple, love, innocently found accidentally and tragically lost. Why is this just happened for two (2) managers involved in the wrong time. They are displayed in a convincing and sensitive manner and Trevor Howard Johnson CECILIA. Neither traditionally leading star material, but the quality of character actors. For more information, see the film. <br /> <br /> Now, what went wrong? Tanker Movie, redone almost scene for scene with the name of the actor Richard Burton and Sophia Loren should have at least scored IMDb ****** Six. Both actors, although it is disinterested, just showing punch their time clock and pick up their checks. Neither involved with their characters, or with each other. You do not believe that they are in love or when they finally selected is any great loss to any of them. It should not be, and that is why he is not in its intention. Sometimes it's just best to leave things alone.
