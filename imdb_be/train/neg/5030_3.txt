What is that in the sky? It's a plane? Whether it's Superman ?? Errr, NO ?? This Turtle!?! See, this is what becomes of the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other issues! Americans downed by a Russian fighter plane somewhere Artic territory and the subsequent explosion of defrost and literally awakens a giant prehistoric turtle creature named Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly little animal, as it quickly begins to destroy everything and everyone in its path. Arguing the government finally decided to kill the ugly monster of a brand new and super-hard ice bomb, but Gammera have another surprise in store ?? Damn turtle can fly! The first time this happens, leads to extremely grotesque and hilarious sequences! Gammera lying on his back, looking defeated, when suddenly a fire strikes from the armpits, and he flies himself in the air. How can you not love it? Then there is also a persistent south annoying story about a child who is able to communicate telepathically with the monster, but it's just not interesting enough. Flying Turtle, people !! There's very little else to write about the Japanese (and American re-release) Sci-Fi efforts, in addition, it is obvious and quite shamelessly plagiarized from such classics as the original Godzilla and The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms. Effects and monster designs are very sentimental and, in contrast to the above-mentioned films, he would never be able to create an apocalyptic atmosphere. Solid actors like Donlevi ( Â«The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ( "Wolf"), do not seem to know that they were shooting, and even the original Japanese chaotic scene is not very convincing. Own and personal theme song Gammera is pretty cool, though, so he gets an additional point for this.
