Mean spirited and down right underestimate adaptation to the classic children's fairy tale lacks only the charm of his ancestor, but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of him awful execution, which is an obvious rip off that made Jim Carrey, but he has to give up acting all together. It is so annoying that you want to beat the crap out of him, if you were able to jump right into the film. Sets and cinematography ugly very bad. I have seen many bad movie this year, but it's not only takes the cake, but it's because of a doubt, one worse movies ever made.
