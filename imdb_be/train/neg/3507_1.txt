Low human interaction point has been reached Maysles brothers with this film. Remember, you who have used words such as "masterpiece" in dealing with this film that the Maysles creeps did not just go to the Hamptons and will make a film on some eccentric people. No, if they found these two poor helpless people, then they would have to fund your project (and imagine what they said people's money, to sell the project). Then they became friends two extremely vulnerable women. Meeting of the Minds is a lot of real consensus or participation. They are terribly Maysles smiled, kissed the ass, did everything they were supposed to get Beales to cooperate, and then exploit them as evil as never been done. I would like to think that these dealers were random thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the process of film-making, given the pre-planning, the actual shooting, and then edit it took a lot of time, and their goal is not to have any of the provisions actually relate to the Beales as human beings. Exploitation film perpetrated heinous people. As accrued during their film industry's reputation has been severely tarnished by what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is abhorrent. This is what people will remember them. Grotesque dealers.
