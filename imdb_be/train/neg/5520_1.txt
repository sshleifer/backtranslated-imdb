This film was depicted in the trailer as a comedy. This is an extreme tragedy. He left me sick. I hated it. I think that if they want to make a film like this, than they should be men enough to reflect the true intentions of the film in the trailer. I have not seen this movie, if I had known. I think that the trailer should reflect the theme and intention of the movie. I'm tired of this. I really wanted to enjoy the comedy and I am very disappointed. A few days passed, and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this film. I've never been more disappointed in the movie, nor I never wrote a commentary about a bad movie. I really believe that the true deception was involved in this trailer, because if they showed the true intention of the film, no one has seen him.
