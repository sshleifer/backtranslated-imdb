I'll probably get a lot of hate pablisl this assumption film I did not approach it with the corresponding generation dewy eyed nostalgia for me. But it will be enough say- Fire St. Elmo was pretty shit-freaking- tastic, even Brat renovation movies go. <br /> <br /> This is another great example of self-satisfied, self-indulgent neurosis, which is everyone, 80s (rent, anyone?), the plot is almost nonexistent, and the philosophy of kitchy at best, poorly conveyed rest of the time. The complete absence of any such cute characters does not help the situation. There really was no growth, no progress at all. Even the climactic scene of the suicide effectively sterilized, refusing once again allow the death or anything resembling reality or adulthood log in. <br /> <br /> Each stencil figure just talking about the fact that you hate them in the softest, most predictable way possible. Stalker loser for no apparent reason other than he is a stalker and Andy McDowell gorgeous. Jackass does everything in his power to keep reminding you that he's, well, a jerk. Gorgeous Slut hides really soulful, deep pain with a wild lifestyle. Poet mood and melancholy around for a full 3/4 of the film, as he can not open (!) In fact, he is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows. Of Virgin, finally it becomes quite happy man after receiving desire of each one of the Virgin hot rolling in a bag with Jackass, before he ditches it really change (for real now). Cheating Bastard Chita, until it is time for him to get there. Finally, feminist walk pouring holy water on any soul that says "obligation". <br /> <br /> This brings me to my final beef-, that the connection super-cement holding these people together as friends? I can not imagine that only one of the Now think on their vortices generated around that narcissism to the city center in a bar. And they were all so scared every Other- heads in the toilets next to the rape, and sleep around with everrrryone. Cherry was after two BFFs act as general baboons after screwing a feminist, she "umm, actually I do not want to be with any of you anymore. Let's be friends! And we can hang out in a completely unawkward way, every day, knowing that I can connect with one or the other at any given point, but none of you are satisfied enough commitments (not the word!). "And they all smile, as if to say,« Golly gee, I never thought about it! What a great idea! »<br /> <br /> Only it is not. Curious that watching this movie is not.
