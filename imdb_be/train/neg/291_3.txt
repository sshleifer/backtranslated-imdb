The film version of one woman-of-Broadway shows Sandra Bernhard is choking pretentious. Sandra substitute for living and superstar acts, but her sense of irony only fitfully interesting, funny and restless. Her supporters say she caustically honest, and that may be true. But it is also poignant, with unapologetic, in-your-face bravado, which is not very well suited for a film of this genre. She does not want to do well - and it is certainly not out to make friends - and it always will be rubbed many people the wrong way. But even if you meet it in half, her stuff is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and, although not directed at him, the film has a cool, detached signature style on it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their strange touch was the fact that all the audience Sandra's house, looking very sad - a feeling many real audience is likely part. * 1/2 ****
