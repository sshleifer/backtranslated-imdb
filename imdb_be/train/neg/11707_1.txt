This 2003 TV movie was aired on the female, of course. As a man, why do I even try to look at it? I do not know, but I had to examine my head. And the director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of yourself, to give people an injustice, as he does. He takes any power and conviction, a person can have with a few women make it boring. Number one groove Heyzer Joyce's wife. I could not wait for him to toss it. Her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing for most of the film. Another rock was Nichole Hiltz, of the coldest person you ever want to meet. Her appearance does not justify our leading man to that monkey on her and her actions were so obvious, only a fool would miss. It determines who lost. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow on the uptake to slut seducing her husband, again played as a guy who is a loser, David DeLuise. Rounding out our cast of misfits Anthony Denison as a boss that has little to do but frown at our hero. Stephen Jenkins, our hero, or should I say, the victim, not so good. At first I thought he was just a bad actor, but later I believe. He never received a fraction of the land and has been repeated all over. Although, as a man, I was furious when two women got along with him. Men, beware of this channel, which puts men and women down to get away even with murder. LMN is a channel. Carefully. Note: After seeing it a second time by mistake, I am sure, my initial thoughts. Especially on the writer / director Simon Gornick. I still think he disgraced males and should be horse whipped. Only saving grace in this film Tembi Locke, who has not had a chance to show their talents with terrible acting Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise around her. Plus a silly story, which makes it worse. Down with the film and its vacant Gornick stars in it. Please LMNO shows no vulgar again.
