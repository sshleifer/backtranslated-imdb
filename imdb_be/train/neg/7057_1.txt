This is one of the most annoying, pointless movies I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. Every time he looked like he could get a good, come with a sepia tones of memories, then paranoid idiocy disguised as comments. The protagonist, Maddox, is manipulative, willing to be a rebel, who lives in a mansion, it would seem, without any parents or liability. The supporting cast more cute and interesting, but, unfortunately, did not develop. Nor do we ever really understand the nature of John Stanton allegedly influencing Maddox commit acts of rebellion. At some point I thought, "Aha! Maddox just nuts and secretly doing all these posts by escaped mental patient Stanton! Now we're getting somewhere! "But, of course, that will not end up like this, and the whole movie is meaningless in terms of both Maddox and viewer. Where Ferris Buehler, when we need him?
