This "screwy comedy" seems very forced. Indeed, the actors are trying hard to make a move in fact not funny script. And as a result, does not really go anywhere. The idea of ​​a woman to find out that she was pregnant after receiving substandard divorce just is not all that funny. And then, when Cooper sneaks away with the child, because he did not want him to adopt just it seems terribly unfunny, and it is really pushing hard to turn it into a comedy. It really is a shame, as well as the actors were more capable than the script, and I found that just bored at the whole mess. Given that Cooper did so many good comedies, I recommend you see them instead.
