«P» (or club-P) should really be called the «L» for the lame. Each festival has a disappointment, and that which can not live up to its advertised logline:. "Thai lesbians are fighting with monsters" Most likely, this is the story of the Khmer village girls who taught her grandmother a little magic with a few odd (but certain ) rules: "Do not walk under a clothesline," "do not eat raw meat," and "do not take money for their credentials." Well, I think that people, she moved to Bangkok to raise some money as a "bar girl" and manages to break all the rules grandmother taught her, which Later releases an evil spirit that is convenient to kill "foreign john" who pay for her services. <br /> <br /> while the film can not even be released in Thailand because of its controversial subject of the most American viewers find this ho-hum Horror Pic cross between "Showgirls" and "Interview with the vampire," as directed by Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> If not for a couple of scenes with a significant amount of blood MPAA probably can appreciate this is only for pre-teens. There are literally broadcast TV adult fare, although you would expect at least the sex scenes, given the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is Thai pornstar in real life. <br /> <br /> As for the "lesbian" angle, there is one short hug and a couple of "I love you in" to prove that the two main stars are actually a couple (to take). And P-Bar to be one exotic dance club on the planet, where the girls keep their sarong and do fancy tricks (there is a swordsman, who cuts the cucumbers from the lips of a girl ... Ooh, phallic imagery). <, Br /> <br /> A lot of nudity, no real monster (except the five-foot high Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and in no way any adult should ever pay to see such a stupid thing, except on DVD . You have been warned!
