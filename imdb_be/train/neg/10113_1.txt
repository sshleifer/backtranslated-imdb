I found that this film gets rented based on the packaging. zombies on the front panel of DVD looks cool and scary. then you get to the movies, and this is a woman with a raccoon mask on. zero special effects ... and even the action scenes you can see them miss a beat by 2 feet. The funny thing is that Lommel acts in the film briefly, he and the rest of the worse crap actors in the film. The only thing I can think of that Lommel is just trying to make a bad movie that people dubbing it "iconic" ... however, I can not imagine anyone thinking that this is anything but one of the worst movies the history made. real horror in this film, how bad it is. I'm confused, I rented it, and vow never to see another movie Lommel again!
