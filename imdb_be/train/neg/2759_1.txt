Hilarious, laugh loud moments ... and yet not a comedy. I particularly liked the gag planted in an ambulance soaking "dirty bum," who then yells after them in anger "dirty bums," I mean, wow, that someone pays online degree in literature! Worst case scenario you can imagine, with the topical administration of a single moment, the absurd movement in the history of the development of the character of ZERO (even between the characters, which are found .. It is as if they all knew and trusted each other for many years), brisk voice po- above with an added echo effects and plot holes .. God has plot holes !! Frankly, I'm writing this without even looking the whole thing, but I, of course, expect that the last 30 minutes or so to really enhance the already miserable attempt at a movie ... Thank God, we have good looks lead to several do remember that the film is loading ... well ... use your imagination for the conclusion of this particular proposal!
