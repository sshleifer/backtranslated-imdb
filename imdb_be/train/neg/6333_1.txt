I actually saw this movie at the cinema. As soon as I handed the cashier the money, she said two words I never heard in the theater, before or after: "No treatment" as soon as I heard these words, I just waved good-bye with my cash, and went home. No, silly, I went and saw the movie. This film did not make anyone in the theater laugh. Not even once. Not even by accident! Mostly, we sat in a daze. Every ten minutes or so, someone will shout "This movie sucks!" The audience will applaud enthusiastically, then sit in stunned silence bored ten minutes.
