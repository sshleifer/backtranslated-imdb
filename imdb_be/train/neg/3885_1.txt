This film is not just bad - it was awful. After I watched it, I really felt the need to take a shower to get the dirt on me. There is a running "gag" with an elderly couple making out, this is not funny, but it's disgusting. makeup monster was cool, but that's all. Continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least, I was. Editing is really poor. <br /> <br /> Most of what you could have done better than to spend time watching this movie. Even if your friends are in the group of "bad movies" this one is exceptional in its mediocrity, I could not even bring myself to laugh at him. You have been warned.
