Perot idiot, but he is aware of this and act in consequence. His life is totally boring, and he does not know how to change it. If it is the last one, Nikki dies. It feels completely empty, and he decides to go to become drunk. When he returns home, he drops to a girl who puts ads. Despite the fact that she ignores him, he fells in love and begins to follow her, furiously. Well, the beginning of the film is a bit slow, and can lead to a close for most people. However, as the action begins, it is a bit better (not much!, Maybe the best part of 5-minute sex (almost 30 different scenes on this), that you can see in the middle of the movie, it's not good for erothism, but funny and suddenly it's the scene. this is probably the best of the film. neither the actors nor the direction is good, and the results of this boring film, which can lead to funny to some people (not me). All the film is based on absurd situations (idiot like says in the film), there is something interesting. I like Ventura Pons, but I must admit that this is not one of the le Shih his films (perhaps its worst!), he knows what to do it better.
