What happens to the ITV drama. Firstly, «Losing Gemma» quite simply the worst TV drama I've seen in recent years, and now the "ideal parents" Complete confusion from beginning to end. Anyone who is responsible for entering into this nonsense should get there P45 special delivery. <br /> <br /> Most Drama / Thriller, the requirement to suspend a certain level of faith is necessary in order that the storyline can be developed, but the "ideal parents" took it to the next level, I stopped as much faith to end this nonsense, I felt that force-fed in a truck load "Magic mushrooms", it was like the writers have decided to try to create a "Drama by numbers" with the participation of some serious problems - religion, education, greed, fear, murder, Paedophillia only trouble was like a big Eric Morecambe once said, playing the piano ins, "I'm playing all the right notes, just not necessarily in the right order." For your guys following scenario, I suggest you try reading a few books on the development of scenarios than the "Script Writing for Dummies." <br /> <br /> Because of the ridiculous scenario and the complete absence of tension in the direction of the action was adequately low key, not the fault of the actors, the cast was at the highest level. But I believe that all the actors that are involved in this sad drama of the need to instruct their agents the next time postman tries to deliver the script department of the ITV drama, make sure the mailbox is firmly nailed shut !!
