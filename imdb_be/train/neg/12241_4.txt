This is one of the few episodes (if not only) with indisputable mistake in its history. When handling the situation Ralphie Christopher says that he heard about the death of Pie-O-My in a fire accident. This is an important detail, because in this context it is clear that Christopher knew from the outset that Tony is the one who should be killed Ralm. There is no way, but Chris could hear about the accident. Who's to say it, and when? By the time he is torn from his delusion by call Tony nobody was even informed. Tony knows that - that makes it even worse! Hearing Christopher talk about death Pie- O-My, thus, can only lead to the conclusion that Tony that he put Chris fire. Given the clearly complex recording process, told the writers themselves on DVD, I do wonder none of them did not understand the problem there. History simply does not work that way. Unnecessary to add that I'm a big fan of The Sopranos. Otherwise, of course, I do not care.
