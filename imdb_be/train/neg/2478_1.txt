This film S-L-G-C. Much of the film is actually waiting for him to "start." <br /> <br /> The setting was bleak scenario was gloomy cinematography was bleak, the story was grim, the budget was low (not that all the low-budget film is bad, but this one had no redeeming features). <br /> <br /> plot was dying of a vengeful, slightly deranged hunter than the actual Wendy, who made a very brief appearance by the end of the movie. This in itself was disappointing, as it "Wendigo" is simply an amazing mixture of wood and deer. All about the movie was boring. <br /> <br /> The parents of a little boy were quite aloof and time seemed completely detached from their son. Was it down to bad actions or bad scenario I'm not sure, but it only added to my frustration and boredom levels. <br /> <br /> There was no food for thought, nothing to arouse interest. With no real plot or a metal mold factors, this film crunched on so painful, you just do not give a damn what happened in the end. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere reminds me of Wendy dull film shown at the awards ceremony in the direction of the end of "Mr. Bean's Holiday" :. a film that is artistic and meaningless, trying too hard to be profound and significant, but coming across as pretentious and boring <br /> <br /> I would never have wanted to watch it again. I just watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting would happen ... but it is not.
