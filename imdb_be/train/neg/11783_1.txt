What a crappy movie! The worst of the worst! This film is as entertaining as a dead snail. No-talent-the-so-ever to the actors, the plot silly. Who wrote this script? Was there ever a script for this film Goofy or director just happened to press the record button on your camera, and then decided to make the film as they were? Is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what? My friend's younger brother are in 6.th class and he and his classmates are just amateur film made for them a school project, which outdid the film calling .. This is definitely the worst film I've seen in my life! There's just no excuse for this flick!
