I wanted to believe in this film after only form of mainstream comedy this country admits it is a farce and stereotypes <br /> <br /> Of course, he went a completely different way -. Let's be cool and sharp - and out the other side with little to show for it. Bet One Small Seed ofigel for this. I know that SL did. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters do not have the comic chops to pull it out. Even Denis K was the best time. I'm really serious. Every time they stopped a little character, I kept thinking, "Darn, this man was to be leading!". <br /> <br /> Independent does not mean that the camera work has to be horrific. Black and white have not done anything for this film - in fact, with the flat dialogue hurt it even more longingly bringing relief. Black and white also was not fresh. Staff was horrible. The use of music was terrible. Oddly enough, I saw Little Miss Sunshine after this film and composition it was fine. - maybe that's why the shortcomings in this film stick out in my mind <br /> <br /> I think Korn (which was funnier than the drain before he even said anything) said on this film, not David's - see it and you will understand. I bet that the guys who organize Oppikoppi were alarmed. not going there at all would seem, nothing. I had a feeling that can be removed in some garden. I know that regular guys who are much funnier, raunchier and witty conversations than any of these "comic book." Dude, they hooked up with the end it was ok though. <br /> <br /> Guess the SA Comedy going to stay in the stone age a little longer. Good job guys.
