You can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this movie was simply too much. Virtually nothing was even close to the truth, and even at that time, it was regarded as foolish. <br /> <br /> The defense of the ford, it was shown on the old talk show that he worked on history as told him the real Wyatt Earp, who was obviously old, senile and replay the scene differently. Earp said the director of the coach, and as it was scheduled to occur at the time of arrival of the stagecoach, so, despite the fact that other historians assert itself Wyat claims that this was deliberate. <br /> <br /> This film reflects Earp as an honest man, and his brothers. History sure does not say that they were or were not. Most people insert a bit of deception and injustice in their character, but this is nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them to be law-abiding types shootout at the OK Corral. People who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the old west, you have not had time to think about too much else. <br /> <br /> The characters that do not exist, the characters portrayed are dying in the paddock, which is actually not all make it a weaker film. Further weakened Mature, which really did not make a convincing dock. It can be the worst choice ever cast for Doc, but at the same time, we must remember that the old films were closer to the era, and closer to the feeling of truth. In the end, Wade did get first-hand information on Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> He also weakened all so predictable events associated with the Mexican girl. Hollywood was a Nazi about in those days, and ready to kill brunette women in a very predictable way to show his wing idealism Hitler. This happens in most movies until the eighties. That's no excuse, and makes it more expensive art, however. <br /> <br /> actors playing Earps well and Brennan always thrill. In fact, mature can only be valid flaw of this film. Nevertheless, it is the weakest of the old OK Corral movies.
