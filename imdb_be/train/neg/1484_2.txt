Please do not rent or even think about buying this movie.they not even have it available in a red box for rent, which will cost $ 1, and I think that it is worth less than that.the the main reason why I rented this movie D was because Jenna Jameson in a movie lol between 2-5 min.i give credit that the film had a hot chick and quite a bit of nudity, but in addition, you could also buy the other D horror film, which has the same with no one you know.Ginger Lin has more time acting in this film than Jenna, and she was not even on the front cover ilm or its name.I recommend that people watch zombie strippers, because you see Jenna almost throughout the film and naked most of the time, about the movie such a big disappointment and a huge waste of time.
