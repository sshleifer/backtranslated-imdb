Does anyone else feel betrayed, like I did? The first hour or so was pretty tough, but the last one. Oh, my God. It would seem that it was predictable and cheese. Nha grand and epic as the entire run of the show was. Most reviews were read light, but I really can not understand why. I seriously predicted that the total ending WAY before, but then refused, because I thought, "No, they will never do it, it's way too lame." I can not stand. I feel so unsatisfied. I think I'm going to walk out the door to go to sell each season belongs to me. Someone please. Reconsider. I want to love it. SO bad. Somebody tell me why I'm wrong. Great show. A terrible ending.
