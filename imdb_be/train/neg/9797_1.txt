Currently, he is a kind of trend is to look at all the shows from the early 90's classics (people so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of these shows were / are, of course, well, that alone pure crap. I watched this show a lot in those days, so he got a lot of repetition on TV back then, and even as a child I did not like it. Even 8-year-old can see how many people are in the Power Rangers are replayed, and how special FX sucked even then. If the show does not address the pain of bad «fighting'-stage, it poisons the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teenagers and young they'r social problems every now and then. I do not know about you, but I did not give rats ass about any of this at all, and mostly filler, as long as they do not have to "fight" some dude again in a very cliché stranger headset with fireworks or a toy -robot. You never feel "involved" in some way with this show, as well as the fact that most of the actors act like there actually has no interest other than just they'r purse only reinforces the lack of feelings. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing memorable about this show, and it is rather strange that he had received so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All this is just a quick way to make money, though. I challenge any "fan" to tell me what it is worth in the episodes, which are supposed to be so good, because I could not find anything that even slightly appealing to children. I think that most of the "supporters" of the Power Rangers will tell me that I "just do not get it" in any way, or something along that line. I really do not care, though; it was crap then, and it's still crap right now.
