I could name a lot of funny movies. There is comedy, which determine to be funny, and are. Some movies as Gimkat, for example, are trying to be serious, but ultimately ridiculous. Ladies Man movie, which is desperately trying to be funny, but can not be less funny, if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of the nuclear disaster. This anti-funny. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've laughed harder than laugh at anything in this film. It's just unfunny. It's a sad, stupid, pointless, irritating, strangely bad, but not ridiculous. I do not particularly care for, Tim Meadows, or the character of the SNL, but I expected better than this. <br /> <br /> The film is completely no logic or common sense. It's like a writer was over the head of the bag while he was typing, and he could not see what he was hitting the keys. They say, "origin" with a womanizer, but do not include the motivation for his whimsical delight acting like it's still in the seventies. The film tries to humor with a man who seems to be pleasuring herself porn, soon after he tried to hang himself. It's a comedy? I like to consider myself having a very sharp sense of humor (to spend a lot of time writing a comedy, as I do), but maybe I'm just not quite enough bright for this film. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, as funny as Tucker There's Something About Mary, outrageously bad here. I begged him in my head, to shut up. <br /> <br /> In the end I had to knock on my chair, muttering to himself, and the film went on any more, is likely to be a suicide attempt. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but this is the first movie that I saw that he had come close. <br /> <br />
