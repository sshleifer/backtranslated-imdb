I can not believe how popular the show. I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. I have read countless sci-fi novels and enjoyed by many sci-fi movies and TV shows. I actually will not even consider this a real fiction. Each episode I sat was like a lame, diluted version of Star Trek episode, minus anything that might make it interesting and exciting. <br /> <br /> In general, a group of people standing around in the army fatigues, talking about something boring that sometimes go through the Stargate, and ultimately on the planet, which looks just like the Earth, people who look and sound just like people! It seemed extremely low budget. Symbols forgotten all dimensional expressions, and many attempts at humor fall flat. It reminds me of when you see an advertisement with the famous sportsman in trying to be funny, but it is not. It's just boring. <br /> <br /> The film was awful as well. There is so much you can do with a portal through space, but every place people go to boring ARMY! It does not show the presentation! I actually thought that the series «Alien Nation» from a few years ago (based on the film Alien Nation) was much better. This show actually had a good story lines and characters worthy. I was not crazy about the «Alien Nation», but compared to this overpriced crap, that was great! <br /> <br /> In addition, in contrast to the great new series «Battlestar Galactica», «Stargate" copied the look and lame movie too close! They must have at least updated the cheese "toilet flushing" special effect, when someone passes through the gate.
