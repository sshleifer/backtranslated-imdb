I never even knew that this film existed until I found an old VHS copy, hidden deep in my dusty closet of horror. The name on the box said "insect" and the illustration on the back it is clear that this is just another minor and poorly made horror film 80. They can certainly be fun, of course, is not expected that an intelligent script and as long as you do not get annoyed by seeing a huge amount of cheese makeup effects. Almost every important aspect that makes the horror film worth watching is unusual here in the «Blue Monkey»! The plot is funny and very unoriginal, the acting performances painful to watch and there is a complete lack of suspense. After the always-popular trend of "big bug" movies, "the Blue Monkey" handles about new and unknown species of insects, which wipes the doctor and the patient remote hospital. The creators could not have been more evasive about the real origin of the giant oversized animal! We all know that it is not from outer space, and initially got out of a tropical plant. In addition, there is absolutely no explanation of where this new type of insects suddenly comes from! Like I said, do not rely on an intelligent script. The first half of the film entertaining enough, with some well-baked with blood and the introduction of a pair of mad characters (80-year-old blind lady and alcoholics!), But in the second half (when the entire hospital placed in quarantine) is terribly boring. In addition, towards the end of that «Blue Monkey» begins exaggerated plagiarism older (and better) films. Approaching the climax, they apparently ran out of budget, as well as lighting becomes very poor, and a guy in a monster suit is not very well disguised more. «Blue Monkey» worth a look if you're really bored, or if you really want to see a 80-horror film ever made. Supporters of the B-movie can recognize John Vernon ( "Killer Clowns from Space", "Curtains") in the small and meaningless role of Roger, who is in charge of clinic.
