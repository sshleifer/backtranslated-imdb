I remember this show. I still remember that Kick Ass cool song "America Funniest People." To be honest, it was to be under the name of the lame or unfunny and completely disgusting American people. Dave could not save this show i could not Bob Saget or replacement hosts for BBM, which came later. Jackalope segments were funny and so Dave can do some good voice overs that were better than Bob. But the show went to hell because of the lame videos poor people represented. It is also designed to be more of a variety show with lame guest stars, including the Olson twins. Plus AFV was the prime, before they began to collect drooling ugly as sin babies, as the winner. Did I say that the video was disgusting and lame? But still, the theme song rocks!
