Omega Code was the model cinematographical inconsistency. It was a little (but very few) good action, especially the two prophets and Rostenberg, who only appeared once and had no lines. Otherwise, the action was clearly bad. The plot line was rather weak and only partly on the basis of the already questionable biblical interpretation. Of course, not one of the best of the year.
