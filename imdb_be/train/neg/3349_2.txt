I still read Shirley Jackson's novel, something of which I've been meaning to do for quite some time. I am sure that he must be worse than this film. I remember jumping once, when I watched it the other day, though I can not recall the scene. <br /> <br /> great special effects, and I watched it on DVD, but I'm sure that the theater was a horrible sight. After the first couple of special effects made out I was expecting the development of history. <br /> <br /> I thought that this film at least to be loosely based on the classic novel, so that a good story should be there, but it was not. I was reduced to looking at the beautiful nature of Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the film mainly because it was not anything special to look further. Lili Talor was the will defend nature. I do not like it one bit, then whining about people. Besides, the guy in the movie reminded me of a cartoon Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters in general. Quigon, um Liam Neeson has done an excellent job of trying to get through this film with some type of action. <br /> <br /> Half of three quarters of the way I'm dying to go see mannerisms Friday 13th or scream Queenish movie! At least there is some type of entertainment. If there is no history there, at least they fill it with a bloody death and attractive women. It was nothing. <br /> <br />
