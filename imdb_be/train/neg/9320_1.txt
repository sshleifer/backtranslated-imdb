If this film was a comedy, I would give it 10 Oh, where do I start? Put it this way - I've seen a lot of terrible horror movies, but this one does look like Troll 2 Freakin 'Saving Private Ryan. It is as if a group of porn film makers decided to make a horror film, have changed their minds in midproduction and decided to make a comedy, and then returned to the horror, and then decided that they should have just stuck with porn (erotic in it). Everything about this film is simply terrible: musical score (someone shoot the guy who invented the keyboard Yamaha), script, directing, cinematography, which acts. There's just no words to describe it. Oh wait, yes there is: Holy $% *!.
