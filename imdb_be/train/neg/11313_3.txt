and it does not help the case of Romer that in a few years Syberberg came together and made a strikingly large part of the work on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> perhaps this film Waiting for "t look so insignificant when it came out, without syberberg film to compare it to, which is probably shot at even smaller soundstage with fewer resources. I actually can not remember at the moment, is there a horse in syberberg film. all I know, the German version of pure magic, while it looks like some college production of a documentary on the film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> music ... la Musique ... not even counted here on IMDb ... and someone on the basis of its esters from the 12th-14th century "or something ... well, it is not much help to the film. He comes off as cheesy and false, Comme le frommage mon cher !!! <br /> <br /> Romer is one of those French filmmakers who loves his leading man as a whole is quite unsightly, too, and it does not help the cause. Parsifal syberberg was lovely, and they can be seen on German television today the sale of some special bike he invented. ... <br /> <br /> I shudder to think that watching the video syberberg like. I remember that the last time I saw the film at the cinema, the press was so bad that the experience was unusual 5:00 parody. But even then, it should surpass that this version has to offer, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> points for honesty, for arrogance, but ... this film simply need beau coup bucks over. it does not look like a medieval manuscript it looks cheap! BON MARCHE !! Oh, and yes, it just ends very arbitrarily Parsifal go to church, and the cheesy passion play being put ... blah!
