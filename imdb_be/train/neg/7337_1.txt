Painful. Painful is the only word to describe this horrible execution of such a fun and interesting Shakespearean play. I gave him a chance, but was terribly disappointed and could not bare even finish viewing it. For a man who wrote a novel about how great this rotation a lot of noise was, I'm sorry you and your brain is bored. Let your excuses about young audiences to be removed without retaliation. Please do not even bother with this gut wrenching, disgusting excuse for performing acclaimed Shakespeare's drama. You will be forced to vomit and will require a stool close to the TV, with which you choose to watch this shit, because involuntary bowel movement will take place.
