How Spaghetti Westerns go, I would put this man can not die on the blunt side of the genre. This does not mean that the film is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flashes some other sex workers I have ever seen. Guy Madison makes it the best in the title role, but lacks on-screen charisma necessary to pull it out. not very good with one exception, the rest of the cast. Direction strain and offers very few things that I have not seen before. There's just not much to get very excited. <br /> <br /> cast exception I mentioned it Rosalba Neri. It is the only bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: .. IMDb page for that person can not die properly Rosalba Neri plays Jenny Benson Instead, it is a symbol of Melina, I do not know how anyone could make a mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Barth as . listed in IMDB credits for the film.)
