I found this film in "horror" my video store. It seems to make sense, since most movies about zombies have their place there. With the "dead" trilogy Romero to 28 days later. However, after seeing it, you can quickly see that this film really is. <br /> <br /> This is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and becoming more and more bloody. There's no horror here people. Just some halfway decent set the scene of action, which will soon grow tiresome, because it was the last time ... and then ... and then ... and soon you get the feeling, maybe you DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the film. Sorry. I think that anyone could find better use of $ 7 million dollars in film, than to make this piece O »crud. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, but once again, they have been used more and grew tedious, since it was the same trick over and over again each time, only with a different character. <br /> <br /> In addition to being royally annoyed splicing the footage from the game arcade. I played this game. It sucks. So why do they put it here? The fact that it's right, it's not a movie, a music video, and it's bad in this. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: much violence / gore and profanity
