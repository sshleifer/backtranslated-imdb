I do not recommend this film because it is inaccurate and misleading, the story was supposed to be in the Algerian Berber territory, this one was shot in the southern Tunisian desert, (completetly different culture, I know what I like Tunisia and Algeria) , another shocking element is the character of her companion aunt, she says in the film with a very clear French, French academic university level while the character she plays was to be broken never left her mountain of the character, so live like a Bedouin with kind m Education I, that the context is not possible, the most infamous scenes and disrespectful especially to the population of the region is a segment of "fatal repudieeÂ», which is the S fudge from the writer / director, and the like that will never happen in the Algerian society when either !!!
