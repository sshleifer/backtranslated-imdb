I tend to like movies Landmark Drive. I also think, Hope Davis turns into a stable good job, so I had high hopes for this film. These hopes were not justified. <br /> <br /> The main drawback with this film direction. There are many scenes that Daydream sequence. The film makes frequent use of the character Denis Leary, as the alter ego of the character Campbell Scott. This does not work for me at all. It would have worked better as a game than a movie. <br /> <br /> There are problems with the plot as well. It is important that the characters in the film to make a journey and end up in a place different from where they started. I did not feel that the characters have grown in experience, depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editing was not well done, either. There was a very large deflection in the middle of the film, which was extremely boring. <br /> <br /> for the actions of which I felt was consistently strong exception, the film failed in almost every aspect of the movie.
