Just do not bother. I thought that I would like to see a movie with a great supspense and actions. <br /> <br /> But it grows boring and very predictable after an interesting start. In the middle of the movie you have some social drama and all the tension is lost, because it slows down the speed. Towards the end it gets better, but not very big. I think that the director took this film too seriously. In this kind of a movie, even if you do not care about the story, at least, you want some good action. I almost fell asleep in the middle / core. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
