Nicholas Walker Paul, the local town Reverand who married Martha (Ally Sheedy), but also the usual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to escape with his current case, Veronica (Tomanovich Dar). However, he gets amnesia (hence the film's title). Sally Kirkland also on hand, as a crazy old coot who misses the good Reverand through shades of "minuscule" type of way. It is sad to see a very good cast wasted like this. Last but not least a little John Savage in a terribly bad forgotten the role of the private detective. The film exposed as a "black comedy", one should bring the two elements in this film. While it really brings the first shovel, it unfortunately does not contain any of the last. In addition, you can not underline any of the characters, and in this case, it is not interested in them. Technically, not all together bad film just very forgettable one <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Gift Tomanovich Gets Topless ;. Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /> <br /> My rating: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase
