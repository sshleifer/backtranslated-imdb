Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to his wife looking young and beautiful. To this end, he drugs bride during a wedding ceremony to make it look as if they had died, so he can steal their body. I'm not quite sure what he was doing with the bodies. I do not remember that ever fully explain. All I know is that he produces something from them, and injects it into his wife. (I just think it's cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid was in vogue mad scientists in the 40th years.) You can pretty much guess the rest here. <br /> <br /> There are a couple (well, actually more than a couple, but I will write only two) problems that I have with this film. One of them is a way to use Bel. Of course, he does a decent enough job in its own way as a replay (by the way, the rest of the cast is just horrible). But that he was hiding in the back of a hearse or crawl into the bedroom of his female reporter not to do anything that's just silly. Also, why was beaten and / or killed all the protege does it have? Whether it is to make him look evil? Well, someone who is in a coma bride kidnapping does not really need to be in order to look more evil. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have an idea of ​​brides narcotic intoxication. Why is the bride? Would not it be any woman under the age of 20 years do? Looking Bel pass through the circulation to get your victim, I thought of another idiotic fisherman knows I, what you did last summer. In each case, it would seem a simple way to achieve their goal than using seemingly impossible plan, which depends greatly on the way to circumstances beyond your control. (By the way, an alternate title for the film The Case of the missing bride. I think that partly explains the need for "brides".)
