This will be the most useless comment that I ever put down, but I still have to do it to warn you about the crime in the movie that "Dead Freddie" is. It is not only the worst nightmare of the head of the series, but right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring, pointless, and almost death for free. Scary 3-D and the end of the over-the-top sugary kills enough to conduct this "film" in the ground. However, it does not stop there, simply add the bad acting, terrible script and some cheese Kama, and you get yourself this heaping pile of guano! It is not surprising why Freddie, as always, played by Robert Englund, made two posthumous appearances. I would also, if I went like this. This is strictly a movie fans, do not look at our shame.
