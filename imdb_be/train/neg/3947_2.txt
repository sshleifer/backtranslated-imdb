The comic modesty strong. Alexander stage that plays Modesty Blaise is more like anorectic model. It has no moral or persons who have modesty in comics. Modesty would never give a woman advice is to show more skin to make more money. I do not see the resemblance with my comics with modesty and the film. It as a Mission Impossible movie is about Ethan Hunt locked in a room temporary detention in high school, talking to the janitor about when he went to high school and Hunt would play Kuolls (in Road Trip). Soo, if you're a fan of modesty does not see the movie you just get angry. If you do not know much about comics Modesty shoot another film was not supportive of your time with this one.I can not figure out how Quentin Tarantino can put your name on it. I will ask to return to my DVD rental store tomorrow.
