This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen, all of it is weak and incoherent. Actions absurd costumes even crummier and history does not exist. This film is "a series of poverty" the sword and the adventure was to capture some of the success that "Beastmaster" and "Conan" used, but it does not give us any reason to follow along. The protagonist is a cool and dim, he can not even deal with the ball, and the sword of the 16th century. All the action sequences as slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and terribly dated music playing when they are on horseback. Do not even bother with that shit.
