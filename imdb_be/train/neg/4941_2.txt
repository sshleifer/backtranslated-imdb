I am actually not against the Geico commercials first 50 times since I saw them, and even found them a little crooked and funny, but seriously! It is best that these people could come up with?!? This show sucks! It is soft and feels like watching an episode of "The OfficeÂ» with the characters disguised cave (I know that many of you will hate me for saying this, but the "Office" just do not do it for me). Well, I understand we have a poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and it is a crappy boss who hates him; pseudo-intellectual who is really just a little intelligence is functioning; and sluggish someone who just wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT !!! I have worked with these people, and found that they were just as annoying in real life as on TV, I ... why would I want to spend another 1 / three hundred and thirty sixth week my watching over those nominees type?!? Please call your parents and ask them if they fall on your head, if after thinking about it, you continue to deceive ourselves into thinking that it's fun.
