Damage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets horror Christian Coalition. Well, maybe it's not so bad. But it's close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is passed, and possibly killed a serial killer (Chris Ferry, which is pretty terrible and cruel). I say probably because she wakes up, and it was a dream ?? .. Or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that the fifteen minutes of the plot (Done well enough the first time) is repeated over and over again. And as Claire wakes up each time, and each scene is obviously a dream or an alternative reality, I just stopped caring what happened to Claire, and began to wonder what a lame twist at the end was going to pull it together. <br /> <br /> I was the introduction for the session (which honestly would have made more sense), but instead got one of those too obvious half sudden endings (the Think Village or below) Hugo film breaks faster than Donnie Darko cut director. All the big twist endings in horror films The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, happy birthday I worked, because the audience did not expect the left-field explanation. (Heck, even a canoe ends in the original Friday the 13th cost push) <br /> <br /> remaining on the other hand, cries Twist ending every scene change. Other faults are pulling one note piano soundtrack (Although the features songs were decent) a clear time filling (Claire makes the dish, the storyline mother Claire) Claire says "hello anyone there" every time she thinks that there is a consistent killer around. <br /> <br /> In addition, some of the supporting roles of existing (in particular the mother Claire plays Maureen Olander, reminiscent of Mary Kay zombies) indicates the first time the actor roots of low budget. <br /> <br /> and the priest, and not nearly smart enough Damaged retains its interest, if only to see how they are going to fix this mess. The problem is that they are actually not.
