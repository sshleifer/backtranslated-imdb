Well, first of all, I have not sat down to watch the premiere in the series "Star Trek" to see the cowboy flying around in space. it is like a normal episode of Enterprise runs <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds Nebula or something aloung line that wants to close, but it can destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2, it sends the shuttle in the nebula and the shuttle and damaged ... <br /> <br /> all the episodes I've seen, all the problems are due to silly mistakes Archer. Oh, and you will see a preview of the episode featuring Archer and TPol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch this episode, but after that I completely gave up the enterprise and turned to the TV directly. Come on !!!! This Star Trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> In addition, there was a banana slug ?? In one episode, the Hoshi was the banana slug, but had to leave it for some stupid reason. Well well, a little dull to bring you pet slug in space, but no matter. Well, that was what I thought, until they left him on a desert planet !!!!! SLUG banana can not leave an empty !!!!!!!!!!!! How dumb these writers <br /> <br /> Any ways, simply put, if the enterprise is to NOT WATCH THIS !!!!!
