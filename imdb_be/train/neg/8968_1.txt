Compilation screen is so stupid that hurts me spend my life 2:00 I will never go back (where have I heard that before). Act itself. Things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something terrible to happen. Nevertheless, there is no original, that in this movie. While the first cub was stopping horror movie that does not make much sense, after all, zero cu picked up on that and tries to recite exactly the same story, but this time he does the opposite point attempts to chew every detail explanation that the first film did not answer. Comic thing, the director transforms the exact scene of the first film, which was a bit strange, and tries to explain them. But the scenes are copied, NO consistency in general. This scenario is sooo meaningless. I can imagine that he wrote something silly person 15 years of a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part, in the end, they maim "good" child prodigy guy and he becomes retarded guy in the first film, and you see it when they find it ( "the green room ..") in Cuba in 1997. Goodie gooodie, flake flakes which turn. First of all, what about when you have not seen the first one, it makes no sense to you jerk director. O, another great idea: instead to determine the amount of x, y, z coordinates of the room (the cube 1997), this time is three letters, each of which provides one of 26 possible values ​​of the coordinates. Duh. Only now reshuffle does not make much sense anymore..so it allows letters disappear before anyone can use them..I want my money back. <br /> <br /> I think I had to write it down, as there are just so many bad, inconsistent, or simply a stupid idea in this film. Director / authors should be required to have some talent.
