Not so bad as it is credited to (Hooper made much worse) ?? all the more frustrating for me. This imaginative concept that never really tapped to Hooper on its economic orientation, and especially in the smoke (pardon the pun) to write. He is so ominous and over-the-top in a dead serious tone, becoming ridiculous and focused giving all pessimistic about the mystery / conspiracy narrative laced easily telegraphed to the end of something quite dramatic. Because of this, Shagan is rather sluggish and Brad Dourif (great to see him in the title role) seems to struggle shifted balanced performance, in spite of the etching out an embarrassed brisk intensities him a dubious character. Despite the fact that it is cheaply made, there is a competent technical attitude. However, this does not seem to be anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster nasty shocks (that make some of the work) and surprisingly steaming special effects (fire, flames everywhere) instead. Hooper did show some stylish obsessed with image (to a greater extent towards the latter end), and the camera-work to maneuver quickly and glowing assessment tickles. Performances throughout the store a bit with appearances of Prince William, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, John Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have a small, but amusing cameos ?? especially Landis. Nothing surprising, but it is tolerably attractive.
