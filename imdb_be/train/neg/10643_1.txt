Normally I am a bit fan of the movie bad eighties and early nineties with now ... but beens this film is so incredibly scary, it was a real test of endurance to sit through. Guys dressed girls were done to death - but not so pathetic. Corey Haim performance was boring as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. It has no redeeming qualities, even if you are number # 1 supporter of the actor / actress in this part of the trash - stay away!
