"Fever Pitch" is not a bad film; this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible the American movie audiences and critics so stunned and lobotomy in the feces that Hollywood churns out, they will praise to the skies even a mediocre film with whether laughter barely? This is the only reason I can think of why this terrible romantic comedy (and I use that term loosely, because there is nothing funny in this movie) getting good reviews. <br /> <br /> I sat through this film stunned that screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babalu Mandela even for a moment that their script was funny. <br /> <br /> brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well the film. He adapted «Fever Pitch» for British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Zhemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby vote for "Oh Boy» (2002), and if the «High Fidelity» was Americanized film in 2000, writers DV DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg entirely wrong, because they have kept the essence of wit and humor Hornby. They made one of the best films this year. <br /> <br /> So why is the US version of «Fever Pitch» go awry so painful? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters, we could respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel all funny in Hornby were cut. In Americanizing story, they killed her, removing all that was good, and the uniqueness of work Hornby and replace it with the usual nonsense. <br /> <br /> They've turned a funny story in formulaic romantic comedy, never once deviating from the unfortunate formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girls, each of which has a specific function. YOUR Overweight second cynicism and ambitious, and the third romantic. Want to guess how many male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is? <br /> <br /> What did the «High Fidelity» so much fun not only a good leading man and lady, but the participation of the secondary characters. This «Fever Pitch» support six friends do or do not say anything particularly funny. They are so small that they do not even decorative. The only reason why they are in the movie, because the formula requires. Poor Ione Skye winds as one pals Lindsay in a thankless role. Excellent Skye must be willing Lloyd Dobler would swoop and take it. Think about it, would make a great Cusack Ben. Of course, Cusack's too smart to cling to such a scenario is very tedious. <br /> <br /> There is not a single, solitary moment in this film that seems original and laid-back. Each turn portion predictable, each lame joke telegraph. Ganz and Mandel works for a laugh. The first 45 minutes so painfully slow, you wonder if these guys realized that they were a comedy. You can mark the story is in this film hour. It's almost as if it were Ganz and Mandel is the formula of a screen for writing guru pasted on the wall. When they got to a certain page, they looked at the formula and said, "Well, the guru says that this has to happen now." And, voila! <br /> <br /> Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter do not help the film of some sort. They do not have a clue how to present your story and characters (they pass V.O. narrative is not the main character, but to the other guy who sits at Ben in Fenway Park). Thanks to some very awkward writing, we have to look Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their first meetings unfunny. <br /> <br /> Barrymore make sweet and charming is better than most. She's so good at it as Goldie Hawn in her prime. But even her wit can not save this extremely terrible movie. She tries her best to squeeze some energy and humor of the story. About 30 minutes into the movie, Ben Lindsey says, "You're funny." The only explanation for her remark that it was in the script. For Ben Fallon never says anything even remotely funny. Fallon is neither clever nor funny; when he does comedy, he overacts. <br /> <br /> Fallon was never good at "Saturday Night Live". It was quite possible, at least funny person on the show. Remember that lame skit about the radio DJ, who did all the voices? The only reason, «Weekend Update» worked sometimes because cohort Fallon, Tina Fey, knows a thing or two about comedy. <br /> <br /> The actors who think they are funny and behave in a way that rarely, if ever, are actually funny. It is true Fallon. He thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely raises a laugh. His stuttering, unsure of himself shtick does not work on the small screen; lousier it on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, to Fallon, his role in this film also requires a few dramatic moments. If you thought that his comedy was bad, wait until you get a load of his dramatic material. Two scenes in particular - the first in the park, the second bin in front of the school - it is painful to watch. Scenes require an actor with a modicum of dramatic abilities, but Fallon does not have the knowledge or skills to make them work. His range of emotions did not even cover the whole range from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has no face or depth. it often occurs as OAF. And it is not attractive in this. It boggles the mind that Lindsay find attractive about him. Compare the performance of Fallon Firth th in the British version, and you will understand how awful flat, unfunny and forced Ben Fallon and how wrong it is for this role. Watching Fallon in «Fever Pitch» makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic tinge Ashton Kutcher! <br /> <br /> Just as the «High Fidelity», Americanized «Fever Pitch» could have worked brilliantly. It just needs a better writer, a competent director and is definitely stronger, funnier, smarter leading man. Do yourself a huge favor: Avoid this rotten film; Rental 1997 British variant of Hornby and read a book instead.
