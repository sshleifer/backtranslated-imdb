This is one of the worst slashers B I've ever seen in my life. The ending is what you need to see to believe. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Harry and Phillip Permanent Standing, sitting on the stairs with his mother, watching their father came into the pipe, dressed in a Santa suit. He put presents under the tree, eat cookies and milk, and then returns to the tube. Philip goes to sleep, but Harry comes down only to find his father, dressed in a Santa suit sexy to please his mother. Harry then goes up the stairs, smashes the snow globe, missing piece of glass, and cut himself. <br /> <br /> Then you move on to the present. You see, Harry. He is alone a person who sleeps in a Santa costume and watch small children through a pair of binoculars. He has two books. One book to good children, and another for the poor children. It records everything that they do in these books. Loser boyfriend. He also works at a toy factory Jolly dreams. His brother Philip has a family and two children and lives in a nice house. <br /> <br /> When Harry learns that his boss only cares about profit, he goes and collects toys and gives them to a few children, then it goes to the church and killed 4 people. Then he goes to another house and put presents under the Christmas tree. Children catch him, but they go back to bed. Thus, Harry goes into the bedroom and kills his father and leaves. <br /> <br /> When he went to the house, a lot of children in his place and run to him. Since parents are nervous and trying to get their kids to go back to them, so they do not get hurt. How do they know that Harry was the murderer? Of course, you should be suspicious, because you never know who it might be. Harry gives gifts to the children and the father pulls the switch blade in an attempt to strike him in front of children. <br /> <br /> When Harry runs away, light the torches and the inhabitants to follow him, to kill him. They do not even know that he is a murderer. When Harry reached the house of his brother, his brother, and he was a little talk and Phillip suppress it. He only loses consciousness. Philip downloads Harry back into the van. When Harry wakes up, he takes off. <br /> <br /> ending that I could not believe it. Once again, you have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that bugged me was a black Santa. That's right, a man in a Santa suit they saw was white. So why do they bring to the black man? <br /> <br /> Skip to see it Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa's Slay. You get your money's worth watching the two films. They are better than this bunch of garbage! I give this movie 1 star out of 10. I wish I could give it 0 stars the reason is that this film deserves.
