You all know the story of "Hamlet". I do. <br /> <br /> Well, "To be or not to be" a phrase (not the language) was beaten into the ground so many times that it is not very interesting (actually, it was not that great to begin with). In fact, I believe, "Hamlet" is good, but significantly overestimated the game. It's not even the best of Shakespeare, "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo and Juliet" is ten times better with the "Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" is not too far behind. "Macbeth (pounding the table, from the pants, washer redeem, OW!)» Not so bad. There are many others who are better than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I will not comment too much really for the film, and I will cut quite a horrible episode of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Good. ,, Mike Boots and win a card game, get to pick the movie. ,, They ask "Hamlet», Pearl sends it to them, Yadda Yadda Yadda. ,, and prepare for the most boring Sci-Fi MST3K episode ever (though I have not seen any of the Central Committee Ones). <br /> <br /> While the «Blood Waters of Dr. Z» makes viewing the episode badly, as it is not quite a movie, rather casual, spliced-together scenes (I am reminded of a line from T-shirts «Future War» "Maybe this is an anthology of short films plotless"), the SOL Crew many cost quite a few good cracks. I can not say the same thing here. <br /> <br /> riff fall flat, host segments (cf. usually), mediocre at best, and if the film itself (which is not so bad) is actually better (I mean, like movie quality, and not in the camp, as the "Prince of space"), what version of MST3K, you know that the show should be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw it was a few months ago), well, maybe eight or nine times over the course. I tried and tried and tried to have fun - but I just could not. Only random lines like "Dilbert boss Hail the Queen!" (And if it's a funny line of the episode, well, um) - and from time to time, I mean every ten minutes or so - maybe I even laugh. The second time I tried to watch it, I can not even laugh at a few jokes I found funny before, and just gave up forty minutes before <br /> <br /> The film does not hit. it's just the German version of Hamlet. Actors good enough, and although overwrite is not the biggest, it is not in itself a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> The four stars on "Hamlet"; Three, and three for the MST3K version <br /> <br /> PS :. WHY WHY WHY, MST3K!
