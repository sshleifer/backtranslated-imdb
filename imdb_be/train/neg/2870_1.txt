Oh my God! Please, for the love of all that's holy, do not watch this movie! He's 82 minutes of my life I will never go back. Of course, I could no longer look at the half-way through. But I thought it could be better. This is not so. Anyone who actually liked this movie, one of them seriously sick and twisted individual. It is not surprising that we Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this film badly from the effects of the editing. I do not normally write reviews here, but in this case I'll make an exception. I just want someone had to warn me before I hired this catastrophe
