I am writing this because I somehow felt that I was led to believe Dark Remains was a good movie. Despite the fact that this is not the worst that I've seen, this is certainly not good. <br /> <br /> The weak script, weak actors and weak direction. Even if they can not afford big name actors, it would be too much to ask for a more attractive title role? It was painful to look at the usual actress through the film, with its dismal performance. The story was clich√©s and bad scenario. Special effects were minimal. The "unknown" techniques that are reused here were hard to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Dark is not worse than the very few Masters of Horror episodes. But not quite on par with the quality of movies even. Dark Remains only recommended for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss any movie in the genre, even if it is poorly made one. For whom, the time should be spent on something more valuable - it should be very easy.
