It was a stupid movie with a predictable plot and terrible acting !! Willie Nelson was tough as his braid. The film just seemed like a very long time for the announcements bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson wore - especially where there were so many close-ups of her face. The room was not funny, and like I said - soooooooo predictable. Whatever money was spent on the creation of this film was a shameful waste. Any hints for other old films of Marilyn Monroe Sun amplified view Blonde Ambition at all. Furthermore, it was so incredible - Jessica Simpson is able to reach the leadership position of the Secretary of the blue - it was funny !!!
