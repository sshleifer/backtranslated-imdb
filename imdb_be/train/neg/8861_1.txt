Scary horror sequel to "Oh." This takes readings from the funeral Karen White (she was murdered at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee boring) arrived and said, Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown), that Karen was a werewolf. He's going to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning) head werewolf. Ben and colleague of Karen (Annie McEnroe) to join him. <br /> <br /> A terrible script, bad directing, editing and inept really terrible actions of Brown and McEnroe alone to sink this. The werewolf effects are largely kept in the dark - not in vain! They are horrible, when you see them. Irregularity of special effects as well - although I like the cartoon lightning comes from the Dunning fingers. There's also a werewolf orgy, which is particularly stupid and Dunning removes the top, at least eight times during the closing credits! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I discovered that the village in Transylvania fun - it looks like it came from the Universal horror flick of the 1930s! There are interesting tricks chamber between the transitional scenes; Brown and McEnroe have a good body, and Lee Dunning good at it - but they could not save him. In fact - why do they do it? Where is that they are hard for the money ??? This is one of the lowest rated movies in IMDB. That should tell you something in itself. Ostensibly Dunning was horrified when she saw the film - I can understand why! Compulsory-miss.
