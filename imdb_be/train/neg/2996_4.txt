Born Again is a substandard episode from the first season. We are talking about the subject of reincarnation and just does not fly. I've never been big on reincarnation, and it can be a part of my apathy in relation to this episode. He cites the case of Tooms, which some good continuation of the previous episode. But the positives end. Which is sad, because it occurs at the very beginning of the episode. I think it's funny that a dead man would choose to incarnate in the body completely unrelated girls. He waits until the girl will be eight to get revenge. There's even a serious lack of Mulder and Scully witty dialogue to keep afloat episode. If you are in reincarnation, maybe this episode of your line. If not, then at least you can find out what bradycardia.
