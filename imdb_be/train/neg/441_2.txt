We do not have this on television in England, but I walked it online on YouTube. It's stupid, immature and sad! This is from the creator of "Earthworm JimÂ» Douglas TenNapel, I never got into this cartoon, but I must admit it's better than that. The multiplier has done nothing for years, as in the present time. For ten-Neypel, Douglas, is the return of a parody and constantly low! the story of the three cats who inherited the house and a lot of money from his old master deceased lady. They argued and continue to agreeing on what they want to spend their money. "sad!" Animation terrible. The main characters are intended for cats, e so? But they do not look anything like a cat! It's amazing pet monster look like creatures with large mouths with sharp teeth and Bulgy eyes! Symbols human animals and others also pulled together a real ugly! leitmotif terrible and annoying! In addition, these stories lame and most likely copied from the old show. it surprised me how this show got 7.5 / 10 votes other spectators IMDb. Television is really not what it used to! But now most of them silently, cheaply made and boring. Some of you are on the site may not agree with me well, I'm sorry, but it is a waste of money and a complete and total waste of your time and rejoice that Britain is not too tolerate this shit (oh yeah, if you have a digital you should) but I do not have, so it's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it is very lucky to get it, because I gave the other shows the worst!).
