Bridges of Madison County is the best version of this story. I felt that the end of the film was not brittle, as they did in the original English film. This film is very indianised, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in the movie, when the hero dies at the end, you'll love this movie, on the other hand, if you are a fighter in life, and they think that crying is for wimps, you can not like the ending .But all this is quite a good subject well treated for Indian conditions. Tabu was good as a caring wife and mother. All worked well.
