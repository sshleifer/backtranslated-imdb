I think if you're in a sci-fi and horror thing that might be interesting. The action was good, but not great. Two pregnant girls must be fifteen, but the play is clearly older actresses who were twenty or twenty-one at the time. The plot is good, but the story does jump around a bit, leaving one guessing whether you are in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the rate of curvature between them. The church is portrayed as having a secret sect to investigate the events that happen only to those with this belief. What if the two girls were Protestant? They are worried about the Catholics? Therefore, the fact that some have managed. Who knows, someday the Catholic Church can even find out what the Bible teaches. If you miss this one, you do not feel that you have lost something.
