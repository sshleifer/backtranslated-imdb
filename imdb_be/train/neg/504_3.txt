Especially libel suit of the Italian cult movie with a meaningless title to download (if anything, the alternate spelling of Satan is even less relation to the story!) This hybrid of gothic horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of sensuality) only manages to a flat view of the atmosphere in the all ?? actually corresponds to the processing that is downright scary! Here we get the usual group of people (acting troupe) stranded on the island (to which they were invited to the Count ?? because he was in love with the leading lady, a dead-ringer for her missing husband)! Symbols are quite a few stereotypes of middle age, but a dashing hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history has more than its share of violent tragedy), demure heroine, walking companion (remembering Mae West and formed the most annoying of the lot!), good-natured, but a devotee director (always reproached one and all of its non-masculine behavior!), lesbian couple, a mysterious gardener (ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi, who, this time, gets to the action if you know what I mean), jealous housekeeper (nominal star Femi Benussi, though, for it's worth, it's really part of the ensemble), a religious fanatic butler, maid, vulnerable, etc. while the film is not any means unwatchable, atrocious dubbing, the rate of snails, trash production (with scenes that show the raging sea rises with some black and white film!), and the fact that the killings occur only in the final half-hour did not help the cause . In addition, evaluation of Marcello Zhiombini, though nice in itself, comes off as modern disproportionately in these circumstances; that said opening is surprisingly complex one (considering there is certainly no shortage of suspects here).
