-might contain spoilers ... but believe me, this film spoils itself from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I went into this film with high expectations. It was my own fault. I put too much stock in the record, Steve Carell to date. 40-year-old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... Management. And I also made a mistake in joining IMDb and see the rating 7.5 users, before you go to the movies. It has always been a very good performance in the past, but something is definitely off recently. The last time I felt that it was uncomfortable, and this is a lot of pain in a movie theater watching «Blue Steel» in 1990. <br /> <br /> This film felt from the beginning to the end. The script was a flunky material. Terrible writing all around. "Killer Love"? "Love is the ability"? Whoever wrote this crap was suffering from the same disease that struck the writer (s) in American Beauty ... waaaaayyyyyy trying too hard. The entire film was littered Company'ish moments triples as a terrible and far-fetched scene in the shower. Or pointless / aerobics confusing scene. Laundry or terrible scene. Really, if you think that something serious and / or real to happen, they throw in one of those awful moments. And it happens again and again and again. <br /> <br /> And with the character of Karel? Guy meets some lame in a bookstore, and suddenly head over heels in love? Let's face it. Their conversation sucks. They both had to say goodbye to them the first few minutes. Pay special attention to the initial conversation, if you have the misfortune to watch this movie .... Karel character is trying to say something that is completely random and not-funny (I think that a fine line, "this one time when I was child "... that's all. seriously), but both are laughing so hard that the coffee is going to tip of nose. The actors themselves looked like they were in pain, wondering why they were sent to do what they do. <br /> <br /> Back to the IMDb thing ... You guys need to figure out a way to keep the promotional team to movies with this website. I know that this is impossible, but it is painfully obvious that the first 20 or so the ratings / reviews were either placed on the 12-year-old, or a hired lackey in the studio. Check the rating of The Family Stone ... if it's the middle of the 5, then it is absolutely to be 2 ... and that is pushing it.
