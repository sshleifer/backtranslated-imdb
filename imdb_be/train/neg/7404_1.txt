I originally bought the interest in this film after reading the reviews say, this movie reminded the reviewer of Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of Silent Hill, and frustration with this debut film, I thought I would give this a chance. Um, FEARnet only lists the film as "Dark Floors", instead of his full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credits, I immediately thought about the group (I was in college, some friends who love them), but I do not think that this is important and quickly pushed that thought. <, Br /> <br /> strong film begins. Although the "terrible little girl" was done to death, good use of the audio and the feeling of isolation is really the beginning of the history of the sword together. The tense atmosphere quickly built up, and everything points to the points of the film is excellent. As the monsters are real stars of horror, I could not wait to see what is hidden in the hospital rooms of the main characters find themselves trapped ... <br /> <br /> And then the first monster shows and I found that highly delighted . By the time when the second came, I was frightened really it seemed that just a Megadeth concert, and stupidity turned me off completely. <br /> <br /> During the film's atmosphere has remained intact, and history has left you wondering just what is going on, but the panic were largely non-existent. However, I had hoped that the end will make it all worthwhile. Unfortunately, it was not so. By the time the film reached its climax, I was in complete disbelief, and I immediately recognized the tremendous bad in his final disclose ... lead singer Lordi? Seriously? <br /> <br /> It was the fact that the film all comes down to? Beam wretches chased around the hospital members of the band Lordi? Silly monster design suddenly make sense. If you are going to be corny, maybe through the members of Marilyn Manson, or even KISS there too. Not to mention the fact that I'm sure I saw the end of one of the music videos Lordi in a few years ago. They had to go and do the whole movie of this? <br /> <br /> The worst thing is when I learned that he was actually all that I could manage to yawn. I'm not going to "ruin" it for you, but I can say with confidence that this is probably a plot device, which you've seen before. Most likely, more than once. <br /> <br /> So, if you're not a big fan of Lordi, stay away from it. It's not scary, it does not bring anything new to the table (although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies, mostly Silent Hill). And I can not emphasize this enough, LORDI is an antagonist. LORDI. It's about buzzkill. <br /> <br /> In fact, you'd better watch yourself scare Slipknot music videos. In other words, it is simply not possible.
