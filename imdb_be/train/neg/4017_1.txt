Yes, this movie gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the genre of adult film. However, I do not like this one at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more than fitting a horror movie, she is able to return to earth for a short time to live a life of lust, she had never done before in his life on earth. Crappy sex scenes that follow. Why do they shit, for whom they are so eager to be artistic, they are taken away from actual sexual intercourse. I mean, we watch porn sex, we do not. Little girls Blue also makes art in the way things are, but it is still very sexy and nice to look at. Of course, the girl that one is very nice. Here we have a rather unsightly lead actress, and it does not help things. If you find lead in your adult film unattractive NO amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film. The sex scenes range from bizarre to YUCK ... I mean there's a snake in one of these people. So this film simply can not, as it does not excite me at all, and me off to me.
