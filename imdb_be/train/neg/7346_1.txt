I feel like I just watched .... Snuff beautifully acted, taut, thrilling and terrible thing! Two hours litany of perversions in the most basic and all-inclusive sense, sexual violence and torture, rape, beheadings, incest, corruption, living funeral, abuse, violence, ill-treatment. A lot of redemption at all. And I'm having fun. I could not stop watching. What does that say about me, about the people who make and act in this way, and in the world that has become so insensitive that eventually real Snuff will be the norm. And I'm no puritan, no sense of humor, I'm not trying to hide the existence of the dark, and I do not lead to a secure life, but I was ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see my English cousins ​​dragging subject sewer Incidentally my own tribe does. It should not be comfortable, but it should lie in vicarious sadism?
