We had to go to a meeting, so we've included DVR for recording the ending. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have the key?". It does not contain shook his head. I said, "So you made me look at the end of this film, and I have no idea what just happened." He does not "make" me, but you know. <br /> <br /> The body movie was pretty good. There was a lot of uncertainty. He kept you interested. Then the end. The ending ... well, it just ends. You did not let on what happened and why. Up to the titles, I kept thinking that something is going to happen to explain it, but he never did. So I came here, waiting for someone to understand it, and I just was not paying attention. No. Here, four years later, I'm just as clueless as Tom Sawyer was. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea what went on. I'm just glad I did not spend the $$ to buy it, because I am sure, I would have been crazy. <br /> <br /> Ohhhhh! I got it! The end of the film that has disappeared! ROFL
