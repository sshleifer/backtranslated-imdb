Not too keen on this fact. History is quite nasty and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, nunns cost well. After that, it was pretty scary. Tim does not correspond to the role, he finds himself in smug self inflated ass and Pruitt Taylor Vince entirely unconvincing as a trumpeter. This film is an idealist and as a musician, to feel a little offended after watching. There's no scene in 1900 practicing or playing with his colleagues group mates, it is completely self indulgent. I believe that it is difficult to build any relationship with such a character, maybe I do not look that film. If you do not have a real passion for life and a sense of Gurdjieff that all about then safely indulge in a suspension of disbelief and watch the wafer.
