I just finished watching "El OTROÂ». I always took Julio Chavez performances hat, as he's a great actor, but this film is really upsetting and slowly. I think it would be even worse if it was not for Julio. In any case, it is certainly a film that you will never understand unless you are from Argentina, and even if you do, I would advise you not to shoot this film in order to have a good time with his girlfriend, friend, family or friends ... it's really upsetting and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make much sense either. Perhaps the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he is doing is opening and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. In general, I do not like this movie.
