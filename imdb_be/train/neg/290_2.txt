Killer Tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor - you'll either love or hate. I personally like, but in this fourth film leaves a feeling. Tomatoes are not the same, lame jokes, even the actors are not so funny. Because it's the only thing that such films should be. - funny <br /> <br /> So now the next story did laugh, it's annoying. They really did not have to do the fourth part in a trilogy Killer Tomatoes.
