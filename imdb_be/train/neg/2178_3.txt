I would have enjoyed this film a little more there was for Jason (Herb) Evers constant harping on the experiment. Many early reviewers Seven Samurai accused Mifune in the replay. Nevertheless, more and more critics have viewed this film they saw purposefully done. Jason Evers clearly Mifune, and replays it so. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this B classics were pretty good actors, minus Evers and Showgirls. If you watch this movie, you would have noticed Evers crying almost every line, that is, until he does not smoke and blowing smoke indifferent to his nose. <br /> <br /> special effects were in the order of things in a B movie such as this. In retrospect, there is not much that stands in my mind as a fantastically good or bad for this film.
