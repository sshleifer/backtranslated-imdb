I was not sure how to evaluate this film, because it was so bad that it was actually pretty funny. I'm not a fan of Gackt by any means, but he's a talented, despite the strange nickname that sounds like a cat coughing up Hairball. I always thought that Hyde was a talented, though, Vera interesting album. <br /> <br /> But on the people here. This film is funny. It's so over the top and pointless it is almost like a parody of supernatural fighters. <br /> <br /> In the film, the story is almost here, except that it's just about a vampire with a gangster friends. In a sense, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, so as there were too many ideas that have led to not enough time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were laughable Quickly edit, almost difficult to understand, with choreography that so ridiculously bad. Although Hyde looked very stylish in the scenes, but it's just such a ransom of this film. I youngsters for good fighters, but the action was badly done. Although the final shoot-out was the kami and the highlight of this otherwise depressed movies. <br /> <br /> It keeps jumping between genres, not a very good thing. He wants to be a drama or action movie, or horror, or romance ... what the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review makes you crazy, why? This is because Gackt and Hyde is your love? Do not be fooled, this film BAD.
