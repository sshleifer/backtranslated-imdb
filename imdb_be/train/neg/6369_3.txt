The only reason I rented it because of an article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made the movie look interesting. Well, it's not. It was very sad, amateurishly written and directed the film. All the actors in this film is terrible, except for Faye Dunaway, who is always a joy to watch. But too much time has been focused on Gina Philips and its ridiculous meetings with crows and Duilio Martsau. Martsau has such a thick Argentinean accent, you can only understand every few words he says. Also at the hands of Nicolas Pauls, who plays ultra-soft love interest to Gina Philips. Result: this movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and the last five to ten minutes of the film. I would give this one star, but I gave him three only because I like Faye Dunaway so much. But even she was not that much in it.
