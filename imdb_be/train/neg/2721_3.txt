I'm a big fan of '50s sci-fi, but it's not one of my favorites. While the film's concept was a natural remedy for a classic little teen sci-fi movie directed by counting too heavily on it to carry a movie. It is clear that he worked without money, because the whole film is loaded with bloated dialogue that continues forever. I have * never * seen so many times that kill in the movie. <br /> <br /> There are probably less than 60 seconds "Blob cadres" in the whole film, and most of the rest of this people, engaged in a large number of poorly written, coasting dialogue. It was interesting to see Steve and Anita M. S. together, but God ... as if casting could think anyone in their right mind would believe them, like teenagers?
