"Crush" pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, he is trying to be Britt "Sex and the City." <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the turnover of young handsome trophy, the nature of which is not very fleshed out (think of it, we have not seen all that much of his physical flesh, or Kenny Doughty is worth looking more) . <br /> <br /> They sure do a lot more a matter of a young man / older woman than was done in reverse in any version of "Sabrina" (no movie I like) or on the issue with Douglas / Zeta -Jones or dion / Svengali marriage. <br /> <br /> Around Andie MacDowell as an ex-pat from the otherwise welcome familiars Brit dramas and comedies such as tart-tongued Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The plot twists towards the end feel very Deus Ex Machina. But it was not until the loans do not come to an end, I realized that in fact, may be wrong. Just as with the "Sex and the City" writer / director a male, that's a first timer Scot John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a screenplay about three gay, probably about them is because of their loved ones and at work (characters principal of the school, police and a doctor), which would be better and more interesting film. The working title of the film was "Club F * cker boring", which would make it parallel with the gay "broken hearts club" even more apparent. <br /> <br /> (originally written 2002/06/04)
