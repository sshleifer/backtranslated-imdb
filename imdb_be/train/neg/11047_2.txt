There are two reasons why I did not give this movie 1. One of the reasons some of the actors (eg, Malcolm McDowell and Gvinayt Walsh) work, who tried to play on them is usually a good level of acting. However, in many scenes they had some way blocked by bad scripts. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the coolest idea and looking at Cyborg, which is quite different from most other similar roles that I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in the movie as bad as it can be. Sad scene, useless and boring dialogues, poor script. And, apparently, it was the first film ever to many actors. This could be an interesting story though, but they have not fully succeeded.
