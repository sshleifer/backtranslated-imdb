I am sure that deep in the recesses of the mind the character of Jack Black Nacho Libre absolutely hilarious, but no, it is not. You can tell ol Jacks having a whale of time hammin it plays a smarmy, slimy Mexican monk with a dream of becoming a champion, but this film is just flash in the pan in almost every department. <br /> <br /> I just sat there for most of the film thinking, "This is supposed to be funny" and "That's the guy from Tenacious D right?". The truth is that this film has nothing to offer. AT ALL! This is a lousy script with bad characters and really naff actions and direction. You will see the endless moments when you think that something funny is definitely going to happen, but it's just not. I was bored silly for about 10 minutes, but although it's certainly pick up. He did not. 90 minutes later, I barely managed to prevent the aneurysm it was so painful. <br /> <br /> It's like, remember years ago, when you see something from FAVE actor in it, even some of them really early swab, before they were famous, and you would be very puzzled, that the actor was actually in such load spikes. Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed some of the early films of Jack Black as the Shallow Hall, and I look forward to meeting with Pick of Destiny, but come on man. If you do that to us again, Jack I'd have to come over there and kill his knee or something. At the very least, give you a serious conversation with. <br /> <br /> I know it's a cliche, but it's one of the worst films I have ever seen, and for many reasons ....
