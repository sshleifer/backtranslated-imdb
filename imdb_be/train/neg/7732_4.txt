Before writing this review, I went back and re-read the reviews of others. This film has been particularly frustrating for me, because it has two of my favorite dancers Gene Kelly and George Chakiris is appreciated by the often wonderous Michel Legrand ( "Wuthering Heights», «Ice Station Zebra", "The Thomas Crown Affair") . Dancing was stilted, unmotivated and unoriginal songs forgettable story joke. Not even the costumes especially commendable. Only photos are captured the right mood and spirit. I am glad that other people enjoy the "Girls of Rochefort," though of course I did not.
