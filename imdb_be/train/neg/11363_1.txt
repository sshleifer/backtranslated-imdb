This film was advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every issue. So when we went to the multiplex Kinnepolis our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how sad this movie! This movie is in the style of Hollywood about the film in the film. Shades show so clearly that we are not ready to make "big Hollywood movies." I'm not a film critic, but I think a good film starts with a good script. A nightmare scenario. As my story line, it is nothing, and then a loop. You can just look at the TV and seeing nothing. It was a feeling that we got when we saw shades. Shades is a BAD PRODUCTION !!!
