Devil Hunter was known for the fact that it is on the "Video Nasty" DPP list, but it does not have to. A lot of movies in the list, where there is a God (and RPM) only well-known reasons, and while it's not tamest clot; there's not much here that warrants a ban on ... which is a shame, because I would never have sat through it, where it not for the fact that it is on the "shopping list." The plot really gives the film a decent base - or at least a decent base than most cannibal movies - and it's worth an actress who is kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle. Hunter then hired to find her, but along the way he must endure a native, to lead the man who calls himself «The Devil» (hence the name). The film is basically just drags on and eighty-five minutes, and there really is not a lot of scenes that are of interest. It's a real shame that Jess Franco eventually make movies like this because people clearly have the talent; as seen in films such as the diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, faceless, and it kills ecstasy, but, unfortunately, it is only good films gems, among the piles of shit and Devil Hunter is very a piece of crap. I saw this movie only because I want to be able to say that I've seen everything on the DPP list (only two more to go!), And I think that's why most people who saw him, saw him. But if you're not looking for bad things; there really is no reason to worry about it.
