I almost drowned watch this movie in the cheese. In fact I could not even finish. I want my money back. weaker attempts of Hollywood to come up with one new idea. Well, I keep a bowl of lemons in the refrigerator. Just in case. They must, gave Nicolas Cage hat and bull-whip. Swashbucklin. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona and Leaving Las Vegas has the "lemon". People who are fully sold (and most of them are) have to love this movie. If this film was animated, I would take it more seriously. I would rather pay to see a very silly movie that was not trying to hide. In my opinion, it was incredibly stupid movie and made even more incredibly sad attempt to try to hide this fact. <br /> <br /> All the sheep seem to like it, though.
