Fulci experiments with Sci Fi and fails. As a rule, in his horror films, are not we still get a large sum wedge, but not here. It brings a very funny scenes like when prisinors forced to stay at the bar for 12 minutes, and when they fall they electecuted. and the guy falls and has some kind of a fit on the floor for two minutes, while his friends, who are struggling to stay in any case, raise it off the floor. The city is the obvious model, but not bad. and the end of the explosion at best ridiculous. And do not get me started on the awful fight scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
