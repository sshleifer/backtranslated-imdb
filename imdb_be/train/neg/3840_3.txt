I heard about this movie some time ago from a friend, and she recently received her on the DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we both heard that it was a terrible film, really terrible. How disappointed I was ?? VERY !!!! In addition, the same scene (we all know which bit) nothing happened !!! I expected to see a woman in black a few times and for her to make a few more nervous scenes as appear in the window or walk around the room or something. <br /> <br /> Almost all of the reviews here say that scary, gripping, atmospheric film it. I just did not see it, I'm afraid. Maybe there is a difference in what people believe, it is terrible to the US to here in the UK. <br /> <br /> The big let down after all the hyped reviews :(
