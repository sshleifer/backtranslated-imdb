I completely forgot about this movie until now. It was the most brazen and worst attempts to demonize a hobby that I have ever seen. This message seems to be: "No young people use their imagination, they can take the game seriously, go crazy and hurt people." I can only guess that this unimaginative works of authors believed that the D & D game is a form of evil style ritual or secret worship.
