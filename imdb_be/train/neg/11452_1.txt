If I could rate this movie on 0 I would! I see that some ppl at IMDb says it's the funniest movie of the year, etc. etc. I'm sorry? you snorting LSD or public procurement ........? There is absolutely nothing funny in this movie N O T H I N G! I really want my 27 minutes back into my life that I spent watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I read someone sitting on a plane to watch this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes, I fully realize that I actually have not slept for snakes on a plane to 2 times more, instead of watching this film one time! <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie, do something more useful in their lives doing the dishes, walking the dog, damn ... anything better than to spend time watching TV in front of a hot rod.
