I'm a big fan of the Spaghetti Western genre, and I used too, as most of them are cheaper. Infamous director Fidan Demophilus of Constantinople, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, trashiest, and, well, less contribution to the genre. Plots Fidani films were usually very weak, and because his talent was very limited, he usually tried to sell movies, adding the famous Spaghetti Western names like "Django" with "Sartana" to the title. I'm a special case, "SMI La Testa ... Hombre» 1971, he simply took the title of Sergio Leone "SMI La Testa» (aka "Duck You Sucker»), and added «Hombre». The film can be found under different names ( "A Handful Of Death», «Western Story» ...), I personally bought it under the title "Goodbye Companeros", which this film shares with other Fidani film with almost the same cast, "Per Una Piena Di Dollari bar ", which also has the right to« Adios Companeros "in the version in German. <br /> <br /> plot is rather weak, he basically stands guy named Macho Callahan (Jeff Cameron) and his participation in two opposing gangs led by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). <br /> <br /> The leading performance Geoff Cameron, kindly said he was not very convincing. None I have not found Jack Betts very well as "Butch Cassidy". Legend B-movie, Gordon Mitchell, however, is always worth a try, and although it was probably not a very good actor, I have always found his performance in the spaghetti westerns pretty funny and original, and it actually saved some of Fidani films (. such as pretty lousy "Django and Sartana ... Showdown in the West») <br /> <br /> There is a very funny and original thing "SMI La Testa ... Hombre» - a great Klaus Kinski plays a priest! I could imagine Kinski in any role, but before watching this film, I would never have guessed that someone would cast him as a priest. Kinski, again great, though it has only a little screen time, and one scene where he breaks up the fight, probably the only good scene in that. Another great thing about this film is that the legendary director and the king made a song Joe DAmato cinematography. <br /> <br /> «SMI La Testa ... Hombre» is cheap, cheesy movie, but nonetheless it has some funny moments. As a Spaghetti Western enthusiast, I found it interesting to watch, but if it is not, do not mind the film or watch it only with the purpose of seeing Kinski plays a priest. 3/10
