Good shot horribly wasted it's slower than molasses and haphazardly indulged comedy. Peter Ustinov is trying here to bring something to life, but the result is an unshakable hole that passes all the right beats, which might make it watchable. Despite the favorable comments here, this film is terrible. Poorly aimed. Bad changes. Bad acting. Poorly written. You have to sit through a hundred films to meet one's bad. <br /> <br /> confused and painfully backward plot concerns Ustinov to cheat their way into the American insurance company to break their computer and assign millions of pounds, as he has done for claudication and authority (he was just studying their computer skills, seemingly all night reading some pamphlets and deceives computer expert Robert Morley in going to South America and the theft of his identity). <br /> <br /> as a side portion Ustinov romances fellow loner Maggie Smith, who just happens to be his secretary accidentally after he gets an apartment in her house. She ends up sharing the stage with sexy shades with Newhart, who do not go nowhere, while Ustinov is vaccination money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead in Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he marries Smith and they fly to Brazil, which has become the main product of chord in almost every British caper comedy ever since (Sisters on the run? A Fish Called Wanda?) <br /> <br /> unexpected twist ending more ridiculous than all that was before. Until the end I thought that I must be really off my rocker to stick nonsense like this. Even episodic Cesar Romero not help. One of the most unfunny, poorly past "comedy" I've ever seen, and definitely the worst capers. Do not waste your time. If you like it, you should see the best films.
