Do not get me wrong, I love action and click vengeance, I have seen many of them since I was a child, including Dolph Lundgren in the latest Â«The Mechanics", which is very good. And Tony Scott, of course, know how to use the camera, and can even be a genius shooting and editing films. <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and even more than "the Domino"), Scott shows that instead of using his shooting 'genius' skills wisely, he uses his puposelessly, to show and compensate for the lack of substance, his stuff does not offer him. "Man-fire" is close to 2 hours and half, when it actually had to be at least one hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott shot and edited the film also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit in his film, because his constant movement of the camera and the flash is really a torture for the eyes and makes you want to leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes it. <br /> <br /> from time to time where the MPAA and the studios have a questionable relationship with respect to the ratings, the violence and the adoption of a PG-13 movie, I think, too, I suspect that the film made $ 70 million from the B-movie script with a character which cuts the fingers, put the bomb in the ass and a man blowing his hand man with a gun, all that to avenge the death of a little girl who is not even dead! Go figure it out, why the studio will be the best scenario for language or violence ... It says ...
