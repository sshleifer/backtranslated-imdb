Ugh. I thought it strange that their ancient book on curses was done using a common script font instead of handwriting. Act so apathetic and sometimes overly dramatic way at other times. Why «demonico» kill two suspiciously quiet physicians who helped make him immortal? Just for the heck is this? And is it really necessary to show a motorcycle Lilith whenever it somewhere. We get it! You've spent a bit of money to rent some third crotch rocket speed. This does not mean that you have to show him all the time! Lair "Faith" looks like an old school set of Battlestar Galactica with some recent changes in minutes. There's a scene where we meet with a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they die for no apparent reason and without value. All this idle character. Forget the characters and even more forgettable story make this one of the most ill-conceived films that I've seen come out of SciFi Channel. Stay away if you're not in bad movies.
