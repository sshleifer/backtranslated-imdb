This film was rather a disappointment. After a very slow, very intense (and quite bloody), since the film starts to lose it. Too much plot leaves too little time for explanations, and coming out of the theater, I was wondering what that was all. Symbols are fine, the story is not convincing at all, most of them without a hint of deja vu material parodies, and there are some very cheese pieces ... Like, young police officers have to do to dig up the body. Of course, the night and the rain, and he must do it alone ... yawn! Or evils being a "Nazi" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, this is really original. There are some good bits, though as a fist fight scenes, views of the mountains and some of them (running) gags, but (at Reno and Vincent Cassel to do what they are), which is certainly not worth it.
