The plot does not offer any new unrest, he even begins just as the cube I. At this time no other improvements to cube machines, because the auxiliary output, which is not protected, very witty, except. The characters are not as good as the details in the first episode, they simply become "flat," as in a soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone makes it to the normal output, the person will be asked a few questions, like "Do you believe in God?", it is not very creative or original, and especially in my opinion, it does not fit into the secret cube it picks up. In fact, there is nothing special to say about it.
