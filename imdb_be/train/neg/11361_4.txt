It's pretty surreal that these flies can do ... well ... it's a cartoon, so anything can happen in this. <br /> <br /> First, I must tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is not nothing but a list of shortcomings: <br /> <br /> 1) I have quoted tag line. It is said that this film has a great 3D-effects. Well, I did not see any, at least not anything special, I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) "flies" in this film do not look like real flies. At the very least, they might have to make them black. But turquoise flying, seriously? With giant heads and thin-chested? <br /> <br /> 3) history. I believe that it was written for a 6-year-olds. I could say it in two sentences is so much more simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "They are American files after all," Oh, give me a break.
