I have no idea what it was filmed on but you can say for sure that they did not have any budget. Bad action, a terrible film, and a lame story and some decent special effects entirely make a good film. Style cinemtography WWF will make you cry ... where a tripod? In Filmakers it aims high, but sorely missed their mark.
