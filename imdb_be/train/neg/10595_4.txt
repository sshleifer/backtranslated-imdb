I'm sorry for Jean, after such a good original film followed perhaps his worst film of his career is. This film was beaten terribly awful job of acting Goldbeg (Romeo), and regardless of the fact that the computers had a name. In addition, some scenes may be just a little unnesicary. Indeed, the bad film.
