This film has a core of a really good story. The work of men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the northern part of the Pacific Ocean, is the heroes and legends of material. This film is a good story to muck trmisya endings (none is satisfactory), a pair of unnecessary and senseless bar fights and two alleged "romantic" relationships, which have the same number of non-working fire spark. Rescue scene great - even if the generation of a computer and a fake scenario is quite unrealistic - but the background is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his arm action (look at it). Ashton Kutcher is flat, but not terrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. Best female of one of the sailors, coast guard rescue center, and it is in the camera for about two minutes in the entire film. This could be a great movie - and Costner needs one!
