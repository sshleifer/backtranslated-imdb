Virgin chosen to marry a rich guy. The rich man urinates. A woman loves a sailor on the boat. Sailor urinating. Virgin visits the gross-out dinner of the commune. Man urinating on the dining table. Boatwoman doing a striptease for little boys. Man pretending to be a child urinates. There is an underlying theme here. Makavejev is trying to say that he pi $$ clipping in the world. To say that this amazing film is an understatement. In order to justify the title, there is a scene where Laure, who barely spoke ten lines of the entire film, bathed in chocolate syrup. This scene is really sweet, but the rest of the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth when one does not happen to share fetishes director.
