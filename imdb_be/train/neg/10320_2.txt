I was really hoping that it would be funny show, considering all the hype and clever preview clips. And talk about the hype, I even heard an interview with the creator of the show on the BBC World Today. - a show that is broadcast around the world <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show is not even close to delivery, all jokes are obvious - the kind that sounds funny the first time you hear them, but after that it seems inaccurate - and they do not give any new treatment or spin. All the characters are one-dimensional. Actions - good - mediocre (I have to be good). This is a classic recipe for CBC. - one that always fails <br /> <br /> If you are a Muslim, I think you have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you are white, you are probably a little offended by the fact that almost all the white characters are displayed as either a bigoted, ignorant, or both. Not something to make fun of white people is a problem - most of the best comedies are rooted in this. This is only a problem if it's not funny. - in the show <br /> <br /> Canada bursting with funny people - so much that we have been exporting them to Hollywood on a regular basis. Since the producer of the show could not find any?
