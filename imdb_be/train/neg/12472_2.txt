Imagine what the American national anthem in the cartoon. Add a pair of cute animals, some awful puns and a pair of roller skates and you find yourself with an almost exact copy of the film <br /> <br /> I remember when I was younger. I made my mother to remove it from the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not so bad, it's just that all Marxists to look, of course, have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> If you do not like America you do not like this movie.
