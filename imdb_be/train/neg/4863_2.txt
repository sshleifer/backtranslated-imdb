Why oh why did not just stick to the action of its point of sale? Everything in the movie, young and old, there to see what they say animal humor, and while they did, we were all happy ... And then, as with Lost In Space, came two killer blows - the plot and mood. Who really cared what happened to the tiger, or Eddie Murphy did with your daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
