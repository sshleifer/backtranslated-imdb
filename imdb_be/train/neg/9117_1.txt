... or maybe it is just that bad. The site is a cheap rehash of the first, it was strange, because he has to be a prequel rather than a sequel. Pretty much the entire movie seems cheap remake of the first, with the stage imitating what happened in the first place, only much more ridiculous and improbable. Where the first one was a big shot, this one is made up of B-list actors and rejects. It operates mainly terribly bad. Half of good lines in the film comes directly from the first, since almost all of the main characters, including those that were not in the first movie. I understand that this has been done before the pilot episode of the series, but that's no excuse. They should not have to turn the (bad) shots in the film. Only one thing a little good, and it's erotic sequences. However, since this is not as good as those in the first, even this does not put him above the rating 1. If you have a chance to see it for free, and you are straight guy, he could be checked, if you want something erotic that it's not porn. If not, avoid at all costs. 1/10
