in the movie, this film felt like one of those after-school events, only the lower budget and lower than all else.i guess it was an inspiring movie of some, but it did not work me.yet some, it comes in preachy.it It has a very pale shades of Flash-dance, but so what? there is simply no excitement in the screening of the film dialogue, contrived and formulaic to death.of course, the whole movie feels like a bad 80-clich√©.the action has been less than stellar, though it has a lot to do with the fact that the actors were given (or in this case, nya) work with.on top of that is a poor choice of song, with a very bad lyrics.i uncomfortable for all actors involved.they all talented, but you can not tell from this is only movie.this my opinion of course, but I have to give the Flying AKA dream to believe in 1/10
