Marie Dressler carries this Depression-era drama about the gentle owner of the bank, which was recently shown on the time of their April Fools Comedy month. If you come with the expectation of a big laugh affectionately Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed, because this is really a very dark movie. It is also very badly done, surprisingly so, considering that came from MGM. bare bones cinematography Leonardo Smith strictly from the "adjust the camera and do not move it" school, often to the detriment of gypsum, which find themselves in the delivery line of the screen (it's like a frying pan and scan print before such exists!) or having their heads cut off. The film does not even have enrolled Directors, which underlies the imaginary nature of the production of fly by night. In general, it is unsatisfactory mess with Dressler often overly emoting and just this weird end of the drum to the bathroom shooting range to set it apart.
