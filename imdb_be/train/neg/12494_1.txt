There was nothing about this film, which I liked. It was so obviously a low budget with poor lighting and camera work (much like Blair Witch Project, only it was not to be that way). There was not really a lot of the story, and the film is merely a drug further. I actually quickly crossed the last 1/3 of the movie, but it did not help matters much. It seems that it may be well out of the box, but I must say once again: nothing about not even like this movie is good. No good actors, special effects were so fake, camera work was terrible, and the dialogue was painfully terrible. On my personal level, I give this film 0 out of 10. Yikes!
