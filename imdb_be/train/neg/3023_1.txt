It is rare that I came across this film is terrible, it's annoying, and it's annoying. This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot, if it does not stain the intricate and aimlessly over the ostentatious editing, ridiculously. Why Domino has become such a badass tough bitch? Because her goldfish died when she was a child, and it is "traumatic" event left her emotionally stunted, and hate everybody. If dialogue is not a generic or trivial, it is littered with ridiculous lines such as: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... poor ... and everyone else." In a moment of hunters have some guy tied at the back of their bus, which has a combined number of tattoos on his arm. Because of the confusing mobile phone call, rather than roll his sleeves and simply read the numbers, they blow off his hand with a gun. Elsewhere, the bounty hunters to take the bomb to the meeting organized by the mafia and threatened to set off a bomb when the mafia would not let them go? It is clear that is not going to the meeting would be too easy. <br /> <br /> Knightley lame and terribly miscast. Mickey Rourke does manage to save some confidence from this disorder. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed some of the previous Tony Scott film, True Romance to be alone, but all I could think of suffering it's stupid, it should be made a complete idiot.
