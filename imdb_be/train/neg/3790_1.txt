I really do not comment, but wanted to make sure to warn people away from this film. This is an unfinished film student, with no redeeming features at all. At the technical level, it is absolutely amateur - constant hopping unintended changes within the scene, rewriting wildly away, etc. Plot completely patterned, ridiculous structure and operation is inconvenient. I do not want to be too hard: I've done my share of student films, and they were all terrible, but there is no reason for this film to be in the world where innocent fans should see it <br. /> <br /> The safe assumption is that - yes the same as gypsum - positive comments filmmakers, friends and family.
