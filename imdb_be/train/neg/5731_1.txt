I watched the unrated version of the film and realized about 30 minutes with him, I'd never get my time back. I persevered to the end in the hope that the dialogue will be improved, martial arts will look realistic in the end, the special FX will actually looks special. I was so wrong. I love horror movies, I am full of blood hound. I enumerate some of the eighties splatter clicks among the great world cinema. This, however, was not done in the eighties, when the film was released in the early eighties, a fax can be forgiven for looking so bad. It was not that he did not receive this protection. Dialogue scary with so many bad lines I wincing in writing, not fidgeting on torture. I do not like Hostel, never I thought that it was a higher ranking, more bloated, and I do not feel anything for the main characters, but it shines like a beacon to greatness next to the trash. On the back cover for the live feed of the promised turn you would never see the parish, I am still waiting Twist that was promised.
