What a shame! I tested this with the hope that it will be Unsolved James Garner stone and that it turned out to be a bitch! Product quality was good, but the story was undoubtedly the lame, and I can honestly say that I have only a couple of hours, much older and dumber today. The film does not have life-saving qualities and if this kind of thing constantly comes out, it will give a bad name Hallmark. For those of you who insist on knowing what it was about, it's about nothing, and in this case, it is not a good thing. We are subjected to watching an old angry woman, which is one of the most stupid creatures ever to roam the earth, which occurs in a marriage with a real lover, who is probably the only person who could put up with it. She pulls it through one mess after another, getting it into one embarrassment after another, and be proud of yourself all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief that was! Not worth the time it takes to watch it, so do yourself a favor and skip this, you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad it really is.
