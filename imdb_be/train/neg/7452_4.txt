For me, this film just seemed to fall on his face. The main problem for me was the casting Glover as a serial killer. I do not know, it grows with type casting, or just their behavior, but I doubt that Glover could portray a convincing villain. He's a good guy, and it's always evident in his performances. In addition, the film of your ordinary serial killer stories. Nothing very innovative.
