Confused mess from start to finish. As talked about Beatles'songs, it had a secret message when you play back LP. If one had the patience to watch these films a scene from the end to start, you would get away with the same degree of frustration. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this psychedelic Hodge fatties memories and false starts, clear characters were patrons of the film, out of revenge, when the film did not get sorted. There was nothing like any of these two. Replays, shouts and threats were brought to comics fashion. I think that was one-dimensional exaggeration. <br /> <br /> So, perhaps artsy types roll their eyes revel in the fact that, unlike them, we plebeians just do not get it. Well, I'm afraid there was nothing to get. And two cardinal sins of any bad movie made from start to finish. Non-existent and the pathetic story line, if you want to call it, and worse, no sign that cared for in the least.
