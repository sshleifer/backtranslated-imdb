I just finished watching this movie and WOW it was bad. In fact, the only thing that kept watching me, it was so monumentally bad it was kind of interesting. The action of the characters gay, hyper-dramatic way they get to the shots, their incredibly bad acting (there were bad guys all simply dragged from the street, or they were actually actors?) To extremely poor supply lines, their inexplicable actions (if you going to try and shoot someone through the doorway as they come in, it is obvious that you need to do is to shoot directly at the door handle !!). This film should break down some of the worst records for written and delivered lines <br /> <br /> The work chamber was also very bad. - one can hardly see what is happening in the fight due to switching angles and perspiration <br. /> <br /> I would have voted '1' except that I do as Chiba and friend Sue Shihomi, and I entertained a couple of scenes: 1) violation of the hands of the villain, so the bone is pulled out of the skin (it should hurt) 2) thief in law drugs eat brown-furred animals (monkey ??) hacking away at the carcass with a meat cleaver 3) Sonny Chiba performing some impromptu eye surgery on a guy with his fingers. <, Br /> <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sonny Chib, but this one is really not worth it any time. I saw about 7 or 8 of his films and came to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching (and they are great!) Is a series of Street Fighter and The Killing Machine. I also heard the executioner and Golgo 13 good. I recommend sticking with those.
