Although I have to review the film about two years, I remember exactly what made my mind as low as it did. Falling in love with the original Little Mermaid, and how it will get the mermaid as a child can be, I decided that I take the time to sit down and watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If you do not have the original director and actors on hand ... you just want to get yelled example. <br /> <br /> In the future, our story begins with a little more old Ariel and her daughter, Melody. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the crew were singing. Yes, I understand that Disney large number of singing and dancing, but really, that's what made my favorite Erik Prince. He was calm, collected, and a gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did. NO. SING. <br /> <br /> And then the villain. Oh, how could we forget the shiver that ran down our vertebrates, when Ursula stealthily on the screen, how Ariel and viewers around the world? Unfortunately, this gene was not accepted by her seemingly useless sister, Morgana. Nothing was ever, ever spoke of Morgan in the first film; it just pops up out of nowhere, trying to steal a baby. Oh, how cute. Younger sister checked, and, instead of going after the trident, decides to steal the month-old baby. Gag me. <br /> <br /> In addition to the planar nature of originality without feeling it, Morgana was a very unorthodox. The same plan, as well as her sister, the same henchmen (which, incidentally, does not scare anybody. I was three years old on my lap when I watched this movie, and it hysterically laughing.) She had no sense of being there; I would like to see the mother of the villain. I'm sure she would have done better than Little Miss silence there. <br /> <br /> King Triton took none of the respect he has earned in my first film, and do not even get me started on Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a strict but loving father in the first film, and secondly, it's almost like he has lost his will to throw fear into the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once comic, who did all laughing at him Â«DINGLE bunker" (yes, I admit it, I call my fork Hopper Hollow, time from time to time thereafter). In this film, Scuttle is all but forgotten. Supporting character, even in the first, he at least said something to the film. It was others are not rich with flavor, and in the future, they are all but stripped of it completely. Sebastian was still the same, but twice is a concern, as in the past. Disney does not do it. Do not try to mess with our favorite crab. Or our favorite little fat fish, which becomes a dad and has a lot of very annoying children. It is thick, and it is soft, and it looks like it's going to flat line any other. <br /> <br /> Penguin and Walrus were not needed, and after a while, you just start to resent all. Especially Melody, who do not have the depth of her at all. <br /> <br /> And one of these days, Disney, I'm talking out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I did not love the original so much.
