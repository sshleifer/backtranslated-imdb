Seriously, what the hell is this movie about just silly ,, ,, I would give it a 0, 1 ,,, but "terrible" is the lowest you can go ,, seriously, this movie is not worth watching ,, a waste of time, I do not know what the hell happened to you guys voted this movie 7 of 10 ,, I seriously can make a better film than this, recruit other unemployed ,, 'n I'll make a promise the film better than it ,, this movie was so bad ,, I'll never watch a movie starring Steve Carrel again, the bottom line is do not take the time to upload it to the network or rent it ,, I would assign this film the worst movie of the century, I mean the worst thing that has to give, but after that it is the second
