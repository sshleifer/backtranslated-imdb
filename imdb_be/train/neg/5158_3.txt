Sometimes that does something strange and modern does not always work for the benefit of everyone. Although I admit that set design and concept of the film was quite interesting, the implementation of these ideas in a congruent history simply did not work. This movie was so outrageously slow and pointless, even Robin Williams can save this garbage. It's a dream obviously Barry Levinson fell on his face, but he had to warn the rest of the world about this slop.
