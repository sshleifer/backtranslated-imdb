When I first took this movie, I was intrigued by the main idea and want to see what happens. I am a supporter of animation and love it when he successfully merged with live action footage. However, the animation in this film was all that I enjoyed. Although I must say that the actors performances were excellent. Visual appearance - including animation - gave surprisingly unnerving air to the part. However, this quality is embarrassment was lost among the bloated images, both visual and script that you were almost clogged the head. The most irritating about this story was the relative lack of importance. It seemed that the plot was shoe-horned in irregular intervals which give stuttering effect that diminishes the massive flow of parts. In a voice-over by Felisberto - especially the one at the end - really feels like a desperate attempt to fill a gaping hole in the plot, which was ignored in favor of the side issues, such as the whole ant thing (and even that was not properly taken into account) . I'm afraid that all part across as, at best, a "reasonable first attempt", the teenager, who has spent too much time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from experienced filmmakers in general.
