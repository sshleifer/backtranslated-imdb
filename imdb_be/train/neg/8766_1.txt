I have to put out a warning to all that the film is not worth watching. It is not a tribute to such a wonderful way that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect was terrible, I did not expect a complete failure on the part of the director to appreciate the military equipment. Like a machine gun, which is usually fired at a rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1 / 10th the speed? As soldiers can fall forward when the grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive if there is artillery shells fell as close as 20 feet? As the shells fall only on either side of the road, not the road itself? <br /> <br /> This is not only disrespectful to arms shake me, it was formulaic situations and dialogues incompatibility that I cry blue murder. Were common dialogs like Ye Bhi Kisi ki hai Bhai, ISE laath mat Mara and Pakistan currently jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan ​​me Haya and the cross LOC rug bark you Mera hukum Haya. Blunt, to say the least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De wrote exactly. The director worked without a script, and it shows. There is no flow in the movies. There is no gradual progress from one battle to another. This is just one skirmish after another without connecting to the general scheme of the war. Intelligent scene badly. Army Chief of Staff looks unconvincing. On top of theater people indiscriminately cut frames to fit four hour film in 3 hours.
