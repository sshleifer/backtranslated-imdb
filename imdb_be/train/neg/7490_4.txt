This film was disappointing. It was incomplete and dull. While Alec Baldwin tried to show himself as a perfect and fair prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film never showed any of the defenders or tried to challenge the audience to date considerable debate on how the country can manage down so horrible way. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one wants to defend the point of view of the Nazis, but it's a point of Nuremberg Trails! Four hours of just bashing on the Nazis .... c'mon! That's already been done! <br /> <br /> I really think Alec Baldwin should just follow in order to be a husband. <br /> <br /> Basinger in immediately after the movie ended, TNT showed one thousand nine hundred fifty-nine film Trail in Nuremberg, this film is far superior.
