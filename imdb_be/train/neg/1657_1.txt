This film is worth five blows to my Â«Hurter card". I saw it at the time, stationed in Virginia in the mid 70s. I saw him alone, that I should not be distracted, as I watched it. It sucks. It was a funny thing, the total number of celluloid waste I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know others who reviewed this film would have thought that it was strange. I offer you this: if it was so amazing that it would take the cash? End of discussion.
