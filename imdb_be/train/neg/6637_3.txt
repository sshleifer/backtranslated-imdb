They should have called this film ... Blonde women who needed to have their roots dyed. In addition, the protagonist, Geeze, it too tight sweater. Giggling. I thought the guy did a good job, though. I continue to hope that we will find a good 8 stars Christmas movie to watch this week. Dart throwing. If you would laugh about it, too. We still have more than 3 on the DVR, to see, maybe we'll get lucky. Oh yes, I understand, the guy pretty quickly and nailed it when he took the flowers, and then drove with his cousin. I told my daughter that they were on their way to the cemetery. And how stupid it was that the two girls followed them there to spy on them? Intimidating.
