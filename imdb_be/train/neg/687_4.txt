I'm a big fan of McMurray and Carole Lombard. And, in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (very nice actor) was in this film ... so why do not particularly like it! Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest and most written sample "A picture" I have ever seen. Given the talent and the money spent to make this film, it is shocking how to slip shod letter was. I knew that the film would be tedious if from time to time in the beginning of the film, I found that the prediction is EXACTLY what will happen next - and I was always right! And it's not because I'm some kind of "film scholar," but because almost no imagination and effort is not included in it. In fact, it almost seemed as if the film was just a long string of cliches strung all! Also, I found it a bit annoying that Fred mistreated Karol so bad throughout the film, and yet, it is true, to the Convention, she ran to him in the end. Uggh! There is still uncertainty in the film Lassie ( "he will bring people to rescue those or is it hanging from a rope break?"). <br /> <br /> Despite the very, very tired and clich√©d script, there were several positives about the film. It was pretty cool to see Fred Lush look frustrated at the end of the film - it was quite plausible, and he looked like he had not eaten, shaved or slept in days. In addition, the "chatter" Charles Butterworth did give some mildly funny moments. But all this was simply not enough to make the film look different than "in the film." It's a shame ... this could be a lot better.
