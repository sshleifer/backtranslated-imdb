Like most festivals records Hamiltons makes for an interesting movie that's all ideas and little implementation. While impressive for him is clearly a low budget film varies in its final turn and becomes a terribly long time, he pulled out and the obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of monstrous outcasts, who are trying to survive after the parents died there. They kidnap people, pour out the blood on them, and feed a locked basement. There are some good cryptically humorous speech by Mckellhar and Firgens, and the rest just so. The film never feels realistic or very disturbing in this regard. But in the first half of knocks in a surprisingly humorous and dark mixture, which is an amazing achievement. The next half is not as successful as it is in the film receeds oblivion with surreal twists in ridiculously daring finale, which turns the whole movie shit. It's a shame, but there is no doubt that a talent has been associated with this product, and although deeply flawed is original and creative. Too bad that when it comes to delivering it completely fails on every level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
