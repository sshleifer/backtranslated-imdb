Well, I just ordered it on my pay-per-view at home, because I was bored and need to laugh. I must admit that I laugh a few times, but I do not even remember what parts they were. I do not understand why this film was made. He argues that in a comedy, but seriousuly, I do not think singing penis, or a naked 70-year-old woman, very funny. This film is trying to fit themselves into the "gross-out" comedy of recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it just failed miserably. That was the way to the big gross-out, it was a comedy. Also, why on earth and Cameron Diaz to attach her name to this film?!?! The only thing that I liked was in the movie, when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and nice and well done. In addition, in order to avoid this movie. 3/10
