I saw this movie for several reasons, the main of which Mira Sorvino. With her on the cast, it can not be that bad. And it is even thought that it was some kind of mystery and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time, and he was very good at `UnfaithfulÂ». The story is set in Spain, so it may be exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses <br /> <br /> If you are thinking about the same thing, let me warn you :. It's really horrible, uninteresting, boring film. The only definition that comes to mind is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The story contrived with the sub-sites that do not add anything to the story. They're trying to build a chopper / thriller with views of fascism in Spain, but is unable to awful. Rotations have no confidence and so-called investigation leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> Symbols paper thin! I do not care about anyone. Moreover, they are annoying and rather evil men. <br /> <br /> Effective brutal. World, what happened to you? Why the World? You are the winner of an Oscar! Keep some dignity! Her character was weak, but that is no reason for such a terrible performance. She seems to be sleepwalking all movie long. Let's think about it, I actually think I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes. I used to think that this woman was sexy. Well, she's not here. If you want to look at some of the skin to try Romy and Michelle, because there's nothing to see here. And this emphasis? Oh my God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez worse. It's too painful to remember his performance, to describe it here. I'm sorry, but I can not. Ive suffered enough with this rubbish. <br /> <br /> All of this film is depressing! It is so bad in all respects, it's amazing how it was even done. Lousy team to produce a disgusting scenario and make some money on his actor's name. Do not fall for it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it! <br /> <br />
