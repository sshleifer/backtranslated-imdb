Released in 1965, but it is clear shot years earlier, it is a little inept crime melodrama with some inept front sexploitation. As usual for the Grindhouse era clicks, there are a fair amount of dressing and undressing without cause augmented lousy music, annoying and inconvenient editing stories. Cafe scene lays the foundation agonizing as we grind back and forth between the characters, to avoid actually see them speak their lines. All we get are reaction shots to the voice off-screen character! 50s rather vague Ayers stripes on its French-cut panties a couple times before the action is triggered. It is always accompanied by the fact that, apparently stock music from the romantic to the west on the mother-is-the-dishes, mixed randomly to produce, among other things, the most exciting lighting a cigarette ever captured on film. See how he introduces it! Watch as he gets on the match! Will he breathes, or he will be captured by the Apaches? Only time will tell !! The film tells the grim story about how Sally gets the wrong way to work in a brothel, falls for doping, and can not escape. For some reason, we were treated to some of the most tedious and boring whores ever committed to film, literally making nails or knitting and not to entertain clients. Some tremendously lame comedy (screwy lady accidentally drinking milk! Harry Har di!) And the silent film the action is not helping. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, even on something amazing video of the tent. It's really more curiosity film for anyone interested in the history of cinema - a very bad movie.
