I tried to watch this so-called comedy, but it's very difficult to sustain. This is bad, close, clich√©-ridden movie. Definitely not funny, but it is very sad and annoying, actually. Bad script, bad acting. It's a waste of time - and remains nothing more to say, I'm afraid <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points ..
