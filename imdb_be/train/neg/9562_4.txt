I think it might have been a decent film, and some of its parts in order ... but overall this B movie. The same about the story, the details of the procedure, but it does have a few holes and strangeness that did not quite add up. Acting mainly in the manner I've seen worse than this, too. :) <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the level sets, with cars, management in the desert, which makes the "cool", but completely unnecessary jumping through some small dunes (in slow motion! Cool!), As well as the drivers never seen sand before ... it gets a little better there, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you are going to rent it, get another one, too, and use it as a warm-up. Keep your expectations low, and it can work for you.
