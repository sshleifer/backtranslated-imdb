Just had to write that one liner, but it really is. I love the gangster genre, and this is the weakest record I've seen in recent years. My compliments to all involved in most aspects, but the most important scenario. This is a weak story about a petty criminal. No amount of fine-grained actions or black-and-white film style can not compensate for the complete lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey, and I heard that he was going to make another film about the whole. My advice, do not waste your time.
