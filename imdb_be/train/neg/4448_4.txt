What a strong start of the film, when Julia Roberts character punched in the face and her abusive husband anal plays Patrick Bergin, and I felt ready to experience the powerful film on the same level as Farrah Fawcett in The Burning Bed. Well, as they say in summary, I was wrong lead. This movie was not like the burning bed, which had the power and Tara played the role of a woman, you really feel for, and felt her pain and her need to survive. In bed with the enemy fell asleep after the first act in a cheap thrill with Roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in Iowa. Her husband first suggested that she was dead, but begins to grow suspicious that she might still be alive and goes after her. The rest of the film is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia to get a house in this small town in Iowa and change her personality .... there is no mention, of course, she got the money for it, but at this point in the film I did not care about all that much. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice fainthearted) and falls on it, and her husband, finally catching up with her, but not before he again organizes its cans and kitchen rectified. This, I believe, to provide a cheap thrill the audience. But I did not care much if she was abused by his wife, because the film, as I have said changed audience. If there was a course I'd felt for her and her situation. Of course, my husband was killed, and all is well for a small Alla Ms Roberts. If only the real world is nothing close to it .... Watch the burning bed, and you realize that the movie is suppose to be similar to the topic of domestic violence.
