Vampires Vs. Zombies entirely original name. It was really ... <br /> <br /> Nastya Semi-Lesbian Vampires and two zombies getting hit by car: special guest appearance by Bob lesbian Gypsie-witch and her dog, Random A woman with special powers and the Catholic school girl short skirt zombie choir. <br /> <br /> In addition, on the box: Warning: None. only area writer and director understand the end, or anything else in this movie <br /> <br /> But seriously, I love bad films, I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I even enjoy lesbians. This film combined all three with a vague and confusing (or nonexistent) story, terrible (I mean really BAD) dialogue, and random things, and people who have nothing to do with anything (or they ... I do not I did know what was happening in the world). Oh, and I can not forget the green oatmeal «Zombies» latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap they could not even cover their hands Zombies in oatmeal and paint). In any case, the result is painfully BAD movie, if you could even call it that. <br /> <br /> It was the end should have no meaning? The vampire was actually a nurse and the other girl was really mentally ill? Where were the Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where they were all vampires ... you really could not call any of the vampire girls. Anything. <br /> <br /> Do not ever rent or buy the movie. If you are really interested in ... well, I understand. Seriously, even fans of bad movies will not be able to stand it. It should be number one on the bottom 100.
