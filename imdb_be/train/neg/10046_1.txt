I was not very impressed with the 1st season offering Dante's "Homecoming", it was not so much a horror story, and reasonable political statement with the undead. Screwfly situation history virus unleashed in the world that makes a man a sexual attraction to replace the murderous tendencies towards women. The episode begins okay with a short film explaining how the screw fly was murdered scientists. Then there is a short scene where a man was arrested when the female body is discovered in his home. I believe that it is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak, but it remains unclear, because it will never come back. Episode additions are for a while introducing characters blah blah.It seems cool and mysterious, but the episode the stars to get worse and worse, because it does not heel forward until it boring and unsatisfactory end. Worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.
