I do not understand how these animated films do not continue to go out, and no matter how good (or bad) they are people like him. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5,7). They love almost all animated (like most of the people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I'm looking forward to see the film with its superb cast. To be honest I was bored silly. It was incredibly predictable and simply unfunny. There were a few laughs throughout the film, and that was it. Of course, they tried again and again to get a cheap laugh, but simply do not work. My son is almost always tells me that he wants to DVD after we see an animated film, but not on this. My daughter fell asleep halfway through. In addition, the children thought that the animation of the character looked strange. I have not heard that they have since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm not one of those who are looking for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and, like so many animated films, they throw out there, it is very small.
