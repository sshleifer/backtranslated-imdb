Awful! Absolutely horrible! No plot, no sense, no end. It seems that the director turned the camera, and then the whole crew went to lunch. Every day. I try to give the video away, but no one will take. I'm giving it a 2 instead of 1, because I like Benigni. Roger, I want to say thumbs down on this one. <br /> <br />
