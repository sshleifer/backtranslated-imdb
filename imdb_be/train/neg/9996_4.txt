Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson some improvements, "Airport '77" is not much better than the "Airport one thousand nine hundred seventy-five": slick, commercial garbage flooding (this time literally!) A decent shot. Jack Lemmon is packed airliner pilot that gets captured by art thieves and accidents at sea (all publicly claimed that it was about the Bermuda Triangle, but there is no mention of this in the film). When rescue ships come to raise the plane out of the water, we can see all of their taps is reduced (and blindly) into the ocean, and it's hard not to laugh (representing cranes driving the aircraft, passengers and swampy scenario). NBC used in the air, seemingly "director's cut" of at least one hour of additional footage - mostly retrospective - is injected into the case with all the subtlety of an episode "Gilligan's Island." The most exciting moment of the crash, and some players have some fun: Lee Grant disgusting drunk, Brenda Vaccaro no-frills flight attendants, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland flirting elderly people. However, interpersonal conflicts and painful military parts eventually to tear your patience. ** from ****
