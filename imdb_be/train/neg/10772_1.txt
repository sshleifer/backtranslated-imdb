The sad part of this is the fact that those 87 minutes, I will never go back. I knew it was terrible from the get go, the guy dressed like a crazy Indian chief on top of the roof. (See if they can get away with it in 2008). My 10-year-old boy is really in baseball right now, so we decided to take it on a rainy day. Despite the fact that he seemed to be enjoying her part, I had to pervert when I heard all the unnecessary foul. Bad, bad movie. It was horrible robbery bad news bears. Completely shameless and totally predictable. I am not against the film predictable, if it is done well, but this one absolutely was not.
