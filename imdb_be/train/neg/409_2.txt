<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed on this one. He began to make fun of themselves. Once again we have a film that includes sex and violence, immorality, leering at women and many attitiude conversations between the characters and dollying pans. <br /> <br /> It's all for nothing. Because they will not have any action at all in this film. He fudges all his set-pieces. All the actors give the kind of performances form a film Verhoeven. In other words, binge acting on almost every level. Starship Troopers went with him because he was such a MIM world populated by characters. This scientists operate in the same manner. Sorry Paul, but the soldiers and scientists are not really made of the same mindset. <br /> <br /> One big flaw in the story that after his escape to this one night to do evil Bacon character, then returns to the science lab, where we have already spent more than enough time watching the animated manniquens (Elisabeth Shue released) to walk and talk. Why not show the magnitude of what the character can do in the outside world. They can track him if he could be anywhere at all ??? Consider running all the different things that could be done with this concept, both in terms of the history and characteristics. Then take a look at what makes this movie, and you really like a poorly done and concieved the whole project really is. <br /> <br /> For more insulting it is Doco on DVD, where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of mad genius. Well, one of the two is not that bad. <br /> <br /> This film has nothing remarkable about it. Just as the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
