I enjoyed the movie very much, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It does not contain violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and does not need them one bit, holding my attention all the time with visuals, stories, and mixed up the words of wisdom <br /> <br /> However :. [1] some of the foreign-language accents made dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] there is an unnecessary abuse of abuse (especially the F-word, which is the only reason this film was rated R). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion that keeps you throughout the film, except for the final decision last minutes unpleasant due to exaggerated long dysfunctional reaction to the loss of some of the characters, who lives in the depths of sorrow and depression too long. [4] I will not recommend this movie for 5 seconds narrative background that will not add one bit to the side of the character it is used, or film - it just turned me off to the movie and stuck in my mind throughout the film, and then mother of the protagonist of German origin, while watching old WWII movies, "secretly root for the Germans." There will be "local flavor" or art, when the Nazis had won the war. I do not know any Germans today, in addition to the radical skinheads who think that the world would be better if it won the Second World War the Nazis.
