In more than 70 years watching movies, this should be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Myers and some others have done some very bad comedy, this, however, the absolute bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This is unfunny from the opening to attack the scene during the credits. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, which I usually like, must have needed her salary bad. She desperately needs to relearn their skills. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is), needs a director, to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is also not its role. <br /> <br /> Mike White has to find a different character, he did it the same type of person a few times too many. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard, which began a year ago as a first-rate actor, are not as good as it used to be. <br /> <br /> There's nothing decent I can say at this attempt at comedy movie. <br /> <br /> ratings: * (4) shows the 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (of 10)
