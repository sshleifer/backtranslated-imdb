...... in a horror movie, that is. Well first of all, let's start with Keith. Its main goals include getting laid by George Clooney, look good and last but not least, all screwing more. Gotta love it. She had about 3 surprisingly good chance to finish this Sicko, but ..... instead she ran. I mean, she does not want to bring a Guy in 10 minutes, and when she did it was too late. I mean, the guy was trying to rape her. I can not get into those movies where the protagonist is a sad idiot. I mean, who would honestly sympathy for the guy who finishes it all meet at night. The film went on to go further. And as a result it has lost its credibility.
