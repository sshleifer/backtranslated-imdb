I give this film, because it is really a terrible movie. The sound track of the DVD is so bad that actually hurts the ear. But the vision, no matter how inconsistent, really shows something really fancy in Italian society. I will not go into the details of what actually was so shocking, but different incidents are absolutely normal. Thus, for a value break, I give him one.Otherwise, video, photography, acting actor adult / actresses simply low-quality, hands-jock for people who love foreign movies.Roberto, the protagonist, has a full range of emotions but exaggerated to the point being unbelievable.however, the children in the movie mainly 3/4 years, and they are genuine, and the film gives an idea of ​​Italian life ..
