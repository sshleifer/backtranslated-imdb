This film has its share of negative comments and I have to agree with those who believe that one of the worst movies ever. However, most of the films based on King works pretty bad, but this one goes beyond bad to hit. There is not a scary moment in it, except for the stupidity terrible. This is a typical garbage King - Myths are twisted around, that does not make sense in the first place, mixed with obvious and thrashed so-called "discouraged" that are as shocking as the Playhouse Peewee (that is at least entertaining). It is full of funny moments, not the least of which is the character of Alice Krige in. If it goes on the rampage and starts quipping as the villain in the old Batman TV show, it is so stupid as to be nauseating. All the people who cameos in this (including John Landis) lucky, they still have a career. But the most absurd part must be before the end of the cat suits that look like a cheap rubber clothes who bought at K-showcase. The best part of the movie is the emergence of some real cats, which are in fact of existing people in the film.
