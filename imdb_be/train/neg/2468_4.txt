It was not so great. Not scary or hateful or anything, just forgotten. <br /> <br /> It was a kind of, um, half-hearted, diluted air, he never knew what is right, whether he wants to go for a laugh or sweets or satire. Thus, we are left with a weak connection three. The actors seemed to have lost their native. <br /> <br /> In addition, the ideas were very tired and reworked almost Zombified themselves. How many more times do we have to be told 50s banal sense of conformity have been infected in the United States? And it was immortalized aggressive consumerism? And that emotional suppression in men is baaaaad things? Old hat. <br /> <br /> His worst crime in my eyes, even though it was just how detached from reality it was. I know that it was a comedy, and everything, but - especially in high-grade movie where you have to keep the interest of the audience for a long time - you still need some kind of an emotional anchor, some Relatable guide to the story, to make it part, to "hero" child look old, two fellow students and, ultimately, his father dies before the pain in zombie hands or that and for him to greet it all with a happy smile and a shrug, then I just struggle to deal with this in a positive way. Mom was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhumanly at this level, then you run the risk of losing me, and that's what happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of this kind of apple pie suburb and it took him quite well, it was a beautiful film, especially some of them are widely tipped to the outside, and inside the Robinson house . In addition, the opening newsreel was cute, in an already did before but still not funny kind of way. <br /> <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly was in order, and that comes from someone who is not a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I just fear it's going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene, but he played it pretty low key for him and probably left the most sympathetic character in the entire film. <br /> <br /> in general, is not great, though.
