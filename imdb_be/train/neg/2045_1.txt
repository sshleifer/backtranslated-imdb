This film was the absolute worst film I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent The Zodiac (2007) and got this chance. I thought it was a joke to the actual film. it was horrible, I was waiting for him to get scared, and he never did. this film does not have the real facts of the real Zodiac. The filmmakers did not even bother to explicitly explore anything on the murder ... they just liked the name ... so they decided to write a script about nothing justifies its name. I'm upset, I do not understand that this is not the film it was earlier. I try once with each film, I do not hate movies ... ever ... but this. If you could not give it no stars, I would definitely have. 1 10.
