This film has one redeeming. At some point after the character is attacked with axes fairy brother asked him: "Why does your dick there, Chuck?" Having nearly an hour bad movie, it almost made my drink came out my nose. <br /> <br /> Some of the action is not so bad, but all the kids stink and PJ Soles should be ashamed of himself for this film. History is weak, and no one does what you think (or what common sense suggests) they should. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are a lot of plot points that do not belong. For example, in one scene ghosts of young children need to focus hard to move a physical object, so they can prove that they exist, severe exploit, since they apparently can not interact with physical matter. However, minutes later they all raise the industry from the ground and beat them with the Tooth Fairy. Apparently, sometimes they can move independently of and sometimes they can not. Go figure it out. <br /> <br /> A lot of blood and guts, though ... some good boobs. But that does not make up for deficiencies. <br /> <br /> If you want a film about the tooth fairy, go to the «Darkness Falls» rent. I think it's great, though many of the other reviewers do not share my opinion. At least, it sets the mood.
