I believe that there are some out there that remember Nicole Eggert with her little baby girl days on such television shows as T.J. Hooker, Charles in Charge, and Who's the Boss? You perverts, thank you! Maybe you remember her from Malibu, where she grew up and got breast implants. Regardless of whether you are, of course, forget about it in this supposed comedy about a man-eating aliens. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that do not make sense and never explained. How did she recognize a foreigner? Why is alien to hot paprika and cinnamon? Why is not alien to her to eat? You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Before the alien eats her friend and assumes his identity, you will get to see it in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to watch this garbage. Stay for a shower scene and the boyfriend, and go about your business.
