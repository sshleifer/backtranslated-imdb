This film was very boring. It should at least not more than 15 minutes. Images of children and animals killed was a little anxious. <br /> <br /> I do not usually write comments but this one was so bad with so many good and excellent comments. I think that in this case, we are one step closer to an honest assessment of this title. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? I fell asleep during the movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from the 8:00 long sleep period. I think that is the very point. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between the characters, except for maybe 2 proposals in the end. <br /> <br /> If you fall asleep just looking at it and not try to rewind to catch up, because you will fall asleep again.
