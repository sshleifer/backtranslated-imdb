After watching this movie, I felt an irresistible need to express my disappointment a bit. Selma Blair fabulous, currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was quite simply magical «Kill Me Later». History, while not entirely original, of course, has shown some promise. Nobody did not matter, though ... at all. <br /> <br /> I do not know what her deal, but the director Dana Lustig has almost no talent as a director general. She slowed the footage down, sped up shots up, Flashback, use awkward angles, use annoying color filters, made a million quick cuts, bounced back and forth in the terms and topped it all with an unpleasant "modern" soundtrack roaring stuff, I can not remember the last time I've seen such incompetent work of the director of the film. Her ego must be great to throw action and story line and put it front and center for the members of the audience to pay attention. He squeezed his throat. <br /> <br /> There are a few good scenes in «Kill Me Later», which show that could and should be. Unfortunately, just when all will begin to show promise, Ms. Lustig is digging in her purse out of film school tricks and piling up things again. It's a shame, because Blair and Beasley had good chemistry, and you could say that the film really had a good heart. 3/10
