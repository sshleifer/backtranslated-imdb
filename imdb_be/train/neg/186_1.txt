I do not know whether to laugh or cry at this distortion of the history of Canada, in particular, poor service caused by mounted police history in the Yukon. <br /> <br /> I leave it Pierre Berton, the historian, was born and raised in Dawson City, Yukon, and the author of the final stories of the Klondike gold rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express irritation with this silly movie: <br /> <br /> American idea of ​​freedom-loving boundaries subordinate individual heroes, armed with six guns, was continued in a faraway country, another story about a cowboy in the Wild west - Wyoming - this time driving his herd of cattle gold country. Painting nightmare geographical impossible, but the actual discrepancy is the basic assumption on which the plot is obtained ?? that there is only one mounted police in all Canadian Yukon during the gold rushes, and that he could not cope with the lawlessness. If James Stewart and Walter Brennan to limit Yukon cattle, customs booth is empty. <br /> <br /> «Where a constable? Brennan asked. <br /> <br /> "Up Pellet River. The problem with Chilkats, «someone answers. He is a real hard work that Constable. He patrols around ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he did not go home for two or three months at a time. "<br /> <br /> The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory during the gold rush was the closest to the police state of the British North America had ever seen . Northwest Mounted Police was in the territory in large numbers long before the Klondike strike. They controlled every route in the Yukon, and they do not allow stupidity. They collected customs duties, often cries for newcomers, made arbitrary laws in place at the river traffic, and turned people back if they do not have enough supplies, or if they just looked bad. In a truly Canadian fashion, they laid the moral laws of society. In Dawson strictly abide by the law of the Lord's Day; This offense is punishable by a fine, to cut your firewood on Sunday; plump and young women have been arrested for what is called a hard-faced police "does not give the risky performance in the theater," as a rule, no more than a hint of dancing on the stage in tights too open. <br /> <br /> In this community , gunbelt was unthinkable. One notorious bad man with tombstones, who tried to pack the gun on his hip was personally disarmed the young Constable, who had just thrown him out of the interior of a bad crime to talk too loud. bad man is gone, like a lamb, but protested when police to find he with the gun told him to pass it. "No one has so far not accepted the gun away from me," the American said. "Well, I'll take it," said the constable gently and did so without any further resistance. So many revolvers were seized in Dawson, they were auctioned off by the police for just one dollar and buy as souvenirs, to keep on the mantelpiece. <br /> <br /> in 1898 a great year crush, there was a serious crime ?? not to mention the murder ?? in Dawson. Contrast with the Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless city in the submission soap Smith, Denver trust people, was excellent. But in a distant country Dawson considered as a community without law, a character with soap Smith Skagway ?? he called Gannon in the picture ?? It can be easily controlled. (In real life, one of Smith's men, who had tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and frogmarched back again mounted police sergeant). <br /> <br /> {film} lone Mountie said, "Yes I am the law. I represent the law in the Yukon Territory. About fifty thousand square miles of this. »<br /> <br />« Then why are there more of you? »<br /> <br />« Because this desert yesterday. we do not expect that you pour in by the thousands. Now that you are here, we will protect you. »<br /> <br />" When? "<br /> <br />" There will be a post established here in Dawson at the beginning of May. «<br /> < br /> »what is going on until May? you're going to be here to keep order?" <br /> <br /> "Part-time" <br /> <br /> "but what about the rest of the time?" < br /> <br /> »Take Yourselves good man. Swear him. Let him act as marshal ??" <br /> <br /> in Mountie leaves the film and is not back in the frame. His strange proposal ?? that the American city marshal, complete with a tin star, to be sworn in citizens groups living under British jurisprudence ?? accepted. Naturally, they want to Jimmy Stewart conductor; He clearly fits part. But Stewart plays the role of Loner, looking after number one, and so one person is chosen to get a shot. And he does it. Other shot. Even Walter Brennan gets shot. Stewart finally comes to the conclusion that it is reluctant to have to finish all the shooting with some shots of his. He tacked on a tin star, and he is a bully, Gannon, a distant explosion alone in the western inevitable climax. <br /> <br /> To anyone with a concomitant knowledge of the Canadian north, the bald retelling the story goes rational belief. <br /> <br /> ?? Excerpt from Hollywood Canada Pierre Berton, 1975.
