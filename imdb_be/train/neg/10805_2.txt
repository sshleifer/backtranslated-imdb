The only reason why I DVRd this film because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq is currently playing basketball for us and 2. I have always heard how terrible it was. The film did not disappoint. The best part was Shaq outfits in. The worst part was, well, just about everything else. My 12 year old son and I just meandered and could not look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why Max did not want Kazzam, to fix this front tooth it! But all this is terrible, we just could not stop watching it, the story sucked you, like a black hole or a swimmer or a tar pit, it was a dream. But it's worth it for a laugh and just say that we actually watched «Kazzam».
