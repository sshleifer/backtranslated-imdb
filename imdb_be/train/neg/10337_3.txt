Man ending of this movie so scary unwatchable and dated, that my whole class of film aesthetics laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the film was good. This was somewhat unintentionally funny scenes, but had some real good pictures, or editing the camera. Yes Alderich is a great director, who made the Flight of the Phoenix, and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane among others. The problem is not with the direction, action or anything technical. The film is simply destroyed in the third act. Why? These murders, and the vicissitudes of the characters were all revolve around the nuclear material? What the devil was the writer to smoke when he came up with this? How it just comes out of nowhere, perhaps, was the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about the planet Burton Monkeys, The Life of David Gale or Notorious, I think this is the worst ending ever. That summed up.
