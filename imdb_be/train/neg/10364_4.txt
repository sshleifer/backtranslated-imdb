The book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-TV movie will move you, but how it diverges more and more from the book, taking out all the religion and love and mathematics, and to put in a cotton candy dies, it becomes boring. However, from the comments I've heard people who have not read the book, as a rule, like, and if it results in even a child to read the fold in time, it served its purpose. The most uncomfortable middle ground to make a change clone Mary Poppins Uncle Albert (I love to laugh). Nothing is quite so squirm inducing as symbols on the screen fun laughing at things that are completely unfunny.
