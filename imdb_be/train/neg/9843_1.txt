Only Robert De Niro movie that I really hate. Stupid movie with horrible acting (of course, not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma has to do their mafia movies, as always, like Scarface (1983) and The Untouchables (1987). I also loved the Mission Impossible De Palma (1996). De Niro worked with the palm of two different times also, greeting and wedding. I, however, that the wedding party was okay too (I have not looked Hello). <br /> <br /> The script is really bad and unfunny. There are not any scene where I can smile even once. The film lost the chance to be funny, even a little style in Â«Be Black baby" stage, and I do not like the scene where there was penis guy. Thus, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen! Only worse. I hate it.
