I have seen 7.5 IMDb rating on this film, and on the grounds that he had decided to watch this movie, which filmed my roommate. She said that she had seen him before. "It's funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw him, "she gushed. Maybe compared to other Bollywood films deserves it 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other films I've seen in my life, it deserves no more than 3. Any movie where I can not stop thinking that will happen next is not good for me. The characters are incredibly, as the act is not realistic at all, and their motives are unnatural. It is a more dramatic and the songs are not so great. My biggest problem with Bollywood cinema is the lack of grace. All emotions are too exaggerated, and therefore, it is not realistic. Any emotion or relationship between the characters, that is the least bit subtle to be increased to an unnecessary song. I think I realized that the relationship between father and son was more like the one between friends than the one between father and child, without having to he handed over five minutes long song. Silly comic complete with laugh track is not funny or necessary (we get it, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed). If the movie is trying to cause tears through the most hackneyed means possible he just does not make sense, just a little uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> ***** ***** SPOILER <br /> <br /> in general, if someone has a terminal stage of lung cancer of their son, who lives with them will know that something is not yes, there will be mentioned. Too many plot holes count. At first the film was funny and cute in the way Bollywood films for people who do not watch them, that voraciously, but it's just exhausting. It takes a lot of skill to make a film that is funny and desperate, and the best way to do this, as a rule, does not have all the fun parts in the first half of the film, and all of the desperate end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Maybe it was a little more depth than in other films of Bollywood, which I have seen, but not much at all. I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the film than the parts that were supposed to be funny. I did not shed a single tear, and I do not feel that it is, rather, I was struck by the feeling of disgust when trying the dramatic denouement. I do not recommend this film if you want to see something good, I recommend that if you want to watch a movie of Bollywood, which is kind of sad.
