one of the worst movies I've seen so far. Pathetic scene of action and a really bad game does not help. The only good point of the Busey, but it does not remove the film very much. it lives up to its B rating and film passes the test with flying colors. Waste of my money, but I found interesting to start with his bored after a few hours. I do not recommend this movie if do not watch it for free or for a gift. (Gift you can ask for a receipt and send it back for a full refund). <br /> <br /> In fact, bad. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
