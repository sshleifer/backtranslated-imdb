This film is one of the most wildly distorted images of history. Horribly imprecise, this film does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, English, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved workers that sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built "on the bodies of the white man," as the head of a Japanese engineer. It is shocking that such unimaginable horrors committed by the Japanese invaders are the source of the film, where the bridge itself, not even close up to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What of those who survived are still alive today? They hate this film, and what he should represent. Their members are starved, tortured and murdered cruel sadists. Those who did not die from dysantry, hunger or sickness are deeply affected by the film, which makes this light their dark times.
