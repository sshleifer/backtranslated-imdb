I watched the movie «The Flock» because of the casting Gere and Danes, and because the story synopsis sounds interesting. It was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen some of the turkey.) I have never posted on the Internet before, but this movie was so horrible, I had to do it. I believe that the problems begin start with a script that was so amateurish that it's incredible. History has zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it nauseating. Poor Gil, he deserves far better. As for Gere / Danes to match the screen, due to the terrible letter, do not believe any one character for one minute. I bet he could Gere wants to redeem the negative, such a thing is possible. It's a shame to see talent wasted so badly, not to mention I would get my 2 hour ago. (I know what you're thinking. How do I feel?)
