In contrast to "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai" or "Big Trouble in Little China" or "Conan the Barbarian", which are horrific movies that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into a cult sensation, a Golden Child bad. <br /> <br /> room itself is not dysfunctional, and there are some funny moments. But here Eddy Murphy Â«flip attitude" simply blows away any sense of tension or danger in the history. And the special effects stupid enough to do more damage to that tension. The "mystical secrets" Tibetan Buddhism ridiculed, and do not seek to coerce. <br /> <br /> Without the feeling that something on the map, or that the characters face real danger, why should we care? <, Br /> <br /> Who should see this movie: <br /> <br /> - big fans of Eddie Murphy, who can not help themselves <br /> <br /> - I can not think of anyone another <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke, which worked.
