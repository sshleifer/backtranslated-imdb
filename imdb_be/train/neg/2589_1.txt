For those with little time on their hands, I sum it up quickly, in a word ... shabby. There are many good examples of why this film is perfectly suited for this description. So much so that you can only get through the 2 minutes of screen time, not seeing something completely stupid and pointless imposed on you. Want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason it seems so pointless, though, that this really sets the tone for the rest of this part of the juvenile crap. You can almost look into the crazy mind of 12-year-old boys, who wrote this piece of garbage, just watching this shit, they expect the public to actually pay for !! ?? !!! <br /> <br /> I've watched a lot of declination movie franchise for many years, but American Pie; hostel should be one of the worst offenders, given that, in spite of the average character of the original film, it is still a thousand times funnier than this dreck. <br /> <br /> plot is predictable and sometimes you really feel like you're watching a school play. Things that happen in this movie, so unreal that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief actually watch (we are talking at the suspension of Star Wars, as a species, you need to convince yourself Jerash really) <br /> <br /> plot paper thin and mostly events that evaporates is only there to show another pair of breasts or install another pathetic joke. There's no acting talent to speak, all that you get a bunch of handsome guys who are trying to make us laugh. And ooh, they fail !!!! Each gag falls flat and the only thing I was laughing as socially not know the writers, it seems. How else can you explain the bulls ** t they try to pass off a story? <br /> <br /> They are held every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertaining in favor of poorly written, the lowest common denominator is nonsense. Characters must complete a certain number of tasks before they are accepted as members of the hostel, but it is considered generally very short series of assembly, who believe that they complete the task, but we can see, there is little evidence of it actually happening. Its a very lazy way to tell a story. He also misses the opportunity to be funny in this. (Imagine say, The Wizard of Oz, where all the important events taking place off-screen and not on it, and all that we see Dorothy and the Scarecrow high fiving every now and again, saying, "Gee, that sure was a great adventure we have only recently been ") lazy. lazy. lazy !!!! <br /> <br /> heroines has little or nothing to say. All they do is undress without any reason, and are used in as a visual props through most of the film. you braindeads, that only look for T & A, will not be disappointed, but for this reason shame on you. If you buy it on DVD, you will contribute to the society falling in its own special way. Congratulations.
