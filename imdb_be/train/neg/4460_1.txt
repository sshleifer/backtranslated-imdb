Horrific! Avoid like the plague. I would rate it in the top 10 worst films ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. apparently made by students day care ... Wait, I have seen the program better than this. It opens like a soft porn show with blurred nude woman doing a shower scene, the port from there. Good nude scenes, but it is. Sound and lighting problems were constant throughout the film. Sometimes I swear I could hear the roar of the engine chamber. YIKES! I would like to see another movie on this story, but made by different people. This batch of actors and crew members need more acting and film-making lessons. Votes 1 of 10.
