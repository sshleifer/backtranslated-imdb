The film is about a young man, Michael, who is caring for the elderly. One day, he decides to kill some of the relatives of their clients. Around the same time he decided to model it after the murder of the Zodiac 60s. He comes into contact with the author of a book about the Zodiac, and they form a friendship. As Michael has a gun (Aparently a single gun, as it seems to be in the hands of some other actors, not only portrayed as the same gun.) And he goes on-kills. Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like B movies. I thought that the idea of ​​the film was good, but editing and effects really drowned plot. I thought that the "blood" was too fake, the lighting was terrible in some places, and the dialogue was too standard. The film was shot on video, which is good, but editing the movie just made for some amazing «Plan 9" scenes. Not a bad movie for fans of B-movies of the genre, but if you want something with a bit more Polish, move on to something else.
