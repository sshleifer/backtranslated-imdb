Very, very humdrum movie fare here with Stella Stevens takes instructions from someone in disguise (it does not take long to figure out who it was) in the old town of Nevada outside of Las Vegas for the money robbery in the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads her girl gang of three people, and they learn that they must act much more quickly than anticipated. Despite some nice looks at Las Vegas in the 70s, while the average is very credible acting from the most active part, and a portion of the line with a potential Las Vegas woman is one big boring egg. It seems like forever for the film, to push into the mechanism, and if he does it just sprays here and there, and never speeds. I was somewhat disappointed with this film. Of course, I was not expecting anything great, but I, at least, thought it might be one of those neat exploitation films from the '70s or something like that. Not even close. Nobody dies. There is limping skirmish between creaky Stuart Whitman and officious George DiCenzo, one year before its grand performances as a prosecutor Bugliosa in Helter Skelter. Shootout has all the suspense watch the waterfall. There is a one hit and one hit the head with a blunt instrument. In addition, nothing in the action plan. As for the girls, do not expect much there. Stella and her little girl (both very mediocre still pretty talent get in the sauna and bath. What do we see? Nothing but a fleeting side profile. The Stella wears these beautiful open blouse emphasizing their true talent, but I want it to be a little more open with its performance. so I could write one thing that would have to recommend this film. Unfortunately, it was not to be, and I have little to say in favor of this movie. it's not a terrible film, in any case, he just did not have anything to be the same for him. pazya Hanne.
