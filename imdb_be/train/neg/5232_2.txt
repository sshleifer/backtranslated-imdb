Becky Harris plays the female buyer, whose misfortune is to be in the store at the time and, obviously, the only goal is to be in this film to show due to wear remotes! Miss Harris, it seems to me that she fifties or older, when she first came on the scene. Once the bully is red it becomes apparent that this is not the queen of AARP. If this is not one of the best assets ever appear on celluloid, I want someone to prompt me. Absolutely breathtaking, in my opinion, and I literally wore a VHS copy of capturing her charms. I would like to know if this film is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is not really worth mentioning. I was expecting something pretty convincing and clever, but I was disappointed on both counts. God Bless Becky Harris!
