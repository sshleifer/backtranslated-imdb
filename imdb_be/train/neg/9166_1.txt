Recherche is a good word to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> For example, each movie has a point of sale, a trick. Transformers trick is strange effects and nostalgia fan boys. Sleepless in Seattle trick situational in their tag line, "What if someone you never met, someone you never saw, who never knew, only someone for you?" Many romance depend largely these tricks and some by big names draw. Leap year run both by Irish folklore as fact and showing significantly well-known names in the country. <br /> <br /> So now that the audience in the cinema, in addition to all the usual elements of the characters, the conflict and the effects of the crisis, and to allow isolation, they also look forward to stimulate dialogue, more absorbing situations as a result of leap years, interesting sub- plots and perhaps to a certain extent, a good turn in the middle or towards the end of the story, which contributes to the circumstances of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is what Jean Yeo is trying to reach. When they tried, their goal was, apparently, in the other court, on the other stadium, at the other end of the planet. She and her author, Alain Layrac, completely unable to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most of the lines were unnatural. It seems that they have a bag with lines that she wanted to use in his film, "Well, this is a string and quotes that I've heard or read or movies I have ever seen or books that I have read before and they all sound good for me. If they sound good to me, they would sound good to the audience. So all I have to do is collect them all together. I will use them all. " The result is a laxative. I can not say that the lines were not necessary, and have no relation to the story or in motion at the site, but they do not seem to appear from nowhere, caught you off guard with this Quotable quotes. <br /> <br /> on a personal level, I know people who cite the quote based on the majority of cases our dialogue, trying to make it meaningful for myself nodding along. I do not go with them anymore, because the desire to break their enormous. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the characters you see stupid and one-dimensional. Except in unnatural dialogue implying their motivation (necessary for driving portion), there was no point in their belief. I'm not who they are. They are all simpletons hitters lines from the column tips female oriented magazine. <br /> <br /> trick in leap years is not enough to drive the story, because circumstances are too small. Again, there are films with less, but doing better than that, does not exist. They did this with my first and second point. Moreover, these additional sites nonessential (not that it's bad for films) and thin (bad). <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo and producers try to pass a terrible story with fancy seats and a passable picture. This is because they probably realize that it is possible and it is easier to reach agreement on the part of some viewers than others with good use of cinematography, soundtrack and filming location. These non-discriminating viewers. <br /> <br /> This is not the kind of movie that is so bad it's good. It's just bad. Not even see.
