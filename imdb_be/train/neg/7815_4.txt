As a longtime fan of the Superman comic book, through a series of the 1950s, the first two of the films and Chris Reeves Lois and Clark, and finally, of Smallville, I * really * hoping for something reasonable with "Superman Returns." <, Br /> <br /> Instead, we got a Lex Luthor does * other * attempt to convert real estate, another Superman beat-up and worn-krypton sequence, and internal contradictions: he could not stop himself falling into the ocean when paused 6 "Krypton, but if Lois breaks 3" out of it, leaving the rest of * him * built-in, it can lift the continent * * space ?? In fact, the only character in the story was a partner Lois - I can not remember his name with his hands. He made all kinds of rescue, heroic things nothing but guts and skill. - no superpowers, Sun invulnerability ... just a normal person <br /> <br /> They continue to do so little Superman. Why can not we have the Superman fights Brainiac or a fight to save the universe from General Zod instead of small schemes Lex. Oh, I forgot ... they do it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yeah ... I think I'll stick of Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You should probably also ...
