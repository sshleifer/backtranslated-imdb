Painfully slow pace of the film, probably expresses the intention of the director to convey what life as a teenager growing up in rural China. However, I found that a combination of slow "plot" of the glacier and the overall shooting style so impersonal to be completely disposed of, in particular, to a Western audience. Sometimes I really had problems to speak some of the characters from each other, as they have been removed from this distance. Two hours later, and I was completely past caring. As someone who is not interested only in music, but also very much in the history and culture of China (and, incidentally, is no stranger to the Chinese cinema), I could not deal with one character, and found nothing to my teeth, it is a question If I did not like it, who on earth would want this? Give me a Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige let me. Give me a job just about any other Chinese director I have ever seen. This sorry effort simply can not be measured at all. I would be sorry to see the Chinese film judged against this test.
