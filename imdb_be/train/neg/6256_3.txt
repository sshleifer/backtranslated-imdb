Hmm ?? I agree with the reviewer who said that the "strange people with a generous taste was a review of this film." I thought the film was sufficiently intriguing to watch it. I think that first of all because of the Marsden and Speedman. - not the plot <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film is a bit psychologically tantalizing on the one hand, and deeply homophobic another. Not bad on the former and triple thumbs down on the latter. I'm not sure if the film is intended to promote dialogue and to spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was mediocre. A lot of talk, it was about 90 degrees obliquely reality. I still wanted to get some sense of the story, but it's ultimately just a conversation with a crazy person (Speedman). I feel a little sorry for him (Speedman) because of its losses, but not really. His loss is not more and certainly less than the losses suffered by each day all over the world more important reasons. <br /> <br /> Whether naive film about HIV / AIDS to expose? Yes: This is from the target audience. Is HIV a dark, mysterious, evil killer? What about his victims? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor its victims do not have any more or less malicious intent than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, cancer, or a victim, please. Just because this is a contagious disease, it does not make a very deliberate or negligent - or bad - it's just <br /> <br /> I take this excuse of ignorance or fool hardy risk.? - NO. If all people to practice safe sex? - YES. Whether safe sex to save the world? - NO. Is safer sex realistic in all cases of love and lust between hot and emotional people? ?? Of course not. What would the world we live in if everyone stuck to the rules, no one had ever ventured, and sex was never spontaneous and hot ??? Can I not paying attention that the transaction is a film with gay sex? ?? YES. HIV is spread through the exchange of blood or bodily fluids between infected and uninfected individuals. Gender is not necessary to transmit, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I'm always worried willful violence one person to another. I actually thought that the film does do a good job drawing absurd abduction Tom captive, and intentions with respect to Dan, and this kind of insane violence actually happens every day. <br /> <br /> The stream of consciousness notes the film :. That crazy <br /> <br /> Why not Deng to ask "why" you feel so rather than "what are you doing?" Manifestations: men who have sex with men get subtext "AIDS": HIV = AIDS where Tom responsibility in the sexual act? Why is it the responsibility of Dan to use a condom? "Maybe you slipped him before he got stuck in ??" What are we talking about here? It was one of the parties of the unconscious? "Maybe she did not want to hear the truth," You're joking, "She is in heaven and so incredibly painful that now she knows about me" ?? right ?? Is Dan's life more if he has HIV? Of course not! Is this why the whole world is so homophobic ???? They think that gays are the cause of HIV, that they will give it to the rest of the world, and we're all going to die ?? are you kidding me ??? Are people really so stupid to think that homosexuality is the reason ... is the problem ??? Do we feel that because of the victims of tuberculosis? malaria? I can see that Tom was hurt by the death of his wife, and he accuses him of AIDS, but seriously ?? who is to blame here? A victim or a virus? Whether the disease is really responsible for the sick? (Assuming that they did not seek and did not try to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Of course, safe sex is important for the safety of life, but not control, rather than flying, sun ostavlyaya- house nya-life. Do we really want to blame the disease on the victims? Whether safe sex between Tom and Dana prevented the final demise of the wife of Tom? Maybe, but it is not responsible. <br /> <br /> Tom Dan crazy. I have already said that <br /> <br /> Tom Dana. "Maybe you get what you deserve" ?? Come on! 24 days :. Violent, naive and homophobic <br /> <br /> Am I overreacting? Maybe. But I think that this film indicates referee finger on gay for their daring and malicious intent to "straight world" practicing unprotected sex, when the rate of homosexuals practicing safe sex is proportionally equivalent to or better than in heterosexuals. We all need to wake up and get serious about HIV / AIDS. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of Africans each year EXPRESS.
