Trying to capitalize on the success of Deal or No Deal and 1 in comparison with the 100 came this lame excuse for fun - Show Me The Money, which shimmy out of 12 sexual "dancers" in a shiny red clothes prostitutes. Member gives rise to phrases such as "Which team lost ..." with three options, A, B, or C, and everyone who completes the phrase. The participant has three chances to give an answer to one of these three options. The owner - William Shatner, in his obnoxious smarmiest - asks the contestant if he wants to "lock back" and if the participant says yes, he chooses the "dancer", to which he yells, "Show me the money" She opens! scroll, which has a volume, and if his answer was right, he adds that the amount of his winnings; when he was wrong, the amount is deducted. (Thus, in theory, possible rival in this sad fiasco actually wind up reasons Shatner money.) There is also a "Killer CardÂ» and when a participant chooses a girl who has this nasty scroll, but he answered correctly, nothing happens. When he answered incorrectly, the game enters Sudden Death, and should give an answer to another question. If he gets that one wrong, it goes with anything. <br /> <br /> Before you go to advertising, Shatner screams "let's dance" and Shatner, the participant and 12 dancers shake booty. At the end of the show, Shatner will ask for "Last Dance," and they shake it yet . More <br /> <br /> I give this show 6 episodes on a very large, at this time, I hope this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door (it could have been worse -. they could have somehow bribed Cuba Gooding Jr. to be the master, but I bet he's a better dancer than "shat", as they call it these days) <br /> <br /> 08/07: Guess what -. I was wrong! It lasted only five episodes. There is hope for the world.
