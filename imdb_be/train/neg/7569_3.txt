It certainly fits into the time period as the Axis and the Allies are playing spy games for most of North Africa and the rest of the world. This is not the best of the films, but certainly not the worst of the budget of the film, as described above with War Classics collection. <br /> <br /> Duncan «Cisco Kid» Renaldo was actually very well in one of his first feature film. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke (enrolled in Parkyarkarkus). Why he never got any big role for me. He played the perfect boyfriend as a partner / and save movie ... IMHO. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, this film was part of a package with budget Superbox-Mart called War Classics. Eight films for eight dollars, which included other had never heard of the movie, which has some decent star struggling to pay the bills. <br /> <br /> This scenario ... well, not so hot. Editing and cinematography ... worse. If you can avoid all this and want to see the future Cisco Kid & great sidekick who never, unfortunately, did not fulfill their true potential, of course, take it! Otherwise, there are other movies to watch WW2. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
