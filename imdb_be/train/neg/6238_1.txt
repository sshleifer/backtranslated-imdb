About the people, it's amazing how someone can claim to be a science of global warming, well, I think it's an elitist nonsense is now replaced by the science of eugenics! Al Gore is trying to make this question is difficult, even if it just needs to be common sense, to see the whole thing a great deception on the part of a man with his own agenda! Profitable <br /> <br /> As mentioned scientists estimated historical temperature this planet? Assessing the sun spot activity. No one has ever questioned, when this method was accurate? No, not even Gore himself! So how the hell would not be accurate to predict future temperatures with sun spot activity, when it was something that really last? According to Sun spot activity temperature today is completely in line with what it should be. Why in the universe the temperature rose (relatively) equal to many, both on the ground? Have our SUVs cause the temperature to rise on Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use common sense! You need not be a rocket scientist to understand that it can not be anything other than a hoax. Please examine yourself. That Al Gore and his elite friends like Rothschild (banking family, which is a hangout ground) to get out of this? Well, the new World Bank will be based on carbon credits, ie a tax on anything that gives CO2 omissions, and it is easier to get from these taxes, when people are tempted to think that this is to save the world when it is only about money, centralized management and more power elite bankers. Al Gore has even companies that sell carbon credits! Is it not a noble pay voluntary carbon credits to save the world, especially if it goes in your company? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to blindly believe me, please do your own research and use your own common sense, and I'm sure you've come to the right conclusion!
