Not much to say about it. The site you can pretty much peg in the first 10 minutes. Nothing too wrong with this film, very little action thriller. There was a chance to explore the nature of the emotions of the time. Is the action film genre right to do this, I'm still undecided. The sniper was one of the easiest films to watch, not giving full attention, as it was a few twists and a simple plot. I was probably to blame for that, as with the second and with close attention, could be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 of the 10's)
