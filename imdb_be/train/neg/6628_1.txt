If the scale has gone negative, I would be happier. Seeing Sno Sushmita was good, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and director, and any spoiled all the fun of the story. The choice of angles, the choice of lighting and well all be distracted by trying to remember that this story. Oh, songs and dances does not cause you to tear your ears with the head first. The film could be done in half an hour at 1.25, and it was very good, kind of like "The Seven Samurai", but the director and the writer did not go in that direction, even if the "citizens" to finally find their spine and want to help . This film will not work on so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - name any aspect of the film - it is bad - probably powered by a caterer was too bad. I never in my 6 years of watching Indian (Bollywood) movie saw something it badly done.
