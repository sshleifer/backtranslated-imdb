Everything about this movie was terrible. To start with this film was a very good shot, and I believe that it is impossible to make such a large cast into the biggest disaster for the gangster film genre ever. The sound track was, as one of the very bad slapstick comedy. He had this to music through the whole movie, and it started to get really annoying. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT ITSELF deal with this trouble YOU ONLY Hurt
