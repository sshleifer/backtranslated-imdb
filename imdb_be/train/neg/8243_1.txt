The word sums up the result d'oh;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home, they stopped at the store to get directions they hit a parked car breaking one headlight on it, they Flea scene in the fair out of trouble, but suddenly they they see each headlights coming up behind them (Oy). <br /> <br /> I ended with all the screaming, crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy man who lost it because of the headlights;), and the screaming and crying pretty much stay on throughout the film (very annoying) film shot with a cheap camera, trying to make it seem "real" or "shocking" I think it's just awkward and useless, though. In the absence of anything better to compare it with Â«Blair Witch style." <br /> <br /> screaming and crying for most of the movie with a shitty sound was over the top annoying, you just get a headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it was not terrible, just annoying a painful piece of shit movie.
