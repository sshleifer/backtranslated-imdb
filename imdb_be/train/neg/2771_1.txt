The film was shown here in Bangkok with all the pomp and even in the theater, she failed miserably. <br /> <br /> It seems that the author of the story just does not hold water. Something is definitely not enough. In my opinion, people should have a reason why they watch it, other than historical glimpse of the past. The accuracy of the history is not what we are looking for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> movie just lacks any substance. The only way to make this movie right was somehow to make changes, where it acts as a kind of legend, not just a story. And the legend will have certain elements that are trying to tell you something that people have forgotten in time, for example, the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. This is called the central theme. <br /> <br /> The film is not able to answer why I watch it anyway? <br /> <br /> at least some of the amazing legendary flying elephants, eccentric psychic king or the king, such as "King and I" would be wonderful, that would significantly added to the reference in the movie. I think that there was no treatment other than simple vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once you have received the request, the story of the next thing we have to focus on. In marketing terms, we call this a "must see". Hearing the name of the movie people would say, Oh, I have to see him. Now, where an appeal in the Kingmaker? Why not just repeat the name and call him, "How not to be a king?" And to make the black comedy of old Siamese days, "Dr. Streynzhlav" style. It would be much more interesting. Scenes such experience weaknesses king of the first persons roped off would have made the film very funny. <br /> <br /> Most of the films today have that 'must see' attraction, such as spider-Man, Men X, the names speak for themselves. If they do not know the characters, some other films, such as the island was an appeal by itself, when it asks advertising " Or do you still think that it is an island?. Â»<br /> <br /> or for the film," under the changed name is not to be the king "can ask the question," What do you still want to be king? " <br /> <br /> lousy
