Very disappointing movie. Sun until the end, I do not care for any of the characters. I enjoy the fact that Ving Reims in a very small part, and William H. Macy was good, as always, still not worth watching. It starts strong and gets weaker and weaker. Insomniacs like it, as I'm sure it will put them to sleep.
