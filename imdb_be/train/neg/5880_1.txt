The film starts slowly, when we got to the movie, we thought it looked pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we were bored out of our minds and wondering what movie we came to see, I do not like this film and would not recommend it to anyone, the best part of the night was when the alarm and the light returned, because the project failed, because we thought we could all go home. this should be one of the worst films I have ever seen, we were all bored with or minds, and most of the people in the film actually ran out of the door at the end, because it was so rubbish. I am surprised that no one came before it. if you go and see, make sure you have something to keep you busy, and even better not to go and see it at all.
