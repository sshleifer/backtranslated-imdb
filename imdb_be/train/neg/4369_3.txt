*** SPOILERS *** *** *** SPOILERS Juggernaut is a British production of "Thriller," released in US First National. Karloff Dr. Sartorius, who has to leave his studies because his funds dried up. Karloff forced to retreat to France and start a medical practice. He suggested using a cunning woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows that Karloff need money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees to the proposal, and soon became the personal physician husband. All this time the wife gallop through the city with a local playboy no good. Karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison, and he kicks. However, his son (from another marriage) comes a few days before the murder, and discovers that the will was changed. If he spills the beans to his wife, she flies into a rage and even biting the arm of his son. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the nurse Karloff already ridiculous hypo- Karloff used to kill the old man. If Karloff learns that he does not receive any money, he asks his wife to poison her son. Nurse suspects Karloff and you find necessary hypoglycemia. The analysis shows the poison, but not quite in time, like Karloff kidnaps a nurse. <br /> <br /> To make a long story short, the nurse flees, gets to the police, and manages to save his son, who is about to be introduced by Karloff. Karloff instead injects himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good points. Karloff owns and plays a kind of mad doctor he did in Devil Team and the man who came to life. This is common, however, to see that he walks around stiffly and slightly hunched. We will never know why it is that way. I suspect that the director thought it made it more sinister. <br /> <br /> The actress plays the wife of a 2-timing overacts something terrible. It has a French accent. Despite the fact that she overacts bad, you still manage to hate them (or maybe you hate her because of her actions ...). <br /> <br /> A little below average for Karloff vehicle. If you buy a copy of Sinister Cinema VHS, sound a bit choppy.
