The original Boogeyman was silly but entertaining supernatural slasher flick. It was not in any case a great film, but fun in the right mood. The third installment in the series, The Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, it's just awful. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifeless new footage. Secondly, many recycled bits from the first film. The new material is incredibly amateurish, but not entertaining inept way, just incredibly exhausting. These shots were apparently shot down quickly and without any effort. It serves as a framing device for endless clips with the first (and possibly second) films. And boy, they milked the clips from the earlier films; Sometimes reuse sequences again and again. The only new addition to these parts is a voice-over, which aimlessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of watching it really heady <br /> <br /> Return of the Boogeyman is an example of the worst kind of exploitation flick. the kind that exploits the audience in a very cynical way. I want to make this review short and to the point, because this film deserves no more. There's nothing here of value. It's no good.
