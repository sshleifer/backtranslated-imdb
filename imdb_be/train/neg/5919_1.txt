yesterday I was shooting this film and can hardly express its disappointment at the small of Laura Ingalls to be included in something so badly made. I'm not sure if it was awful bad writing or directing or both, but it leaves the viewer very disappointed in spending time to view this swill. It consisted of a weak naive storyline very poor lines, and rely solely on pretty scenery and beautiful people to sell it. Unfortunately, it was not enough. You would be better to remove the tape full of static, rather than spend time on this crap. Lindsey Wagner also played a rather pathetic role as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard, doing nothing, anyone who has ever been near a ranch knows it is obviously written by a young man from Los Angeles, and not someone with great knowledge of the world,
