I went to the cinema expecting to be completely silent. With such low expectations, any form of entertainment will be a pleasant surprise. The sound track was the best part of the film, but making fun of the stupidity that comes in single wards and funny. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there are many things about The Singles Ward, which were completely annoying. The entire film was poorly duplicated and made to watch their mouths, listening to their voices very annoying. This lack of professionalism was surpassed only in a cameo with the Mormon celebrities who do not have a business that act. <br /> <br /> This film will do well among Mormondom, especially in college communities where there is a singles ward. However, the conclusion does not give any hope for the poor loser rendered unmarried. (Only the beautiful girls in singles Ward married, fat, ugly there, but all ugly men) In the end, we realize that the whole film was a commercial LDSSingles.com
