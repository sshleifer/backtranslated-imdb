Something to sing about was promoted to Grand National studio where James Cagney worked at the time in accordance with a contract dispute with Warner Brothers. He made two films for that studio B, none of which rank high in the credits Cagney. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest losses in the movie is the fact that Jimmy Cagney and made several films that have used their superior ability to dance, the two that come to mind immediately appear Yankee Doodle Dandy and light-flooded Parade ramp. Two smaller films History of West Point, and never Steal Anything Small. Cagney himself said he never used to see something besides his musical resign. So why does he do so few of them? <br /> <br /> Well this one was wrong. The plot of Something to sing about problems with hoofer, who fronts for the group that discovered and this contract cinema. There are the usual complications artful studio boss and conniving press agent played, respectively, and a well-Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract requires idle point marriage, Cagney and girl band singer Lady Evelyn Dow married in secret. Then we get a complication of advertising initiatives novel studio with leading lady Mona Barry screen. I think you can see where this is going. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing is something to sing about is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. He's short dance at the beginning and end of the film, and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Dow had a good singing voice and charisma of a ham sandwich. She received musical numbers, such as they are. I am sure that film publicity paid for their tickets to see Cagney dance. <br /> <br /> In addition, the annex to giving him a few dance numbers of female dance partner would be good. He danced well with Ruby Keeler in the Parade and filled in the spotlight with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day in West Point story. It was not Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell and Ruby Keeler available? <br /> <br /> Sun catchy songs came of it. And DaW voice is the state as well. It has a soprano Jeanette MacDonald, who was so out of place in a swing band. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly Cagney went running back to Warner Brothers. But they had to give him some decent musicals.
