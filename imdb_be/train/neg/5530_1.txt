With the many problems associated with this film, the continuity of the worst; and again many years ago edit it on VHS for the cable channel college, I was trying to find out exactly what went wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually built a lot more film and then cut it to the standard theater viewing. How many more? to fill all the holes in the plot, as we will need about three hours the story and character development -. Especially considering the fact that the film we have, it's just so slow and takes itself just seriously <br /> <br /> It is staggering; which could in Halperins, may have tried to achieve here? Their last film, «White Zombie», was a successful low-budget attempt to duplicate the early monster movies Universal Studios (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and thus stayed pretty close to the zombie mythology that in North America will be aware of the popular magazines. <br /> <br /> zombie uprising, on the contrary, seems to have been conceived as a modern allegory of the war policy. This is not only to explain the discovery and the changing nature of Dean Jagger in megalomania, but it also explains why the zombies are not actually do in the film, except standing around, look scared, and wait for orders - they 're only allegorical soldiers, not undead eater we all come to love and hate in the zombie movies <br /> <br /> I have exactly any of my dislike for modern warfare and its policies. - but I think the movie should be entertaining first, and only then, can be informative. And, of course, - zombie movie should be about zombies <br /> <br /> In fact one of the most amazing films in Hollywood history, but not one I can recommend, even historical value ..
