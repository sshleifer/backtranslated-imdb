I do not know where to start. The cast is full of people who have never done anything before or after. Debralee Scott is shown on the cover of the box, but does not appear in the film at all. Compilation is very bad, even for college films. This is obviously a very low budget, with one scene in the sorority house, which has an extremely choppy editing <br /> <br /> The characters pretty typical for college films. - a timid man, a botanist, a suave black guy, tough guys, a guy with a mustache, attractive girl, a small town girl, etc. signs of the teacher that it was to be expected ... a stocky middle-aged guy who gets easily distracted. <br /> <br /> If you wan't to, to see college Flick, stay away from it. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
