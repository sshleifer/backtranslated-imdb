This film is worth watching if you enjoy marveling at the special effects. There are some nice visuals. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is typical of the nineties / aughties Hollywood fare glare without substance. True to the name. <br /> <br /> You should not choose the story apart. It's like doing surgery on the brain of a dinosaur. There's not much there to begin with. Nothing original and not very special. So do not go into the story at all. Just look at the consequences. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, it has received little cries in the end, the purity of the great breeding treat FX invisible (and sometimes half-hidden) person. However, if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics spectacle (no view). <br /> <br /> In general, this is a decent FX film is worth seeing for that purpose, and alone.
