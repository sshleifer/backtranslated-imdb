It was the worst movie I've seen in WorldFest and he also received the least amount of applause afterwards! I can only think that gets such recognition on the basis of the number of well-known actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals, but it is only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker much better than the actress part allowed. The rest is hard to judge, because the film is so funny and predictable. The main character totally unsympathetic and so boring to watch. There's no real emotional depth to the story. The film revolves around an actor who can not get a job feels very original to me. Nor does the development of the police. It feels like one of the many movies directly to video, I saw back in the 90s ... and not even a good friend in these standards. <br /> <br />
