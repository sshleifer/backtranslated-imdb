So sad. Even if it was removed from the film, I think it stinks a little more than a movie, like a lake of blood, There's Nothing Out There and. The music they play is the funniest stuff I've ever heard. I have a brother and sister in this film. They both did not try very hard to sound sarcastic when they say things like "My friends will be so jealous!" Hey, what's with the killer only to wear a mask in the beginning? Thats retarded! I almost ignored the second half of this. My favorite part of the movie sound effect, which they use when using ax murderer. Exactly the same sound for each chop!
