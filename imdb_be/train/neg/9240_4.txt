The idea to make a miniseries about the Berlin Airlift seemed to me, as one of the most interesting German (pasta) war films. This is a topic that has not been studied as yet. However, the creators of the series have thrust plate. It starts with the DVD cover of the film, which is a direct copy of the cover of "Pearl HarborÂ». <br /> <br /> Louise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) gets to hear that her husband, a doctor (Ulrich Noetus) died in Russia and after the war, she is struggling to survive. she finds a job at the US base, gets a job in a cool and high ranking officer (Hein Ferch) in town, falls in love with "m pregnant, and suddenly her husband is over. Come on! !! We have already seen this too often play a role Ferch Hein and Ulrich Noetus very well;. Bettina Zimmermann but no Collie really seem convincing. For some reason, it always seems that it is a little too late, giving the correct emotional response to the scene. It's just not working for me. <br /> <br /> The action scenes with the planes and the airlift, we sometimes exciting, more often not. disgusting things always seemed to happen with the same pilot <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of the world war II movie, I suggest you spend your money on something else :. Chocolate ice cream brings a lot more fun! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
