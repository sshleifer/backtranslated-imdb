Serum of a mad doctor who is a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases by force of reason. Instead, it creates a monster that must eat human flesh and brains. Mad Doctor creates some zombies from corpses and has some problems. There are very long lead in all the action scenes with many getting you acquainted with the characters. Nephew mad doctor gets in a car accident and the mad doctor is trying to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C with an OK movie action, but some of the issues that guide and some continuity errors. There is not a lot of zombie action in this one, and effects, while adequate, nothing special. You can fast forward through slow parts and enjoy the scene. Watch out for some nudity and profanity.
