My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you have seen the BBC's "Planet Earth," which I'm sure most of you have, then you are not going to like this movie too much. And I have all drives "Planet Earth," I saw the rating for this film is very high, and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I went to the theater and the film began, I saw that it was a Disney movie with production companies Auction BBC and Discovery. And when they began the first stage of a white bear, I learned them from my DVD's in house "Planet Earth." <br /> <br /> The film went on and on and on and on, my friends and I kept on the recognition of scenes were a "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed, because I think that 90% of the footage from «Planet Earth». I say 90% because some of the scenes I did not recognize. I have a feeling that I just can not remember them. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, this movie really is a compilation of different stories from different disks "Planet Earth", a story aimed at children. So, the story is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. If they show a polar bear coming from the mother's baby, the narrator says: "Polar bears no longer as a human child. They do not always listen to your mother "(I do not remember the exact words, but that's how it is) So in a nutshell. It condenses "Planet Earth" for the kids!
