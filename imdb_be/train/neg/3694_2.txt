This is not the worst Doubt Rajnikanth films ever. The first part is held in place with a solid comedy from Gaundamani, but gradually getting worse and worse, and quite illogical. Our hero also receives dig in holy with same name (Bab) through the template and completely lame one-liner. The first half has Rajni uttering his usual array oneliners and style, and in the second half, it becomes almost a saint after the beggar takes him through the interdimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babazhi (unknown Saints, he took a pin on previously) gives him special powers for no apparent reason ( except the stern). It really starts to get interesting now is not it? <br /> <br /> In the rest of the film of his to spend their magical deeds and strength and influence policy and associated with black magic. Usually predictable crap out of the implementation of fun. Oh, and black magic I never worked on our hero, because he just went to have a Param Vir ... uh .... Shakti Chakra with him. The bad guys and the usual cliched villains policies, overworked and in the end, quite insignificant to the story, which in itself does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> But, despite all the shortcomings, it was fun to pass the time with a yelling and Baba related acuity during public events. It is also interesting to watch other damn about this movie. AR Rahman is said to have composed songs for his film through a mobile phone. How important he thought. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan, and he turned on the two characters (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it. But, as they are drawn up, dressed and treatment is absolutely pathetic. Japanese can stop watching Rajni movies after watching this. This film was probably the promotional materials for Rajni in politics, but the results of the film would be killed by any of his political dreams. <br /> <br /> Fun, when you turn your brain off though.
