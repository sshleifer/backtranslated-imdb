I looked at the other comments and was thoroughly entertained, to find that it is clear the only people who actually worked on the film yet. I mean, I do not want to speak ill of amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and would like to comment, tone it down a bit. «Groundbreaking» bit over the top. This Boston-based production to a college that does not even reached the level of the majority of amateur college film. This is what you'd expect a bunch of kids to do. Stupid action movie without much creativity. It's pretty funny, if you're willing to mock him. Not that you will ever see, unless you are a student at Emerson College.
