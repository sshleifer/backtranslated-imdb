I am 47 years old, and I spent as much of my life, as I remember, a lover of horror and science fiction films. If they are silent, black and white, sun budget or large budget, there are very few of them that I can not find something to like about. That is, I'll give the film credit for good gore and creature effects, but that's all. This is the case of effects of history. True, we live in a time when there is very little left that have not seen in a horror movie. Therefor for the film of any kind, to really please, it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome the bad effects and a bad game, but a bad history with good action and good effects still a bad film. This film has not even good actions, only the good effect. So if you can not just gore, pass this one.
