The retired diplomat, played well, Michael York, travels to Russia to avenge Russian gangster who killed a police officer son of a diplomat. There diplomat meets exceptionally strong and decent Russian policeman who helps him lead a Russian mobster to justice. <br /> <br /> I thought of the old action flicks of the 1980s, which always reflect the Russian evil bad guys to blow up just the US government. It is interesting to look at this time Russian guy, a hero. <br /> <br /> Not a big flowlines, it really is typically «B» Flick action. Michael York gives a class of so mediocre film. Alexander Nevsky, who plays a Russian policeman like "L", but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor, he would have chemistry with whom he makes a scene with. Disappointingly, the beautiful Adrian Paul dies within the first 15 minutes of the film. Now that Adrian Paul was in the movie more, it would be above average «B» Flick action. All I can say about Paul Adrian that he is really a pleasure to watch for the first 15 minutes of the film. Villain, played by Richard Tyson, your typical bad guy. He is very bright and very sneaky in this film. <br /> <br /> Looking to rent a movie if there's nothing else on TV to watch. All right. It does not suck too bad. Scenes worthy. Actions could be better, the plot could have advanced much faster, but hey, you can see what Russia looks like today!
