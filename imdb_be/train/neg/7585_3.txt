I love to watch the early color films - You mean those 40s clothes were not all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this film. Her "eccentric" clothing is actually very attractive and so, it has an amazing figure hourglass. But I feel, and too much she gave her head. It is likely to have developed this feature for many performances, and no one told her, "If he gets a laugh, leave it," It's too much crazy fooling about when it should be surprisingly down to earth.. Joke Madame Arcati that mediums, usually depicted as a thin woman in a long draperies. Arcati behaves like a retired headmistress (We really put your back to it!). The contrast between her fresh, banal manner and her silly beliefs really did not bring. <br /> <br /> Just because all the actors are British (except Cummings), Americans believe that they should use the word "brit", "tough", "lip" and "upper". Oh, give it a rest! three main character loses its characters constantly and make a risky remark (or he loves you Yes, but very carefully - he was in the cavalry!).
