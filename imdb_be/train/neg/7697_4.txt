This mini-series is actually more interesting than some of the others with much larger budgets and grand aspirations. SOTD falls somewhere between "Kung Fu" and «H R Pufnstuff» on the entertainment spectrum. If it was not so long (about 3 hours), I think the kids would like it quite a bit. This is an adventure, action, "Cliffhanger scene", and not too much romance or other "unattractive" things. When you are young, you are not too critical bend the rubber balls, sweet action and scenes that are repeated. (At least two scenes are repeated equally in the film, just as it was done in the old-fashioned TV series to bring the audience up to speed.) Finally, the kids tend to be more susceptible American English dialogue comes from Asia lips of the actors. (not to mention the fact that some of the leading role played by non-Asian and tsory.) <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie three stars, but I felt like the director, producers and actors deserves some extra credit, at least, through the conduct of the project. This film is not art, but, as a picture of your house, it actually took some time, effort and discipline to get it done. <br /> <br /> as a whole, it is not recommended to use for its time, but it can keep children entertained while traveling in the minibus. <br /> <br /> Oh, yeah ... hey, IMDb! "Dialog" is preferred, and conventional writing. Your spell checker seems to think that the "dialogue" is the correct spelling. While the "dialogue" is acceptable, as the OED and Webster consider an alternative form.
