I found Horrorvision almost unwatchable. While only 70 minutes in length, I have found myself again and again by pressing the Forward button. The action was to `when I cry and say I have a lot of *** K intensively" school. And this story has been, at best, a scenario that has not yet been specified. <br /> <br /> While I never go to the full moon for a great film I've never seen them make as bad a piece of junk like this.
