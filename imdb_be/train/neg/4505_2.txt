Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully shot film, there is no doubt. And the action is usually excellent, at least from the standpoint of how it reflects the characters as they are scripted. <br /> <br /> However, as many parts large and small just _wrong_, it only bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully. A small detail that is typical view of the lack of sensitivity of the varieties of one scene (no this does not spoil anything), where Mameha calling bell hanging at the entrance to the house where Sayuri lives on a snowy winter day. The bell rings it is fuurin or wind chime - only hung over the house in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes were not doorbells - they simply opened the door and announced himself. (You may think that this is such a trivial detail, but I would equate this film made about America, where a Christmas wreath hanging on the door in July, and no one thinks anything about it.) And do not even get me started on a completely wrong hairstyles, according to Mike and geisha who vaguely pan-Asian / Chinese / kung fu-ish, and nothing like the real thing. I think it's pretty cavalier attitude to culture, they are trying to portray is really out in the relationship, and images of people and situations, too. <br /> <br /> So I think that the less you know about the Japanese culture and the world of geishas and Mike in Kyoto (which is what "Miyake" is), I believe the more you You will enjoy it. I sincerely believe that this film could have been much better ... as it is, it's just another version of Hollywood's "exotic Japan."
