On the "General Information" on IMDb states that the filmmakers were protesting because the film was re-cut by the studio to "simplify the plot." If so, that effort was a complete failure, as it is one of the most inconsistent narrative I have ever seen in the film - I would not like to see it before the site was <br /> < «simplified». br /> It is sad to see Warren with so little character to go, even he can not do anything inappropriate material does. It is interesting to see Caron in 70s mode instead of Hollywood glamor era clothing and a person, "but it's sad to see how she helplessly wander through this Doing-a- goodwill-to-her husband-producer of dreck. It really connect with and later marry the director, and - who, you'll notice, never directed anything, but made strictly first or second AD TV work here on out. It Oughta tell you enough right there. <br /> <br /> I call it "interesting," because I have a commitment to automatic American films of this period, and this role really adds a different perspective of a fantastic 1971 Oates output (Two - Lane Blacktop, hired hands). But "the 1940s detective, like a fish-out-of water in the 1970s LA" theme, which is the only film really have to say, sold too clumsy manner. A similar theme will be much better handled in two years in Altman The Long Goodbye. And how Oates plays the annoying guy at the request of the convicted, three years on, it will present its final work in the Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. If you have not seen those, do not waste your time with it!
