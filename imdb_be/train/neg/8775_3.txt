LOC might very well made film about how the war was Kargil; it took place, the budget and the ability to be in India, "Saving Private Ryan" or «Black Hawk Down». Instead he came across as a bloated, 4:00 holes trying to combine a military procession with Maasai film. Even the war scenes were badly made, using the same hill in all its action scenes, and spend too much time on casual conversations. Rather than trying to appeal to the Indian public, better film would count to books about what happened in Kargil (as «Black Hawk Down») or even spend time fighting point of view (for example, «Tora Tora, Tora" ). Even better, if he could use a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, direct and edit a film. By that time, I did not want to see some one re-edit the film, only the relevant sections are included; it would make the film more watchable.
