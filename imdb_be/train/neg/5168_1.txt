If you are going to try to build tension in a film is always a good idea not to build it as a point of total boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Butcher Brothers do not understand it yet. <, Br /> <br /> This movie sucks, unlike most of his characters, which (if you did not work they are vampires in the first few minutes, then shame on you), the advantage of being hung in abundance, "no one knows where I AM» types of fans and homosexual drifters who hear and convenient with fast food swagger past them insulated doors. <br /> <br /> single little bit of originality in the story of how these vampires vampires come in the first place, but otherwise it is inappropriate and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Forced sticks (as opposed to packets aktsiev) on a regular basis due to their tendency to fill their basement with bloodless corpses, they really are not too bright when they feed their victim that they can conduct their own farm a bit of blood, and it would reduce the mortality rate, the most by allowing them to settle down and get the amount for a gift. <br /> <br /> Why the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and murderous gay older brother, I'm not sure. He added zero plot, which was unfortunate, given that there was not a lot of story to start and had no impact values ​​at all. <br /> <br /> One was never told why he was dead parents, unless, of course, was not explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. It is clear that a social worker should be warned about the family for some reason or the other, but then again, it was for the audience to write your own mind. <br /> <br /> The only well-rounded character was the younger brother, who goes looking like from Pugsley Adams family. Indeed, he was too rounded, having a child the kind that suddenly came from the class of strong Watchers' and a very bad horror movie. Oh God, he had. Nothing expensive, have another donut with yummy blood center.
