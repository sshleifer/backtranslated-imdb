Not surprisingly, the historian Ian Kershaw, author of the groundbreaking biography of Hitler, which was originally a scientific consultant of the TV film, distanced himself from it. The film is historically very wrong. Errors begin immediately if Hitler`s father Alois dies at home, while in fact he died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in reality it is actually moved to Munich in 1913 I could go on forever. Hitler`s childhood and youth are drawn way too short, which makes it quite difficult for the historically ignorant people to understand the nature of this failed neurotic person. Important early time party officials as Hitler`s fatherly friend Dietrich Eckart, or the party of "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg completely absent. Hanfstaengl characteristic is very problematic. In the film, he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script, obviously, should be Hanfstaengl`s own gloss on the kind of which he gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was anti-Semitic and was crazy about her, "the Fuhrer". But the biggest problem of the film is a picture of Hitler. He is described as someone who always hostile, does not have the charisma or charm and ever orders all around. After watching the film, he asked how such a hideous man was never able to get any follower. After all, we all know that was an evil criminal Hitler, of course, every writer temptation to portray Hitler as absolutely disgusting and uncharismatic. But the fact that he can be very charming and interesting in private. His fellow `t didn follow him, because all the time he shouted at them, but because they love this wonderful man. Apart from all these historical errors, the film is well done, first class actors, boom location and design of production give a plausible impression of age.
