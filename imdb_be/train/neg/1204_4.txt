I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watch it and laugh all the next day. It's not so bad for the made-for-television horror film, but it is a derivative (mainly Exorcist) and efficiently, due to the lack of a better word. It does not blow you away with a sly cinema or large effect, but it is not a waste of time, either. This is the kind of movie you are looking to kill a couple of hours, if you're not in the mood to think too hard. <br /> <br /> However, if you go to the cinema, looking for some laughs, you won "t be disappointed. Early stage with Lucky Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with the children of the damned eyes, funny is not threatened, and the highest blue screen effects giant black dog (with horns!) Quite a side splitting. And watch out for disguised Satanists in Maverick shades aside start. <br /> <br /> Not a big horror movie any stretch, but I want them to still do things like this for television.
