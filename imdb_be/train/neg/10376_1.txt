I saw this movie at the screening in a previous version of the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the producers and director of the film were present, apparently to gauge our reaction. <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes have caused a burst of laughter from the audience, which would have been nice if it was a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience was not terrible, it seems to me that the filmmakers. They sustained release during the year. Out of curiosity, I saw him again, to see if they had to re-cut it; As far as I can tell, they did not have. It was the same lousy movie, only a year older. <br /> <br /> it almost qualifies as a "so bad it's good", but it is a slow and tedious.
