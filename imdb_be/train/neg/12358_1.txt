Demi Moore's character in the film was selected for the seals because of their appearance. It was a bad start, and the film came out. The plot was absolutely incredible. The desire to make it in a tough military unit lacks. This film is not convinced me of the woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks that you need. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that men and women are basically the same as insulting the intelligence of each. Differences between men and women, which makes life interesting.
