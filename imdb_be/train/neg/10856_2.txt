Now look, I will not lie to you, but I just got this movie for $ 3.99 from each other, because it was Danni Filth, lead singer of the ever-popular death metal band «Cradle Of Filth» in it. I expected, of course, violence and blood at its best, because that's what Mr. Filth can be depicted as among the storyline. <br /> <br /> But dear God, I was so wrong about. This film is serious bites, big time. Being a low-budget film (ha ha, wait, do ZERO BUDGET), it is clearly not enough beautiful Howard Stern orchestra score and special effects Spielberg. No, it's all one camera, bad angles, and bad blood scene. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, when our star and violent threw Mr. Filth, brutally kills a robber. Emergency throat and spits blood, but my God, it seems, have the juice pack is filled with fake blood in a person's shirt <br /> <br /> You Cradle Of Filth fans :. You will hear two songs for the film, but with the angles and bad shots, they pull the overall fun of the song DOWN <br /> <br /> My final comment :. Stay away from him. It is blood, blood, breast, and hey, even a bad story to go with it. So if you like terrible violence, a number of no votes (yes, there is virtually not a word in this movie), then by all means, buy it. But if low-quality films are not your thing, then avoid it. Do not waste your money.
