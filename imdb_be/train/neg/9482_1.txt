Do not even waste your time, not to mention the rental payment for this piece of dreck! As he got to me. (I do not know why there is a minimum of 10 lines ... I've already briefly this crappy movie, but, oh well ...) The acting was terrible, as they are all the necessary lessons. The plot was weak, the ending ... Ugh! I think that cinema was the only thing that is not completely suck ... well, maybe the sound was minimalistic OK. One good thing if they could do this film, even make some money with it, there may be hope for any writer with a real idea. So, you all hold on! I think the same is true of the actors ... if these people actually got paid, then you can too!
