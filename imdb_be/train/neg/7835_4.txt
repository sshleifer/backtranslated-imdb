Man, I really wanted to love this show. I was starving for some good television, and I applaud TNT to provide these "vozmozhnosteev". But, unfortunately, I'm in the minority, I think, if we are talking about Cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as the writing of the king: the irony is that it simply does not translate well to the screen, big or small. With rare exceptions (very few), the king of experience can not be removed with the same exposure that these stories have in reading. Many people do not agree with this, but I'm sure that deep down they have to recognize that the best shot King story, but a pale memory of what they read. The reason is simple. Medium King story takes place in the mind-antennae characters in the story. He gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal views. In short, the king takes the reader a place where you can not put a Panavision camera. As the audience, watching the king of shot, we were left with less than half of the information than the reader has access to. It's not too big a stretch to say that one becomes a character in the stories they read the king, while another is limited shallow voyeurism of the same character when filming. By that time, according to King, Hollywood will shoot anything that comes out of his word processor, without regard to whether or not they are. I do not blame the creator of the film for a try, but it takes a huge amount of talent and diligence, to pull subtle adaptation of Stephen King, that works. The task looks like turning lead into gold, or some secret skill bottom. Well, better luck next time.
