John Scott (John Wayne) and Kansas partner Charlie (Eddie Chandler) are the following friends who make their way to the Rodeo Gulch rattlesnake. Scott is a pretty fair participant, but he believes that if he is not ready to take twenty-five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crooked promoter, he will have to collect your winnings at gunpoint. Quite by chance, the robbers Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide that they would like to see the rest of the double rodeo; they shoot promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall), and make it look like Scott, Kansas Charlie are killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use the running gag in the movie where they're going to go at it with his fists on different trifles. Every time Chandler takes a wild swing, Wayne foot stomping him and knocks him silly. <br /> <br /> If you are very careful, there is a neat Lipton tea advertisement in one of the scenes in which Scott loved Anne (Mary is Kornman). <br /> <br /> Later in the film, framed with friends once again on the scene of the robbery. Having a change of heart and see their mistakes, the bad guy Jim wants to purify and to admit to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him down. Being sealed, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Ann. The incredible scene, Anne walks right into the middle of a firefight between the good guys and villains to facing the sheriff. <br /> <br /> «Desert Trail» is a blander John Wayne Westerns with Lone Star Productions during this period. Conspicuously absent George "Gabby» Hayes and Yakimov Kanatt, one or both, as a rule, can be seen in these oaters. If you're a fan of John Wayne, though, you have to see it once, but it would probably be enough.
