Dire. Just pitiful. The script contrived acting sickly, and the story just pulls. This is without a doubt the holiday Sally Potter and little else. It would not be so bad, but she was the director, writer and star of the film, and therefore only self-praise. I found myself without worrying about the developing romance between the two main characters, and the end has not come a moment too soon. It has two redeeming features. Firstly, many of the shots is really very nice, especially in Paris, and they look pretty good in black and white. Second, whether you're a fan of the tango or not, music is by and large excellent (except when Sally begins to sing). Watch this movie on your own risk, or if you need unintended laughter. I'm sure he turns to someone. Statistically, it should.
