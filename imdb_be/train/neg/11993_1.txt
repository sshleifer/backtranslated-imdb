After watching only half of the film at the school in November, today, I saw that on the Flix Channel and decided to look it up to see the rest of it and write a new review of it. <br /> <br /> the book that the movie is based on, Ax, all right. This is a terrible adaptation of it though. <br /> <br /> Terrible (I mean awful), which acts, bad dialogue, cinematography, and the average of this terrible adaptation ax. <br /> <br /> The film begins Brian, who is a cliché image of the late '80s teenagers (sporting a mullet, hitting his head to cheap 80s rock music) and his mother was driving in the car for him to board a plane to fly up to see his estranged dad (his parents divorced ... now rewind the dramatic pause.) Now Brian said goodbye to her mother and a dog and fly up to see his father. Pilot fat, ugly, rude people (not like that in this book), which is in 2 minutes in the air, has a heart attack and dies. In the book he goes into more detail with the pilot, with more pain, and it seemed that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack. <br /> <br /> plane (for two minutes) went to an empty fuel (leaving us, the viewers, to imagine that he was there for a few hours it was even though the sun has not changed the position and the scenery looks in the same way.) Now he crashed landed. <br /> <br /> this is the point in the movie where everything is completely different, it was in the book. The book said that his jacket was torn to shreds, but in the film it's fine, no tears or rips (looks as if he just bought it), he never said that he went up the mountain, he saw the wolf, and went to sleep there on the mountain, he never said that he had been a bear attack (he said the elk, but not a bear), he never said that he eats a few mistakes, which he does, he never mentions the second tornado or what he learned to get these sparrows, skin them and eat them, or that little trap fish farm that he does (which is one of the tornadoes destroyed) ie referred to hurt him on the ribs of one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> I don "t even think you can call that a tornado has been shown in the film. It was all just a storm that knocked some of his things. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp festival was lame retrospective of Brian (who are never mentioned in the book), especially cliché scene Brian waking up, I went to the window and saw that his father (with all his things packed that all this may well fit in only the back of his truck) leaving and yelling «DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!» (Another, of course, his father did not hear him, although he was just right outside), and he punches his fist through the window ( WTF?) <br /> <br /> ending the only thing close to what happened in the book (I said close.) in the book, I think, w about one of the key things that the pilot and rescue Brian said when he landed was "you're a kid, which they've been looking for! I stopped months ago. .. "until they left that line in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic epilogue Brian (somehow without counseling or therapy) return to a normal life with his family. I think we should have to assume that they get together on Thanksgiving Day (because they had a turkey on the counter.) Then he shows his temporary home (because in the film, it seemed, for three days, but in the book has been for a few months) and his ax still in the tree where he had left it (also not held in a book), indicating where he carved a message, so well done: «HOME» (where we really have to believe that he had cut that it completely with just a hatchet?) <br /> <br /> nO quotation can not let this film up best when Enid and Spirit World said that "it's so bad gone past good and back to bad again." A perfect description of this film. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to someone (who have not read the book), and just wants to see the movie and I will not be with someone who read the book (because they will be disappointed and bored to death. <br /> <br /> for those who read the book, leave that is created by your imagination, like a movie. It's terrible, and bring down their thoughts on the book. <br /> <br /> 1/10
