I've seen better quality products on YouTube! I feel sorry for the actors, the letter was scary and shocking direction, do not know how they could get out of line - I really doubt that any actor could not save this movie, no matter how good they were. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot, which has just appeared, nowhere else. It's a shame, really, as a prerequisite for the movie was good, and with the best quality products, trends and scenarios could be a decent movie. This, of course, was not a comedy, if you do not laugh at the dub - which was amateurish, even English actors sounded strange.
