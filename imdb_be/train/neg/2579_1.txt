I must say that I used to be a big fan of the series. The first 3 were large, while others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's a shame because it was a great series, and it's getting worse. I know that they are made for DVD-movies, but some effort would be nice. <br /> <br /> There's no laugh, just a couple of good jokes that bring a smile, if that. There is quite a nudity and very hot chicks. But no sexual material of any jokes really works. <br /> <br /> To add that this movie is too racist or racist film can be done without asking called racists. I'm not one of those people who think that everything must be politically correct. But the image of minorities is very offensive. <br /> <br /> I would not waste time on this garbage. See previous versions, they make you laugh are not sick.
