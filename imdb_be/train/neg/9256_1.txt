Meaningless short of a bunch of half-naked men, slapping and punching each other. That's all. Within about 5 minutes, we can see it. He was shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other on the motive of the terrible music. It looks interesting, but there is no plot, and in fact - the violence inherent in it got anxiety. In addition, the homo eroticism in this play on, but mixing it with violence, it was not a good idea. Some people who like avant-garde material may like it, but I found it incomprehensible, sad, stupid and (ocassionally) alarming. In fact - what's the point in all this? I saw it during the festival of gay shorts and the audience sat in a daze. I really would like to go below 1.
