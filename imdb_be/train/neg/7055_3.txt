lets start with the fact that «Jawani sofa" just pathetic film. I agree with the last person who said, "I missed Joyride». lol. <br /> <br /> jokes were terrible. The performances were average. Something went wrong with the film. Emraan deserves something better. All CELINA Jaitley made the expose. Hrishitta Bhatt was OK. Hashmi was also normal. <br /> <br /> MANN (Hashmi), a desperate guy who wants to be famous. Thus, he uses Radha and pretends that he loves her, because her father is a music manager and can help him to become a well-known (for example, the father is subject to all of his daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to Goa to have fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA Jaitley) and falls completely on her appearance and tries to flirt with her BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then, that night ROMA can not open the door to his room, and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he can not just, ROMA is to ask for help. While she was gone, MANN able to open the door and decided to go inside and sit on his bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes and they have a one night stand. However, that One night stand ROMA falls in love with him. That morning, they noticed the underworld don (Mahesh), who sees all this. Don loves ROMA and could not stand what he saw. He tells them to get married, and frightened, MANN obeys the order and Merry ROMA. Then their marriage ends in the news paper. MANN later learn that he loves ROMA after they make a music video together. Now he is trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> horror film. Songs «SINI NE SINI NE» is fantastic remix is ​​even better. «DIL DIWANA» is also great. The title track is also strange. Guys, do not watch this movie.
