All the while, Disney makes one of thoes movies that surprised everyone. The one that keeps you not interested until the end. Traditionally, Pirates of the Caribbean, this film is sure to become a ghost, kill and rape their village. It's terrible. If you want mindless, mindless, predictable "action" movies, go straight ahead. I believe that young children might enjoy it as they like, as good always wins. But me, I love the movies, where it is thrown, who is going to win. This film never allows bad guys took over. By the end of the year, when the heroes and remains «inescapeable» to it, you just know that they can get out. Everything works great for Cage and his friends, he never has to think about the mystery or the key for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex is. See this film if you want to see some spectacular set designs, if you do not want to see a good action or a good movie. Go watch the movie Superman, would have been much shorter, and the kids would like it more. For example, the scene where Cage to escape from armed fighters, and bullets all face the fire escape railing. (And I'm not talking about the fence or something, just one small pole) This film shows the disintegration of films and film industry in cheap gags and dull, unrealistic action that this film offers in large quantities.
