No, it was not one of the ten worst films of the 1980s, but it is, of course, surrounds the bottom 100 somewhere. This film looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else to explain the special effects pre-dating "An American Werewolf in London," the disc is still considered cool, and Ronald Reagan without being 40th United States President? While we're at it, let's not lose sight of those 1970's hairstyles in the 1950s and 60s. I've seen more here than in «Happy Days» and «Laverne & Shirley» together. <br /> <br /> One woman who picks the movie "so bad it's good" category was late, great Elizabeth Hartman, but only slightly. BIF plays Miss Montgomery High School teacher mouse that becomes sexpot, a stereotype that has been done to death, and still coming out of Hollywood today, but even as a "hot chick", it retains its quality mouse. Her call for help attests to this. In addition, it looks much better as Miss WIMP. "Seven dollars in the beauty salon, shot to hell." She was not kidding. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there are no good parts elsewhere, they are just few and far between, and I'm not just saying that because I like Hartman. By the way, "cub" was better than that. "The cub Too" was better than this, and it was not even very good. <br /> <br />
