Well previews looked funny, and I do not usually go to the cinema for the premiere especially with children, because ...... well, you never know. Here is a film that does not refer to children or adults, is too perverted jokes for kids and provides a completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults. I was actually ashamed to be with my 9 and 6 years old and having to explain my 6-year-old that S H * T spells. Essentially what is happening is a total of twisting the classic Dr. Seuss in. He adds wicked and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money. If it was a plot, then perhaps it would be good, but it ends up being the main story about the film and "cat" plays a role in uncovering the plot neighbor to my mother for who he really is. Take my advice and read the book and pass the film.
