I'm afraid that I do not like this film very much. Apart from a few saving grace, it's nothing to write home about. <br /> <br /> J-horror flourished over the last five or six years, but the films themselves have more than one account were repetitive and carbon copies of previous success. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is mainly supernatural slasher film. The beginning is promising with frightening scenes from the morgue where the dead girl is her eyes graphically stitched together, but shortly after their discovery. However, after that, he quickly downhill for this film. <br /> <br /> In order to be a sort of I'll start with the things I like «Gawi». On the positive side, the visual and tasteless film looks excellent for its type. For those who like their horror Mountains NO few beautifully made (no pun intended) the murder scene. We also get some good suspense sequences / Set-pieces. <br /> <br /> However, there are many drawbacks and ... <br /> <br /> First of all, my main complaint of this film, the plot leaps and jumps back and forth in time with alarming intensity. This is usually not a problem for me, but here, where students look exactly the same, no matter in which they age, I was confused on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> The performances well, I do not think (a little hard to tell if you do not know the language), but it seems a bit stiff. And for a horror movie, I do not think it was quite scary. For a while I was pretty boring, actually. <br /> <br /> As an advocate of Giallo movie, I expected a lot from the "Nightmare", but unfortunately, I was very disappointed.
