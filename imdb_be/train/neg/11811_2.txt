You know, when you're on the bus, and someone decides to tell you my life story, and you're sitting there with a pitiful smile on his face, when all you really need to do is slap the fool and go? Well, I had a similar feeling while watching this film. Well, I actually decided to go and see Aprile, and I knew the taste of Nanni Moretti to build yourself one and only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last party of his memoirs, I wanted to give Moretti in Madre all spanking. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a few other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half high-pitched whine is happening about how his policies are better, or that dodgy part of popular culture is now tickling his fancy. He also finds time to slag from the movies that he does not like something I thought was reserved for those who have lost as I am. Of course, we are in a position, as it is possible to think that he would like to try and make a point about the movie a little more reasonable than that. Making the right film, perhaps one with some ideas and decent structure, or perhaps one that is not completely dominated by his voice annoying. And when he began to fawn over their new born baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably all, of the film director obsessed with their own amazing penchant for tacky music. The next time someone you do not know, trying to tell you my life story, give them a slap from me. Each hit will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
