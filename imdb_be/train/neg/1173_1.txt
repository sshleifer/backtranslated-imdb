If I had only one camera, which was accidentally taped to the floor, enough film only one take of each shot, and then lost all the film and had to get a few dollars to buy some digital video tapes, and was forced to do more-2 -gadinny film about the French revolution, as well as do not have any set and had to have my 4-year-old autistic son to paint the background, and unified actor, I could find were people who wait "t make the casting of this year, soap opera, and I was not forced use any music in the whole film, as well as the zoom function on the camera does not work at a time, except when he began casually zooming and could not 't stop, oh, and if I hated my audience, I could do something like this terrible, but mistakenly fun, hell worthy of spending time. Nearly Grand mind, but quite fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of the latest creations of George Lucas, who did so much more disappointing because throughout the film, there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film is the culmination in a lightsaber duel / space combat laser. I do not want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, but that's not how it ends. The only thing I can think of that wasted more time than watch this movie of writing. World.
