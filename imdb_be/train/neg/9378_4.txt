This is another production of Northeast Florida, taken in the ground and close to Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was very surprised that the company was able to take on the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as it was necessary to reach street scenes. The film is very, very bad. Tami Erin cute but overacts. Eileen Brennan overacts even more. Suitable for young children or for those who like fluff in large doses. A 4 of formula Miller films.
