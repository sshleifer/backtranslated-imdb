Really? REALLY ???? I know that if you make a political war film you will get noticed, but this movie was just garbage. Terrible in every sense. Terribly inaccurate in many respects. I'm easier to believe United States President suit up, flying a jet and shooting down alien. It is easier to point out a few things that were right. May jaw dropped when I saw someone said that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was outplayed the seemingly nonsensical story of sabotage and had the dubious cinematography at times. <br /> <br /> X-Box, YouTube, ACUPAT utilities ?? Or someone to check that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you had to do extensive research, it was only five years before the movie came out. I'm in Iraq War veteran and if you spent one day with an infantry platoon or squad EOD you would understand how BS this film. To compare this Platoon or Saving Private Ryan ludicrous. Why do not you just throw Commando and Red Dawn there too; I think those would be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see past the incredible story, historical and factual differences, then this film might just be right. Nothing more. If you continue to hear the "Oscar buzz", and need to add your own review pompous, go right ahead. As for me, I write the director to see if I can get 131 minutes ago.
