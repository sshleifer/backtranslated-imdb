I personally liked «The Prophecy» 1995 deal. Christopher Walken was, as always, is great, and despite the fact that the film was not perfect, it was horrible and very original horror / fantasy film, which is very entertaining. This is below the 1998 sequel still worth watching, but mostly because of Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he was again excellent as the fallen archangel Gabriel, which he played for the second time here. Once again, a war between the faithful and the fallen angels brought to earth. Gabriel returned to prevent the birth of a child, namely child Danyael angel (Russel Wong) and a human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child may one day be a determining factor in the celestial war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken once again perfect as Gabriel. Furthermore, Gabriel, however, "The burden II», unfortunately, also includes a bunch terribly irritating characters. The nature of Valerie annoying enough and Danayel annoyed me even more. The biggest pain in the ass, but it was the character Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who will not shut up. However, Walken's performance is not the only redeeming quality of the film. The entire film is quite a chore, and a good shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel resurrection scene in the beginning is also very high, and one of the coolest moments in any of the «Prophecy» films. "The burden II», nevertheless the weakest of the three films «Prophecy» with Uoken. Christopher Walken is definitely one-man show, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.
