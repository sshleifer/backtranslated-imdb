Though the film may have been a "real" book to Lewis (that scenario was largely word for word, verbatim) that failed to capture any of the greatness that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this. Mythical Creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) are * * in turn, as in the previous review, the flying sequence of green screen was very hard to swallow. I almost laughed to death when I saw a humanoid giant beaver are stiff suits and lower teeth; I almost cried when I heard the wolf «howl--» man in a gray suit, mostly indistinct screeching as loud and as girly as it possibly can. <br /> <br /> All the acting is extremely forced, especially little Lucy Penvensie ... I could take only so much outrage, despair and reducing teeth (what felt like) fourteen hours watching a movie. The actress, who plays the White Witch, in all its theatricality, it seems that it would be more at home on the stage, where a loud voice, weapons proliferation, and the heroic efforts of something Shakespeare will be more than welcome. <br /> <br /> Many feel claustrophobic, whether the scene take place indoors or outdoors. Indoors, it is as if the BBC could only afford to spend $ 100 for the construction of the complex, and therefore it is very small, and all the characters are constantly pressed against each other. Castle White Witch is a run-down, rotting rural English castle, filled with plastic statues and poor lighting. When children Penvensie roam woods-- actually * any * scene woods-- feels as if they're just wandering around. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks decent Aslan in the film, but you can bet that the BBC, probably blew up the entire budget of the film on the construction of the mechanical cat. It looks great when it is in position, and, before he begins to speak, but as soon as he starts to move, you can not help but pity the poor person who has to be back in the lion costume. <br /> <br /> So, if you are a hardcore fan Narnia, you can see this version, simply because it saves every word that Lewis never wrote-- but Lewis was not, of course, not a writer, and a lot of dialogue feels chunky and uncomfortable when on the screen. During the scene in which the children are beavers and preparing to flee from the wolves, continuous Mrs Beaver, "Oh, just one thing, dearies, and then we'll be ready to go," punctuated by children's simultaneous cries and sighs and groans, "No, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE ! "- the scene of the comic, so incongruous (they need to be saved from imminent danger, the sun wondering how to pack a sewing machine or not) detract from the drama of the scene might have otherwise. In fact, the whole movie is replete with directing faux pas, such as they are. <br /> <br /> I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney, 2005). The new film, with updated effects, spectacular computer animation, great timing all around, and a great and scene- stealing the White Witch (who plays his role with all the fine scrapped a seasoned politician, unlike the screaming banshee) captures all the grandeur and beauty of the world of Narnia without detracting from the smallest bit from the original vision of Lewis (I think). Lucy's a lot nicer (NO buck teeth, YAY!) Like Beavers (and actual size), and the obstinate BBC Edmund has nothing of the divine, desperately-Hungry-for-acceptance-dangerous-and Angsting-to--an nepavnavartasnyh- Edmund complex, the new version of Disney fronts. <br /> <br /> If you are not the type who likes to spend time making fun campy movie, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
