Many deaths occur in the wild. You need not be a rocket scientist to figure it out! But this should be the focus of a documentary nature? What's with this fascination horrible death? Do we really need to see an adult elephant torn to shreds pack of hungry lions? Or, cheetah grabbed by the throat gazelle in slow motion, no less! I thought it would be a family character of the film! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show the terrible violence in a movie trailer? Filmmakers were afraid of losing money? <br /> <br /> Then, in a manner typical of comic relief, we will see the magnificent birds of paradise-performing mating rituals in the most irritating and stupid story humanly possible. It was unreal! It's as if the filmmakers felt that they would be affected only to a room full of first and second class field trip to school! Wow! Medium to weak-minded in a heartbeat <br /> <br /> If there is any future nature documentary waiting for their time reading this review of the film, why not focus on the animals actually copulate; giving birth; laying eggs; swimming; sleeps; purification from each other; communication; to play; but fear and anger emotional expression; unusual behavior, like the mouth of incubation; migration; problem-solving skills; Culture (yes, many species of animals are what people call culture); communication skills; parenting, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on the violence or the dumbing down of beauty, and why not be more rounded - and focus on the excitement and inspiration, as well?
