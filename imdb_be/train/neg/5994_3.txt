OK..this film could be soooo good! All generations were exposed to Thunderbirds and fall in love with her, and this film has some of the features one would look for in a good movie Thunderbirds. Sami and the island Tracey courts were actually transferred to the big screen, while still keeping in design we fell in love. Sophia Myles, fantastic as Lady P and Bill Paxton, while not exactly who I provided Jeff Tracey have been strong enough ... but the adults were taken out of the equation, and we were asked to believe the 8-year-old can fly 200 -tonnyya machine. <br /> <br /> This is not so much the fact that the film was centered around children, which made me feel like Zhonaton Frakes was slapped me with a wet fish and laughed at my hard-earned money spent on the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracy was so bad in the film, and that he seemed to be able to fly on the machines, as well as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, this is some pretty damn easy to use, if it is so. <br /> <br /> The film does not seem to know whether he wants to be a serious or farcical. He tried to pay tribute while ridiculing and it is only as a whole fell on his face. 3/10 (2 for machines for 1 Lady P)
