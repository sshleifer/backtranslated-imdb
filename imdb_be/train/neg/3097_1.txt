There can be no question about the spoilers for this film, directed by beating us all the same, and spoiled the film in a lot of ways. <br /> <br /> blatant plagiarism in such things as Gremlins and Critters, this film fails on many levels, to regain the humor and the horror of the best movies made. He ends up sloppy waste of time where bad actors deliver bad dialogue before the director idiot who sometimes throws stuffed toys to them. They are struggling with these toys in the same manner as the old Tarzan movies used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them while shouting and trying their best to make it a little threatening. It is painful to watch, and did not help the mental-80 modes, which are cast. <br /> <br /> In fact, some crazy little aliens that have been closed aging security guard in the film a lot, finally getting free after many years in prison, and begin to telepathically jokes with the minds of people. Guards rookie idiot who let them out, despite repeated warnings, the gang gets his 80 friends together, and they go and have a little adventure together in an attempt to regain Grem ... brownies. <br /> <br /> All my life here with the gang, which is composed of Knucklehead athlete, his 80-whore girlfriend is frigid and prim girlfriend of the hero, and the young hero, lacking in confidence, and wishing his girlfriend will extinguish in any case. <br /> <br /> First comes the infamous tramp battle scene where the former military athlete shows how he was trained in the military to be a bully, poking NERDY hero with the wrong end of a spatula for what seems like hours. Then there are some run, ending with a real pie fight in the style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand grenades to blow up everything except the people standing next to them. Then Grades film ends and Alls well that ends well. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. It's like watching a train wreck, you can not take your eyes off it, it's so bad. The ideal rate for Mystery Science Theater, but the god-awful you have to try to see him alone and uncut. fashion police still has a number of outstanding warrants to throw, and I have the right one not to laugh in the open ridicule in the front battle. This score 2 out of 10 at best, on a good day.
