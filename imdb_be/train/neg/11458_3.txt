I fondly remember the heyday of B, Derek and the media attention the UK (at Mucky Sun & News of the World newspapers especially) - all after her small role in "10" with Dudley Moore. It is understandable that a lot of noise was made with her photogenic face, the crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly shaped jump chest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the acting, and never has been, her forte! I think they need to do one of the triple CD collection you will always find in the bargain DVD bins- Orca, Tarzan Tarzan and the bolero. All of these films can be nominated for Â«So Bad They're great." <br /> <br /> It will be guilty of a "must buy" me! If you ever read your press, or this comment Ms Derek, please do not offended- always had a soft spot for you, and there are more important things that are happening in the world to worry about than your acting ability. many Love.x
