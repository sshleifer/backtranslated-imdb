I saw a movie on cable late at night and could not believe how bad it was. I usually take a bad film, but it was so disgusting that it was not even interested. Some of the highlights of the film include the absurd music that plays constantly throughout the film, disgusting special effects (if someone is shot by a laser gun they turn neon green and disintegrate rapidly) and acting nasty. Actions, in fact, is what I feel like dwarfs. I do not recognize any of the actors in the film, and I hope I never have to see any of them again. Overall, I recommend renting this film (if you can find it, I can not imagine a video store carrying the garbage), make sure that you can learn to appreciate the quality of the film after watching this garbage.
