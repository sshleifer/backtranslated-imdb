Coyote Ugly can be much more effective when the filmmakers have done is R-rated gloating / exploitation film (with a lot of nudity.) But because the PG-13 rating is the fact that all the studios want these days, we I end up with a film like this :. to "tease" Flicka PG-13, is not allowed to go far as the film had to <br /> <br /> script to go grassroots, it is easy to guess that the plot point will occur 15 minutes before at the actually happening. Action is adequate, but the characters are so paper thin that nothing can be done with them. There were also a lot of points where it seemed that I was watching a music video, not film. <br /> <br /> only asset of the film is remarkably beautiful woman is. We will see them in some very narrow and rather revealing outfits ..... but the only way it could be shown in connection with the PG-13 restrictions. There's plenty of cleavage and fit, climbing organs make some well-choreographed dance numbers, but no nudity or sex talk. Tyra Banks (she continues to get even crazier is beautiful with age), also in the movie for a very small amount of time. Sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy on the eyes (and she has a killer smile) and shows some real action potential. <br /> <br /> The only people I could see this film appealing to pre-pubescent boys, who are not allowed to watch R-rated movies yet. This audience can get a lot of it from tickling aspect, but adult viewers will feel angry and cheated <br /> <br /> Rating :. Film-1 female 10
