This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I have ever seen. To begin, I would like to say that the front cover of this movie definitely misleading, if you think about what to see really scary horror movie monster clown, you are soooo wrong. In fact, the killer is not particularly even slightly resembles the front cover, it is only the image that they had to find on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of things that they found, and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in the movie, where some of the gang are looking for one in old forests, and then suddenly the screen chops on the stage, where a mother parenting deer is young in shining sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ??? As it related to the dark forest they wander down the road? I bought this film from the man at the market in the hope that it would be interesting, if not terror, then at least it would be funny, is not it? Wrong! The next day I gave it to my colleague freeing themselves from the plague name S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Or not see this movie !!!
