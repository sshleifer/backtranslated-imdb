Brazenly ambitious sci-fi by Kerry Conran, for which this is clearly a labor of love. Unfortunately, it's just not as good. It all starts well enough - the epic, but restrained by a mixture of Lucas and Hitchcock's editing style and glossy cinematography in Spielberg. The film also refers to a set of cellulose science fiction novels, TV series and films as diverse as The Day the Earth Stood Still, Superman, metropolis, Planet of the Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy, who loved me. The film, however, may not be as good as any of those, for several reasons: the main thing being that it is a labor of love, so worried about throwing everything on the screen and creating a brave new world, Conran actually forget about creating a movie. There is virtually no tension, atmosphere or magic on offer here, in spite of the air battles, the dinosaurs, and the race against time set-pieces. Even noir elements fall flat. This is a broad view of things, though - these elements are mostly not because he does not feel anything at all really, and so obviously fake - green screen looks like a video game half-time, and it's obvious the actors were pasted on later, the actor can not make any - Jude Law wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie wasted - and it's all because of the terrible scenario - in this way, which is to explain just about everything. This is a decent experience and some of them can get nostalgic feel, but ultimately, it is pointless to step into the world of yesterday. Good ending, though.
