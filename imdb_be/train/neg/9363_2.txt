This movie has some fatal flaws in it, someone can pass through the open back door of high security medical facility unbelievable. Then the same person simply walks around the object and enters the office doctor is just bad writing or bad editing. <br /> <br /> Very very very predictable film. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this film was made, except that was filmed in Canada, and probably received a government subsidy. <br /> <br /> I have to say, that a person plays Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> If you do not get bored and have nothing else to watch on TV, then I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise this film would not have the actor did not want on your resume .
