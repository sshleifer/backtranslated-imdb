When I saw this movie on TV, I'm really looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980s and, like everyone else who grew up in that era, seen every 80-year-old teenager and a movie camp there. So I could not wait to see this movie, which completely replaces this film genre. What a disappointment !! The film was not nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over again, with little or no plot and no substance. And the filmmakers attempt to black humor has completely failed, some of these so-called jokes did not come across as anything but downright harsh and offensive. The only good thing about this film was wardrobe, music and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all the summer clothes styles from the 80s, and the same applies to music. And the acting was top-notch throughout almost all the best comedians in Hollywood attended. Too bad they do not have the best material for the job.
