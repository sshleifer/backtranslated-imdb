Well, if it was not for Ethel Waters and a 7-year-old Sammy Davis Jr. (here billed without Jr.), Rufus Jones for President will be one of the worst ideas of African American stereotypes I probably from early Talkie era and would not be worth a look because of this. Ms. Waters fine here singing «Am I Blue?» And «Under Our Harlem Moon» while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experiences in show business has prepared him to superstar status as adults. He is so good tuk-dancing here I thought for a while that he was a small man with years of experience. So, if you are willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for President should provide a nice treat. PS This is the fourth time today, I saw and heard the song "I'll be glad when you're dead bastard You» performed on the film, this time Davis. It should be a very popular song of the time.
