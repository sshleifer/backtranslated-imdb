The sun shall set on this film, forever <br /> <br /> He is gone forever (which is usually not a bad thing - The English Patient, Schindler's List). But so tiring. Aging actors is incredible and so delayed the infinite storyline, which actually does not seem to go anywhere. <br /> <br /> In short, a waste of talent and a movie.
