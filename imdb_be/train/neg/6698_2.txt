Saying Funky Forest: The First Contact bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions. I can really get into a good art film house, even surreal and twisted Romp as El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because these films actually have something to discuss when the credit roll. <br /> <br /> FFFC attempts for each prospect to be these deep and intelligent, in fact, there is no substance in this film. This film is poorly made, the visual effects in this movie does not inspire dialogue worse, musical destroy this film .. I chuckled for guitar BROTHERS, but it was immediately destroyed by something completely unnecessary and irrelevant. He tried to be deep and significant, I think, but simply disoriented pretentious nonsense. Students Freshman film without a camera can produce something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar Brothers and stand up routines in between scenes to get 1 point, everything else is just bad walk, pseudo-creative, heavy handed attempts as good as the films of other directors as REAL, Sogo Ishii, David Lynch, and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that the people who rave about FFFC do it because they do not have the slightest idea about what they saw, because there was nothing but soft relevant statements here and there mixed with stupidity and stirred until while vomiting on their own shoes. <br /> <br /> This film was an extreme disappointment, coming off a peak, which was Survive Style 5+, a film that really matters, combined with an excellent use of decorations, cinematography, dialogue catchy, funny moments, good soundtrack , excellent performances, fantastic pacing and flow. FFFC shows the exact opposite in all respects, a sad landscape (20 minutes looking at the soft beach at night? It is white stage? Alien balls floating in white space? And Dinka on school corridor, and then ... school corridor?) , terrible cinematography, forget the dialogue, nothing funny or humorous, except for the fact you just wasted your life for two hours, the soundtrack? amateurish performances, uneven, inconsistent, and often flat out dragging pacemaker, zero flow at all. <br /> <br /> there are those who argue that this is what makes FFFC a great movie, it's so unconventional at every step that it is pure genius. It's just a way to stroke your own ego, it seems, because of the "unpredictable" could be good quality for the film, if it was not with the "sad», «innane» and "terrible." Personally, I was talking to the two men who have confessed to me that FFFC was scared when they came out of the theater, but the vast rave on art-house elite made them watch the movie again, and then come back to me ... "Hey, it was very good I liked it. " <br /> <br /> I'm going to put my foot, this movie sucks, I do not care if Roger Ebert says that this film is the best he has ever seen, since he lost his virginity. "The new cloak Emperor" I say ... this film there is no way indicative of other psychedelic / hypnotic kind of movies from Japan over the past 10 years. The taste of tea, party 7, and Kamikaze girls are much better movies (even with a low budget), and no one can honestly compare to Survive Style 5+. only if you interested in a pretentious bunch of nothing on a shoestring budget FFFC clock.
