If Deborah Messing were not already cast as "Grace", it may be tolerable film. However, this is just another story that never took the girls with questions that hire paid escort (Dermot Mulroney), she read about in a magazine article of time to go to London London wedding of her sister. How new this site? <br /> <br /> Neither funny nor remotely romantic, wedding date slides on sex scene deceptive bride and best man, and paid for the escort to give the film as a wedding Four without Hugh, and, of course, dead-end case for naive groom, that is ignorant to the sexual history of his bride (Amy Adams). While messing perfected depressed princess, 30-something woman with a history of failed relationships, her neurotic and drunken moves on another fake dandy is just confirmed her show. If this woman is an actress, to get the role, which is not a rehash of what is already in prime time. <br /> <br /> A lot of drunken female bonding, cricket and visual jokes Mulroney in a towel (good!), but the film is a hole with a clear happy ending. Anticipated sequel Messing: Divorce date.
