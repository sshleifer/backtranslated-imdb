Unfortunately, the film is more concerned with making a lame social commentary on a real event, but doesnt have the balls legally document what happened. Constant rhetoric about how hard video games is not to blame (I get the impression Ben Coccio avid gamer), or as the media and the music is completely devoid of influence is obvious message (we even get a ridiculous scene, two boys are burning all their CDs, talk about subtlety!), but the film only gets away with it because it "fiction." Nice try. Yes, it's a great idea to alleviate the impact of the media, but as we know that children who actually planned and executed under the influence of a school shooting werent media? or video games? We do not, and we will not with this film, because once these kids are smart enough to completely abandon the media, but stupid enough to smoke a Nazi symbol on the earth? ha ha, I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In the film the bats on the head with his image of normality of families, it is almost a disservice to think that there was a serious lack of children in the family dynamics, who actually went and They shot their fellow classmates. Why is everyone so concerned about making killer seems "normal", if they are so obviously not? Totally false and a false image.
