I had absolutely nothing to do on the weekend, and had come with their friends to check out the film ... any movie. And since the only movie we have not seen, was Inspector Gadget, we decided to go with this. <br /> <br /> big mistake. This is a film that can only apply to children. Yes, and it's not like I do not like movies aimed at young audiences. But this film had absolutely nothing to hold my attention. If you do not have anything to do at home, go to sleep. Better than spending your hard-earned money on it. Go check out the movie, if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
