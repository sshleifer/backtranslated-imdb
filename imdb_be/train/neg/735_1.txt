Five-year-old Michael sees his mother getting axed to death by his serial killer "thief" father, who later committed suicide. "20 years later" I grew up, Mike (Gordon Currie, from the puppeteer 4 and 5) invites seven of his friend to his leeward grandfather home to "master their own fears" on the night of Halloween costume party. Mortes, life-size, wooden doll is kept in the attic of an Indian laborer, he becomes possessed by the spirit of a dead father and kills them, using their phobia. Symbols are thrown out the window, drowned in the toilet, eaten by rats, blown up, etc. Morty conditional dad and wood, walking around and doing stupid acuity. Following the discovery of the girl chops and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters remain in the house, there are fun, joke and have sex. <br /> <br /> Morty good design and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees with the original Friday the 13th) amazingly beautiful, like a grandmother, but this thing is even more pointless and confusing than the original and full of false panic, bad acting, the death of brain characters, repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camera operation. Plus, only two minority characters (Indian and half black girl) is the first to die. BLAH!
