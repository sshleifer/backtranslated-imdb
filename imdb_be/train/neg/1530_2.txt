I wish I taped the men in white, so I could watch it again <br /> <br /> «What? And you really enjoyed it, Theo? »<br /> <br /> No, I mean, I could look again to see if he was retarded, stupid, and how strikingly unfunny as I can remember it <br /> <br /> many people claim that this was done for the children. May I suggest that was also made by children? because the whole structure the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of producers and writers, and many of the set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time <br /> <br /> The cast does not help, but I actually started to feel sorry for him. Honestly, can you believe that during the filming of the actors had to lie to their families that they were filming the hard core porn such was their embarrassment because of the need to appear in something as dark as it is. To give you an idea of ​​how bad the acting whenever Malibu babe Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the story I waited patiently until she again then after a few seconds, I forgot it was in the movie. Got that? Malibu is a star with a few seconds, you forget that they are in the movie. That tells you all you need to know about WHITE MEN standard <br /> <br /> enough, he tries to be a live action cartoon-like sweetness (though depressed mood would be better adjective for this film) Fair, though perhaps film deserves credit never stooping to toilet humor, but considering that this is a film of children (that did not stop him OTVAM broadcast at 11 pm), then there should be close to the excesses of humor in it anyway
