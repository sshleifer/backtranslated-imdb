This is one of those horrible, sex-driven B-movies that could not play anywhere near the theater. Women run dressed in half-naked "bunny" clothing, a very fat woman burden of many tasteless jokes, and they all work in a restaurant dirty old man, who has an eccentric son (Jim Hanks, who, of course, Tom's brother), of which a person wants to "put" . Hanks actually kind of good, but this film goes nowhere and does not make any sense. One has to wonder why it was even made? However, due to the performance of Hankey and a few moments of entertainment (but no more than a few), she received a star "2" out of 10. I think that I was good, though.
