I bought this movie on the trunk of the sale, so I did not expect that it will be a horror film at the same level, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought he was still It will be quite nice to look at. However, it was not very pleasant, but instead of action and the overall layout of the film was in a state of, for example, ways to Â«unsees killer" murder their victims and, like all people have died just happens to young blonde woman. It was a stereotypical horror movie. I say this because of the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blond women at risk, most killed. 2) One survives, crawling in the dark while being chased by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help comes in the form of a shotgun! <br /> <br /> With the help of three simple points I saved you two odd hours, summing up this poor excuse for a horror movie, so that you are now lucky enough to watch it.
