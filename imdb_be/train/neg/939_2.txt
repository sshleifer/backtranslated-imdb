I loved Batman series, and really looking forward to it. But they tried to do too much. <br /> <br /> Why do they have a history of Adam West and Burt Ward is trying to restore the Batmobile was behind me. I do not want to knock Burt and Adam for the way they look now ..... It's been 35 years since they appeared in the Batman and Robin, but to see them dressed in suits and dresses «badguys» The fight was kind of sad. I'd rather just see the ex-star making a comment. Batmobile side of the story was silly. <br /> <br /> As for the retrospective of the film, I think it was too short and do not install too much. It was in fact only a brief overview of my opinion. I would like more background. They showed the Penguin and the Joker for about a minute each time to say the same stuff I already knew. Joker had a mustache for makeup and penguin was smoking, even though he hated and was a former smoker. That was it on the 2. <br /> <br /> I would like to read a book. I'm sure he has more in it, it showed. How and why are there 2 Riddlers or why Catwoman-3 or 3 Mister freeze. Where Commishioner Gordon, Cheif Ohara, Alfred, Mr. Freeze, Tutankhamun, etc. The list goes on. As I have already said that even those who were in it, barely in it. <br /> <br /> It is very disappointing. And really corny.
