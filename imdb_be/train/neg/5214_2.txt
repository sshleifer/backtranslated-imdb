METAMORPHOSIS I'm working my way through a chilling Classics 50 Movie Collection updates and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film in the set. Released in 1990, it seems METAMORPHOSIS remake of Â«The Atom Age Vampire", which also featured a scientist seeking similar results. Set in modern times, METAMORPHSIS not my kind of horror film. <br /> <br /> University researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that will prevent aging. Under pressure from the administration to publish their documents; and some of the results (or the risk of loss of funds), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! On the ground, thinking that he did not suffer any adverse side effects, he eventually discovers that the serum has really changed it in unexpected ways! <br /> <br /> Effective unnatural; and performances have left me with a lot of declining interest in the film. The cost of procuring. And the science behind the experiments and their results are not only wrong; It is absurd; it is funny ?? in the best case. <br /> <br /> As mentioned other end of the gag becomes 30+ minutes, which is seemingly endless. Without giving too much, I would call this, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Meet the Creature from the Black Lagoon meets Home Alone."
