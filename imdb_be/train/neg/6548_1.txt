If you look at it without realizing the idea that the story is about, you are in for quite a surprise. Even then the synopsis painted a fairly reasonable story line, but the real movie is deceptive. <br /> <br /> As a summary went, he talks about obsessive climber, you will see, as a prologue before the opening credits and crawling text, which tells you that there Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in the mind of dreamy manuscripts (note to him ?? this spells problems with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortal yearning for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and the notification of all parties, the climber, and a synopsis explained that they decided to contact them via alchemy, creating intellectual sphere to meet the man. <br /> <br /> What this translates to is a recurring part of the animation, that 5-year-old child can perform. There are forms created, although the merit in the style of a traffic stop, and put it through the numbing loop. And repeat until your eyes begin to stick together, and then move on to the next scene. Anyway, Chonopolisians (if the term exists) really love their sticks and balls, repeatedly playing conjure up that magic ball, and having a field day playing with him before releasing it into the "other" world. It gets no better, and if a person interacts with the sphere in another hypnotic melancholy and sleep inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Thank God, of course, that during operation is shorter than that advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against 70 indicated. Firmly dated, its dull colors, there is no story, scratchy soundtrack and repeat photos will not win a lot of fans. Do not waste your time.
