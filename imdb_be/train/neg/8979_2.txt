It was Jon Pertwee, who said: «It`s very hard to be funny, but it is very easy to be stupid." Well, if `s case pasty FACES« easy ». David Baker (as director / writer) and his cast, it seems under the impression that the comedy involves stealing scenes and superior style Britcoms like ZAMOKLO HAVE .. and the needle, using a completely undeveloped script and jump up and down, speaking in very fast voice is very loud. Alan McCaffrey is particularly affected by this type of performance OTT, but not enough to ruin the film because it`s not enough film to break. <br /> <br /> paste FACES terrible on all fronts, especially scriptwise. I can not understand why it ended the way it did, it just seemed to be staying in a very harsh and stupid manner. Oh, and other egregious mistakes that you need a visa to visit the United States and a green card in order to work there - This movie would have you believe, you can go on the plane and start a new life in America without permission - is you still pay to donate blood in the United States - people who I know, in America, and who donates blood to tell me the payment for the donation has stopped a few years ago - and what you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop. As far as I know, gun laws in the United States vary from state to state, but not the weapon shops do not sell anti gun on the counter. So we `ve got a very mistaken view of America from a very unreal and so not funny film. Maybe it was revenge for the BraveHeart very Hollywood kind of Scots? Maybe, but that doesn`t stop FACES pasty from being crap comedy
