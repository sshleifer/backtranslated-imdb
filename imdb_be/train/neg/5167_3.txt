I rate this film with 3 skulls, just coz the girl knew how to cry, it might have been a better movie if the actors were better, the twins were in order, I assumed that they were evil, but the elder and younger brother they sucked really bad, it seemed that they read the script instead of acting them .... spoiler: if a vampire why they freeze the blood? vampires can not drink the frozen blood, the sister in the film says, let's drink it while it's still alive .... but then, when they move to another house, they take the cooler they are frozen blood. spoiler end <br /> <br /> This is a huge waste of time, and it made me wisely Sogom I read all the reviews about how great this movie was how many awards the film won, and this film was F * *** s s ** t !!!!
