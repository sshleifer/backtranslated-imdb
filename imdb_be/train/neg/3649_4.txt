This is true a little show about paranormal phenomena, although it feels like Art Bell, and that figured out how to carve a career out of the relationship, that Carl Kolchak example. Of course there is, probably will not be in the X-Files, if the show is not targeted this audience for him as well. Darren McGavin not exactly super-heroic type, but it is plausible (enough) the guy to deliver exploits. Check out his work on some of the old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here it is the main attraction, does not seem to be a girlfriend or wife, it's a distraction. In fact, there's not a lot of sex appeal to the show. Something I noticed is the fact that the stimulation is not very disturbing in a typical process. There's a lot of humor idle this show. Sometimes it just Pokey to reach the climax. There's a thread of the show coming all the way up to this crazy show in terms of style. Not that David Chase writes Mad Men, but the people who worked under him Soprano and determined to emulate his legacy Serio-comic tones.
