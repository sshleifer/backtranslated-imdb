This so-called prequel remake just poorly done for a better version of Dangerous Liaisons. Charts identical to most of the script. I loved this book it is based off of, and I loved the first film, but I will not even bother with the third film. Pointless banter between the two main characters in a prequel was quite predictable and banal, and ... I just can not stress enough how bad the movie was. If you do not want to take my word for it, just watch, and you'll see what I mean. If you read a review that says "if you like the first one, you'll love the second," just because it's because it's exactly the same film! Although the plot is not even that good. They took as many lines from the first film, it is difficult to say which movie you're watching.
