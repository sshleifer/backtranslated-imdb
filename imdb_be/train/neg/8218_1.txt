I never finished the film for a reason, it was horrible, and that's just the action. I was not even sure that the film was the fact he had not done a lot of sense, and the violence was awful. I mean Ususally I love some of the nude in the film (laughs), but that was just sick due to what is happening. All the characters are annoying me, and it was just full of loud screams and camera shaking to pieces, and it looked like a sequel to Blair with the project, but without any merit. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and I would like my time back, please. I would not recommend this movie to anyone or even consider it. (N)
