This movie made me feel as if I've missed some important scenes from the beginning. We had continuity errors and graphics, which stopped as suddenly as they began. I was very disappointed, because I like Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, in addition to what is always trusted and respected Denis Glovers taste in the choice of roles, "Grand Canyon", for example. I just could not finish the film, after what seemed like an eternity, but probably only a little more than an hour; we had to turn it off. There was not a comedy, there was nothing about the characters that you empathize or sympathize with them, there was arousing emotions in general about this movie and clips of their past have been poorly edited, confusing and unnecessary. What might be a good idea for the film, even as drama and comedy (although I think the comedy in this situation it would be better, because I love watching white people are worried and start to behave like complete idiots, it makes me laugh) It has become a waste of my $ 1 credit to the video store.
