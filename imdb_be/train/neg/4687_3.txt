Spoilers (although there is not shown in the first two minutes of the film) <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is not really very good at this as a friendly, lonely, emotionally stunted loser Sy. He makes a very human, even sympathetic crazy, and really disappears into the character - no small feat for such a well-known artist. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the rest of the film is such a waste. That support speech (and artist) will not look out of place porn (it does not help that every character, but Sy are made of 100% cardboard) in the soft core. Sometimes the director in fact, seems to be trying to disrupt the intrigue: we know from the first moments, a) that Sy is complete neispravnomom-work, b) that he survives, and c) that he gets caught in the end the police . So we are left to ponder this and Whys Of how, and the answers are not all that interesting. <br /> <br /> plot contrived and perseverance, and shows some meaningless moments (for example, the husband scolds his wife for her expensive tastes, although she seems to spend all his free time at the local discount supermarket). About two-thirds of the way through, Sy doing something so stupid irreparably, that makes you wonder how much he really cares about his grand scheme of revenge. Finally clich√©d explanation of his psychosis, straight from `Peeping Tom," a terrible excuse. <br /> <br /> The dialogue of the absolute worst kind. It is not overwritten, or uncomfortable, or incredible, or bad in any other manner that could be considered fun, even for those who like a bad movie. Instead, each line is a pure, ugly functionality - it is as if the director has transferred the plot outline in the newspaper copywriter and said: Hey, I need a workable script on it - for an hour. It made me want to cry, to be honest. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a return to the most suburban BEWARE aid thrillers eighties and nineties ( `The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," for example), and while it is certainly unpleasant, it never really scary. fetishism in Sy sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable, but by itself it is not enough to make the film work. In the end, the lack of skills of all the participants, except for Robin Williams, the buried. 3 of 10.
