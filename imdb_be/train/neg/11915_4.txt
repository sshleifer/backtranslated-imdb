It is obvious, non-produced pilot for the television series feature young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as the amnesia some pretty unimaginable forces that must be put to use when the man turned the flying demon to produce in the world. CR CGI for television work, and Appleby OK like amnesia, but it's hard to swallow as a superhero. A familiar TV face Richard Burgi along for the ride as the Appleby teacher, but he can not do anything to raise this dreck above the mediocre level. We see way too many cartoon flying demons from the start, a bad sign. Also, the scene where Burgi Appleby trained for battle really funny. They are a bad copy of such scenes in several other films in the first place REMO WILLIAMS.
