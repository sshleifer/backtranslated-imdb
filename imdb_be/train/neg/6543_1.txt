In the 1990s, we began to have a day time talk show sprouting up left and right. Each network had one, and they all have one thing originality. Ricky Lecco were just another show to entertain obesity trailer park mother with Marlboro cigarette hanging from his mouth during breastfeeding one of her dozen toothless, illiterate children. English and other cornerstones of humanity, which destroyed it shows existence. Titltes from the girl you Pigeon head and so on. How can someone wants to watch this pure and full garbage? Has our society really was nothing more than a bunch of Billy hill and dead beat parent? People who appear on the show were Trash. People who watched this show were Trash. Anyone who wants to see this show back on the air, or put on a DVD is the trash. People wonder why Americans are huge piles of fat and too fat to even get a job, have it show how to say it's good to be overweight 500 pounds, and have a 12-year-old girl behaving like a prostitute. With this stuff on TV destroy morale.
