It was pretty awful film; I found the music to be effective for this purpose. In the photographs taken by Mario from the village also unnerving. Nevertheless, I had three problems with this film. One of them is that the lighting was very dark, so for a while it was hard to tell what's going on, but it may have just been my copy. Secondly, at the beginning it is not explained very well, and I'm still not sure what is happening there. The third problem is that I do not understand the ending, but apparently some people do. Of course, there are the usual problems of people who do stupid things, and man's role is very 70s. In general, watchable but not even close to a loved one.
