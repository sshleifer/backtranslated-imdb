I saw this movie on the secret science theater when it was called "He lives at night." This name is much less than the misleading «Batpeople». In fact it would be more accurate to call Batperson. This film is about a doctor who studies bats, I mean, because he wants to make the best cure for rabies. It is not entirely clear. What is clear is that he and his wife take a guided tour of the cave, and he gets bitten by a bat. Why the scientist must take a tour to study bats me. Should not he be able to go it alone. Well after the bites, he and his wife go on a honeymoon, where he begins to have seizures. They go to the doctor's worst ever. The guy is in the hospital and kills the nurse. In the end the guy is killing 3-4 people, and his wife is worth it, and you should be rooting for him, not the sheriff investigating the murder.
