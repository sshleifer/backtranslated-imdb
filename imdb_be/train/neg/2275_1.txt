Remake of Amenabar in Abre Los of Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as the master. For the dubious benefits of the English audio track, we suffer soulless performance of Tom Cruise, as usual, with zero depth. So, the character is identified with his persona, but we tend to give some character that is sure to keep our interest. His empty posturing denies any erotic energy, which could be between his character and Cruise and Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is a valid exercise, which involves the use of a mask to make the actor to enrich your presentation nature of verbal and body language means. Cruz masking only painful stresses its inadequacy as an actor. See 1997 Amen√°bar original open your eyes!
