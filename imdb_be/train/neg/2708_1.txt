This film disguised as a social comment, if in fact it is just as absurd as it condemns racism itself. The premise of this movie: African American = Strong ... any other race = weak. Worst of all, when Rapaport pulls a gun on Omar Epps and the Jewish guy. Jewish guy, stereotyped manner, crumbling in fear and began to beg for his life ... but a big, strong, defiant Omar Epps stands strong without fear. We also have the conviction of every member of the fraternity as being arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. Raped a white girl, of course, begins with a view of lesbianism, because it is simply poor white girl after all. If the brake white guy he rejected members of the brotherhood, of course, should fall with a skinhead who Incredible cowards; especially big muscular guy who shot down quickly strong black men. Wait ... Basta twice to knock GUY HIS SIZE ??? Yeah, right. <br /> <br /> Of course, black people will never abandon their own people and Omar Epps is moving along easily with them. The scene where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line just silly - it is, of course, is the dominant, and his weak white neighbors sit in fear of him, and eventually quit. This movie was horrible and the ending of me actually laugh. For too long, slow becomes fun with people that they do between the Epps and the banks - it's like watching my nephew and cousins ​​faces alone (and they are all under the age of 5 years). Do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.
