"The city called Hell" (the so-called "town called Bastard"), British / Spanish co-production, was made on the heels of the success of Clint Eastwood in the Italian production of «Man With No Name» trilogy. The template that is used in most of these films was to hire a well-known American actor, whose career was in decline and rewrite their voices. This film is no exception to the fact that they use some British actors, and with the exception of. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to summarize the plot, but here goes. The story begins with the rebels or any other, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau raiding churches and killing everyone inside, including a priest. Fast forward to the subject of the city a few years later, when a character show disguised as a priest. The mayor of the city (Savalas) hard leader, who does not think anything massacre of justice with a gun. <br /> <br /> Throw into the mix a sad widow Alvira (Stella Stevens), who is looking for her husband's murderer. Add to that the fact that she was going around in a hearse was lying dead in a coffin, because God knows why. After the mayor killed by his henchman La Bomba (Al Lettieri) city broke into FEDERALE Colonel (Landau) in search of rebel leader (I'm sorry, but the name escapes me). Colonel takes over the city and begins execution unceremoniously inhabitants to make them reveal the personality of the leader. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that they opened the side of the film on the side, it's hard to tell from the dialogue that Landau and Shaw characters know each other. Blind (Fernando Rey) claims that he can identify the rebel leader, touching his face.

Shaw spends most of the film, which reinforces his trademark look at one convenient. Even Landau can not save this film. Beautiful Mrs. Stevens completely wasted here. Just made Peckinpah in "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" Last year, I found it odd that she will appear in this mess the film. Savalas took a few of these paintings ( "Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" come to mind) during his previous Kojak period.Michael Craig in it somewhere, as a character named "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey has appeared in many of these "Western", although it will play the villain in the two «French Connection» films. Al Lettieri also arising in connection with a role in "The Godfather" (1972) and move on to other memorable roles to his premature death had <br /> <br /> In all fairness to the 1975 version, which I have observed, ran only 88 minutes and not longer working time of 95 or 97 minutes, listed on IMDb, but I can not see where the extra 7 or 8 minutes will be important. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one.
