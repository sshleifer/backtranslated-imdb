..This is one! Very cool space, right from the bat. <br /> <br /> There is a great first scene should give credit where due. <br /> <br /> The loan has a tough character and a decent enough script for ghost stories but here are the things that bothered me: When were the ghosts that I really liked, by the way; how it was done, how it looked ... the only thing was the attitude of the ghost. Because of the way things went down in the first scene, you might think that their dynamics will be different. <br /> <br /> The slowed down a bit too much in the middle, I felt, and crab / spider scene was simply not good. But then the ending is really very good! Of course, basically he said, "The GrudgeÂ» is the same story with polished lenses, but not of the samurai, and that's what I liked about this film relatively. <br /> <br /> Please, someone one of the seasoned style remake this movie. <, Br /> <br /> Supporters of "Silent Rage" I will love this movie.
