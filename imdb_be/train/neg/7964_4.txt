«Creepshow 2" a little more than a pale imitation of the original, designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film. It even increases the shortcomings of its predecessor, which was often unpredictable and despotic. However, for the first time, it was quite a thrill to compensate for this periodic lulls, which leads to uneven, but overall pretty exciting efforts. The sequel has a few decent points, so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent. After a while, he delivers, but most of the time, it just lingers there. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all the stories revolve around a common theme of revenge and just desserts. Wooden Indian comes to life, wreaking revenge on the murderer of his owner. Adolescents eaten aqueous monster. Hitchhiking back from the dead to haunt the careless motorist. None of these facilities are not inherently bad in themselves, but they do not lack inspiration. There are a few surprises and scares. This is a textbook example of unmotivated, in-room with filmmaking. It does not help that it looks cheap film suffers from a flat style of the director, although, frankly, there was not much to work with. In the end, the second story comes off better, but not much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the performance of the procedure, in the best case. George Kennedy, like the unfortunate owner of the store in general, does an adequate, if not particularly inspired work. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is quite good as the guilt-ridden motorist, causing sympathy for her plight, despite the predictable excess material. However, most of the characters are pretty slim in general. <br /> <br /> It would seem that the «Creepshow 2" would have been better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned to pen a script based on a story by Stephen King. Makeup effects artist Tom Savini turns into some good, bloody work. So why does the film a disappointment? I believe that Romero did not really want to make a second film, but was forced to do so for financial reasons. It was a decade of sequels horror, clones, robberies and whatnot, so this one was, of course, inevitable. I can imagine a man to write a script in a hurry, picking up his wages, and runs away. I believe that he had to do what was necessary to get financed their own projects; we can not blame him <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. * 1/2 (with ****) <br /> <br /> New World Pictures Released
