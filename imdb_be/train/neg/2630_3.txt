SPOILER ALERT! ! ! Personally, I do not understand why Pete did not help save the life of Williams, I mean, that would be great to find out why William was motivated or forced.I think secret military are people every day, and there's a rumor the writer was a member of the secret service, now it is clear motivation, known.But well as rent this film does not satisfy you, call an old but used a twist, medium acting it's just a thing in this movie, just to keep you waiting end.Clark Johnson as director of Special Forces I did much better work as this time, and I d but I still wonder how manufacturers (such as Michael Douglas) has left this film in the cinema.
