I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman was on it, so it seemed promising. And it was not until Justin Timberlake came out on stage. He is a very bad actor, and should not be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he is one of the saddest, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He does not put absolutely no emotion, none of his line at all. Why the hell did he cast for the role of Josh Pollack? I think that Matt Damon would be the best choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was still a big disappointment. His character is so dull, it seems a bad mix of the character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It may sound cool, but believe me, it is not. <br /> <br /> At present, the incumbent Dylan McDermott is very good. This is about one of the very few good things about this movie. He just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. It has some really cool lines, though. <br /> <br /> On the history, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good. I was waiting for a big turn when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but in fact nothing has happened.
