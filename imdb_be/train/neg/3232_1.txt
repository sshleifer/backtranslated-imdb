This movie has no plot, no character development, rather than the budget. it really sucks to put it in a short time. Because there is no development for the movie, it really can not even be regarded as an attempt to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture. That leaves two other reasons, perhaps to watch it. In order to be in shock or leave it as a sick little bastard. Well, not up here. Reactions girls just seem silly. it is very easy to say that it is a fake (honest professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they are trying to get with this film. They throw stuffing her, but she was asleep for most of it, so it's just kind of dumb. The only actually kind of it costs a fraction at the end, when they quickly cut off from scene to scene just before the needle into her eyes. But to be honest, she is very ugly, and all incredibly fake, except for the eyes. if you want a good film about torture, go watch Hostel Hostel 2. Not only do they both contain realistic violence, but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people. Plus towing films really work on a deeper level, taking into account the themes as US fears of foreigners, questions morality, testing how a person can go against the instincts of human civilization, and many others. In addition, they are carefully written and contain good humor, if the story does not focus on the V Violence. This is a much better choice for this piece of crap
