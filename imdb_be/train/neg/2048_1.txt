1 is now quite generous here. I really enjoyed the Boogeyman, even if he did not actually develop the Boogeyman on DVD covers, and we all know it! He crawled over me. But this film, it's something else. For the director of a guy who has been around for a long time and directed many films, it looks like it was shot on VHS camcorder for 10 years! History and actions are brutal! David Hess, you let me down too. After playing one of the most feared villains in film history, you've come to this? History and actions may have been able to be forgiven, but if someone has the time to make the video look more professional. There are a lot of shots in the video films that are out there do not like him, or at least not so obvious that distracts your attention from the film. I can not say that this is the worst movie ever, because I could not make it through the whole movie, but it's certainly close.
