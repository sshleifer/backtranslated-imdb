To begin with, I should mention the fact that you're going to feel totally lost more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you do not know why and what for. When you finally understand the things you just know that this is not nothing but a twisted SOAD opera, dealing with mature prostitutes murdered mothers illegitimate sons ... The characters and actors quite poor (especially the young) do not help that much make'em look credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but it outstanding actress, no matter when the film is pure garbage. <br /> <br /> only positive things to say about «Frio Sol De Invierno» is that newcomer Pablo Malo, it seems well-intentioned, and he shot a few scenes that are very intense ... Well, maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
