Group camp was terrible, Naked Mile was a little better, and this is the third straight to DVD in the American Pie franchise seems to be the same quality as its predecessor. Basically Erik Stifler (John White) broke away from his girlfriend after the loss of virginity, and now he and Mike «Cooze» Coozeman (Jake Siegel) join cousin Eric Dwight (Steve Talley) in college. With the promise of many parties, a lot of booze, and enough hot chicks in the hostel, they have only fifty-listed tasks to perform in order to become official members of the privileged. But the threat comes to the attention of rivals, DEC ( "Master") house, led by power-hungry nerds (and sheep shagger) Edgar (Tyrone Savage), who offer more and better than the beta. In order to solve it once and for all Beta and Huck go into battle with the forbidden, for forty years, the Greek games to beat each other in, with the loser leaving. Last champion games, Noah Levenstein aka Jim's dad (the only regular Eugene Levy) runs the show, which sees people tripping bras, gladiator duel, which floats on the water, catching a greased pig, Russian roulette in the mouth with patrons aged horse tinder, wife carrying and drink a full keg of alcohol (with tears entirely disqualified). It all comes down to the sudden death of a man getting a stripper lap dancing, and they must resist Cumming hostel win if Edgar ends up with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap. Also starring FlubbeR Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as a Bull, Nick Nack, Bobby Christine Barger Marge, Italia Ricci Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert Sara Coleman, Sarah Power, Dennis , Endrzha Punkris Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. Number of nudity is very slightly increased as Rudeness jokes, and I could guess what the right one out of five stars, but I like it. Adequate!
