It is not really appropriate consideration, as I have not seen much of the film. I stopped watching. The film is very strong, with a bad drug dealers and street punks, but that's not why I stopped watching <br /> <br /> There was a problem :. I watched just enough to enter a few characters, each of which they were not interested. Everyone was tedious, filthy psychopath, without the involvement of persons who are not giving me anything to look forward. I've found that does not wonder what they will do next, or what might happen to them. <br /> <br /> If there was another person of interest, and I do not mean good or good man, I mean interesting man, I could stay with him. See "State of Grace", to see what I mean. In this film, Gary Oldman character full of crazy, but it is a * very * interesting. Al Pacino could have done a good job in Scarface, but his character is simply not engage me.
