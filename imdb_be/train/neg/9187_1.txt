I watched some pretty bad movies in the past, but what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie. If the production crew has turned into zombies when they came up with the idea to do it because you believe that there must be brain dead, to find pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of most genres and enjoy the "shooter" games, but the abnormal fusion of scenes from the game just made it funny and unwatchable. <br /> <br /> As most have said, there was hardly a scenario and acting was weak. I will not waste your time describing it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who evaluates this film above 4 should be part of a production company or Segal, or they have a very distorted concept of entertainment. <, Br /> <br /> I have to say I was more annoyed by the video store, which made the thumbs-up, which led me to rent it. Thank God, I had a second film to watch, to restore some of my faith in cinema. <br /> <br /> Comic will be correct if he said, "The worst movie ever!"
