Cage (1989) was another one of those low-cost clicks "Buddy" actions that have been produced for 80 years, thanks in large part due to films such as 48 hours. and Lethal Weapon. This one stars Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as the former Vietnam vets, who were lucky enough to work in a local dive bar. Reb Lou cares about because he had saved his life in Â«Nam. But Lu was shot in the head, and now rather bland. Despite the fact that it is huge, Lou has a child's brain. Once, some hooligans have thrown them to wait at the bar, and Lou and Rebb beat the tar out of them. But the payoff is the mother. They crash bar, leaving Lou and Reb with nothing. That is, as long as these two gangsters do not come into the picture (one of them is a real nice guy), who has a plan in mind. <br /> <br /> The film is a waste of time. Maybe if they went all the way they did the hard core action flick instead of trying to mitigate the situation gruesomeness, perhaps he could work. Unfortunately, it does not, and the audience left holding the bag. Oh, well. It's too bad, because you have all the elements for a great B-movie. Better luck next time, I think. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
