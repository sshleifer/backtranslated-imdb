I'm being Puertorican origin, was mixed fillings about this "documentary." At first I was offended that Ms. Perez compared Campos Senor Che Guevarra. In addition, the only point of fact, Mr. John Leguzaimo not of Puertorican descent. His parents came from Colombia. Who would have done research on the subject was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our race rests with the education. This message should be loud during the film formation of our road to freedom and power, I think, that any future efforts of the production team dale nna make it their focus.In my opinion, this film was shaken anti-American sentiment.
