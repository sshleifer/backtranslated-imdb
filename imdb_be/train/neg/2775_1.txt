It was the worst film acting I've ever seen in my life. No really. I'm not kidding. All "based on a true story / historical references" to the side, there is no excuse for such bad acting. It's a shame, because as the other posted, sets and costumes were great. <br /> <br /> The sound track was a typical "Asian style" music, although I could not understand where the "modern" love song came when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking of Mary. I do not know who wrote and sang a beautiful song that, but it was as if suddenly Norah Jones was transported to the 1500s. <br /> <br /> Hershey syrup blood Phycho was more realistic than ketchup splattered during Kwik-n-EZ battle scenes. <br /> <br /> but acting. Oh, so painfully boring. The lines are supplied as bad game. If Gary Stretch to suit donned potato 4H Fair County, it may be more likely. Towards the end, it sounded more like a street gang in Little Italy. Sometimes I half expected him to shout "Adrian!" Or even "You want a piece of me?!» <br /> <br /> Favorite line :. "I'm going to have a baby" when the Queen said to her lover (after iffy on the floor) He says, "A child?" I expected her to retort, "No, a donkey, a chair leg! Duh. »
