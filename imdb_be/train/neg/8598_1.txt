Just kidding! It was one of the worst films I have ever seen! It was so bad, though, it was fun. My friend and I rented purposly him because he looked so bad. Jolly old horror is always good for some laughs. The plot is smelly, some voices were dubbed, the quality was terrible. But I am sure that was a blast to watch it!
