I've seen this movie several times in the late '60s / early' 70s, when he raised his head, like a deer rabies every November and December, as the Saturday matinee kiddie show.It always been fierce competition for CHRSTMAS THAT ALMOST WAS NOT (oops- I can say: "Christmas"), perhaps the greatest, most iconic Christmas film of all time.But the season, that is another review. <br /> <br /> At the time, I was surprised that the screen tint SANTA CLAUS was almost "pink and white", so much was the color of stars torn prints changed color. <br /> <br /> film is its native terrible! I thought then - and still is actually. I was very entertained, as I still have! It's fun to «retarted-elf" kind of way. By the way, the image quality looks much better on a DVD I have now, than it was in the theater, about 1969-74. <br /> <br /> If you wait, it may be "lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas specialization forget if you want to do Christmas FELLINI - read more ... <br /> <br /> inherently Dubbing these foreign films (original version here was in Spanish) always makes them appear "surreal." it adds to the film, the inherent oddness. In addition, it is very scary, and that «mishevious demon" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire film trying to turn a decent kid "evil." One particularly dreadful scene of the young "latch-key" boy wishing that his parents for Christmas, suddenly "port-a-family" out of the giant "Christmas gifts-of-mind" until he realizes that he just wants to see it , lovers of Christmas - and if you Stoner, save the cache - this film will make you think you are hallucinating ... without drugs!
