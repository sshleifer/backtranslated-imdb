I'm learning Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a film with a major Catalan dialogue, in my art-house video store. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... not so happy to have seen him. <, Br /> <br /> Yes, as other reviewers have said, it is well done and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence shocking abuse of children, it is well acted and convincing. (For the most part, that means ... Can Mallorquins undress the corpse in preparation for burial in the middle of the town square, in the mind of 10-year-old boy who was killed?) Oh, well ... a minor detail. Up to this point, it was a feeling of something non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also established in the war. <br /> <br /> Spanish Civil Fast forward, and three children who survived the incident came to the opening of the age. Francesco is a nun working in a tuberculosis sanatorium and two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, and patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, as with many Spanish cinema (apologies Almodovar fans), it is that, with one exception (Francisca) characters are just so dang * Country * Their motives, personality, and the dialogue often simply incoherent. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it comes down to some horrible tiny excess. Be prepared for a lot of pain and a lot of blood. The reviewer, who called it "trash" is fully on track. If it was done 40 years ago, the poster would have said: SEE forbidden love !! Rape !! Murder !! !! BODIES bigotry !! ANIMAL cruelty !! Betrayal !! <br /> <br /> opening sequence is not enough to make the person and the relationship believable characters. To work, it must have a few memories for specifying characters. As it is, it seems bizarre and depressing cross between "Brother Sun" and "Pulp Fiction." If this sounds like something you should see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that does not make me feel that you need to take a shower to wash off the blood and gloom. <br /> <br /> As for the Catalan, a dialect of Mallorca, is quite different from the dialect of Barcelona, ​​although I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently Catalan subtitles need to figure it out.
