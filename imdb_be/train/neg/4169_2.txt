I gave it a 2 only because Natassia Malthe (as a vampire Quintana) looks sooooo sexy in this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's very little logic to this film, but also most of the sci-fi vampire clicks. The film will probably tried too much to break away from traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, he had gone too far, and made the whole story is not only unwise, but funny. <br /> <br /> There is too much gore and too many scenes, rip-out-of-body, which made me feel sick. Good vampire movie should be more reasonable, you do not need to see a lot of blood - we all know, the vampire jumps on a person, he / she will do what a vampire would do. A few groans or cries of all it is necessary to describe the scene (like the one in the end, if Quintana tries to sexually arouse Rosa, all it needs is a few groans, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, this is just my personal taste.
