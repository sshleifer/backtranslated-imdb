If I had not read the book, I would say that it was a good movie. BUT I read a book. Who ever made a screen recording spoil the plot. There are so many changes, that it was not really worthy of the title. changes in the nature, scene changes, the time line change ... <br /> <br /> First of all, who was Henry, and the investigator? They were not in the story. Henry was a person Mitch few, but Mitch was not a policeman. No, you did it so Roz, helped the "shell" of his body and used it as blackmail against ZENIA Roz. The actual so-called blackmail was thought Roz Zenia sleeping with her son and wanted her to leave him. Her son was also blackmailed because he was hiding next gay from his mother. Her son was not even really mentioned in the story. Nor I believe, was his mistress, Secretary. <br /> <br /> Roz in Tony and West were not together in the beginning. He was actually the first to Zeniem while in college. Black flat was their idea, Tony just went away. This is where Zenia and Tony meet, become fast friends. Tony hides his love for the West. Then Zenia left to the west, with cash from Tony, the West and Tony together. After all, to get married at some point the West leaves behind Zenia, Tony again for a short period of time. Just heart broken again. Then go back to Tony. ZENIA blackmail for Tony, Tony wrote a test paper for Zenia. Now the future professor at the college, she did not want her to get out. I tell a character who played Tony did it superbly. <br /> <br /> Charis character was blond, not that it really matters. Zenia does not disappoint her that while cancer Augusta was alive. No, she was there when Harris had a lover named Billy. Father of Augusta, he was a dodger draft in the Vietnam War. In the end, after Harris takes care of Zenii for months for what was actually a drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have a right under the nose Affair Charis while taking care of both of them. Then Zenia Billy turns to the government, and the leaves on the ferry with him. Not with Augusta Harris was pregnant with her tho. Charis was also a split personality, Karen was her real name. <br /> <br /> Zenia died of cut part .... it's dropped or was possibly pushed (we never know) from the balcony and landed in the fountain. It was almost pure grade heroin in the blood, and it is likely she took some, did not know and did not fall, when she OD'd. She was also really dies of cancer at this time. <br /> <br /> He has not shown any of the childhood memories or anything that is the symbol for the reader. The book has been stripped down to its bare bones. Then again, we did in Alien vision. Why could not you just write my own story along the lines that you have made the movie. He was different enough, and I'm sure you could have done more.
