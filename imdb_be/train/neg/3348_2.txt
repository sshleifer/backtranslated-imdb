Version «The Haunting» 1963 has been one of my favorite horror films for many years, so I was ahead of the release of the 1999 remake with a fair trembling. Hardly it seemed that any further may be greater than or equal to the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my fears were well-founded: This movie stinks <br /> <br /> I do not know what to think people who are involved in this film .. Jan de Bont, who appeared to be an accident, when he led excellent "speed" does as bad here (or, perhaps even worse), as he did with the much-hyped duds "Twister" and "speed 2: Cruise Control. "Hey John, stick to the film, will I Liam Neeson is adequate in the role-faking doctor to have-a-dream-psychologist - I do not think he is capable of turning into a really bad performance - but even he could not save the unfortunate scenario and weak plot. Catherine Zeta Jones proves once again (as in the "Trap"), that it lacks the acting ability to rise above the material, which is referred to it. The female lead, which made a big episode «The X-Files," looks lost here, as Eleanor, insomnia hovering on the edge of sanity. And that blonde who he is, more than the ridiculously amazing wooden figurines of children carved into woodwork throughout the house. I do not think it changes the expression once throughout the film. <br /> <br /> (spoilers ahead) <br /> <br /> The reason why the first film worked so well because we were never sure whether the house is really haunted, or manifestations were the result of an unstable mental condition Eleanor spirits actually have not seen the original, leaving much to the imagination. - A distinctive feature of other great horror films like "Changeling" and "The Blair Witch Project." In this updated version, of course we get a ton of CGI ghosts, which are mainly (in the face of a weak script / story) makes the film completely unscary. E / x is not even as big, given that they were made by ILM. Frozen breath is particularly forgery. Effects in Peter Jackson's underrated film "pudily-" I've only seen before that were a lot better. Wooden carvings children who are supposed to look horrible, just look silly (especially if they cry), and CGI monsters are nothing to write home about. Instead, to provide relief from a bad action, bad directions and bad writing, effects only add to this mess of a movie <br /> <br /> Some very stupid scene :. If the other three characters to burst into the bedroom of Eleonora, and none of them does not seem at all surprised to find a huge gloomy demon, which hovered over the bed. The scene where Eleanor "see" the former mistress of the house hanging from the rafters ... especially bad acting here. And last but not least, unintentionally paddle bits, where wooden blonde says uninspired cry that must be a catch, jumps on the piece of furniture, and begins to hack away at the old picture, the evil guy who built the house. We actually get some fun in this scene, as well as a second after his attack, Blond Guy pulled up to the campfire ghost of the old and then gets his head is cut off from the chimney. It was the only part of the movie I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> In general, follow the original 1963 "Ghosts". 3/10 stars.
