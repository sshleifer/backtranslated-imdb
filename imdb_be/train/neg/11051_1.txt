Scary movie, which contains a collection of D-list of Canadian actors who seem so shy that they are on camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable. <br /> <br /> The film is poorly written, poorly edited and poorly aimed. It is unintelligible, incomprehensible and strange - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he gets, but it's the only one in this film to make it - he really has a bad story and screenplay for the job. It is not even enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> camp I have yet to see Van Pelleske to act in a credible manner, and even sub-characters, such as Eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto, rather than on a barge off the coast of Africa. <br /> <br /> Is not the director sees that the "being" looks like a jazz dancer in a strange costume? The fight between the blue and orange lightning lights Pelleske in the "magic" (!?! Because of the lack of a better word), it is obvious, is the result of bad actors, without a choreographer, is covered entirely derived from special effects. There was even a director on the set or in the editing room for this disaster movie (not the good kind)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... do not even waste your time with it, you will regret it, as I did. I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.
