this film really tries hard. if your going to make a horror film, at least give him a reason to believe that catch the viewer. <br /> <br /> You wait and wait through the film, waiting for some more explanation, but it is not. Instead, he tries to be too clever ending and not showing anything. <br /> <br /> what's the point of the film? where it actually happens? and more importantly, what the hell is going on. ,, <br /> <br /> why they are there and how it relates to anything? just another weak sci-fi horror movie. I love fake reviews on IMDb saying how great it is related press releases crash movie (either that or the people have low horizons). it's not worth your 2h at all. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the film is better than the fragile, but at least give you a reason and why it happened, and is the end result. it does not and it just reassuring to tons of supplements to make all feel terrible. this film is about the price when a stranger calls. God, that was lame too. <br /> <br /> great tip, if you're going to make horror make it believable with the arguments and explain to the audience what was going on, so they have a hook in your history. because if there is no argument or credibility, there is no solid hold on anything, and it can be scary. Sun disrespect to the cast or the crew because they've done a good job. it's just poor writing.
