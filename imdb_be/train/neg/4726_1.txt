Another film about the tortured self-centered, arrogant, heartless hateful, self-destructive protagonist, we must take care of. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm very open to all kinds of wall off movies that have as much self-destruction of the protagonist character. What I do not accept this is the fact that so little background of this guy. Why does this guy hate yourself and the world? If the script dealt with this more than they could have managed to cause some sympathy for him. How is he just comes off as obnoxious hated character, not tragic, simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> After taking a lot of effort to make this guy like crazy and antisocial as far as possible and make its destiny as dark as possible to the writer, then have the nerve to make a happy ending ... . <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but he's put a good fight! Man! Do not waste your time.
