Tenants observation was an interesting experience for me. This is the first film I've ever seen where I cruised at speed through a portion of the (non) action - and I normally watch anything from swollen militants in Serbo-Croatian indie and find them fascinating <br /> <br. /> Tenants frustratingly sluggish and more orchestrated. One of the main tasks of the scenario there is little realistic dialogue character, except for a set of parts, where Collide characters "in a very structured environment (in order to make this work, the film need to feel more conceptual, he did not). This leads to a lack of realistic nature, everything seems to be two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> what is the worse for that is the nature of Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I found that its characteristics are very uncomfortable and very unpleasant. At one point I even stopped film, because I was so angry aggression an apparent, cruel and monotonal delivery character, the absence of any other person layer, besides a reaction "on" switch (which gets really predictable after a while) and I so desperately wanted to have some quality to buy. However, one of the the reasons for this may be the pitcher time misty tail of the film (presumably the 70 years, it feels and looks more early Noughties). If it were more securely fixed in the 70s, his character may seem clearer. <br /> <br /> Lighting movie too uncomfortable. All the way to the end, the soundtrack is trying to provide some sand, jazz-steeped atmosphere that just did not come off, mainly because the set was too well lit. <br /> <br /> The tenants, it seems to me, an incredible film. It does not reflect the real people or offer any interesting ways of thinking about race, identity, or the writer's life, whether they are white or black. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, I left with the feeling that this project is needed David Lynch; its terrible, clastrophobic and obsessive type and would have raised as an actor and script into something quite different.
