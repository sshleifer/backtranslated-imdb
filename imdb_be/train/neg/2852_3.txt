This is a thoroughly unpleasant when slickly made film. I tried it because it stars Richard Dreyfuss and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because of the storyline - mob boss is going to be released from a psychiatric hospital - sounded promising. The film is billed as a comedy, variety. That we have an infinite number of shots - you should pardon the pun - people in poorly lit and elegant, when several surreal interiors, shooting each other - in the head, abdomen and kneecap, leg, heart (no part of the anatomy to avoid, it seems ) pronouncing unclear and mysterious dialogue, some of which are supposed to evidently to be of a kind humorous postmodernist method. Goldblum dialogue for the entire movie can fit on a 3x5 card and he is one expression - a sarcastic grin - everywhere. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines are doing their best. Burt Reynolds makes a cameo. list loans Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I somehow missed them (a good move on their part). All of this is cold, sterile, mechanical and doubtful; heir, I suspect, in the style of "Pulp Fiction," "Fargo" and "Natural Born Killers". If you liked that, you will probably like it.
