People who praise the film real disappointment - I hope at least that Leonard will see some good $$ because of this, because his savings were stolen off a couple of years ago, the manager, and now he's over 70, but this the film is simply terrible. At the beginning of Leonardo himself says that he is not sentimental about the past, and then for the next hour and a half of the film emphasizes all the worst elements of the Leonardo sentimental songs. It's so bloody of his endless close-ups of the singers emoting. Cohen interview done here-fi video close-up, and I wanted to see the medium or long shot all over his body! I could not care less about the artists comments, especially those bloated ego boys edges and Bo. None of the performers in the film did not do another song as well as their own music of Leonard, and if you think about watching this and you have any doubts at all, to listen to them. It would be acceptable PBS special, perhaps at a time is shown. But I'm even embarrassed at getting this DVD. If the film finally shows Leonard-performing sex "Tower of SongÂ» he destroyed, Bono takes a poem. Even the rare good performances (Antony, the first issue of Rufus, Martha Traitor) spoiled the context of the rest of this haughty BlaBla. Forget this and go buy the latest album by Leonardo, if you want to pay tribute to him.
