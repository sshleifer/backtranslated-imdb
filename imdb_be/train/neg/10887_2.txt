...... this film is pretty awful, the only thing that prevents me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that I, unfortunately, have seen worse. <br /> <br /> jungle music, juttering demons, and fluorescent UV blood type / teeth / eyes give him that "terrible" look, and the script is terrible ..... this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before you give it up. it is also predictable, but not in a good way. Nothing this movie is not exactly in a good way. I watched it 10 minutes ago, and thought I'd talk a little bit, so that you. (Oh, and the current does not pass the film down, it's too scary)
