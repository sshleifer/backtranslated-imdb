Sorry guys, I already wrote a review for this film, but today was the first day, when I looked at some of the other reviews. There are quite a lot of people who agree with me, but what is scary that there are some people who seem to enjoy this film. I do not write nasty comments or criticize other people's opinions, but I think it's only fair to warn anyone who can discuss whether or not to see this movie. This is not a good film. I love movies, and I'll watch anything, but this movie made it an incredibly short list of movies that I watched and was glad to leave in the middle. If you really are incredibly experienced, watch the trailer ... it was a mistake, which I did because the entire film, in fact, in the trailer ... after that there are no surprises, just some terribly bad dialogue to waste time. I love Vartan in the Alias, and would not want to criticize it, but I think it is my duty to stop other people spend hours of your life on a film like this !!
