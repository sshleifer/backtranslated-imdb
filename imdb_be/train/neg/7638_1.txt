I could not even bring myself to watch this movie to end. I can not comment on the story, as I have not watched the whole movie, and the reason I could not watch it because of the "actors". Firstly, for the most part they just looked tough, and I'm sure their scripts in their hands were just out of the frame - but it's a small problem. The main issue I have with the actors do not really their fault ... it's the one who threw this movie! Well, this film was released in 2003 ... I thought the casting people in their late twenties to play a teenager out of fashion with a new wave! I can not watch a movie where one of the first lines of an adult older than himself, this "I'm 17!" How can someone assume that seriously ????? Do not become a victim of this movie, go for a walk for 90 minutes, and you get so much more than this film could give.
