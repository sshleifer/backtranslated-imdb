One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, for both children and adults. Most of the characters have shown no little or lacks emotion. The lighting was terrible, and there was too much crap about the time of the rise of the day the film was shot (in the river stage where they just get their boats destroyed, there are 4 shots, sheriff and dad in the evening on a boat, Jillian and Molly in the evening swimming, the other children daytime *, when he had the evening * on the river bank, and the doctor, Beatrice, and Simonton at night, rather than evening out of the boat.) The best acting in the film, probably because of the sheriff, Cappy (Although there is a slip of character when the pulse detector * that would be the case, when people die, it beeps * indicates Cappy n measures, it is still moving while he still can hear the beep, and while the nurse additional checks his pulse manually, it again shows the pulse, and then he finally dies.) I believe that this It will not be perfect, because it is an independent film, but it could still be better. Not worth watching, to be honest, even for children. I might as well see something good, like The Lion King and Toy Story, if you're going to see that you will remember.
