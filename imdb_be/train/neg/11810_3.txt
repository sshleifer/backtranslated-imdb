I noticed with some surprise that in the credits, Detroit PD thanked for their participation. Chief of Police even have one on the line plays himself (and, boy, you can say that he can not act). The reason for the entertainment of that in this film the police to shoot first and ask questions later. Nha kind of PR, I think the police want. In addition, this is your standard cops and robbers film was removed to the 70s with a racial point of view. Alex Rocco gets the thankless role Lifer cop who can not get ahead and saddled with a mentally ill wife. He makes up for this with bolts at the local brothel. Harri Rhodes dashing its partner having winding wardrobe and likes chasing suspects when wearing a raincoat. The film moves along until the penultimate shoot-out that makes absolutely no sense (why people who are guilty only of robbery, to take the full force of the police?). Not only do we see a shooting, but since there are four bad guys, we'll see four. Then there is a twist ending, which should leave one guessing that actually would have happened, but only left me thinking how stupid it was. Seeing that the director Arthur Marx was also for "Living carrion Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I would not have asked the question.
