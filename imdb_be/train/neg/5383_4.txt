I think I have to start to say that almost any style of work can be interesting in the part. The real test is whether it is good from beginning to end, that's the reason I gave a similar name for this review. Most of us would agree - even those like me who likes to read a lot of blogs - blogs that can not compare to a good novel for several reasons. In the same way, FEM can not compare to a good film for a number of reasons, and I actually think this is a bad example of independent filmography. From start to finish, FEM feels like the pieces of a video blog. (Heck, even getting some pimping MySpace.) If I wanted to see lonelygirl15 hour - I do not - I would go see it. FEM, while, of course, the grittier, than the atmosphere of the above gum media is so personal that no interesting stories. It's like watching mundaneness of life, which I think most would agree very naturally sad. Still, the creators of the FEM want to greet him, their very postmodern film about the making of the film. Cue my yawn. <br /> <br /> In the end, I came away without caring the least bit about any of it. I'm shocked, I'm really interested in the time-out to write this review, even. This is not something that TEM is very bad, because it is not; it has a few moments where I crack a smile or think that maybe - just maybe - something interesting is about to happen. Rather, it is just downright ... mediocre. I feel so indifferent to it, it's almost an oxymoron fittings :. Hot indifference <br /> <br /> I hope that the creators / "actors" in the film get out of debt on their efforts. They probably will need it if one of them goes out and moving on with life <br /> <br /> See this movie if you have time to spend and nothing much that you want to do. otherwise, pass it, and not have to worry that you missed some great, unrecognized talent. you do not really have .
