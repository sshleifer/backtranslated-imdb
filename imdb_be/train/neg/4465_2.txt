After overvalued success Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror spread like a disease in a sad world of horror films. As a result, in such films as El Segundo Nombre, television, as the production of poorly written, but acted and directed worse. I have not read the book, Ramsey Campbell, but I am sure that the author Doll, who ate his mother does not have much to do with this terrible production. Avoid it at all costs if you are looking for a quiet night sleeping in the open theater. 2/10
