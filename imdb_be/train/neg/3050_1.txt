Just when I thought I would finish a whole year, without giving any film "Bomb" rating, a friend brought the proverbial excrement in my house last night. I feared the worst, knowing his reputation, and it was God awful as I expected. This Mexican made a mess, dubbed into English and made K. Gordon Murray. He got terrible scenery and effects, and has a rather frightening Santa, who does not work at the North Pole, but instead of clouds in outer space, and who has little elves help him to make his toys, but rather all the different groups children in almost every country there. opening sequence, where St. Nick chuckles heartily as he notes, monitors, which show all these kids work hard while singing terrible songs of celebration in different languages ​​seem to go on forever, and without history. Obviously, this is Santa Claus does not comply with child labor laws! <br /> <br /> In the end we get a nasty red suits and slinky disciple of the devil journey from hell to Earth, only to make a little naughty child and turn Santa's Christmas Eve rounds into a nightmare. Watching this film is twisted and trippy experience, and this is due to frighten little children and turn them Santa Claus and holiday forever. Ironically, the name of Jesus Christ is often referred to in this Christmas movie that somehow makes it all the more terrible in the context of all the amazing things that are happening. It's easy to make your own personal list of "worst movie I've ever seen," but I am sure that there is nothing unique.
