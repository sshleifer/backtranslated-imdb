God, I'm so tired of the crap that comes out of America, entitled "Animation"! <br /> <br /> Since the anime became popular US cartoon animators or produce a 5-year-lazy ass drawing style (Kappa Mikey) or some kind of squeak Japanese animation of plagiarism. (Usually spoiling classic symbols) Not surprisingly, anime sun beating American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They do not even try anymore! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard about it last night; I live in the UK, and when I learned that the show first came out in 2005, well, I never knew that the UK was so proximate to the current show.
