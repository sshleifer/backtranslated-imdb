Although I warned correctly actually I sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I usually give each film to break even, and because I thought that a film can not be that bad. I corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Ben Stein Bostwick or can save this turkey drown like a ton of bricks. Only once in this humor left parody parody did I laugh. It was during the scene of Simon Says. Other jokes or poorly done, or just plain unfunny. And some of them actually see you coming a mile away. This film is simply not got what it takes to be a good parody, like a plane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III), or scary movie. A. All of them were funny jokes, B. a good dialogue, and most important of all C. memorable quotes. Men in white have not received D. none of the above. To call this film bad would be a gross understatement. AVOID THIS FILM otherwise you can! I consider yourself warned!
