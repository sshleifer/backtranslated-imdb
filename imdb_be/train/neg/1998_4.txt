My roommate got a soundtrack No, No, Nanette how to duplicate a tape, and she continued to listen to non-stop. Once he finally completely brainwashed me into submission, I found that song to be irresistible, especially famous, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But the rough from the soundtrack, I had no idea that the film was about. So the other day I saw a copy of the video store, and I take what should be the long-lost version of the film. I thought it was going to be strange because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs that I loved was not anywhere in the video that I've seen. Now, I have never seen a version of the musical 1930, but this version was, unfortunately, a disappointment because there was very little to sing and practically dancing, and in addition, that the sound was really bad through and you could not understand what people were saying a lot of time. Indeed only the highlights of this film were blatant fashion in 1940. Nanette is this crazy hat with two feathers sticking out like a rabbit ears and Kitty Kansas has this fancy pen freebie that she keeps on her front arm, and then wrapped themselves in this clean handkerchief. A dance sequence is a bit strange as with Nanette do this thing with a strange ballet pin apom girl imagery overlaid on top of her. In fact, another bright spot of the film was an artist Guillespe, who dreams of becoming an outstanding artist, but currently he is convicted for drawing pin-up girl for the money. I like the way Guillespe keeps it old school and Disses Nanette when his masterpiece, a piece that was supposed to make his career, Nanette sold for a measly $ 5250 Did not she understand that this land was his immortality? Silly rabbit / girl with feather bunny ears on the hat. If you learn? Why did he just do not pencil in a cigarette before advertising men take off work?
