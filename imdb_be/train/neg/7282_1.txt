National Lampoon was once a funny magazine. If you like the stoner hippie days in the late sixties or smug and insolent coke head days of the seventies (when comedy was strengthened with a lot of naked babies) very much depends on your date of birth, but all agree that the most in the early eighties, the average age of was killed whatever remaining spark of anarchic humor that the drugs did not have, and suggestions for how the film and all the more terrible spin-off entries executed additional holes in the hull. Beyond the well-illustrated by the title sequence, there is absolutely nothing to recommend it especially depressing stinkbug. If you make it through the heavy segment opening «Myself Growth", hoping all will be well, tough luck - they do not. Anyone who thought that the idea of ​​a woman brutally raped oil stick was comedy gold deserves to head back to him on a platter of dog mess. If ever in the world do not have enough neurotransmitters, the negatives of this chaotic, incoherent ragbag of poor ideas and horrible performances might well serve some purpose.
