I had to give this movie 1, because it is something that is bad, but does not think that I did not like to watch, because I laughed and laughed, and I even had a few questions. So half the time I was laughing, half the time I said "what the hell is going on?" Or "Why would someone do this?" And so on. I mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects, in the style of 80's nude scene / battle / dialogue / nude scene, and so that the warrior swords flap in the wind as they ride horses. and there are some crappy effects models (those that do not have to be real trees, are they?), and I still do not understand this guy, that they are in the cave, what in the hell is he? a friend of mine told me about these films, and I thought to give a try, I mostly liked the film, people like Ed Wood films, I do not have any real satisfaction from the fact that the film was supposed to be, I look at it on my merry way. So do not let this distract you, if you really thought it was the gunman, that is, I just loved it for other reasons. this is much, much worse than Evil dead, so that it can actually make you think as if you spend your life watching it (which It popped into my head a few times). I think that the best way for most people would be to have a few drinks, have friends around, and laugh on this film. Maybe it's a bit harsh, but I do not think the rent it out, and you will see. Yo.
