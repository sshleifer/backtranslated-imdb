The only reason why I did not kill this one, that Sibrel does show that he has extensive experience in the technical aspects of the film. It's technically adept film. <br /> <br /> It has been said, it is a film based on lies and distortions, which are quite easy to be confirmed. Much of the documentary conducted with the use of propaganda techniques to beat the space program, but not in fact. And the "irrefutable evidenceÂ» Sibrel, that the landing was faked easily refuted, if you know anything about orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching it, but if you watch it on Google Video for free. Do not let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity.
