Overall, this film is terrible, and it was not needed. One of the problems with this film, that there is no communication with the audience and the characters, for example, if it is going to be attacked, you want to feel, "Oh, my God, no!" But you do not know in this case, you I do not care, because there is no connection, what has been done to know the character. In the trailer, it seems that the film will be fine, but there is no stress, so when something really is. it could be, perhaps, some secret but it is not. "All that it is a set of tools." stated on the back of the DVD, you could claim Adoum, it was carefully planned this film and angry, but it is not, the ending was just awful, very straight forward, and pointless, too. Acts as an average or below average, may be even lower. In my view, it was waste an hour of my life. in the "special effects" and sets it was also nothing special, on average, what so ever. There is not a lot of dried blood, or bloody violence, Sun indicates a lot of blood. This film was advertised to make it sound rather strange, but in fact, it is not even worth looking for, I do not recommend this to anyone, if they are not satisfied easily, several fights and sad stories.
