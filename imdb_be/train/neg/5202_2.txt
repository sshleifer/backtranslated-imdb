Contains spoilers plot of the film can be summarized in a few sentences: three boys to hunt in the forest. Two of them, as well as other people get shot in the head without explanation. Last guy can stand in a clear, shout and do anything without getting shot. He starts to walk around the old mill and has a wicked people go straight to his frame without a fight. Convenient villains are dressed in black and look like villains. <br /> <br /> That is the whole story, not cumulative, but in detail. All drawn with a guy standing a ringing doorbell. We are waiting for him. Long shot of the guys in the forest boredom and sleep. We can take a nap with them. One extended shot of the woman next runner could buy out, if we could see her butt and tits bouncing. <br /> <br /> There's less dialogue Terminator, and it's not because there's so much action. The characters just do not talk. And then they do not even have something to say banal, like "I'll be back." When my friend took it for a weekend, I cheer for him, because it's quite a feat to find the camera. To pay money to rent it as a DVD is totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The only thing a bit ridiculous is optional with the director telling how the local police, they do not realize that they were shooting, and treated them as random guy walking around with a gun. If they were filming, I would be confident that it will be more fun to watch a movie.
