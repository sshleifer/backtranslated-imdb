Wow. I thought it might be bland, but it was even worse than I thought! Sometimes I like to look good "car-crash" film: those who are so bad that you can not look away, because you want to see how bad they can possibly get. It's really the only reason I could leave the TV on - morbid fascination. It was not so much the action that was just mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this shot, but the premise and plot that was never meant to see the light of day. The script will also induces a groan. As for the movie, did anyone notice that they used "curtains imageÂ» SEGUE device, like the old 50's TV show ... but without the irony? At first I thought they must be kidding, but the film takes itself too seriously, to use it in a manner insincere. Do not even ask me about the bill ... but the high point is the final song, by Morcheeba. I believe they wanted to leave people with something for their $ 8 ... glad that I saw on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton was hard to find a lot of work lately? I think if you do not expect much, and you want to watch mindless thriller, it would be better than spending an evening clipping toenails, so he deserves a second
