First of all: I love a good Splattermovies, and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but with a zero budget film is neither one of them! The picture-quality so damn low, the most annoying one soundtrack I've ever (!!!!) heard, as well as FX ... well, super-low quality makes some of them do not look as bad as it would in the real the film (that is there is no junk). No concept of wafer thin plot, primitive action and a rare dialogue - I think I counted about 10 offers a whole film, each of which is repeated about 20 times ... It's the same for many movie sequences (may be an indication of what type of audience was made this shit !!!) story, it seems that the boy had to watch his father to rape and murder of his mother, was the psychological damage and, as an adult is touring, doing shows mutilation. So far so good ... But for these pseudo-art idiot directors, this plot line is just to put the cheap manufactured percussion scene in a row, do not talk and do not make any sense (freshly selected intestines are thrown at a naked, bound a woman in earthen hole ... why ?? and why it's the only time you see a woman and a thrower in the whole bloody "cinema") ??? Disturbing? Yes !! Sick? Yes !! Needed? Nope! Artistically? NOT !!!!! Every confuse these cheap Gore-show for art should as soon as possible to see his psychiatrist or should watch Pink Floyd «The Wall», to see how such a topic could be developed in a clever way ... I hope that this was your first and last (!!!!!!!!) film, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all you Gore-heads out there, remember: Not everything that looks cheap and does, obviously does not make sense does not automatically «Art» ...
