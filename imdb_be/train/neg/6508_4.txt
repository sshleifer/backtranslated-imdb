This is a rip off an old Frankenstein premises. Famous scientist was killed in a bizarre accident, and his father, a well-known brain surgeon keeps the brain. Then put in a robotic body of his own design. His brother, an electrical genius, gives a "colossus" pulse for the transmission of thought in motion. The entire project is bad, when the creation is enraged. <br /> <br /> The special effects are underdeveloped. Scenario no. And that sense of humor that is not afraid a bit. Well, very little children will think that it was good. If you wake up at three o'clock in the morning, and it goes on .... night night. <br /> <br /> The leading characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played "Colossus".
