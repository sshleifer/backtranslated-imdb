I just finished a marathon in this series, and it was painful to see how he progressed. With fictionalising historical elements, to a terrible accent O'Herlihy in later episodes, the show just falls further it goes. If you are looking for some products of low quality generic WW2 down, I could recommend one season, but avoid anything after that, it degenerates into a life of one step from a soap opera, with more worst storylines and sensuality. <br /> <br /> the old B & W film, by far the best of any form of entertainment Colditz name attached to it, and even that is not what one would hope.
