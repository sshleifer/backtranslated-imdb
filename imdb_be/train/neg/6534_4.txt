This sci-fi adventure is not the best and the worst is not. I agree with the statement that bad science fiction is comical. An unusual pink tint and unusual special effects make this a favorite for late, late, late show to the audience. Space travelers on the planet Mars to drive away the strange giant amoeba as monsters and other amazing creatures. Pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Les Tremayne, Nauru Hayden, Gerald Moore and Jack destroy. Get comfortable and enjoy. Do not worry if you have a moment to nod. I agree with adding this to the list of cult classics, not to miss.
