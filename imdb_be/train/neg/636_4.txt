Several farmers' struggle in the life of a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the lead roles, dealing with fake accents and emphasize the old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. Good wife, many children and land the best thing for men to have. They are seen as property and investments. Because this is a big budget film in which many of the additional co-operate, built large sets and special effects take place, the filmmakers could not take the risk of hiring the less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance, which is by far the worst in the film. Its unchanging entity builds a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan should be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize. On the other hand, Paul Muni gives better performance, once again showing his talents are. Another problem with the movie is the ending. It seems that Franklin did not know when the end of the picture. This film can be dangerous if it is taken as an example of true Chinese culture and traditions.
