At least with a teenage geek gets the girl movies, the guy usually unpopular with the girls. The 40-year-old virgin, he replaced the old 40 years, which is popular among women, but somehow remained a virgin. But then you do not have to engage your brain with this film, and I miss you a little bit about it being in a coma for 20 years? <br /> <br /> One of a series of films, where 40 behaves like something teenagers and woman for some reason find it quite attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has made such great TV comedy, seems to think that we have to rely on oil and small characters for laughs. They made rough for the film. They have done an act of releasing all Americans have a mental age of 15. Where will they go next? <br /> <br /> This film is dull and horseplay nothing to recommend it.
