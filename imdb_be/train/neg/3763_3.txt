A group of foresters and scientists go into the woods to find Bigfoot fossils.They stumble on the cemetery in the end (PVN did not see in the dark), the CGI scenes Bigfoot is back, but is better than endless scene say they rarely emphasize. I used to think that only can be a good movie make Bigfoot. But now, after so many sad sad movie about the legend, I have serious doubts. Pour the salt into the wound watch this movie, ONE beautiful girl just does not get naked once. And although this one could be better than the "Boggy Creek 2" (feat not there), it's still a pity that the best non-documentary film about Bigfoot remains "Harry HenriksonsÂ» <br /> <br /> My rating: D
