Thank God, I watched it on the spot each other, and do not pay for it. The plot is terribly transparent, and the entire film felt like an episode of the TV show. If you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, to follow. You'll feel feel like a film insulting your intelligence. <br /> <br /> In addition, the actress turned Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst efficient I've ever seen, except in porn. She was lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He is the one who carries the film. <br /> <br /> I hate the fact that I spent almost two hours of my life to watch this movie! It's a shame that they have to call it a sequel, because I was the original, which was a fan is actually very good.
