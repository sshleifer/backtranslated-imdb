I like Memoirs of a Geisha, so I read the book twice; this is one of the best books I've read in the past year. I look forward to the movie, and was afraid that reading the book will spoil the pleasure of viewing the film. I did not expect that the film will be so bad. Some of the best parts of the book were taken from the movie and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo (Li Gong) were the worst. If I had not read the book, this film is a bit confusing and incomprehensible. Plot outline of the film reads: "Nitta Sayuri reveals how she goes beyond her fishing ..." Has anyone seen how and when to become Sayuri Nitta Sayuri? Forget about the movie and read the book.
