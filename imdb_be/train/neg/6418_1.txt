Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of horror movies. I never watch them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see him do it on foot. <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen, do legs, but I'm sure it's better than this ... the movie? Anyway, we really did not expect that it will be good ... we actually just went to laugh at him. Cool with me ... I have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater, but since it was the only other couple say and do, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, 2 others left to go to penetrate the Borat movie, I'd love to have seen on the subject. The movie was not terrible, but not stupid, so it would be ridiculous ... it was just boring. It is not scary as «Baby Genuises» terrible, it was terrible, like ... not entertaining at all. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm no expert, but it seems to me that the problem with the horrors of the industry these days is that you can have a PG-13 horror that sad or scared, or you can have the R awful horror film, which are either too bloody or too disgusting for people. <br /> <br /> You want a PG-13 horror that sucks, but it's funny? See «Grudge» section. Avoid this film like the plague ... because it can literally bore you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
