I usually do not go out of the movie, but halfway through I. This film has promised something else, but I kept thinking I had not seen that before? Spoiler Alert! Another 1, spaceship falls and lands on the ground, well, after all these years, with a super adult on board, however, this thing is still possible to burn and crash! What this advanced civilization can not seem to develop the chassis? For an industry that so liberally, we will see another Woody Allen movie or black, please! Superman rescue people running, making sure that it adheres to the US and Europe is not going to Darkie area, please. Maybe I could digest it about 30 years ago, but now is now.
