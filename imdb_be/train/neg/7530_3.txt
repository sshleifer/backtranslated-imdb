I found the film boring, homogeneous and rather uninteresting with a hasty, superficial "upbeat" ending that does not ring true to the overall story. After these characters through the terrible events of the weekend, unfriendly attitude and the bad news is simply not my idea watchable, entertaining film, and I'm very tired of it, "one note" theme and can not wait for it to end-- in fact I almost stopped about halfway. The entire film just seemed pointless and meandering, and the characters for the most part are depressing and unpleasant, although the effect was good. A small movie with little ambition and a small call - I'm sorry, but it just did not do it with me, and I love a good, small films! This one just did not gel, even though I continued to watch it in the hope and belief that it will be. I was disappointed, especially after two local observers put it on their "10 Best of the Year" list. I highly recommend watching "House of Sand" in place - now there's a good, short film!
