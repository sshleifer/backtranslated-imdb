This film is not only a bad script and the director, but it's just frustrating. Excellent novel terribly distorted in the film. Many changes were made to the storyline seems to optimize the timing. But the fact that the results are simply confusing. Actions can not overcome a script that deletes characters motives, their behavior. In addition, the transition to English is not working, when all refers to as the patriarch Esteban Esteban. Horrible. Please, please, please, beautiful novel in Spanish, if possible. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. It will destroy you, that can be a wonderful experience.
