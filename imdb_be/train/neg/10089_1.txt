German director Ulli Lommel was able to challenge many horror fans thought was impossible :. He overthrew fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of Directors of the worst horror movie ever made <br /> <br /> Lommel did Ed Wood to the new millennium. This film is bad and ridiculous as the best worst EW. I'm so proud and embarrassed to say that I saw it as a whole, painful captured, only to see low-bar can be set. Answer: Underground; Lommel dug a hole and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins with a cast of international worthlessness. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every mechanic, doctor and the postman is an actor or a screenwriter and waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors who want to throw him a conversation with an impermeable face. <br /> <br /> protagonist crime beat cop, played by German actor with a strong German accent. In addition to being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in Los Angeles. Despite the fact that he ceases to innocent women drivers and take them into custody, and then pull them into your home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture store), and does it all in the form of his rookie LAPD partner refuses to investigate, so far to physically attack one of his accusers in a raid on his ninja style apartment. <br /> <br /> many painfully bad. Budget thin seen included enough money for paint cans; enough to draw Â«Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall <br /> <br /> Since the actors were clearly unpaid amateurs -. a sad assortment of European immigrants (possibly deported if they acted in their native land), only a girl, mimbos and desperate middle-aged women - and so little if any money has been spent on the sets, special the EFX, place a value of production, it is only fair to say that they did in the spring for a few present who looks police uniforms. Unfortunately, they could not afford a police car; uniformed police cruising through the streets in a brand new Mercury rent. <br /> <br /> More than half of the stories focused on the dirty deeds of our crazy German officer LAPD and the vain efforts of two young recruits to stop it. One of these young actors is particularly bad, because he is the only actor in this whole mess even with an uncertain shot in a real career in cinema. Other fits right in with the rockabilly hairstyle and tortured Brando posing that must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> In the last part of the film, which received the name of zombies as a victim of our killer resurrected after he kills the girl, who had just visited some beats Priestess have a protective spell to put on it. Do not ask why a girl from Romania will access voodooism waiting to be killed, just accept the logic of Lommel and enjoy the ride absurd. <br /> <br /> After long continuous manual scratching straw coated roadside graves zombie girls unable to make their appearance. They look just like they did before death, perhaps even more beautiful, with black glamor make-up airbrush generously around the eyes. Looking nothing like a zombie, they are more like high mannequin ready for the runway. <br /> <br /> At this point in the film borrows Lommel creative note from his fellow countryman lauded Ball and injected large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno soundtrack. We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Things they could play in Ibiza disco if Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, girls Lommel speak and act like normal ... er, I mean, as they did before becoming a Zombified. This gives our filmmaker opportunities shower us with more of his gold dialogue. So, this is the golden rain. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil anything, revealing a shock ending. All I can say is it is in harmony with the rest of this masterpiece. Ed Wood Spirit lives ... or should I say, his Geist.
