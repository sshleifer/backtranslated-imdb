Like time, I like to try, but watch a movie that looks the way I look at it through the coke bottle gives me a headache. If I was playing computer games that have been in this blurry and out of focus, I would have to upgrade your computer. Maybe it was the look of the director was after, but not hurt the eyes, and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I did not take someone with me on this film, I was there. Even if it were a series, not a movie to say, the band of brothers made it. They made it look like World War II footage, but with a touch of grain, but it was still nice to look at. Movies need real people, with real sets and real-world locations; Using CGI, if it is necessary, not for the entire film.
