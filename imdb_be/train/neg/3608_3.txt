I have a good collection of movies which are, and this one has been added to it. Room 274 to be exact. <br /> <br /> In the name I have going on in the first place. Splatter University. I thought it would be a great horror film. Was I ever wrong. Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst film I've ever seen, but it could be much better. I love all the movies, but this one was the one that was more laughter, then a bogey. <br /> <br /> Poor sound quality is bad, and bad arrangements shot some of the areas that could be improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film is ideal for a good laugh. If you are looking for one of those movies make fun, then this is one!
