First of all let me say that I like to watch "bad" movies. It's funny to see how some of these films leave a lasting impression than their truly outstanding. This movie is bad in exciting malicious way. This car is mad ego Sam Mraavicha in not only bordered on incompetent absurdity, he revised the value of the word itself. This should always be the barometer for bad movies. Sort Mendoza line for the film. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs and stars as a blunt object Arthur Sailes struggling discarded wife and Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben "dead behind the eyes" of the struggle for marriage equality Sheets. As libertarians, I believe homosexuals should have the right to marry. Ben & Arthur more harm to this case than homophobic army. Drawing all things Christian so ugly and clumsy, trademark Mraovich, you can not take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother, Victor, the Bible attracted Jesus freak out so badly over-topom evil / effeminately gay, you have to wonder how he was cast in the role. This is because Sam "multitaskingÂ» Mraovich as casting director. Worst of all, Sam himself Mraavich. If you are thinking that leads a person to do the word paste, hair loss, and chubby come to mind? Sam and supplies line as Domino's pizza, cold and usually wrong. The end result: you suck at writing, directing, acting and casting. A quadruple crown Ed Wood. I congratulate you horrible little man.
