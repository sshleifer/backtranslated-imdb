I just saw Adam had four sons for the first time, and that struck me was that I believe that the model of Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were about the same age as the four boys in the film. Warner Baxter in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard talking about one and the same values ​​and family traditions that you would have heard from our 26th president, without some of the more obsessive aspects of character tra. <br /> <br /> As with all the children of TR Stoddard serve in World War I, in this case, although the younger loses only his eyes, instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But what if a woman enters the minx is all men, domestic and tear things? This is the work of Susan Hayward here. In one of his earliest known roles, Hayward immoral flirtatious girl who marries one of his sons, it has to do with another, and begins to make a play at third. This is an early harbinger of view of the part, which later earned her an Oscar in I want to live. <br /> <br /> I believe that with such a strong model of propriety, as Theodore Roosevelt was and Warner Baxter reflects all afraid to tell his father what was happening. Sons, and their governess Ingrid Bergman. That's where the story gets a little ridiculous. Bergman introduce us as a governess hired by Baxter and his wife Fay Wray for their children. Wray dies and Baxter suffers from some financial reversals in business. Bergman should be released. It goes back to France, and a few years later returned to the family when the children are grown. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not believe that children need a governess at the moment. Hayward is absolutely right when she confronts her, it's not the children who brought her back. In the normal course of things, Bergman would have on her life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film I was cut. Perhaps that could be the cause of numerous plot holes we have. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that Ingrid and Susan could not do another movie together in the fifties, when Hayward was at its height and Bergman had just made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam had four sons. And I'm willing to believe that a good deal Ingrid left on the floor of the room.
