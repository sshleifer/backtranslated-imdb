It was a really funny movie. <br /> <br /> Every one in the movie trying to be serious, that is what made this film so funny. I mean come on the shark's head on a human body. You can get any funnier. Good work Sci-Fi comedy movies keep coming. I never thought that a movie can get more retarded. If they keep it up they will have to rename the scientific fie comedy channel Sci Fi Channel or something like that. <br /> <br /> I can not wait 4 the next blockbuster on Sci Fi. <br /> <br /> the patient is ready with a bowl of popcorn and a box of beer or a bottle of liquor and a patient ready to laugh again !!!
