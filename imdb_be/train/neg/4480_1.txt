Let me start by saying that I have not seen this movie in the first with high expectations. It was recommended to me by a friend with a mediocre taste in films and «MTV» was pasted on the front cover, so I was not expecting much. What I expected was a tear Jerker, too dramatic, but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start that I had never read a book or watched any of the other versions of the film. <br /> <br /> The action was my main gripe with the film. By god it's awful. The main girl pretty mediocre, but compared to the rest of the cast, she Maryl Streep. The main "hero" Hit, it's just awful. He can sing decent songs sounding clichéd, but that's about it. His acting has broken "sad" moments, being so bad at the points, I just laughed. Isabel girl was pretty godawful, too, and my brother was just flat character that was played by an actor who can not show emotion at all. And when he tried, he failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor plays Edward, even though it is obvious that the direction was bad because he did not even live to see what I saw him do it. Yes, his father was not half bad my memory, but he was in the film for a small amount of time I can hardly remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More break-ins than you can imagine. Predictable plot (to the final, which I barely understood). Very one-sided characters that have no real depth to it ... In general, just not interested whether compelling, nothing we've never seen before do much better, and nothing worth watching here. <br /> <br /> The ending suggests, be sentimental. He did not do anything like that. The ending is not accumulated at all, it feels almost like an afterthought. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY ending really happened that, when they explained to me, I had to have a look on my face, "Wait, when they say that? What? ". Never a good sign. Editing was probably the worst I've ever seen, although I understand the census INS-decay has come true, because it was originally made for television, but it's really no excuse. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is just rubbish. I am a sensitive guy, I cried for two Simpsons episodes. I never cried during this shit, not even close. In fact, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a sentimental look elsewhere.
