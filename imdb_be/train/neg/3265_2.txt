I have no idea what the audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy-of-illness. With Redd Foxx in the central role, and quite pimpy dresses and polyester to the carpet around 1970 years, "Norman" plays like a picture in combination blaxploitation with any number of silly comedy episodes provisions related to comic misunderstandings, not to mention the extended Waylon flowers cameo! Based on the game Sam Bobrik and Ron Clark, this tale of estranged married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) training hard way that their son secretly gay - and live with refinement, prancing white gay - just limp -wristed jokes to shame any early episode with "Three in the company." Bailey holds her dignity and apparent confusion Fox is good for a few laughs, and the other performers humiliated. * From ****
