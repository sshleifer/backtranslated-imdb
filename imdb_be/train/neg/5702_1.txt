What a disappointment! I hated the mummy, but this was even worse! It was very difficult and incredibly, and at some point I found myself sighing and yawning all the time. I can not believe that people actually liked this movie. The role of Nicolas Cage was not very convincing. The entire film felt a great tour around the most wanted American buildings. Never ceasing stream of tips and combinations are not very convincing. I stopped paying attention for about 30 minutes. What should have been a total disappointment was a happy night. What a drag ... I guess I've just seen too many movies to enjoy a national treasure.
