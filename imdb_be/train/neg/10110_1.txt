This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I'm not even kidding. It was poorly done and the actors could not act. It was a waste of my time and money. It was like a movie that my friends and I could put together yourself. Case movie came, of course, disguise. Nothing in the film looks like a zombie on the front of the chassis. It turns out that the director or just put makeup black eye liner under whose eyes call them zombies. Credits at the beginning of the film took almost 20 minutes of the film. What to watch loans were the best part of the film. It was honestly terrible movie and I could not believe how hard it was put together. Scenes jumped from one side to another, and sometimes looked like "What's going on?" The sound was terrible, and the action arrows look like a couple of teenage joking make a fake fight scene. <br /> <br /> If you plan to rent or buy the movie, I would recommend that you at least watch this trailer because it shows how horrible it is for sure. I wish I'd seen it before I take it off.
