I went into this movie expecting it to be like The Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, there are poorly written, poorly acted storyline in the film (with CG animated cells and peptides into the bargain). However, the real focus of the film is an "expert" talking heads spewing new age feel serviceable garbage area between segments. <br /> <br /> Of course, it stars innocently enough. There are several real quantum physics, at the very beginning. He argues such that electrons exist as both a particle and a wave, and that the atom is mainly empty space. Nevertheless, the film takes a giant (and unscientific) jump, saying that the subatomic quantum effects occur on a large scale as well. Talking heads to take a step further. According to them, the following conditions: <br /> <br /> When did Columbus arrived in the Caribbean Sea, the locals could not see the ships because their minds were not able to perceive something. -Meditation can reduce the murder rate. C positive thoughts, you can walk on water. -Your thought can change the formation of ice crystals in water bottles. <br /> <br /> And hey, it's only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the film was torture. This movie felt like a movie, they will show you, to get you to join a cult. After doing my homework, I realized that it is in principle simple. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it can be considered as mannerisms comedy (although this is not funny). <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: Do not watch this movie.
