It is obvious that all the good reviews posted on this film so far from insiders who are either involved in the film, or who knows someone who knows someone, and therefore saw a few cuts. Well, I do not know who is involved, and I have seen the final version, and it's pure garbage. The only thing it has going for it ambition and a few cameos from horror legend (not on the screen for a long time). It's as if the filmmakers made the film for the weekend during a horror convention and got actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Berryman to shoot scenes during coffee breaks. This ultra-cheap video shot imitators X-Files with a terrible action from the cast of non-professional actors with plenty of mullet than acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; it's all too clever dialogue that tries to explain aimlessly twirled plot. Þér computer FX is a joke, but not enough of them, nor enough action to make this film an enjoyable way MST3K. After about 8 direct scenes nothing but talk, you'll find yourself reaching for the fast forward button ... and does not let go. Absolutely nothing.
