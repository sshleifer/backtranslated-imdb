I would like to say that in contrast to the many people who did not like this film and found it impossible to understand, I was quite unable to understand what it is .. very incoherent attempt storyline. <br /> <br /> I do not like to throw that word around, but in this case it is very well suited. Director, first presents the material in a very "arrogant", as well as worse, it is very unclear. It is incoherent in that it presents the material in a muddy clearing the order, forcing us to think that the director was too drunk to remember what scenes come first, contemptuous that after 2 hours long they expect us to viewer CARE the end of it. <br /> <br /> I respect surreal movie for what it is. (By creating a story around more than in the real world, which does not adhere to the real life), but there's nothing surreal about the story placed in the usual modern times and modern furnishings Earth Day, the most important thing, is not able to attract the audience but, in addition just knocked out a series of events that just tied together. The most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film, as viewing the story; maybe even a good story, as it was based on the book, but being disappointed that the camera does not seem to capture the necessary points and tie means any coherence. <br /> <br /> Let's compare the stylistic film. Compare Noe in "Seul Contre Tous" to it. He gave us a complete, extremely interesting and intellectually deep history. This film does not offer intellectual study, and while it is very fragmentary stylistic presentation, the director, is ultimately left a significant art a good storyteller, and all we are left with a mess of events that just tied together. <br /> <br /> So, it really is possible to make sense of things .... the point. But, as I said before the viewer reaches the stage where they just say: "Who cares," He plays like a man watching the monotony of the secular history of going to the supermarket and buy products in order uncronological.. Even with the killings it is completely uninteresting and unengaging. Too many people these days are giving high marks that they are unable to understand or make sense simply because of the fear of looking ridiculous, and in every possible way this movie is trying to make the viewer look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time on your hands, then please watch this film, taking into account what I said about it. This is a story based on the book, which could be presented in a much more efficient way, and this is my bottom line of reasoning.
