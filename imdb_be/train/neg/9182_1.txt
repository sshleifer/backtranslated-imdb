Just like everyone else said, acting entirely horrible, no story or even a bad direction. On SFX, 360 degrees, matrix style of shooting, 1 shoot silly enough, but for each of the characters. I mean come on give me a break. And what's with all these video game scenes, just to remind us that this is "a video game adaptation"? Jesus, they should be fired who came up with this idea. <br /> <br /> 0,00001 / 10
