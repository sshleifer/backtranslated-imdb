I'll tell you what happened, some people with money think that it would be good to destroy one of the best show that was on TV. Do we really need a big screen to re-do? Did they ask the fans? Interestingly, all the fans would feel if they did a remake of «Rocky Horror Picture Show» with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, took all the music, and made it a drama. How do you think they would like it! This film does not have the same feel to it that the original was. Of course, the original was a little sweet at times, but Bo and Luke have always been good, they are in trouble, because they always have been created to get into trouble, and their main goal is to help people who have passed through the city. Nobody did not matter to the people who made this film, they would never even seen the original show all the way to the end. My big issue is that they will destroy next?
