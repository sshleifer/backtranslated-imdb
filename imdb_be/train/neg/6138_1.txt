This film was God awful, from concept to execution. The United States should create a «Star Wars» site in this distant country? It's their premises? Way to get the United States access to a conclusion, to win the obstacles as cross-country race, where the winner may request that any leader. And who better to win this race, known as the "game" than a gymnast? Of course! Gymnast is an ideal choice for this task. And do not forget that his father was a detective. Luckily for our hero, there happens gymnastic equipment in safe places like the stone horse in the center of the square (without reason) in the middle of a crazy city. Perfect. <br /> <br /> But beyond terrible, HORIBBLE room is uncomfortable fumblings romantic scene, then, obviously, greatly depressed Ninja, whose only job seems to be holding a flag to indicate the path of the race, and the worst menopause kogda either. After winning the race, our hero highlights the desire of the US government. And lo and behold, all these efforts are worth it, because the United States are "Star Wars" website! Hooray! TRIUMPHANT IS YOUR END! Wow. <br /> <br /> Still, being a bad film, it can be very interesting to watch. Cover one showing of the ninja assault rifles, it was enough to get me to make this film. <br /> <br /> But if I ever meet with Kurt Thomas (gymnast-star) in real life, I'd probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists in the layout position.
