1 of 10. <br /> <br /> This is a film that you can not believe you just wasted 2:00 of your life, how do you see the role of credit. I honestly think I could have done better vampire movie .... and I do not know anything. The only thing that does not just suck (stronger than a vampire) Jason Scott Lee .... his character, at least, a little cool, has a secret, and starts a little stock.
