I found this film to be a complete dissapointment. Talent available DIRECTOR especially Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the four main conclusions) - were completely spent on unfunny, mediocre story whose conclusion one could not take care of the time put in a desperate, stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just annoying (being reprized his role with great accuracy, minus the humor), Crystal simply playing his same old hyperactive, neurotic annoying alter-ego and Cusack just walking on his part, apparently bored with the whole project. <br /> <br /> for what should be a "Romantic Comedy", there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, not to mention the chemistry as well as for the comedy- (possible SPOILERS) well, just moments left on gentle humor back role Cusack in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin- writer obviously whatever is not able to show any originality. (Spoilers) Azarov was quite amusing as a Mexican lover and Walken made quite a funny turn as a parody of the type of arthouse individualist-Dogma directorship, but these parts are a very little screen time, and instead of (Spoiler) we were treated to Billy Crystal what his scent sniffing dog. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a huge fan of most of the works of John Cusack, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely let down by a film with a lot of good ideas, and at the same time does not want to investigate or more information about any of them, instead of having to come to the same old cliches of genre and even lowering himself to a depth of almost a "gross-out teen movie" humor at times. <br /> <br /> very poor 4/10.
