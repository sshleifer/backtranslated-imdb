Ah yes, the series VS, MVC2 be top. It's been said before, this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job, unfortunately, the gameplay is half done. Do not get me wrong, it's fun, but you're tired of mashing buttons. As for the short story, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot. Punch that guy in the end and win! Oh, who is playing in this they themselves anyway?
