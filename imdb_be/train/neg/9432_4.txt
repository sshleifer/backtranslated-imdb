"Upset" is an amazing film, forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. It's really hard to write a satisfactory review of this film simply because of the fact that the movie is so unique. This story is quite exaggerated - three young women on their way to a rock concert to get into a car accident and ended up stranded in the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her daughter spinster. Very soon, the house realize that something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing sounds from the attic. In addition, the mother and daughter, it seems very, very strange relationship, as they quarrel intensively before their houseguest for dinner. Old mother, even goes as far as calling her daughter a slut and a whore, and accuses her of sneaking guys at night to sleep with them. In the middle of the film, when a girl finally decides that it is better to wander around to find help, the killing begins. <br /> <br /> As for the action goes, this film is in the bottom of the barrel. None of the three stranded girls can not act, in particular, the "lead" the girl. It is almost incredible to hear them deliver their lines in the same wooden tone throughout the film. Mother and daughter better, but not much. The film is also quite dull in parts and actually really fascinated. These murders are terrible, but nothing we have not seen before. However, as already mentioned here, the film really earns points with brilliantly disturbing and bloody finale. It comes completely from left field and has the same value as the impact of the camp classic ending «Sleepaway Camp». Unfortunately, the rest of the film boring and suffers from terrible acts and boring, sad stimulation. Isolated, looking slider mansion and dark, foreboding lighting really give the film a grainy realism but quickly shattered when one of the characters trying to act. It may be worth it if you can not stick to it until the end, but I tell you better just fast forward to the last 10 minutes. 4 of 10
