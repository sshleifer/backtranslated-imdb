Well, I kind of like the idea of ​​this film. I'm at the age demographic, and I kind of identify with some of the stories. Sometimes even tacky and pointless dialogue seems half-realistic, and in another film would have been excusable. <br /> <br /> I try as much as possible, so as not to smash that film, as did the others, but it is not so simple if the filmmakers did not try at all. <br /> <br /> editing in this film is terrible! Perhaps the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you should not go to film school to learn good based editing is not one of them, but there are poorly defined. <br /> <br /> In addition, the shot ... Oh my God shots, just awful! I can not go into details, but sometimes we just see random things are, and that, combined with the editing will give you the most painful experience of watching the film. <br /> <br /> This film is done at low or no budget with 4 cast and crew members is not an excuse, too. I saw a short film on YouTube with more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what the heck you were thinking, but this film is not that other, as both your ego masturbation. You should be ashamed! In conclusion, this film, like what really lazy amateur porn movie would be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes, separated by long, boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. If this is not your kind of thing, avoid this at all costs!
