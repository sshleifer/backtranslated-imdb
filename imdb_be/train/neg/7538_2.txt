I watched this movie, because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it strange and completely pointless ... so I decided to dig a little bit and got my hands on a copy of the 70. Wow. what's the difference. The original one was much better. I would like you to know that in fact it was initially to make a statement, this existence really has a purpose. It was really a Christian community expresses their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it and to make observations on life, but I do not want to go into detail, simply, to put it simply, if you were disappointed, and you want to know what it should look like, feel free to watch the 70s version, a little dated, but much better.
