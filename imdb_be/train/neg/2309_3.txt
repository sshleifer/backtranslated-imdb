I have a high tolerance for weird, but opened some films go way, way beyond amazing - so far, that they make your brain hurt. This is the kind of movie. Trying to understand or explain it is impossible, and I think the movie is better understood by taking drugs. - this is what is incomprehensible <br /> <br /> The film begins with some very cute Japanese animation featuring a cat. However, out of the blue, tone twisted and sometimes disturbing things happen - makes me wonder when I lose something in the translation. However, even if this is so, why should we relate to images of the magic trick involving the separation of the house with a reasonable, stool, vomit, animals lighting the fire, etc .. All of this really seemed casual and quite creepy. Oddly enough, I do not know why, some see it as a work of genius. I just do not understand it.
