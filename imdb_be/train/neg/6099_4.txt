It was less than a spectacular short film that I saw between the reference points on the Turner Classic Movies recently. Although the film jumped out from behind a very intense the Technicolor, the film itself was not just that the movement and the time of the plot looks pretty cheese - as has been done for use in the classroom and attracts the attention of a wider audience was not even a consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the film were repeated things - for example, when the characters were talking with her, they usually say, "Clara Barton" instead of "ma'am", "Miss Barton," or "Clara". In addition, another painful Confederate soldiers said that he was "Johnny Reb, the Confederate rebel ..." - almost like it was a cartoon character with Mojo Jojo The Powerpuff Girls. It was just sloppy writing. - the period <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see, John Hamilton (later, «Perry White» on TV shows SUPERMAN) beard, President Garfield. Yes - it's him under that beard.
