I saw the trailer for this film, and it looked great, so I went and bought it. What a mistake, which operates a slaughterhouse, special effects (if you can call them that), looks like something that would not be out of place in a school play. Some of the characters are so stupid in this movie you crawl for a minute they on the screen, which, unfortunately, is increasing. As for the history, forget about it. This is a warning, do not spend money on everything in this movie, it has to be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If for some reason you like to watch this film Troll 2, you will probably enjoy that as well.
