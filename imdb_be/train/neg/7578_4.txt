not recommended for at least the length version of the film in the 1970s TV hit «Love, American Style," decorated with flashes of nudity, «Superchick» (1973) is a light-hearted fluff, something still manages to please. And the main character here, Tara B. However, actually a kind of Superchick. Stewardess (no attendant), who is so good, that the autopilot even her plane made a pass at her (!), And a hard worker with a boyfriend in every port in this wingin ', Swingin' Gal really put the "lay" in the "landing". What it germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, with her playboy gangster problems in Miami, and its creative contested rock star man in the memo, Tara sure does keep busy. And if it is not draining these guys all their masculine energies as the viewer learns that she is responsible, it takes carat class, mile high club, driving flashers and rapist, attends clockwork pot parties and stop trying to hijack his plane, as I have said, , light-hearted fun, and, of course, good for a night when you feel a little silly and just wants Veklo in front of the tube. Future Astrologer Joyce Jillson does bring vapid charm of its role of Tara, and the film looks quite beautiful to please. Disappointingly, buxom 70th Faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) fritter here in very small roles, but I still get to do what they do best - show off your chesticles! Although the picture has never LAFF loud funny, and really does not have a lot of thoughts in his head metaphorical, it manages to be consistently funny, and I guess that is something. It is surprising that the final credits should pay attention to the body of Mrs. Jillson double, however; I do not think I've ever seen that before!
