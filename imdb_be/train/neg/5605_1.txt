I was very disappointed with this film. I expected that more female buddy crime movie Thelma and Louise. Instead, women prison refugees in this film, there was no sense of loyalty to each other. They were extremely vulgar pack of hyenas, which beat each other, double-crossed each other, and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film. <br /> <br /> Instead of being shrewed thieves who are glued to plan her escape and find the hidden cache of money, women fugitives were too selfish and vicious, to trust each other a long time. These women were not released in a positive sense. They just end up being a bunch of loose-cannon incapable of self-respect, or with each other. If you like 70S female crime caper movies, skip the bomb and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, which stars Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
