By now you should already know about this film, Jessica Simpson "bomb", which pretty much gone straight to video (limited, anemia theatrical run). Basically, Kathy Mrs Simpson is sent to a small town in Oklahoma, to visit her boyfriend to surprise him, only to find him in bed with another woman. She is stranded, but there is a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I would like us to see, most of the film), which allows her to stay. Kathy finishes to get a job in two insidious employees (Penelope Ann Miller and always fun Andy Dick), that only with the help of Kate, to get the company's president (Larry Miller) is cleared. This is strictly to the film, it should not be deep. Jessica Simpson was not a great actress any means, but it is quite a lot of beautiful and never really annoying. The film is watchable in that it is not an abomination, but his divorced fluff. In a cameo role, Penny Marshall funny (subtle joke about Milwaukee makes me giggle), and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (not to read too much into it). So, not terrible, but it is easy to miss. Your safe bet to watch it on television, if it ever does. Again, not good, but not deep distress.
