This movie is easily one of the worst I have ever seen. And I do not mean that in a good way. We wanted to see shitty horror / thriller, so we chose the one that seemed to be lousy in the store. At this time, the film was all that we expected. And more! (Or should I say, less?) <br /> <br /> The actors look like they read their lines from the poster behind the camera. So-called special effects are created by placing a red transparent plastic front of the camera to create the impression that we see through the eye of killer rats. And the script? Do not even get me started on the script ... And just when you thought it could not get any worse, it turns out that the first part of the film was Oscar material compared to the end. <br /> <br /> Take it from me, this film is fun, if you are in bad horror movies, but if you want a good movie, keep looking. It is not for you.
