Satan's Little Helper is one of the best B horror movies I have ever seen. When I say better, I mean history. Film hatch a new plot, something that is not so cliche in horror - something fresh. But there are some ridiculous questions that come along with it. The questions that you ask yourself throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The film first caught my attention when I was cruising the horror section at HMV. I'm tired of all the so-called «terrifiying» Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different. Cover for Little Helper Satan immediately attracted my attention. As you can see, the image appeals to you - it's scary! I knew that it was a direct-to-DVD release - but I took the risk. I mean, I just saw «Boogey Man" the night before - it could be worse! After I watched the movie, I was half-satisfied. I loved the story of the film. It was really terrible, like a murderer pretending little boy friend, so that he could kill. In some sick way abnormal, he really thought he was a little boy and have become partners - the duo of terror. It was a good idea to set the film in the Halloween night. Thus, no one will think anything masked man next to a small child. They just think that he was his guardian. But this is also where the "plot holes" begin to surface <br /> <br /> If your son came home with a "friend" he had met trick or treat -. It's okay you do not think anything about it, that would be -. If he was 9!, or around the same age as he was. When he came out with an amazing man in the mask, you will be surprised and protect your child. you may ask the person to remove the mask and identify yourself. you ask, why now, he and his son. he does not know it. you have to tell him, please leave. he is not a member of the family. he is a stranger. we must learn to sha child not to talk to strangers in this case, the mother quite well with them and they never think it a little strange that the "man" does not say -..?. all Gruanted they think is the daughter of a friend, but after 10 minutes do not say you will pull the mask and ask him why he does not say a word. <br /> <br /> The film goes down hill from there. The fact that I have the most was all my mother said that was "Do you want some cider?". I can not count how many times she says it in the film. It's like, oh you're dying - there is cider, though, it's all good !! The film became a promise and failed to deliver. It was more of a horror / comedy, and even as it fails to deliver. I guess you could call it "extra", "Flop", etc .. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film cover. Although something tells me it's not worth $ 12!
