This film has beautiful scenery. Unfortunately, it has no plot. In order to have a portion to be a conflict. This film was not. He spent two hours painting beautifule scene and not ever place any activity in it. The picture is trying to be artistic, but did not pay attention to the basics of stories. <br /> <br /> If you like Montana fly fishing and scenery you will find some value in this movie just did not expect history. There is not one.
