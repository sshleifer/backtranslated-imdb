Before we explain the «Alias» comment, let me say that the "Desert Trail» is bad even by the standards of westerns bulging Three Stooges. In fact, it is Carmen Lara as gender bad girl Juan, when you hear her Mexican accent, you immediately recognize it as Senorita Rita of classic Stooge short to "preserve Belle». <br /> <br /> In «The Desert Trail» John Wayne gets to play the character of Moe Howard and Eddie Chandler gets to play Curly Howard. Like their counterparts puppets running gag during the 53-minute film to hit him Coeur. Wayne character, skirt chasing the bully, is not very attractive, but there must be a good guy. <br /> <br /> The game cursory rodeo cowboy rodeo Wayne Holds office box at gunpoint and took the prize money that he would have won, if attendance earnings were good, the rest of the riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar (in fact even less after Wayne robs cashier). No explanation is given for Wayne tearing riders and is still regarded as a hero who gets the girl. <br /> <br /> Speech is difficult at this point, because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his sidekick Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix-it will continue to play Sheriff Micah on Television "Shooter") see Wayne rob ticket office, and then steal the rest of the money and kill rodeo manager. Moe and Curly people came. <br /> <br /> In this way, curly Mo and move to another town to get away from the law, and they change their names Smith and Jones. Who do they meet the first, but their old friend Larry, whose sister gets the second half of the love interest (Senorita Rita left behind the old town and makes no further appearances in the film). <br /> <br /> Sister Larry beautifully played radiantly beautiful Mary Kornman (Now grown up, but in her youth she was one of the first actors from Hal Roach "Our Gang» shorts). Kornman is the main reason to watch the mega-lame western and her scenes with Mo and Curl is much better than any other manufacturer, as if they used completely different team to take them down. <br /> <br /> Even in 1935, a sequence of actions in this case is very weak, and the technical solutions of film is strikingly bad. Two major chase scenes footage ends broad arrows rider falling from a horse. Both times, cuts the editor for a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame filmstrip quite different, and the character has a different dress than stunt rider. There is liberal use of footage in other places, none of them even remotely convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to watch the scene halfway into the film, where Mo and Curl to get on their horses and ride (on the screen on the right) from the cockpit, the squad jumps in the direction of the cabin on the left, the operator should be two puppets with a slow pan right and then doing a whip pan from left to discover the approaching party. Outside the home movie I've never seen anything like it, but not because it looks silly (what he does), but because the competent director would never make a scene so. They will be removed leaving the two drivers, and then move the camera and shoot detachment approaching as a separate action. Or if they feel they are creative stage sequence, so that the camera shows the rider in the foreground, and the squad is approaching in the background. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
