I question its importance for the Queer cinema, as it seems to be more about homosexual meeting through aggressive behavior than to make any clear statements on homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three tales tangled together in a rather perfunctory way. I found myself trying to untangle a messy story in the first 15 minutes, that one did not sit well with me. Weak scene was repeated endlessly, as if we could not get it the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a sense of dialogue laid over the film. More like short short, not fleshed feature film 45 minutes Boy. It was an obvious erotic smell, male nudity and sex appeal, but the total amount is not equal to its parts <br /> <br /> 1st part :. Boxer / Stalker story was the strongest, and yet he also felt like it was pulled thin. Bob Tim walked for four years, and only now he is in front of him? I felt that their game of cat and mouse has not been developed enough to deserve its conclusion. We need more information about them and less parking / Locker scenes with Tim inevitably say, "What do you want?Â» <br /> <br /> Part 2: Danny wants his friend, Tony, hit it until it jack-off. Tony did not mind, but he is not even interested in the study of the consequences of his erotic hobby by God - even after they do it in the nude. This story lacks the all-important transition from "I'm just a boy flogging of my other guys around for fun" to "I think I might be gay, and struck him, because I would like to extend its ass and make it S / M style ". A very important thing to get away with. <br /> <br /> Obviously, these stories, everyone can convey their points at half time. The third part of a man and a woman, slapping each other around adds to the idea. In addition, it was not necessary, and adds nothing to the film. Thus, the actors did a good job in these conditions, and the four wires to the man was very sexy. Makeup (bruises or cuts), however, was on par with upper secondary school talent show. <br /> <br /> There was not enough meat to the story, to have any impact on gay policy. The film did not make any statements, wasted time, and not attractive enough or worthy of thoughtful investment. Its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach, which makes it in the long run, it is impossible to take seriously.
