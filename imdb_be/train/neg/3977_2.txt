Identical twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have risen to stardom in comedies like "two of a kind," I have never seen them in anything before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically Hunter sisters Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) in Rome for the Summer Intern Program, but not long after the beginning of their work, they immediately fired for a series of setbacks. But the man who owns the company they work in Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), give them their jobs back, and they are slowly proving themselves useful tools and talent (fashion) artists, and help stop the average person from a company. Also starring Leslie Danon like Jami, Derek Lee Nixon, like Ryan, Ylenia Lazzarini like gifts, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentine Mattolini Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso, Paolo and Matt Patresi Enrico Tortoni. You can say that this film was made to go straight to video, the camera-work is completely mismatched, and it does not help if you want to enjoy the sights of Rome. In fact, background only good thing to watch, twins are two of the most annoying celebrities around, I knew before watching that they were not going to interest me in any way (they even that is not very much) it's terrible gush trash film. Pretty poor!
