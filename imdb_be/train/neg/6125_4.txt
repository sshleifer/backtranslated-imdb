This is the best film of the pair Derek never did, and if you think this is a recommendation, then you have not seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: it's just as bad as the act of their other efforts, we can observe After undressing or audition for the wet T-shirt competitions quite often, the story just ridiculously stupid, and the film takes itself too seriously. And then: orangutans Utans in Africa <br /> <br /> But there are a few things going for it. After all, looks great, the production value (sets, costumes, etc.) is quite good, and it greatly increases its cost of the camp. In a strange way this is actually quite funny, simply because he's trying to be serious and not so bad.
