I think that this is one sucked on ice, because he left the cube, and gave us a lot of information about who is, and yet for some reason. Original CUBE never left the cube, and he left everything to your imagination. This shit Festival however, gives you all of this. and I do not like it ... Although acting is solid, I think the reason this one was a failure was, because it was done by others, than the original filmmakers of people, if they do Vincenzo Natali is a prequel or sequel, I think, it would have done better and would be more faithful to the source. so I recommend you stay far away from it, and Hypercube, another film I did not even want to talk about ... (I gave him 2 for only the current)
