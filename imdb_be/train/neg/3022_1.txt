I was very excited about this film when I first saw the previews. I usually see a preview of it is good, and I buy a movie once. Something told me ... you know, to look first. I am glad that I did. Keira Knightley has destroyed all future movies for me with this role. In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out, I went to see him. All I saw was Domino Harvey, and I hated her for it anymore. I think that had to do with her hair down and having to cut it short for Domino. <br /> <br /> Domino who? Who Domino Harvey? I still do not know, care. I do not know who she is in real life, or who she was in the movie. I do not care about his character and even Keira get naked partically not make it worth the film. The direction was definitely lacking. Drafting was trite and shallow. Editing was awful. I do not mind the style so much as a bad excessive it. There's a place for it. Good examples gusty, MTV-style editing colorful (not sure if there is an official name) will Fight Club; in the vicinity of the top of my head. Enemy of the State, even had sex this style editing on the part. It has been used with taste and was not used as a crutch. I mean this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, please give me my time back. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who loved this movie. I believe that the idea that you are either totally love this film or hate it entirely fair assessment. Honestly, I hate it.
