This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. While with the participation of a good movie actors do not live up to expectations. The most dramatic thing about this film is the music, which pretty much sums up the movie: compensating for a bad and confusing storyline, obviously having good actors, loud and dramatic music. This does not change the fact that it is very sad to watch a movie. Earned yourself 1 point.
