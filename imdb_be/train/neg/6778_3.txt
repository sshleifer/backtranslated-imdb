Oh, my God, my God ... <br /> <br /> For those who like JM, it was the nail in the coffin as far as her list Hollywood career was concerned. After a tough girl turns can not help the wayward bus, cracker and Rock Hunter, seemed Jane was on her way to becoming one of the hottest stars of tinsel town. However, the obsession with the colorful advertisements and appearance in this clunker Mansfield relegated to the sidelines, but it cheap euro borrowings outs before Fox could not drop her contract as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> This film really diabolical waste of time each, except Suzy Parker, who is the only one in this film is bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jane and her performance grid for the poor return of this film at the box office, and while it is a pain in this film, it can only make it better with the material. In the end, it is unlikely Cary sets the screen on fire he does? After a couple of very good drama and comedy is Jayne takes 10 steps back in its quest to be a serious actress, agreeing (just for the sake of being with Grant), to reflect the squeal idiotic threats. Her character Alice Complete Cartoon Dummy and although it looks good enough to eat in overalls, her every appearance in the film Jangles nerves. We all know Jane can do it much better than this scale, and yet here she was parading around like a pudding pot. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this so-called comedy. It is more depressing than funny.
