I tried twice to pass through the film, changing the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing for the second time, despite the great DVD transfer. The problem? It's just too boring. <br /> <br /> If you can get in a dramatic court room scenes, which occupies most of the second half of the film, you have done it, but it's hard to get to this point. There are some interesting talks on "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) in the course of the trial. The ending is touching, as Lincoln leaves and put it Memoral statue on the screen. <br /> <br /> It is a good story, well acted, and so .... but it lacks the spark in the first half and repels the viewer by hanging in there. I suspect that the real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than the movie.
