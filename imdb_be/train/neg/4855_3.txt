I really wanted to like this film, but ultimately dull and incredulous. The first shot of the camera power from the robot, which flies to a bomb and, of course, the wobbly. But the rest of the film remains in shakycam mode, even during quiet moments of conversational, down to absurdity. Let rental homes end tripods and Steadicam? The fact that it was shot on 16mm will not help, since the entire film grainy and shaky. <br /> <br /> For all of Bigelow's efforts to put in the exact vehicles and equipment, there are quite glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - The car would not erupts in flames after a single shot, and once absorbed is not extinguished a small fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - One Humvee will not be driving around Baghdad in 2004, but will be supported by other means of transport in the event of a breakdown or an attack. - It would be very unlikely to be able to hit rebel runs at long range, where the bullet apparently takes a second to reach the goal. <br /> <br /> - I believe that the bombs were taken to special places of burial on site or near the bottom, and not some random spot in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The onset of an oil tanker, is alleged to have taken place in the green, well-protected area, which has experienced very little insider attacks. Area, mainly offices and palaces multiple residences, but is depicted as a dark dangerous labyrinth lanes and hiding Rebel. Oddly enough, James will never get into trouble because of the ridiculous tactics ordering his two companions each takes oil itself, thus creating begun kidnapping. <br /> <br /> - By the way, 3-person team is always depicted clearing the building, chasing, etc. the rebels themselves, even if there is a clear dozens of soldiers right there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours a team needs to look at the dead militants hanging window to understand that he does not pretend <br /> <br /> There has not been set shots to show? the viewer that the size and location of the database was or where Baghdad was connected. I had no idea who told EOD team to, nor any other characters fleshed out. This is what the characters will know, so we should too. <br /> <br /> Many of the "surprises" and the scene is quite predictable. Yes, it's obvious that the psychiatrist Col. get into trouble with the Iraqis he is trying to move forward, that the choice of cereals home will be overwhelming, and that the driver kidnapped you will not wait for you to leave the car. <, Br /> <br /> Finally, the almost complete lack of character development. Renner character from the very beginning has a difficult relationship at home, recklessly and addicted to adrenaline. He was just at the end of the film. What is the meaning? <br /> <br /> If this is the best so far of Iraq war movies, this sorry bunch. Only on the basis of half an hour I saw him, I would recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead.
