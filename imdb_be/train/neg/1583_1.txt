I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved the running man. So, obviously, I was very pleased that someone made a movie about him. And if the local network showed the film, I was in seventh heaven. I was ready for a fun night! <br /> <br /> The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had thrown Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just could not believe that a man who was known for films filled with flowing An shoot can play more than the tricky part, as it was described in the book. I was still convinced that it will be a good movie, though. Who knows, maybe Arnold had any hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he did not. I soon learned that the only reason he even gave up because someone rewrote the whole story, to make it a struggle to "shoot. Yes, it was a standard Arnold-film :. Hero did wrong, the hero solves problems by flexing their muscles strong and scaring everybody out and the hero gets the girl <br /> <br /> I was shocked. It's not what it says, that the book at all. I know that the book can not be put on the screen, literally, but it does not even have a connection with the book. Stephen King should openly condemn any affiliation with the film, and he should be banned from the Running Man title for this film shameless waste. I do not say this often, but this movie was BAD. If I was not playing at home, I would have thrown rotten tomatoes at the screen. Once again :. Poor <br /> <br /> (Please note that I used the "someone" a lot, I did it because I am sure that many people are embarrassed to have worked on this, and I do not want to. Confuse them even further, calling them here )
