I expect the same excitement as I spit on your grave, but I was let down only garbage as you can even call it a movie (it interesting mini porn). It made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business. There's no story line to it all jumping quickly from each murder. If you like seeing a woman naked, or even part of the men, that is a place in the film is to masturbation even in the film, making it the porn, not a movie at all. I saw some silent films in his time, but this number 1. I want to watch it again at all. Actors even look bored during the movie me so they probably needed money bad enough to make this film.
