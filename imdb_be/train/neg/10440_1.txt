If you are not at the age of 10 to 14 years (except for the R rating), there are very few things like this. One or two rows of Ken Thompson, kokner (we really need to see it bigger) and Sam Jackson and Julianna Margulies humorous as good as it can be seen by its environment, but, unfortunately, it is. Poor story. Bad actions. Worst of writing and delivery. The special effects are murky. As much as this whole situation is odd and horrible joke, significant individual are all equally awful built-in situation. If we consider the part of the action, and there are incredible action sequences in some films that make you light-headed and there are some that make you groan. This film contains the last appearance. This leaves little left. I'm so glad I did not pay for it. <br /> <br /> Despite any cheating, I can read and think, as I sat down to watch, I do not wait for anything good. I had no expectations, but it was a bit worried going in. However, as a train wreck, one can not simply turn away. And even without any expectations, I was let down. Poor. Not even the "so bad it's good" material. I _very_ moderate bad movie, but it makes the "Six String SamuraiÂ» (which I liked) Oscar worthy. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of garbage CGI'd in the same company as Battlefield earth, Little Man, and Gigli. As it is currently estimated at 7.2 completely confuses me. Brainwashing or something like stacking voting system is all I can think about how to answer. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that today I witnessed a train wreck. I need to go wash my eyes. 1 in 10
