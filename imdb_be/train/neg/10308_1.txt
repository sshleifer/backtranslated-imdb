It is really too bad. Lama shows how a second rate actor doing his job. But what makes it worth watching the scene where OJ angrily grabs a fellow police officer by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric "I got a certificate for you!". (Makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - is attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I could not find it on ITunes). It's about seeing the future ... Too funny for words. The rest of the film is forgotten. Score and songs are more interesting than the script. The same continued. The question arises, why would they make a sequel at all. I understand that overseas sales drives much of the film. Do not say a lot for the world viewing habits.
