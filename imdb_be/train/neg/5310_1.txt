I do not what that other review says. This is definitely not a prostitute film, in fact, I do not think there was a decent looking girl in it. No, it's just a bad, poorly made, Ed Wood style sci-fi schlock. And that's bad. I can not even tell you how bad it is. I saw him late at night on cable, and I was in shock. The fact that this film was ever which releases an insult to all of us. The actors were either members of the producer or the mentally retarded, special effects aside, and paced insanely slow. For me, though, the music covers it all. The monkey can write better about it with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on cable, watch. You'll be surprised at how bad the film can be.
