I had high hopes for this film. Theater monologue large and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man, with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. <br /> <br /> I am a supporter of many Belgian films, but this film is bad. It is absolutely incredible that the actors play the roles of a sudden 34 teenagers. "Language Game" were disgusting and over the top. Nothing about the film did not seem real to me. The ending was too Deus Ex Machina for me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and I think that I spent an hour and a half of my life.
