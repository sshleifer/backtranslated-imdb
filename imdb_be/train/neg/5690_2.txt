First ... I never thought of himself as Uwe Boll Hater, as I think I've never even seen one of his movies, but seeing this cheap excuse for a movie called "seed" (which is the name serial killer, this film about) I'm close to joining the club of hatred. This movie makes absolutely no sense at all ... plot of a joke, and although Boll is clearly trying to draw attention to shocking 90% of people from the film simply boredom. You can summarize the film so: <br /> <br /> 1. Hooded killer hours, the animals receive clips of torture on TV. This is real life footage from PELT farms and opens the film with a ridiculous reason "to make a statement about humanity," and gives the address of Peta. Since this film has no message at all, and the worst piece of torture porn operation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onwards. <br /> <br /> 2. Death by electric current with the excuse that violates what happens later in the film, printed on the screen so that everyone gets a retard it. <br /> <br /> 3. Cops watch the animals, women and children from hunger and decompose in the seeds of the basement, having a silly nightmares and crying in their temples, because the seed is evil bad MoFo. Although the actions OK film takes a dive every time he tries to turn any emotion ... <br /> <br /> 4. Seed Cops bust in his house, act silly and get cut in the darkness. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you just see nothing but flashlights. Seed super killer, who immediately everywhere and all the police are stupid enough to kill ... for someone who busts him, except. <br /> <br /> 5. The seed gets the chair, and we see him in the electric chair as long as everything else in this "movie" ... he did not die, and we are reminded of the opening statement that he It must be set free if he survives 3 electric shocks. Guess what ... they just bury him alive to solve this problem. <br /> <br /> 6. The seed comes out of his grave, killing all away in another part of the cuts, and then looking for a police chief to take revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman gets her head beaten with a hammer in an infinite sequence from one point of view, just for fun, and shock him. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed captures cop family, luring him into the house, threatening to kill his wife and daughter. After the murder of his wife with a nail gun cop shoots himself in the head, given the Seed What wants (it is difficult to get into the head guys, because he not only wears a mask, even in prison, but never say a word ... Film almost any dialogue, in any case, so do not mind). <br /> <br /> 9. Ball goes for nihilistic shocker end where Seed closes daughter in her dead father to rot, as the people who we saw in the video on the sequence 3. <br /> <br /> This is it ... no messages, no plot, no reason, no snout behind a mask, without a background except for silly stories, the Seed was burned as a child. Sun <br /> <br /> This film is based solely on a few key scenes and shocking. I do not remember, the film is empty of any emotions or messages, or entertainment. It's like watching August Underground ... that's fine with me, some people will enjoy this mindless snuff. But what is really hard to stand it is a pseudo-message at the beginning and the fact that the film is well-made, taking into account the camera work, special effects and even the action is too good for this waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> So how do Boll to get money to make such "movies", when thousands of talented directors working on shoestring budgets ?? The "seed" is not only the essence of the absurd, its living proof that the free market is not perfect ... by Uwe lucky that the German taxpayer to pay for a lot of waste to get deductments.
