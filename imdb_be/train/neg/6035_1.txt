I really wish I could give this a negative vote, because I think I just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror film ever put on film. action was just god awful, I mean REALLLYYYY bad dialogue was worse scenario sounded like it was written .... I can not think of anything horrible enough to say. And in that day the "outside" and night "inside" shots make you think that events have taken in a few days. Terrible acting, directing, writing, etc. etc. until, as the errand boy gets lunch for everyone. Stay away from it at all costs. If my only saving grace to stay out of hell by doing one good deed, it is to tell the world, not to watch this crap. This film is the exact reason why horror movies never taken seriously.
