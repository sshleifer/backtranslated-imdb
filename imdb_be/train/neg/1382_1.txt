The film was awful. The theater was dead silence because everyone was embarrassed to be there, watching this stuff. I think someone gave Jet Li lobotomies and forced him to run the script with dialogues written by the five-year-old. Martial Arts "OK", but when put next to Jackie Chan movies and "The Matrix," you're better off to see one of them.
