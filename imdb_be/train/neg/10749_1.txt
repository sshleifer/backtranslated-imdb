This film was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Here are the things that immediately jump on me: 1. Forests were more like the hills in Los Angeles a couple of trees and shrubs. Not scary at all. An emergency, if you are shooting in Southern California, Big Bear is just an hour's drive. They actually have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. Preparation was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue I've ever experienced. Varied line in the movie was unoriginal, clich√© or just stupid. Such as the name of the camp "Camp Blood" (lame), the name of the clown "killer clown" (lame). What is a clown doing in the forest anyway? It was only a mask they could find? 3. Last, but certainly less I was acting. Absolutely worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. Virtual wealth shitty lines and bad acting. The worst part was away when randomly flash back to this fat foreign exposure of the photograph. This is a very long scene, and I believe that she should be sexy, but it was not. In addition, and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the film for me was the tool that should be a "sport." For example, if he is bored in the film, he grabs a couple of rocks and begins to do curls with them. Then, in the future it is assumed that he will run for the clown and it is immediately clear from his very "girl, as" run, that it is quite far from sports. Yes, the girl who played Kat, good Lord to stop singing. It's a song that you sang for loans, makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If for any reason you see this movie, I would at least recommend to watch special features. Group of donkeys, who made this film to talk about it as if it really is the original story. In fact, one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the script, and no one could predict the ending. Apparently, she hangs out with special children.
