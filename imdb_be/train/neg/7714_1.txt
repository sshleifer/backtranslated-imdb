Awlright, pancake, then MooCow will be reluctant to admit the truth: I am a kind, "as it is cheap, cheesy 70-parody. The idea that vast horde of killer tomato destroy the United States is a great idea, and, in spite of themselves, the Moovie does provide some decent chuckles, moostly frightened of extras running away from large, obviously fake tomato. This film, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the earliest attempts to parody, which have become so popular in the 80s and 90s, thanks largely to Airplane!. This one, like moost deceptions, rather poor. Many attempts at humor dismal failure, and will cause a lot of groans. But thanks to the predatory hordes of tomato, annoying song «Puberty Love», and amazing helicopter crash scene, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes do provide some products, although mostly for the wrong reasons. There are sooooo many things wrong with this film ... and so right, it's hard to explain. Enough people have also enjoyed it as tomatoes made a comeback in 2 MOORE films and a series of cartoons !! Large chunks of time spent on the tomato is quite boring. And dig those 70s clothes, dude !! ; = 8) This seedy tomato and cheese, but it is worth chuckle or two; MooCow says grab a pizza and pop music in tomatoes !! : ??
