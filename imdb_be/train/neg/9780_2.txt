Lord, who made the turkey should be buried alive. I'm sorry, but another reviewer did not have to see this film, he has to look for something else, or have never seen a movie before ... 9 out of ten stars? He says that it is as good as Ben Hur and Gone with the Wind? Involuntarily funny, massively improbable characters, absurd situations, looks like it was filmed in Griffith Park (which works pretty well - MASH was filmed in Griffith Park), crappy script, just about everything that could be wrong with the film all rolled into one package. If you want to view for all potential filmmakers as an example of how film can be terribly wrong. It reminds me of something USC student can do for a film class. <br /> <br /> give it a pass if you do not take drugs, and in a great camp.
