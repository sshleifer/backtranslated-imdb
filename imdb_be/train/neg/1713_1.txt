If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you do not have. Competition, as "make your own horror movie in one day" could not possibly come up with a record than this mess stroke intelligence of any viewer. Mr. Sheets forgotten story, the plot, the right dialogue, the fact that people need some basic acting talent and enrolled designer apparently forgot lighting to show. It seems to be written on the crummiest with handycams, and copied to the worse equipment. Makeup effect consists of black mascara for zombies and yoghurt being poured over the heads of people to imitate their skin melting. This is nothing more than the home movies, and really bad as well. Just interesting to see friends, familymembers and neighbors who were willing to show on film. I can not for the life of me understand why this is a mockery of the product listed in any serious newsreels or website - I have a home movies of weddings, which are much better and more interesting. A total waste of time, money and energy. Continued ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II just more of the same litter.
