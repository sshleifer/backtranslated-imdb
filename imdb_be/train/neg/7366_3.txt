That F * @ # it was I just watched? Steven STOP !! Please! This film is insatiable bad and stupid. In a bizarre move away from action and adventure, Mr. Segal is now fighting (obviously) will they-were-vampire "as" a creature with super strength person.? OK? Oh, and their eyes flash toward an inhuman way? Wow! Even still in the film, but to suppress Seagals have to at-last-piercing and no one-can-kick-my-a $$ ego, he somehow stronger than they. However, all the average people to break down all around him. Well, I can see the big mouth neighborhood bully or a drug dealer, but it's super human strength people. Oh, and get this, whitefish runs short sting identity issues, because, apparently, he and his colleagues in the film think he Wolverine! Oh My GO ... And worse than all this! Yes, there are worse. He has a voice-over, even changing voice in mid-sentence, while we look at his face. They obviously do not sound anything like him, and I believe that this may be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Despite the fact that I wanted to turn it off, I always watch the film, it's over. It constantly low even for the direct to video films Stephen. Awful! Awful! Awful! Two thumbs down! Redemeption quality? Well, I guess I'm just in this aspect. At least some of the special effects were okay, and I like the choice of wardrobe for actors and actresses. The women were all very appealing IMO. However, and I said, though, it does not make for a flagrant X-Men, Underworld, (insert your favorite zombie vampire film here) rip off! Director, screenwriter, producer, it should be bansihed and expulsion from the film business. I think I feel the way that most people feel about Rayne blood (and just about all the other films Uwe Boll) about this movie. This is all my $ 1.00 on this film. View, if you dare.
