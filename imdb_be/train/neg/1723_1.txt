Man, what a scam it was! Not because there was nothing good (I really did not expect anything from it), but because I was misled DVD braid, ignorant off their "stars" like Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Of course, their names are not in the opening credits of the film, much less themselves in the rest of this !! As it turned out, the only film that connects these three actors together equally unclear LAS VEGAS LADY (1975) ?? but that one has to do with the monster CRATER LAKE, you can only guess ?? <br /> <br /> Despite this, since I paid $ 1.50 for his rent, and I was in a movie mood monsters anyway, I decided to watch a movie independently and, yes, it's smelly! In addition, he had a no-name cast and crew anonymous, amateur unmistakable air was visible from far away, and the maximum that I could make him laugh on the JAWS-like claims and deliberately so, to resist two moronic pranks owners loafers nazem-- boats that often quarrels with each other with dazed local sheriff looking at. The very essence ?? ie plesiosaurs half-dinosaur / half fish ?? is imperfect knew (of course), but as was the case with the giant claw (1957), which I had also just seen, this does not seem not to bother the filmmakers nor how they flaunt it as much as they can, especially in the the second half of the film!
