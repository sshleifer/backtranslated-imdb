Check out the film's website, more time was introduced in solutions than in writing the script for this film. It could not be more out of this boast. The original story? Original? They must have found a script hidden between the old testament, or face legal echo for this little horny Tooting. Leading special effects? Well, I could have done better with the Atari 7600 and a jug of earwax. Stylish cinema? Ah yes, the funniest home videos look in America is still a classic. I am sure that they had little money available for this title, so, of course, science fiction is not so good, or a little bad now and then, or just having fun, but it's a story that makes this movie a waste of time and money. 4 floors in one person, and all of them mindless bit Seen-befores and done it already.
