I'm not sure that the HK films other reviewers have observed, but Enter the Eagles is not at the top of the heap in HK action. Michael «Fitz» Wong should be glad that he can get the actor's work in HK, because he could not act his way out of a wet paper bag in the English language. Shannon Lee looks good, and it's a fantastic fighter (even better with fights legs than her father), but her acting skills are also subpar. In fact, all of the dialog English (90% of the film - even more than in the Gen-Y Cops) so bad that I went into the language of the audio only to deny the suffering of poor dialogue delivery and redundancy of English submarines. Of course, there are some decent skirmish (but nothing we have not seen before) and a good movie, but cheese visuals really spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> However, it is not worth the price of admission to see Shannon and Benny "Jet» Urquidez go for it. Exciting, and almost worth watching for the remainder of the film for. <br /> <br /> And finally, you may notice some of the scenes, which seem to be "friends" with you, in particular a firefight in the open market (think, Matrix) and Fitz diving from a helicopter in black tires (think, MI: 2). Guess who thought, at least, something that was necessary to tear the film.
