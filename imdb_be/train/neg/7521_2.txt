I'll probably give it more credit than it deserves, because it is Halloween, I was just in the "Scary Farm Knott," and I was in the mood to look really cheesy Halloween movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it only cost me one dollar. <br /> <br /> I usually FFWD through a movie like this, to get to the "good stuff", but I restrained myself here, and I still do not know why. This was evident from the first frame that was not a "real" film, not even B-movie. This is more in the category DeCoteau «horrors» movies like "Brotherhood", which were shot on film watch for about 50 cents (in fact, I am wary of any minute one of his inflated college boys will be reeling from rubbing himself in his underwear or something ). There have been no expressions of shots (too expensive to make a few camera settings) and flat lighting, but ... it is difficult to determine. There is something refreshing about watching filmmaker with no money to steal half decent movie. The fact that he does even half decent work is commendable, and this film has its share of merit - acting is not bad, pretty good photos (if it is too bright to be scary), there are some surprises, and all that is his native ... different somehow. <br /> <br /> a bunch of college kids is (for unknown reasons) stayed in the warehouse, where they decorate the annual haunted house. The old man gives them a terrible satanic book, and they happened to gain the powers of hell. This leads to people costumed in a haunted house becomes what they are made out to be, and causes a lot of chaos and human suffering. Along the way we were treated wonderfully sophisticated and thoughtful lesbian relationships plot - it's interesting that this pair seems the most well-rounded in the film. Yes, there is no sex scene, but it is not indecent - or at least no more than you would find in any legitimate movie about lesbians, who shows them sex. It is quite unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to low-cost operation. <br /> <br /> Another thing about it that I held my interest was how he was clearly trying to imitate the "stupid kids have sex and get killed 'vibe' 80s slashers. It is difficult to accept that, because there are so many of those films that already exist, the genre has been done to death. I'm not sure if this is good or bad, that the filmmakers were just trying to make another entry in this genre, without irony, as if he was still LIVING genre, but I appreciated the attempt. <br /> <br /> Which is why I got through it; Sometimes you just want to watch mindless, nya-budget "A-for-effort" a horror film. There really was too much to install, do not have enough of Gore, endless plot holes, dead ends and clichés and unhappy overall feeling of the film, which is simply not enough money in it for film producers expected ... but at least, a haunted house scenes were pretty cool . I would pay to go to the haunted house, if it existed, and do not mind paying for a dollar to see it on DVD, even if I'll never look at it again. <br /> <br /> Yes, and possibly ** spoiler **, but it was great, a brief affair with a vampire girl in the coffin: "I used to be claustrophobic but I changed" Haha, good friend..
