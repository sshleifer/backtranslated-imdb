Being a big James Arness western, the film went down as the worst Alam film ever made. The story was scary, inaccuracy all through it, and only very unrighteousness to boot! Continuity was cast to the four winds. Anybody catch the sequence of a gun? Mexicans are stupid enough to shoot a gun, which apparently was dirt and ramrod still sticking out of the tubes. Come on! Then a funny hat Brian Keith! Dresser wort was away or something. Or simply out of your mind!
