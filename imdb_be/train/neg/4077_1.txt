What do you get when you have a bad game, bad directing, scenes that painfully long, terrible lighting, editing painful and terrible effects? You Jessica: A Ghost Story Seems his shot on Betacam, which is good, but the lighting needs to compliment the environment. In this case, it is not. There are several vehicle where a person's face is completely in the shade. One scene in particular, the scene at the psychiatrists. This is a joke, if you ask me. Some scenes were so long that they could easily be cut in half ... but I think if they had not had a full-length movie. The main character is incredibly flat. He lead a man, so it must have some "hero" of the elements of his character, but he does not. He cries i afraid of the whole movie. I could go on, but I do not want to waste your time. Although the lighting was terrible, I have to say that they have a good camera movement. It is a pity that lighting is not to praise it. Cover DVD is good, and that's where it ends. Just awful.
