This is much worse adaptation of Jane Eyre I saw. It is unclear whether or not ever read the book Bronte writer. George C Scott funny and awkward, like Rochester - if not just plain old acting anger. Susannah York has the dated 1970s hair I've ever seen in Victorian film. The characters barely speak to each other, so that the rich enjoy the banter in the book, which is the basis for their deep intellectual and unfailing love, gone. The ending is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please, rent version of Timothy Dalton instead. This is so true to the book, it's like a novel to read aloud to you. Dalton beautiful like Rochester. GK Scott clown.
