I do not consider myself to be one of the biggest fans of Leonard Cohen. He nevertheless has an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. The most valuable element in this documentary to hear the thoughts of Leonardo about his life and career. Warming and submissive. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians featured in the concert not to talk nuances of the music / literary style of Leonardo. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were exceptions, even if Leonard appreciates Rufus Wainrights interpretation of the songs. <br /> <br /> What is particularly failed in this documentary was directed by the ability to allow the viewer to see that Leonard Cohen and how these musicians to connect to it. Many say, in this regard, but the viewer does not apply to a person, Leonard Cohen. This shortcoming is particularly evident from interviews with Bono and The Edge. They consider Leonard as a special icon, but can not translate the exact value of Leonard Cohen. Cooperation with U2 is a farce. All live recording looks headed for work. And just as in the whole film, only Leonard Cohen is still a part of it and can talk about their own part. <br /> <br /> entire installation and the scenario is very similar to the project correspondence high school. Using effects such as echo, delayed or flash image is hurt. Some of the camera work is negligible. Part of the price is hardly reminiscent of some kind of association, I might have expected. At times it seemed that the director added psychotic elements of the film. Perhaps the reference to it once the use of LSD. <br /> <br /> Some of unintentional humor ... at some point, Leonard tells how he influenced the musical genre. Initially, he can not remember the name of the genre, yet in the end he does not say that it was a punk, then punksters really took to his music. The next scene in the film live cover of "I can not forget" ... <br /> <br /> "I can not forget I can not forget I can not forget, but I do not 'remember who"
