This show stinks. For parents, they tend to want their children to see something good for them. It is, as a rule, educational, funny and bright. <br /> <br /> it educational? The number in the Doodlebops sing and that's all. They usually sing about themselves that they are not trying to teach anything. <br /> <br /> It's funny? No. The Doodlebops instead of saying something which is not intended as a joke, and laugh at him. <br /> <br /> This is a bright? It is so bright that it hurt. As for the colors, all with a very bright, so that's good. But nothing is ever as the world Doodlebop years. Thus, they are always welcome. child in need will get depressed because they have never been exposed to miss. <br /> <br /> The show is also very cheesy. Each composition is said to be at the highest level of exaggeration and quite banal. It's too much. <br /> <br /> For children, it's interesting, but by the age of 2 years, you do not want your kids to see it. They will never know how to grow.
