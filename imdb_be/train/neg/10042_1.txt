This long-awaited film .. But he disappointed me and my friend, who went to see the movie for the first day .. From the trailer it looks like a thriller, but it turned out to be out and out comedy (bad comedy). But one thing that is commendable is acting these professional actors, they have done their part of the film very well. A good effect, but I do not think you can save the movie .. India was filmed beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan (Ladakh?) Were saturated with color, good. However, the path was removed inner beauty of these places I want to know exactly where these places were, and I could go there ;-) <br /> <br /> sequence shot very poorly, no one could make out the head and tail tricks they used Akki (Akshay Kumar) is very good, but could have been done much better .. <br /> <br /> The animation is the worst I've seen in recent movies (90 movies were the best animation stage I think (the original scene where the car falls' mission is to be the better word, "the road to the lake). <br /> <br /> And the name of the movie was mentioned almost every 20 to 30 minutes, just to make sure that the audience does not forget the name of the movie, I guess ..
