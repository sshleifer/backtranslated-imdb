The film reflects the unresolved issues of France with its colonial heritage in the Western (French-speaking) Africa through Puzzled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman, France (hereinafter referred to a symbolic offering of her nation). It is often interesting and complex portrait of a young woman desires to come to terms with a traumatic moment in its past, in particular, and the nation's desire to enter the "other" is when something "owned" and formed. This is reflected in how he focuses entirely around the concept of travel (or on the road) from the present to the past; We remembered for the undisputed reality of contemporary political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> The characters all played by the symbolic, albeit limited and unconvincing role. France, I meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of modern French society, remain indifferent to her plight, as she seems to have not yet imbued with the same naivete she had as a child, in fact, as a child, it seems more ownership of its reality. The rest of the ensemble riffraff simply forgotten. Black Africans, to put it mildly, offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonial peoples are now inhabited by poor handling directing her stuff. They are nothing more than a dark and dies background against which Blythe, France wonders of the world is looking for, she never knew, and in the hope of one that can never be found in Cameroon.
