This kind of film that you regret you put into the VCR. It's some surprisingly bad rip off version of the Stephen Kings of the film "minuscule (1990)." I can not understand how this film has received 5.2 points, because it has no history, what so ever, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved. <br /> <br /> This film was to be released as a short film instead .. much time is spent on the same. And as in every bad movie, everything happens only at the end of the movie in the time period of 10-15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> So, before you decide to see this movie, do not forget to put some new batteries in remote control, because you're going to do the whole mass of fast-forward ... do not worry, you will not miss anything important.
