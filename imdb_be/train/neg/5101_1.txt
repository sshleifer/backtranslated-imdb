The only thing that occurred to me after watching this rubbish was I would never have the time, I used to look at it again. If you want to see Stacy Keach and Michael Dorn try to make what should be that the advance payments at a holiday home, then stay tuned. Wooden steps, bad special effects, the only comedy moment was while our hero was a stranger in the female form, and it will end as soon as she made her obligatory b-movie nude sex scene for 30 minutes in the movie. Opportunity to do something that might be a decent film disappears at the moment Nicole Eggbert HOURS alien at the bar for 30 seconds, while the public police, military and Joe do not cotton to that woman drinking coffee, dosn ' t use a cup and handle is four jumpers at once. It obviously must be from another planet. But where would I be if this film was included.
