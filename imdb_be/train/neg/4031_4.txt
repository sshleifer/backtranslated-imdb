In fact, it's terrible deception of the film. His 70-minute time works very well complemented by footage. Others had descript exterior and interior gray scene. The plot of the exposition is very poorly provided. They all just kind of the casual scene strung. There is no attempt in the choice of the plot of the drama, but rather transferred to the intensity of the drama actors. Please do not ask. <br /> <br /> The plot comes to missiles, radiating a million degrees of heat at the Earth's orbit five miles, threatening to destroy the Earth. It is now a threat that must be diverted, if purpose-built hydrogen bombs can be made and placed in the experimental rocket for an hour. Nothing here is very Sun report for furious speech against the project in addition to the scientist, because there may be some kind of life on board and think about the possibilities of science, but it is the performance of compulsory idiot liberals were largely passé by the time. <, Br /> <br /> What saves the film, several uniquely, is stock footage. I have never seen a greater selection of fifties fighter jets in any other film. This is not an exhaustive list, but only some of the airplane, I was able to see. There short interception is piloted, in alternate frames, F-89 and F-Scorpion eighty sixth First, to scramble the hooks is the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker hunters and F-86 Sabre in streams (or built Canadian CF-13s), and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks. <br /> <br /> Then, for whatever reason, are the B-52s, B-47s and even saw B36s taking off. More padding. <br /> <br /> «These Canadian aircraft moving at a speed of 1200 miles per hour." I do not think so, because one of them appears to WW2 era Gloster Meteor, the remaining F-80s. The Meteors press the attack, and one turns to F-84F with the end of the flight early straight-wing F-84S attack formation. <br /> <br /> There's a strange version of the tandem cockpit F-80, which doesn "t seem to be the type of training t-33, but some temporary all-weather interceptor version with radar in the nose. They are mixed in a blizzard. <br /> <br /> Corner aircraft carrier deck can be seen from 500 meters. It launches F-8U Crusaders, F-11F Tigers, A-5 and A-Vigilantes 3 Skywarriors. Air Force F-encrypts the 86s and F-84S and F-89S more, then you have ever seen in my life, as well as the F-100 Super Sabers and F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> F -100s press their attack with sooooo much padding. F-89's to unload its missiles in their Wingtip pods in SLO months. Fire F-86s, F-102 lets loose a hawk, even some of the F-80 (F-94S?) From the middle of the wing rocket pods produce. There is a very strange shot late-model F-84 (prototype?) On the right wing of the early model F-85 over it, in turn, obviously (Republic Aviation) infomercial producer, which shows the difference between the old and the new improved model F-84 Tanderzheta. How came here anyone's guess. <br /> <br /> There is another great footage of Ottawa in the old days, when the capital of Canada was a wide spot in the road, and especially great staff Times Square New York during one of the civil defense drills in the early 50s. <br /> <br /> I think that we are dealing with the notion that it was filmed in Canada with the possible exception of car chases seen at the end of the picture, as the Pacific Ocean seems to be in the background. Using Jupiter Zhovett several stunning and there is a good TR 3 is also visible. Canada should be cheap, and it's pretty much used unnecessarily in the background. <br /> <br /> As for the actual narrative of the film has little to recommend it other than the secret, who is Helen Parker giving the finger to the end of the film. And it definitely will toss someone. Maybe, R, in Robert Loggia? He was released filmmaker who died for this film? Her career as it was her last loan? <br /> <br /> It's like paper gift came wrapped in more valuable than a gift.
