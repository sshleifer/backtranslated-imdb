This film is poorly conceived, poorly acted, poorly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder terribly annoying, and can not avoid the same routine Napolean Dynamite. Self-obsessed and ignorant. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton plays the same Manish, overly obsessed with a mother who cares too much and yet not enough about their children's lives (see Because I Said So). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I do love her, playing insipid idiot in this film as well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is passable, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please skip this film if you want to save your soul.
