Really confused incomprehensible mess. Most of the things in the film look more or less in 1987, but then there is the futuristic stuff just thrown in as a beam of a police gun. And this machine! The director seemed to be in love with colored lights. Only really characteristic work was the girl who played Valery, but as it was not a cast list, I do not know what kind of actress that was. This one is worth missing. Evaluation: F
