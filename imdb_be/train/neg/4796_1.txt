. I love John Saxon in that he once, when he takes on the camera, although it directs the film, which should have been more accurately under the name "Please do not watch this movie called: Zombie Death HouseÂ». $ 1,000 Shock Insurance certificate is a tricky way to expensive Fred deer Ray about to make you spend $ 14 in the captured dump out of the legends of big cheese 70. Ray frontman in the future retromedia. Ray Charles Band makes way to look hotter than stucco ceilings on the Ford Falcon. Simply bad now, both alone and close in addition. It's great that Ray dig up this old material, and in some cases the public domain as the rest of the US dollar video dealers, but in the case of a zombie house of death (the word "zombie" sloppily applied add a property and interest from a Fort) The only way do maintenance on these scars release him DOLLAR MARKET mysterious collector and fan of Saxon !!! If you want to see a real Saxon, pick Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or glove.
