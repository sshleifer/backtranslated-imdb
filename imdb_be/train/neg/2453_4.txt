I could give this movie a higher ranking before the trilogy, Peter Jackson came out, but seeing the two of them side by side, not just does not compare. The pace of this film have rushed many important scenes from the book are omitted, and there is little character development. Animation is a bizarre mix of traditional cartoon images and scenes of live action, which had been painted over, which I found distracting. And the most offensive in this film is that it breaks off in the middle of the story was never finished. There are some good battle-percentage point in the scene is interesting to observe, and the dialogue should be the book pretty much to the letter. Watch it if you are in a hurry and can not spend 10 hours of viewing a new trilogy. But if you have not read the book, you are likely to be confused, because there is a lot missing from this version. 4 10.
