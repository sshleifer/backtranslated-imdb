I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but it pretty much sums up. You can not beat the original two, for several reasons, one of which, including the director's talent Chris Columbous. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible directing covered even more terrible acts. I can not even believe that these people are considered to be actors. <br /> <br /> The painful to sit and watch. The plot was full of anecdote about the secret chip and Russian terrorists in the painstaking quest to get him back. Horrible, rent one of the original tow and enjoy! <br /> <br /> The film has not even been set at Christmas time as the original. Home Alone was converted from a prominent family comedy Christmas to joke with no moral or site!
