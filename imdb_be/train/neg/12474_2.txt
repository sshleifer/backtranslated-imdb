I saw the MST3K version of «III» worthy of death, and loved the movie so much - even «unmystied» - I decided to watch the entire series «Deathstalker» films. I bought I and II and got a laugh. <br /> <br /> Currently, the "I" in custody death was not funny at any level, and if the titles I was confused and sad that I bought it! Too many ridiculous, nudity. I think as «DS 3" was much cleaner production or MST3K actually edited a lot, because I was expecting something like this, that is silly and carefree and easy. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99 it seemed a waste of money. I have not even opened, "the DS 2," I'll be back tomorrow. Now I'll probably just throw this DVD as I can not get it back, and no one wants - including yourself! So in fact, not to bother with it. Even nudity (a lot of it, by the way) is a dull and unattractive.
