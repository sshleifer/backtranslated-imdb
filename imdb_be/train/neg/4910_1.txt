The word "first" in the title has a more sinister significance for the audience of this film than for his victims. At least, they do not have to stay and watch the endless film reaches its own destruction <br /> <br /> first must refer to :. 1 draft of the screenplay; Origin receives used in each performance in the final film; The first editing in post-production; and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> The film does not throw too bad, it's just that all of the film come off as less than a third course from blunt scenario in wooden performances. And while suffering through the cobbled together a movie for 2 hours of play you want to pull out of your misery. 160 minutes of time is quite obvious that it should have been edited to 2 hours. <br /> <br /> going into details about the lame script and acting to serve little purpose. Even as terrible, Lake Placid, at least appearances, Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda built from a very weak script, were enough nuances to make you laugh in the movie. In the 1st to die, one end mourn only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening of training suicide scene. <br /> <br /> Women's role in editing so bad one never entered into one of the main characters, which I think (it was not enough said) is a DA It just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously, the scene where she presented the audience dropped to the floor editor. And no one knew that the character appears out of nowhere was an unusual course of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, do not waste your time with this. My wife and I wish we did not. But, at least, we have created our own diversions, commenting in different places, in the film, as it was Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile, in Cleveland ...." !!!!
