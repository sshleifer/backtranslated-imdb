I read some good reviews, who defended and critised various aspects of the film. One thing that I see over and over again, it's a shame to Megan, idealistic politician, is trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe because I'm a 23 year old student of political science, and I think I'm going to change the world, too, so I'm Megan. In addition, she's cute. It is not a super model, but a cute girl next door. <br /> <br /> So she cried and cried a lot. It is very dramatic, and seem to be overdone, but it does not fit her character? She goes on the show with the intention to sacrifice his life to prove a point. She thinks that people who love this show patients. I think it is very well made its argument. Of course, as a young naive girl, she was horrified by what she is going to face. I think that it works accurately reflects a young girl, showing moral courage, in spite of her fear preferred. In addition, I think that it has retained certain dignity throughout the film, in spite of the desperate situation she was in. <br /> <br /> As for the film as a whole, except for Megan, it was pretty much what I expected. They were excellent scenes of gore, micro-budget standards. The plot can be quickly adopted the idea, almost no contemplation. It's basically just a dark humorist mindless slasher what the name implies. I love sadism doctor. He continued to tear the shirt off Megan, not only for the cause of cheap (although mostly so), but also to torture her before he kills her. Loch chainsaw was hilarious. For fans of slasher, he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10. It was a nice setting, almost no plot, and the mixture of good and terrible action. I would recommend it for cheap thrills, but it is unlikely diamond in the rough, that the micro-budget horror.
