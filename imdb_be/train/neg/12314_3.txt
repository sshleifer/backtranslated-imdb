Maybe I really old, but this is one time I missed and old funny bone completely. Undoubtedly, there must be something wrong with this powerful Irishman (I, Schultz!). Lordy, Lordy, what I would give to see the light! First, Phil Silvers manic energy, wit, and the disc was very much part of the comedy of education and general education in life, if you will. Although it is possible that a number of the first under the name: "You will never be richer" (1955-59 *) could get on the CBS TV Network with someone starring Sgt. Bilko, it is very difficult to imagine any other actor / comedian in the business of wearing stripes, those foreman in. <br /> <br /> This strong identification is inevitable, but not the same kind of career sabotage typecasting nightmare that he was in some other guys like More Clayton ( "The Lone Ranger"), George Reeves ( "Adventures of Superman" ) and Charles Nelson Reilly ( "uncle Step'S BLOCK»). <br /> <br /> One of the main barriers to successful adaptation and updating of such work from the 1950's on the TV screen in 1990-Movie-publicized our collective memory. Not being sure what percentage of the crowd remembered character Bilko see original run syndication and early awakenings, and their number was certainly significant; even a significant part of the young saw BILKO reruns lately. It was obvious that the new film and the source were a mile; or even light-years apart. <br /> <br /> So, in order not to be regarded as completely square, an old curmudgeon, please, let's look at some other points. <br /> <br /> It is here today, the 14th day of November, in the year of our Lord 2007, let me swear and confirm under oath that I have been a fan of Steve Martin for almost 30 years, In addition, I received enjoy the wit and talents Bilko '96 Co-Stars Aykroyd and the late Phil Hartman. In the end, it is the talents of guys like this and so many other graduates «NBC; s Saturday Night "and" Second City TV ", which has kept the last quarter of the twentieth century laughter. But BILKO remake; it just did not click. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the film was made as a Comedy Service (always loved them!), but without Bilko Show names and gave him some identity is itself would be valued more highly irritable, old men like me. <br /> <br /> so we have so many Sitko and cartoon series turned into a movie in recent times, what is next? Howse of someone doing World War II Army Hela Roach comedy series sergeants Doubleday & AMES and the 1st TV cartoon series «Crusader RABBIT"? Remember where you heard it first! Poodle SCHNITZ!
