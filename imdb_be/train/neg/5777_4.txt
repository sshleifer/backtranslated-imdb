It's funny, when you stop and think about this: in fright film fans, as a rule, to a deep and abiding love for those who scares the living daylights out of them. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre can give us nightmares, but who among us (the true believers) did not feel very real attack of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE- or Ken Fori, forever and ever resolute character of the original DAWN OF dead? His cameo in the remake, I wanted to stand up and lift (like a cameo in Savinykh); I'm not kidding. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you get my drift (if not, just stand downwind ...). Here are some of the heroes of horror. To see this many of them gathered together in one film is almost unheard of (at least so far as I know). Unless the author (s) was so daunting task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, I'll try again. As long as it's not another half-hearted effort (for example, Brotherhood of Blood, for example).
