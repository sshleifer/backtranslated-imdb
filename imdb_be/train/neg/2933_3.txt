If you've read the book - not high set your expectations if you do not - read it, and never watch a movie. It's amazing to see what Toby Young was actually involved in a lot of writing the script (as he asserts himself in the post scripts books). . Because the film is very different from the book <br /> <br /> The fact that the film seems to be the goal - a pretty thoughtful and interesting part, which combines the philosophical ideas with a simple funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone will understand - it reaches perfection. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for comedies, and lost all meaningful message that it could be. <br /> <br /> You better not to see.
