Ok ... so I've seen a lot of really odd / unusual movies in my day. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas comes to mind when I think about it. Well, no more ... from here on out, whenever someone asks me, "Hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?Â» Slipstream is what I say! And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the film, it was obvious that this would be one of those "trippy effects camera" movie. By this I mean little things like flashing images on the screen, rewind and fast forward the words and scenes of people messing with the color on screen, flash forwards and flash backs constantly ... that is the actual action itself. People accidentally get violent, shoot things / people say strange things that just do not make much, if any sense. <br /> <br /> The film about a writer who begins to mix real life with a book he had written and lack of a better way to explain it, you mainly see this "trip" when he goes throughout the film. The thing is, Johnny Depp went on a similar trip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the only difference is that his trip was interesting to see, it does not hurt! Honestly, I had a real hard time even finishing SlipStream. It's kind of hurt my brain a little. <br /> <br /> I can see a movie buff to make a statement to this film, which have certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique, but add to the sense of dementia ... blah blah blah. Point, the film hurt your brain, when you look at it .... it makes very little sense, it takes all your concentration even remotely try to understand what is happening, and even in the end, the only thing you can be glad that it's all over ... and you can tell that you actually sat through it! Thus, in conclusion, if you want to watch a movie that will have you saying, "What the hell" again and again, as loud and in your mind, go ahead and spend an hour and 30 minutes, and check it out <br />. <br /> Mr. Hopkins, while I welcome you as an actor and approve of your choice to take a hit in the direction .... please do not ever make a movie like this again. next time to try something, that belongs to a little more on great storyteller than the methods of cameras that usually leaves the viewer with a headache.
