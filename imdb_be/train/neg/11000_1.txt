Words can not describe how deplorable this film. This is a series of random, unfunny clips of all of the Batman parody stupid guy to get it on with the old lady dead (really disturbing). Only remotely funny comedy about the subway watching Joey Battafuoko, best actor in the film. In addition, the estimated NC-17, despising won only people who can tolerate him.
