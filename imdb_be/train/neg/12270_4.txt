This ghost movie Kiyoshi Kurosawa pretty wild, and it is at least one jump scare, which caught me off guard. But on the whole, the film is incredibly stupid, the detective, trying to find a suspected serial killer, only to find out that he may have committed an offense. Then he finds a resting beautiful Asian lady ghost, and has no idea why (and neither does the viewer). Like other murders, he becomes even more complicated as the killer is easy to find, and it was a ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, lady ghost more funny than anything, especially if it suddenly flies through the city as Wonder Woman. And the ending makes little sense, in fact, the whole movie makes no sense, and I can not recommend it at all. If you do not take yourself so seriously, I think it was supposed to be a black comedy. Outside of the "bright future", it is the worst film director Kiyoshi Kurosawa I've seen yet.
