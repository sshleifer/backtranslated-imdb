I must say that I am very surprised by the high ratings for this film. I have found that it is absolutely idiotic. The mother receives a "vision" when it comes to certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision for ... It just seemed so ridiculous. Didi Pfieffer performance was terrible, I thought. It was very annoying. The girl who played Lori did a good job, and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work. <br /> <br /> I usually like LMN and very open when it comes to movies, but this film seemed a funny story and over the top acting, and it just was not for me.
