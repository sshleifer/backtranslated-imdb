There are so many puns, to play for the title of spectacularly bad Valentine, I do not know where to start. I say this, though, this is a movie that makes me long complexity valentine cards we used to give to the elementary school. You know, the ones with Batman exclaiming "You're a super fight against crime valentine!» <br /> <br /> Valentine is a slasher film without the slightest hint of irony, one of the few horror films in recent years, ignores the impact of Crick. Villain understanding and almost-invulnerability. Heroes fearful when people are running in the corners and grab them by the shoulders shouting «HeyIjustleftmycoatbehind!» Price more imperious than Norman Bates's mother. <br /> <br /> shaky plot worth a few childhood friends, now grown up and very lush. Since the film does not have nothing to do, they stand around and wait for the masked stalker sun kills them one by one. This stalker seems to be a former botanist Jeremy Melton, who is constantly rejected by women and men were beaten in the high school. With Valentine's Day approaching, women are starting to get scary maps predicting their death. Melton seems obvious suspect. Only problem is, as many of the characters have warned that Melton could change your appearance in thirteen years to look buff and beautiful. Yes (insert here the frightened cry) each suspect! <br /> <br /> This is one problem. In order to have any sense of suspense, watching Valentine, you must accept the reality, in which high school nerd can become David Boreanaz. Botanists will not turn into an angel, when they grew up, they become older, BALDER nerds. He's not a terrible actor, but the script is not less than four authors, gives him and the rest of the cast is nothing to do but scream and make out. Denise Richards (bustiest actress in Hollywood is never star in Malibu), particularly exploitation; most infamously in the rough ground to get her in a bathing suit just before the decisive stage unknown. Note to self: always bring a bathing suit party Valentine's Day. Just because that February does not mean that you can not feel like taking a little swim. <br /> <br /> slasher in the Valentine dress head to toe in black with a mask of a cherub. That's problem number two. The filmmakers obviously thought it would be an alarming image to have a color someone who blurted out the people in the face with a hot iron. Plain and simple, it is not. Instead, it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face, including his eyes and ears can move so quickly, without bumping his shin on a chair or table. Again, given the Cupid Killer does, maybe he can teleport and his eyes on his hands. <br /> <br /> This is not only a bad film, he was not even sure who the killer; final "twist" a "Huh?" than "Ha!" If you are scratching your head, you yawn, the groans, the search for the nearest exit. Do not watch this movie. Even if you are alone on Valentine's Day, to find something, anything, else to do. You'll be glad you did.
