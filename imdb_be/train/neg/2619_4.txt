This is a good movie for kids who love dogs. It works a little slow early, but ends when vanity gooped to De Vil. The main subject is the same as in the first film. The bright side of the film for adults says bird that thinks it's a dog. Bird says, as a man (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog. It's a comedy that the film needed more. Look in the mornings, so you do not have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on Disney.
