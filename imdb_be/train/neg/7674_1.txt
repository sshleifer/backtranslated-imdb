However, there are a lot of films, much worse than this film. This film was not Manos: Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I've seen them both .. twice), but at the same time, this film is neither alien, the Predator or Alien vs. Predator (yes, even this film has surpassed it). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like Star Wars is so bad. Razzie Award observation, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This film I'm talking about, of course, alone in the dark. I'll try you at least step by step why this movie is so bad. <br /> <br /> Acting- I first start with what may have been the best ingredient of the film (near the ending credits, which played "Wish I had An Angel», which acts. Christian Slater should be proud of yourself he successfully proved that it is possible to operate a decent movie worse than drinking antifreeze. although all his terrible dialogue he had to say made me wonder why Maybe he just does not leave a lot of half. this is due to Stephen Dorff be in the film, and (what he wants, he can be, but not in this). Tara Reid is bad actress, but look good And that's all that really matters in such films as they are. It does not mean that the action was perfect, though, it was average, not very good, and perhaps the only thing in the film is not very good. <Br /> <br /> the Soundtrack- except "I wish I had An Angel», the soundtrack is pointless and badly heavy medals is injected into the audience's ears, perhaps, yes sguise terrible stories (something I will get in the near future). Long and very dear 2 CD soundtrack is now for sale for those who are musically challenged. <br /> <br /> Directing- Director Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Boll, who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Telling us, "Yes, the films can get it really bad, and it's only the beginning of my death saga terrible movie." At least, as they say, directed by Uwe Boll. Not being told that I would have suggested the monkey was stolen from the Congo, brought here and forced to draw conclusions on how to make a film on pain of being shocked. Cinematographer, probably, the camera glued to a skateboard and pushed forward until it touches the wall. On scenes where the camera must remain still, she is constantly moving, it does not allow us to stop anywhere, and when he has to move in action, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> Producing- Who on earth dumb enough to put money towards this bomb? I'm sorry ... stupid sometimes. Sometimes I am happy that he or she is taught a lesson, never put money aside worse than a dog litter litter tied in a sack. <br /> <br /> Writing / Storyboard- Attempts Analise story is more painful then the ice ax jammed thumb and feet of a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with him immediately after, but I'm still going to try. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby escapes as a child from the orphanage where 20 children, where to go for scientific experiments. He runs away and hides in an electrical outlet, where it is electric current (this is the point where it was so bad, I started laughing out loud). Then fast forward many years later, when he paranoid detective. It get attacked by any zombie that can not be shot, killing him and moves with life. Later, he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster, and he discovers a secret that nobody knows. <br /> <br /> So, the plot is bad, really really bad. creatures from the film waiting for us to read about 10 minutes, which felt like 100, random text about inaccurate civilization called Abskani. The film is not one turn after another, more, viewers can handle more then the audience wants to handle more audience could never take care of. This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon is doing better. <br /> <br /> In general, skip this movie. I gave it a 1 out of 10, but that's because there is 0.
