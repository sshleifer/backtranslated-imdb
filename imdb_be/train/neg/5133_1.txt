I had no real expectations going into this film, and I'm glad. Even if I expected it to be bad, I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Firstly, I think that 15% of the film consists of footage of stationary stuffed in the dark field of the jungle. I get it. There's a stuffed. I think that the name "Scarecrow" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the damn thing is not explained with respect to stuffed and paranormal phenomena. There are too many times when I left to go WTF? <br /> <br /> In the third place, the film takes on seriously. I'm all for a B-movie with buckets of blood, screaming women and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But these films often know what they are B-movies and even flaunt as Dead Snow (Scandanavian hilarious zombie flick) or Evil Dead 2 but this film seems to be paying no attention to his crapdom. <br /> <br /> And finally, it should be of more than a blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said it. If you are going to have a horror movie shit do with the murder. And if you're going to be one hot and one half hot girls, one of them has to show some side fool at least. <br /> <br /> So, as stated in the summary, skip the "Scarecrow" and just poke yourself in the eye. You'll thank me.
