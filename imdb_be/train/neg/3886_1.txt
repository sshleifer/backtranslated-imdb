Whether it is a stupid movie? You bet !! I could not find any point in the film, which was a horrible or scary. Silly moments? Lot. Stupid characters? You bet. The risks? Everywhere! Rick Baker could have gone and made bigger and better things, this is not one of them. Well, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson cheesed. He's the whiny doctor I've ever seen. He has a melting man running amok in the county of Ventura somewhere that he was not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because it is 55 years old and weighs 90 pounds), and there are no crackers can be found anywhere. In addition, he received not too useful in its general Hinder wants to find astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what is happening, even if Mr. Nelson could not tell him anything. There are also some random characters added for good measure that encountered with a melting man. In the end, the film ends with the monster gets scooped up in the trash can be composted. In the end, this is exactly what you need for a great MST series.
