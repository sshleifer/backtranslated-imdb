I saw about a thousand horror movies. (My favorite type) This film is one of the worst. For me, the idea drives the movie. Thus, even bad acting, cheaply made film can be good. Something strange is definitely cheaply made. However, it has little to say. I still do not understand what carats scene at the beginning of a relationship to the film. Something Weird little to offer. Save the pain!
