Read on and take notes - you can save 88 minutes of your life (that all!) <br /> <br /> relentlessly bleak, the film sets for the production of (I think) modern American small town Christmas. Capra bike in style. If you can not .... totally and absolutely is not possible. I tried to think of one good thing about it, and I can not. I will mention some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People do not die, they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in the plant Santa. Angels are actually former Cowboys sitting on trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot .. I will not spoil it for you, but there has to be some light in the film, if only in contrast with the darkness, but there was not. Even the gloomy picture - the snow is shown at the end of freezing, everywhere it looks cold, damp and miserable. <br /> <br /> As you can guess, the film has a happy (sweet) ending. What a relief!
