Watching the film made me think constantly; why they make such a problem with some broken brakes? There are a million options to slow down the car! The film speed Writers least thought of a good reason why the car was not able to stop ... <br /> <br /> There are not many good things to say about this film; All the usual narrative clich√©s to make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is leaked like a sieve, etc., which makes this movie a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
