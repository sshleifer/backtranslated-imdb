Miraculously, it's actually quite watchable. I mean, it's bad. This is very bad. But while the original was so bad-is-ruining-my life is bad, so bad-it-mildly entertaining bad. Yes, it is rather weak praise. production values ​​rotten across the board, the current difficult and Romero-wannabe satyr can not make your mind up to some environmental side of the fence he mockingly. The internal logic takes a backseat to the heads of throwing themselves with refrigerators, virus incubation times vibration as a "plot" require bullets to work against the zombies or not, zombies, having the power of speech or not. Gore is a draw, obviously, but the frame is so lightly that it's annoying. The dialogue sounds like it was transferred to the same computer, the MANGLE operating instructions, as well as the scale of the zombie invasion meant neither ingenuity Romero films. All this is topped off with a terrible account of synth. Absolute nonsense.
