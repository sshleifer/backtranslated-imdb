Seriously, why the American and FRECH actors pretending to be Czechs need to speak perfect English with a fake Russian accent? I am a man, so I enjoyed the gratuitous nudity. - but soft porn movie will be more so, at least, will not pretend that art <br /> <br /> All policy statements, where painful didactic- heard was the director of subtlety? Action was also wood and melodramatic, comic and never was funny. The characters were very small, and I just could not tell them all <br /> <br /> The bit where I was laughing when they cut the actor in the archival footage of demonstrations in Prague. - and they were black and white, sepia and then to fit the frames are simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I have read a lot of short stories Kundera (not Unbearable Lightness of Being), and there are good things about his style of writing (although its theme one large male fantasy) and I must say that the film does not convey any Kunderas style with kindness.
