It was not a major disaster, which I expected, but that's about as positive as I can be in my description of the film. I'm not sure that was supposed to be funny about this movie, but I guess it's all a matter of taste. Personally I do not find it amusing to watch idiotic moron live life, or make a fool of myself on TV, but then again, I'm not a fan of a helpless daytime talk show host Jerry Springer. I'm not too boring to look at it, but I was not definitely never enjoyed it, either. If you are in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that is not too painful to sit through, this is a good choice.
