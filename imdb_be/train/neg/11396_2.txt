Master of cheap erotic horror Rolfe Kanfski finally makes a film that goes straight to the Playboy Channel. "Hazing" borrows from all that came before it from A Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable ... just a little bit. The characters are cardboard, wooden dialogue, the story of the paper is thin, and the actors could not act their way out of a grocery bag. Put that all together and you have a fleshy ball of mulch for the film. Sometimes when I'm sad, I like to eat paper. Watching this film is a lot like that. Chew on it for 90 minutes, and you're left with an amazing taste in the company, and nutritional value.
