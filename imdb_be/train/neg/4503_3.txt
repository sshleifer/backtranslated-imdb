I admired Rob Marshall's Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha are but another failure combing western and Asian art. In general, the scene is excellent, but after careful emphasis on exotic-oriented scenes, some of them may just find yourself fed up with them. Excessive cherries, frankly exaggerated. This is probably the perception of cultural differences here: the ultimate beauty is not spectacular view, as well as a truly beautiful geisha is not a pro-Western pumpkin in the film. <br /> <br /> Some of the other comments rightly mentioned the biggest drawbacks. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt, the actress is more. Actor / actress can play a role if he / she can look like him. Gong Li is great, but the power of emotions that she showed in this film has not been translated in the Japanese style. All I saw was a bitter and jealous Chinese. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favourtie actress, not even similar to the Japanese. Some comments mentioned the peculiar delicate, feminine features of Japanese women, which I can not agree. They are so frail that I believe that not even all the modern Japanese actress have the right to the role in the geisha, not to mention the two Chinese and one Malaysian actress, who grew up in different cultures, and probably did not know that a lot of Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> Geisha good shot for arousing the curiosity of the American audience. But it would be an insult to himself and to art, so the movie when the film won the Oscar for best costume, best director and best film.
