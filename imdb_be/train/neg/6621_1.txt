Something, somewhere, must be terrible has gone wrong at a time when the director took this story. The film, which was supposed to be a remake of one of the most popular films in the cinema, is not able to provide every aspect of filmmaking. The best artists have also failed to find the settings that just goes to show that the film itself is a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> poor editing. The direction of this shit. Acting out of this world (OMG)! Symbols to look scary to make people laugh at the stupidity of their dialogue and costumes. <br /> <br /> I would not watch the movie, even if someone paid me the price of tickets or even gave me a free hamburger with him.
