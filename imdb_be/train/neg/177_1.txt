If you want to see this movie, please reconsider. I usually do not write your comments about something that I've seen on TV, but this one was such a waste of my life that I need to do something productive to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Criticism of the film takes too much time, as there are many things wrong with it. I'm just saying, please do not ever see that movie. It was a complete waste of my time, and it will be a waste of your. Anyone who wrote a positive review of this film is one of two things; completely incompetent, or work for a company that produced it. Again, I guarantee that you're really sorry to see this movie!
