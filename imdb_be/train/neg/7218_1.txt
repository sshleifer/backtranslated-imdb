There is a scene near the beginning after a shootout, where the horses run. If something catches your eye red, it means that a white van parked behind a bush on the path. I thought I saw a bad thing, but it's true. White van in Western. Did not they catch it? Well, I paid a lot of money for rent. It will make you want to grab your friends and have them all put in 10 big and make a better movie. The conversation was so so slow, acting mainly in the order, but can not be taken seriously because of the bad character of filming. There is a door to the sheriff, which looks like a door today with a specific finish. I say, watch this movie, and move a cabin boy at # 2 on the worst of all time.
