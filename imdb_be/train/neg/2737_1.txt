There are no spoilers in this review. There's nothing to spoil <br /> <br /> there is no plot, nothing. Most video shows at least try to link the clips in the story some sparse stretch of the imagination, but it does not even do that. Clips, three lines that lead to the following infinite sequence of stupid clips ... OK, so maybe they were short on production time, but they were better skip this episode completely. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how it was done, actually. Shrubs tend to be much better than discord path, but for some reason it is necessary through .... <br /> <br /> Thank heavens, they returned to form in the next episode.
