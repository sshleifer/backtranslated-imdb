I must admit that I laughed when I saw one reviewer compared it with LOTR. Well, yes, if we exclude the dwarf cast of thousands, great special effects, great battles, a strong characteristic, a decent plot, good acting, stylish direction and everything else. That leaves you with walking. And boy, does this movie make the move! If Mr. Piano had its way, it will likely be an uninterrupted three o'clock hardcore walks through the countryside of Wisconsin, but every 40 minutes or so, these nasty Martians floated for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes even like wandering around, you've never seen so much go to the cinema. If it really was a budget of $ 20 million, most of them must have gone to Mr. Piano shoes, because he had to go through a lot of couples from across the walk he was doing. This explains why there were decent effects, decent video camera or the actors of their own money. Honestly, it's like watching a strange fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in historical costumes. Even on fast-forward, it looonnnggg walk <br /> <br /> As for the sci-fi stuff, I think it was a mistake to put the Martians in the film :. They receive only walking path, which is clearly much more interesting director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Mr charges piano walk the dog?
