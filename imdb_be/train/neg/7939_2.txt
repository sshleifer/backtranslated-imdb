Of the old series is already oversaturated Â«Hillybilly horror" sub-genre comes this bitter story about vacationing families terrorized inbred animals. Sounds familiar? Well, it definitely should anyone even with a running knowledge of the horror genre. There is a completely new here. The film seems content to rework all of you with old worn-out cliches (deformed Hicks, peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when it comes to show a rebellious daughter, a "freak", which is good at heart, and so on .. .), but even that half-hearted enough to make it a complete waste of time. It is forgotten dreck, but quite humorous J.D. lead Hart once starred in a movie called "Movies that suck" at the beginning of his career, quite ironic really omen <br /> <br /> My rating :. D-
