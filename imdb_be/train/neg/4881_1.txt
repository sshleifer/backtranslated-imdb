This is the sad worthless piece of crap I have ever wasted an hour of my life on. All I can say is, thank God, it was only an hour. More than half of the "film" is footage from the original "mentally ill" criminals. At least I was able to see the highlights with the operation of the rare classics, because for some reason ignores the reality of my video store has only "mad criminal II» (as it is, "Crazy Fat Ethel II»). But the rest of the film, some of the absolute worst home video action film and the garden you'll ever see. Why my video store has this and not the original? Why do things like this actually end up in video stores? Why do people rent it out, and not just burn a copy as soon as they saw his obvious terror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, Lord, why <br /> <br /> If you do not like to see the annoying fruit eat all the candy in the painfully slow stage or said receiving a pass from the fruit of the stair railing in a more slow scene or character to get the knife aside (do not ask) several times on the back, or a brain cell killing monologues for tea poisoned his wife, and then complains that all the talk made his own tea go cold, or mentally- backward fly food soup, or just wants to see the Var 'Yat Fat Ethel dances with a bloody Mr. pulp in the garden does not see this movie. Repeat: Do not watch this movie. Do not make this film. If at all possible, do not pass by a shelf in video store that has a copy of the parameter of the film on it. You can still be saved, but now it's too late for me. ,,
