This is only one bomb "explosion" of the other, without humor and absurd situations only. Indeed, the pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of his strengths. I give it 1 out of 10. I would have done is zero, but this option has not been resolved. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve the best roles. But sometimes we all need to have money. And I still have to jump in the Tim Burton farce about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that there was a turkey. But if it was a turkey, this film did not even stomachs. I would say, "Give me my money." You can bet that if I could. But it is a problem with the paid services, the signature variety.
