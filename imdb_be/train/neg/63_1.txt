Holy crap. It was the worst film I've seen in a long time. All performances are in order, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! Beam clowns talk about this and that, and this is your movie. Ug ... Robert Duvall character is an old man and continues to ask the same people and the same qestions again and again. This gives him the same answers over and over again. I am confident that this film will receive up to six, because people think that they have to like it. Good performances from well-known and respected actors, but the actual work is complete turd evaporates. Well, maybe a little misleading, as the steam rising from the pile of fresh sounds a bit like something happens, and nothing happens in this movie! bullets
