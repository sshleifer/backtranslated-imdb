In a cheap shot in the beginning of the video Crazy Fat Ethel II of, I wondered whether it was the same movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is mindlessly easy. Ethel, a maniac with an eating disorder, be exempt in the halfway house because of hospital overcrowding. It is certainly the most sane resident looks at the time as one person puts the dead flies in a strange soup. Ethel then teased one of the half-house staff with chocolate after he hits the sharp expense as feeding the dog food people. Ethel revenge by strangling him with a wire loop on the stairs, and then .... well, you get the idea. If all this sounds like fun, it is not. The film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting. Characters so wooden, delivering their lines, they have to stand in front of the tobacco shop. To make matters worse, half of the film consists of flashbacks in the first film, Ethel, rabid criminals that little bit better. VERY meager efforts.
