It's one of the fun things that a young one can be easily fooled with advertising. I said earlier on another film in which a promotional video for the (comedy) film makes it seem funnier than that. After seeing an ad for it in 1981 it made me think that it would be wildly funny movie. What I and my brother, who went and saw him, did not know me that the scene is used in television advertising was very last scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of all that was before the film, I can only guess that there was nothing funny use! The last scene, thanks to a potion of youth, Doctor. Fu Manchu is transformed from a long bearded old man in a bright young Asian / Elvis, like a rock star! (C back to the singers no less!) <br /> <br /> Set for no real reason, in 1930, Peter Sellers does not make it better with the material at hand, but he did not give any really good reason "comedic" moments for him. Other actors were just bored, and my brother and I sat through it all just laughing at something. It was only natural that we expect «Pink Panther» type of comedy, Peter Sellers was so great that. <br /> <br /> It's pathetic disgrace it was his last film before he died. His appearance on The Muppet Show was more interesting than this ill-conceived flop. However, I do not blame him. I am a wine all others involved in trying to do the best film this. 2 stars is being generous !!
