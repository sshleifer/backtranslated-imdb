<br /> <br /> Get your brewskies and enjoy this vicious action flick. Considerable skill keee Speakman (in good spin kicks, decent with sticks - poor couch) is the only redeeming quality of the film, which just encourages bad action. The plot is not half bad; just performed rather poorly. But when you see this film for anything other than martial arts, you release completely. The film, to be held in Koreatown, way too little of Korean actors (even more).
