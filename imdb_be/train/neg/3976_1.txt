The plot was dull, the girls were sick and prospective Italian Actor never heard clearly Italian accent.Someone boys said there were like in the movie, but it just seemed to be full of mediocre people. There was not just wholly redemptive features about this film. <br /> <br /> I think it's a graveyard for the actors, who will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins, who seems to charm people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I hope that the Olsen twins to find something out of sight, to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.
