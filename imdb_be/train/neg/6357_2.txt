I'm so disappointed. This movie left me feeling jipped of my time and mental energy. Here was the quintessential Woody Allen movie again and again, top class neurotic Manhattan discuss whether they will or will not cheat on their husbands. Woody, I've seen these symbols before, I saw a story on you ten times already. Where your creativity to go ??? You need to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed since Annie Hall - and you have to change with it <br /> <br /> There are much more interesting and funny script, which you can apply your brand of melancholy and neuroticism. - why not try them. out instead of repeating the same old slop over and over and over again <br /> <br /> When I hear that the new Woody Allen project goes, it does nothing for me - because now I have come to wait for him old standby: a couple who do not get tired of each other and in the end result, deception. . Disappointing and the same old, same old <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to win back his supporters, he must understand that our sense of humor and intellect must be stimulated - not insulted.
