If you go for outdoor movie under the Greek summer evening, you usually do not care what the movie! Edison started very well with a good effort from the singers-who-want-to-be actors and once again a great Morgan Freeman, but ... (In the film, there is usually a good start to catch the audience, do a little sad story while filling the middle a film that is more about the characters and less on the actions made, and the third part of something really good, so you can remember the film ...), if you see 30 staff members of elite police (packed with weapons, can demolish the building) shoot the guy behind the car, do not hit him again, when he kills all (but 3), and then the guy takes a flamethrower (to kill the other 3), you realize that the Greek summer sky filled with stars too good to be distracted by a movie like this!
