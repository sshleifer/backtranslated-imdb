I take I am curious yellow from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released, I also heard in 1967 that in the first, he was captured by US customs, if she ever tried to enter the country, therefore, the future lover of movies deemed "controversial" I really had to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> the story is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Len, who wants to learn everything she could about life. In particular, she wants to focus to do some a documentary about the fact that the average Swede was thinking about some of the political issues, such as the war in Vietnam and race issues in the United States. Between asks politicians and ordinary citizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> what kills me about, I am curious YELLOW is that 40 years ago, is considered to be pornographic. In fact, sex and nudity scenes few and far between, even if he did not shoot, then cheaply made porn. While my compatriots mind find it shocking, the reality of sex and nudity are the main products in the Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, perhaps their response to the good old boy, John Ford, were the sex scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I paid him for the filmmakers that all sex is shown in the film are shown for artistic purposes, and than just shock people and make money, to show pornographic theaters of America. I'm curious YELLOW good movie for those who want to learn the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of the Swedish cinema. But in fact, this film does not have a great story.
