I gave the film 2, and though I consider myself a supporter of science fiction, I found this film very difficult to take seriously. It was the AMC alone late at night, and I'm glad I saw it for free. This film is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more <br /> <br /> effects on the average over time. - not terrible, but not great, either. Of course, we know more about Mars than we did then, but we really can not say that against this film. The main reason why I do not like this movie because of the story <br /> <br /> There were some parts of the film, which I would like to explore in a little more detail. - Astronaut injury / status, a city on Mars, being in the lake, etc. in general, the film is very similar to the long-episode version of the 1960s the external borders - complete with a bad ending.
