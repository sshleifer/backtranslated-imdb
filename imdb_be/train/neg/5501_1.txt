I think my favorite Martian was very boring and drawn out !! It was not funny. The audience just sat there the whole movie and did not laugh at all !!! Not people, even kids laughing !! It's sad for the Disney movie !! I thought that they could find someone better to play Martian, rather than Christopher Lloyd !! It was really stupid !! And he was not funny !! I thought it was really stupid costume !!! In the original television series suit does not speak or move !! In my opinion, they have their time on this film should not be wasted !! I give it two thumbes down !! Really a waste of time, and I would not recommend this movie to anyone !!! Thank you !!
