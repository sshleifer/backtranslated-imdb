This film was the biggest disappointment in the direction of intellectual NIVEAU, the story and the way it deals with its subject, art. This slow movement of the set, as an episode of Wonder Years, with a terrible lack of depth, though. He also can not deliver his message in a convincing manner. <br /> <br /> The approach to the subject of the painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms like "beauty". According to the creators of this film, "beauty" can be experienced only in the Bob Ross style kitsch landscape paintings. Good art according to the film may be achieved by applying a base (e.g., primary school level) color theory and many moods. In parts of the movie to offend, for example, in point, he said (and that says dancing on the tables) that people do not mentally retarded are capable of having emotions or express them through painting, their work is by definition worthless "garbage" (quote). <br /> <br /> I do not understand how a film can get such a high rating, then again, there are still many people do not appreciate, and they have chosen only for very high or very low grades.
