This film could be very good, but comes short way. Funny special effects and so by doing so. I could have looked past that if the story was not so bad. When there was more background stories, it would be better. The plot centers around an evil druid witch who is related to the woman who gets migraine. The film drags on and on and never really explains nothing, it just keeps plodding on. Christopher Walken is a part, but it makes no sense, as a large part of the film. This film had the potential, but it seems that some very bad made for TV movie. I would avoid this movie.
