Average quality TV movie, full formula history religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who gives a good "I'm not only the president of" crazies R Us, "I am the customer too."), Who takes control of biochemical virus (think the virus from the movie "The Rock "). Too bad for him that he is stuck in the bank building during an earthquake with a bank robber and government agents who try to stop him (headed by clearly physiqued, mildly entertaining Wolf Larson, with the support of Fred Dryer), along with the standard "in the wrong place at the wrong time "courageous woman (all bland Eleniak) and" lived like a wimp, but he died as a hero at the last minute "men (Brandon Carrera). It has a standard background story, to give sympathy to the religious fanatics (wife and son who died in a police raid a few years earlier). . <br /> <br /> Basically decent rainy day movie <br /> <br /> Favorites Favorite Line says Ron Perlman once it finds a vial of the virus hidden in cleavage Eleniak in "The woman and her secrets." <br /> <br /> should rent.
