I saw the trailer and thought to myself, my God, this film really, who would like to see this movie and at the same time, I thought that my friend turned to me and said: "We have to go see this movie." ..enough I said, so I saw it for about 5 minutes to go, and I tried to put on a brave face and enjoy cheap horror stories, but there was not even any of them. He must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen a director has no influence prospects for the same frames over and over again is used it does not build up to the unknown cast, they were probably just said, screeching cry launch in the fall. I would like to see the script, like the first 40 minutes of mostly annoying little girl giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ... well, there was no conspiracy was basically I know that we will terrorize the high school team on their prom night stalker with a serial killer, it's brilliant! hmmm Action was what you would expect in the Australian soap opera bad that the protagonist god dam Blondie she annoys me. it should be a long line of half a sentence, and every time she was on camera, she just pulls another face rough. <br /> <br /> Please, listen to me, if you have any taste in the movies do not go to see it, and if your like me and have no choice well, then I wish you well, maybe smuggle in a bet or magazine. I can not believe that this film was made!
