People who really loved Problem Child (1990) should be examined their heads. Who would have the idea of ​​playing an evil boy harm to others and find it funny? The film is not funny, ever, in any case, from start to finish. He wants to be a cartoon, but the authors do not realize that farce is not funny when people are attacked by bears, or hit with baseball bats. It can be funny in the cartoons, but not in the film. <br /> <br /> The young protagonist of the film Young (Michael Oliver), who, since he was a child, was placed in the front door of the adoptive parents for adoption. Family rejected him because younger try to give them a hard time. <br /> <br /> He was then thrown into a shelter where he terrorized by a nun, and write a letter Pen Pal convict Bow-Tie killer (Michael Richards). He quickly passed Ben and Flo Gil (the late John Ritter, and his wife, Yasbek), who are dying to have children to be just like any other father in their area. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of the family Healey, and "Little" Ben is interested in him, despite the fact that it destroys the campaign luring the bear to the site, or throws a cat at the "Big" his father Ben (Jack Warden), fanatical politicians. <br /> <br /> I think that we should take care of junior, so that we can cheer for him when he gets his revenge on the man. His new mother, Flo, is a bitch, his grandfather is completely selfish, and one little girl - who despises adopted children. - a spoiled child <br /> <br /> But what makes the younger to get the last laugh this does not mean that funny- is a hard and sometimes life-threatening. <br /> <br /> And what is the message of the film? These are the children must solve the problem of violence and vandalism? What they should be looking for friendship, writing a convicted killer? They are definitely not what this is going to be a bad kid. Junior is not alone - he was just a sadist, a little ham. There used to be a time when it was bad for the kids to beat the other. Now, all laugh when younger children hit by a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this film was marketed as a "family comedy." What's worse is that the PG Heavy child evaluated. That the MPAA thought when they saw it? There's a lot of profanity and vile prank here that the question may arise about the division between the PG and PG-thirteen <br /> <br /> The kids will enjoy it, but parents will be shocked that be depicted on the screen. And for most people, Heavy baby will be considered as "schadenfreude" a classic; a movie that someone shamefully admit to liking, despite the common misconception that the charges more serious audience that the film is a piece of shit.
