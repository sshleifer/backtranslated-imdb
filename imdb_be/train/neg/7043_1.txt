I was ready to laugh throughout the film, as the Mystery Science Theater experiment, but it was just boring. It turns out that manufacturers have a lot of biker friends enthusiasts, and from there by chance decided to make a film. <br /> <br /> It is often unwatchable. Many frames biker traveling on a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly. Unfortunately, little Renee Harmon in the film. Harmon, is likely to have perked things. Perhaps she had other commitments, it was removed the next day. <br /> <br /> Of course, bikers terrorizing a small town. Fights, murder, cowardly cops, dumb mechanics, etc. One of the bikers always wears sends a football, a feeble attempt to distinguish it from other criminals. <br /> <br /> The script has nothing to offer, one scene has a biker attacking a woman screaming at a woman's face, "You do not care! You do not care! ". We return to the stage in a minute, he again said, "You do not care!". Could the writer to think about something more creative to say ?? <br /> <br /> At the end of the good guys killing bad guys. We also learn that the marriage between the old and the young mechanic Joe Susie was canceled. Susie is going to college, and we suddenly learn that the wedding of Joe is still (but on the other bride). End.
