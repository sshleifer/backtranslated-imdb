After reading the good reviews about this movie I thought it was time I go and see him. Well, I do not know why I worked. Basically it is a trusted family of a clue that leads to a large cache of ancient treasures hidden by the Templars during the War of Independence. Apparently, it had to be of British arms at any cost. First, why the said Knights move treasures from Europe to America? As Nic separator character to figure out what "Charlotte" was in fact a ship? How did they find out all the evidence and puzzles, in about a minute? And, as if two people suddenly became a master thief and steal what is probably the best guarded piece of paper in the world? These are just some of the plot holes in this silly little Hollywood action went wrong. Cage has been in some big action films - «Face-Off» and «The Rock» - so why he fell for it? Is he too old? His character is very annoying in fact - for some reason it is a "normal" guy steal the Declaration Independancd, ahead of a thief with a gun, escapes with the FBI and in general seems invincible. The entire film really does not make sense, and in general it was quite disappointing.
