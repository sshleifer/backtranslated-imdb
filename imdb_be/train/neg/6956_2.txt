Sorry, but every time I see a movie in which she sucker punches a man and the man does nothing but cower, the film loses credibility. Thus, the new (female) Starbuck immediately spoiled the plot before it even got off the ground (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was so much more believable as a sensitive character type than New Age Kattee Sackhoff-- which replay is likely to be now praised as "a compelling, exciting, must see the pioneering work" on the new political correctness says today editors review copiers; but, in fact, it's just a tired old image of a woman with a chip on his shoulder as big as the town house: the biggest stamp on the Today screen. I can give this series for another shot, but human caricatures will not by themselves keep me up in arms as James Hilton complained again ,. "History, please give me a story."
