As there was nothing wrong in acting, etc. etc. Literacy for the episode is far for the series Phantom or Phantom NO. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the Martian Manhunter. You should know that in the middle of the 6-series no matter what happens, it's not what's going on and really brings nothing to the history of the series, except to meet again with the Martian Manhunter and spend 30 minutes to make it today another case of bad writing in the soap opera Smallville. I enjoy the show, but mostly because of the actors and 3 or so good episodes each year, but who ever is on writing a cast that works or used to work on the soap should be preserved. It was definitely one of the worst. From within the first 4 minutes, you know what happens is a fake and that something is going on is a dream based on Causing Clark is obviously due to the nature of the phantom zone, and when he wakes up, he will win and blah blah blah, so authors should not really create villain who will progress the storyline any this week. Maybe just added another villain to die in the last episode of the Martian Manhunter was in and forced him to fly again, or go back and tell Clark that he forgot his glasses to get a closer look, in this episode, and call it a day.
