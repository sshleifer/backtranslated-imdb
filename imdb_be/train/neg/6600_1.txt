Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're better person than I am! This film, while a large attempt to "simulation" Laurel and Hardy through the look, sound and routine, falls very short of honoring them, or even to be a film of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue breaks the old L + H films and planted in unrealistic plot confusing useless feature other unwanted concomitant stars emphasis Pinchot was strange for the camp, and while Sartain did an excellent job with the emphasis Ollie, he tried too hard to create a wonderful mix who was Mr. Hardy. Where was (good) musical number? Editing jerks acting strictly ugly line, physics -implausable- (though perhaps they are trying to give him the feeling of cheap sets?), And on the whole it is a terrible thing to watch. It is more painful to watch than Atoll K, where the legendary duo made his last film in 1950 a terrible era of writing and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch a lot of original films Laurel and Hardy as you can, and learn how things work. You know what the magnates there, is not it? Stan Laurel did not always respond to the semi-idiotic barbs in each sentence. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for those who think that this is a decent update / honor of the boys. Where was the classic theme song?!? Why is death "Here's another beautiful mess? Why skip" any wiser? Why was pointless gaggle of co-stars? WHY TO MISS Gulch Wizard of Oz ???? WHY LARRY harmony to be in it? WHY BOZO!? And he made Training CHANNEL relief fund things? <br /> <br /> I mean, really. Fart jokes, please. <br /> <br /> fart jokes.
