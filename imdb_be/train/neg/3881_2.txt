A few days ago I watched a documentary called Fifty Worst Films of All Time, and that's where I first heard about the incredible fused MAN. Being a lover of schlocky films, I make it a point to try to find some movies from the documentary film - not only including the incredible fused MAN. In fact, swimming MAN is the first "bad movies" I have seen since, and I have to say that I am very disappointed. Although this is a really bad movie, it does not come is not close enough to be included in this list. <br /> <br /> Now, before watching the documentary, I enjoyed the "bad movies" ever since I read the book "Fifty Worst Films of All Time" Harry Medved. In spite of the same name, the book was a long time, long before the documentary and the creators of the documentary is never credited with the concept of the Bear. Bear of the book, I saw about 35 of the 50 films, but came to a standstill - the rest of the films are simply not available on VHS or DVD. So I thought I would try this film with the same title. <br /> <br /> So I was most disappointed Incredible fused MAN was that there were a few good elements in the film. First, the guy melting special effects are generally really cool and disgusting. It is obvious that a professional (known Rich Baker) has been involved in creating this look realistic. However, I would also like to note that there are more than a few cheap and cheesy effects, as well - such as a floating plastic head and the monster ran after his left hand was cut off - you can see it "hidden" under the clothing as for the story, it's just nonsense group of astronauts in a strange way enters Saturn's ring, without being suppressed then they comment on how beautiful the sun -.. as we see close-ups of it is surprising, since Saturn is so far away. it - it does not look that way - at and should be a great spot. Despite this, once the picture is changing, and we are told that one of the survivors of the astronauts are in the hospital. What happened between the last scene, and it? Yes, it is anyone's guess. Well, soon after, as a survivor shoots and participating in a lethal rampage, his whole body melted. <br /> <br /> Now, given that they have a psycho running around, which looks like a melting popsicle, you might think that the government will pull out all the stops to find and stop him, do not you? Wrong. Total engages one lone doctor to find it !! No army, no police - just some flaccid doctor. Even after the organs begin to installation, at no point do the doctor or even do anything to organize a full-text search or get backup. <br /> <br /> At the present time, given the stupidity of the movie, you would not be surprised to find the following :. <br /> <br /> If a dude melting runs next to the house doctor, the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves it in the house <br /> <br /> If a cute old couple managing late at night, they will naturally stop at garden to pick fruit and kill. <br /> <br /> If a woman sees a guy melting, she barricades the door, to protect themselves. It would be reasonable if it did not have a back door of the house, next to her! Rather than just go out and run, it is just waiting for! <br /> <br /> If the photographer and his model taking pictures, the guy grabs his assistant and pulls on its top. Why? . Well, to give the viewer a cheap thrill and make it an R rating Flick <br /> <br /> If a dude melting finally placed and the sheriff a clear shot at him, the doctor stops him - even if the creature is now killed about a dozen people. <br /> <br /> So, as you can see the film is replete with stupid plot elements. This is a very bad movie. But, given that sometimes good special effects, it just was not a terrible film, as I had hoped. Of course, it's good for a laugh, but no where near Plan 9 from outer space unsuitable and should not have been included in one's list of worst films.
