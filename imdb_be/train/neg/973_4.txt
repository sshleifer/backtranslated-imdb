Typically, this melodramatic film Bollywood inexplicably became the darling of Western critics. Scenario ridiculous, which acts in a top-and it looks shoddy. The only reason view this soap opera are beautiful songs performed Mangeshkar and the curtain of the legendary Mina Kumar. Watching the actress, who was ill at the time of the shooting, and will drink himself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released, it has the same fascination, like watching a train wreck. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, writer and director, but it lacks the competence to perform a task or well. Bollywood produces much better films.
