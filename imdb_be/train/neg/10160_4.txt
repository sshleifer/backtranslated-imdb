Typical Lanza film that had limited entertainment with a weak storyline, which has been introduced together just to justify Lanza MGM contract at the time. <br /> <br /> According to the member Lastliberal (above) Grayson could not stand Lanza, because it is obscene to promote her to leave (and sometimes on) the camera. In addition, his mannerisms drain and a constant smell of alcohol in her face during the scenes that they did together were unbearable. After performing his second (and last) film together, "Toast of New Orleans", it is usually quiet Grayson broke into the office of Louis B. Mayer and told him in no uncertain terms that she would never work with Lanza again ?? period. Mayer believes that Grayson was much more valuable to the MGM then Lanza, so the statement Grayson paused. Grayson went on to star in a number of widely accepted (and much more profitable) musicals Howard keel and others. Later in life, when asked to compare Lanza Kiel and her answer was that there was no comparison between the two, and that Kiel was great to work with and it was much more appealing to the "real people" in the audience.
