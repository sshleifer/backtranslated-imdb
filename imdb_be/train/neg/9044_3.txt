I really wanted to like this film, but much of it is stolen / borrowed from other works - some painfully blatant borrowing. The New York Times 'review said that their frogs singing is very similar to the one in the famous Warner Brothers' cartoon ( "Hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my ridiculous gal ..."). But I challenge anyone to watch Fox / Blue Sky animated feature Robots (2005) and did not find funny similarity: the storyline - a young inventor is growing, and one innovative company distributes all great inventions <br /> <br /> cityscape - very similar to shooting angles are very similar futuristic environments. city ​​<br /> <br /> ... robots .... - servant robot with mi Robinson has a very similar design to those in robots, and both the film uses a kind of retro-futuristic look. <br /> <br /> All of this seems to be in sharp contrast with disgusting quotes from Disney after all , this means that the company has steadily innovator who never looks back (which is also contrary to their ever catalog of films in the 90s, which were largely clones of each other, with some minor tweaks to the storyline and ethnicity). <br /> <br /> The filmmakers do not seem to be able to let the story speak for itself, and instead of constantly sending objects and sounds are flying in our direction, though we do not focus on anything less. <br /> <br /> The villain is really well thought out and brilliantly animated, and he is a pleasure to watch. Most of the rest of the film seems to have cast-subculture. Some of the landscapes look like CGI since the mid 90s. <br /> <br /> The film actually opens the classic Mickey Mouse short. By the end of this cartoon, we remember that Disney never had much interest in innovative or good speaking - they seem to think that just to get something on the big screen, it is sufficient proof of their strength.
