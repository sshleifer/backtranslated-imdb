This film is just boring. <br /> <br /> He's trying to copy some effects, taken to the Creative Director, as the wife in "Amelie", but this is too much. Dialogues pretty bad, some of the worst I've ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I almost never found it very convincing), his father in the film is very bad, dumb story, ending ... stupid. <br /> <br /> I think I do not love the movie so much as «Le pacte de Loups» (Brotherhood of the Wolf) by Christophe Gans (and I look / see 80-100 films per year), but, at least, that the film had some action and a lot of good actors. <br /> <br /> I never commented on here (only estimation), and when I saw the ratings and comments, I thought I had to write. something down <br /> <br /> I think we will not have problems to sell DVD we were offered not a bad film in our (large) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I am open (I watch the SF, westerns, dramas, comedies, Silents, horror, fantasy ... the movie!), but this movie was so boring that I felt like I lost one o'clock half.
