That this film can not be the answer of how wrong this war (and most American wars have only recently to get a little oil). <br /> <br /> How many innocent civilian casualties there were, how many lives lost and how blatantly stupid criminals <br /> <br /> So let me ask you. - if the American soldiers killing women and children, in addition to the enemy, its ok, but if the government accidentally kills his own strength deadly chemicals, killing civilians as well, is not it? Your logic fails, sir. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a 5 for the solid performance and everything else 1, 3 in total.
