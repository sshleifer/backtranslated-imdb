I take it, because the second segment of the injured me as a small child. I penetrated down early in the morning, began to watch HBO, and Raft (segment 2) terrorized me well. At this time, I still use a raft, although I could not tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons, or if it was actually a good short. The remaining two segments was a complete waste. I can not believe that somewhere producer paid to do this garbage. All I have achieved, observing it was to destroy another childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of spoiled childhood classics. 4/10
