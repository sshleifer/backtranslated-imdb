This "film" is a parody. No, wait - an abomination. No, wait - this is without a doubt the absolute worst film ever made featuring favorite characters created and set by other actors <br /> <br /> I thought, "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin in place of Peter Sellers. (!) It was inappropriate and blasphemous, but even daring to "remake" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy donkey and money digging. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy was dead, respectively, between 1957 and 1965. Why would anyone imagine that the corresponding update for L & H will be in person Bronson Pinchot and Gaylard Sartain me. I set up in the belief that to be sorrowful and confused, and I certainly was not disappointed. All involved in this wretched, stupid, disgraceful must be blackballed from anything and everything that is connected with Hollywood and the film industry. AVOID THIS FILM FOR ALL COSTS - YOU HAVE BEEN PROPERLY caution.
