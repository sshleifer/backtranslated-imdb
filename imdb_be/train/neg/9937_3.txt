Firstly, it is very dated film, not concentrated in the exposure of the left wing of the political revolution. Honestly, if someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intelligent (which in itself is quite meaningless, because the answer was arrived at by just being smart) reduces me to despair; as if we all have to go back to the primates in the name of equality - this is just ridiculous. Our intelligence is just one of the many human qualities, but that does not mean that we should not educate yourself as much as possible. But there is no doubt that this is a non-educational linked with Godard rock music; thus, The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Sympathy for the Devil", the creation of which we are seeing, and from which the film takes its name, this is actually nothing special. The sequence of chords, not particularly original, it has been used for much more effect in Led Zeppelin in «Thankyou" (Led Zeppelin II) Apart form that "sir" Mick Jagger recites his usual vague manner (rather like Bob Dylan.) - note how the first melodic phrase is repeated again devoid of imagination again form a poem <br /> <br /> in addition, the fact that. the Black Panthers, depicted in the film, it seems, e know that they are fighting for the most interesting scenes are linked by the equation of fascism with pornography; the message that actually undermines the sexual "liberation" of the 1960s and today (in fact, that the message that contradict behavior The Rolling Stones at the time, the film was made). <br /> <br /> not surprisingly, DVD-come free with The Sunday Times! For a really deep historical narrative left sympathies, listen to a masterpiece of Luigi Nono, «Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore».
