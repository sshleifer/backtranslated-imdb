1980s TV shows, updated with fresh female flesh, and raunchy language. "The Dukes of Hazzard" passed me; it is not repeated every time when I was in front of the television in New York or California; or I probably would have looked. However, somewhere (for example, clips, accompanying the updated release of this film in 2005), I knew that it was a fast, orange Dodge Charger - and, in the "General Lee" is still good to go. <br /> <br /> Hunky cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke), new Riders Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (as Daisy) fills her poor short well - but even her exciting pink bikini can not beat off competition from boarding the full bouncing topless Coeds. Too stupid plot involves gray Burt Reynolds (as the «Boss» Hogg) threatens to turn Hazzard County in a strip mine. <br /> <br /> ** The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
