Despite the fact that I have seen "Gimkat" in the theater back in 85, I could not remember the plot to blurry images of Kurt Thomas and fleeing fighting on the background of stone wall and disappointment at the ending, except. <, Br /> <br /> After reading some other reviews, I took a copy of the recently released DVD, to once again enter the world Gimkat. <br /> <br /> turns out, this is one of those movies made during the 80, which go directly to the video today. Movie Stars champion gymnast Kurt Thomas, Jonathan Cabot recruited from blue to penetrate people «Parmistan», to enter, and we hope to win «The Game» suicidal Bloodsport sponsorship Khan, who encourages his people, shouting that sounds like "How to Power . "The mission includes Star Wars defense system. Jonathan trained in martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves. Once trained by trying to blend in with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with touches of blue and white. Needless to say Cabot consider themselves running and fighting for his life along the stone streets Parmistan, on his way to a meeting with destiny, and games. <br /> <br Star />, Kurt Thomas was sick served as director Robert Clouse, who seems to have never been on a film set. The so-called scenario is this side of the incompetent. See other reviews for many gems everywhere. City loonies has some good moments, but ultimately destroyed the bad editing. The ending is ... meh. Nevertheless, there is a germ of a good action adventure here. Hong Kong version with more visceral action and a faster pace, maybe even very good.
