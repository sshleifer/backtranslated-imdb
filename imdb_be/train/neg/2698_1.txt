This film shows how racist John Singleton. He paints white and other races that are not black, as the evil that exists in our education system. How quickly he forgets that it is the same system of education, which has made him what he is and not at him. Ice Cube character is the epitome of inciting a black man who was responsible for much of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationship between the white and black characters, who were trying to reach out to each other. If Omar Epps said: "I have to be with my people" that the racist remark speaks volume. And, John, do not think for a moment that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the tower stairs did not get my attention. A nice touch!
