This film is now my gauge against which all other films will be compared ... as in "it was so ridiculous as Revolver?" I was also in the audience of the Toronto International Film Festival last night, when the room was filled with more than 2,000 people gathered in a terrible silence after completely stunned for 2 chasa absolute bosh. Jason Stratham would be strange if he had a purpose. During the first 10 minutes he gave a proposal by Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (The Sopranos fame), which does not make any sense! Then there's some shooting and then there's Ray Liotta wear uncomfortable bikini panties, then there is some animation, bare butt, Ray Liotta, in a lot of shooting, teeth gnashing, art house want to be pretentious and more awkward body Liotta, sparking laughter at every show .. .which I'm not quite sure, was the reaction he was looking for ... not 5 times anyway. Everything in this movie thinks they are smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he's Yogi Bear incarnate. Storylines could not go nowhere but posturing was outta sight! The only way this movie could have been even worse if Madonna herself was in it.
