It would be better, considerably strengthened by it as <br /> <br /> 50-minute episode of The Outer Limits. Too much excess material and such things as the main bad guy, looking like he escaped from the Phantom of the Opera did not help. The whole "Night of the Living Dead" sequence was very stupid and totally unnecessary. In the end, if the dead were to punish anyone for their sin now remind me exactly who killed all again?
