for the recognition of some good cinema than that, I can hardly say anything positive about this film. The only real problem is the dilemma of the hero or remain with his childhood friends in the world of suffering, or leave them to take their own lives. Rich "emotionally powerful scene" do not go with this story, and because of the bad effects, they also do not create a certain atmosphere. The Director manages only imagine the dilemma of Anthony and ultimately brings a simple solution. The characters do not seem to develop, although it is difficult to talk about any signs ... maybe except for Sonny. Beside him, the actors do not get to play a lot, and if some of them should they come off as self-surrendering lovers. Interestingly, the film has ruined more: the superficial script, throwing out the full potential of the site, or bad actions, violating any appeal that may be left.
