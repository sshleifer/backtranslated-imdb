I saw this movie a few months ago in the town, which appeared in Greendale in the film, which is the only reason I went to see him. Another local resident, who was there just forwarded me an email notification about repetition, showing, because the first one was sold, and people turned away. His editorial comment in its forward good summary: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unless you are a fan of Neil Young or live in / near the "Greendale" (when "UK" in the last, you know. whose real name), skip this movie. It is basically ego trip for the filmmaker. It does not have a tangible plot, the music is good, and too many of the lyrics unintelligible make it impossible to follow what little scraps of story can be. <br /> <br /> I do not need to put in a spoiler warning, because no unexpected pay. <br /> <br /> I would give it 1.5 / 10, but it is only for the value of the locale attractions to see made in the movie. Not worth the $ 6 I could pick up and overtake "Greendale" and make the best film itself. <br /> <br /> If you want to see * good * ecological message of the film, without a plot, go rent Koyaanisqatsi.
