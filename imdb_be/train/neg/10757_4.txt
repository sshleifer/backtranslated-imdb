I just saw this movie on DVD last night and decided to check the reviews in the morning. It seems that the "I, Robot" polarized critical review of the community here on IMDb (and spawned many insults and abuse, as well). <br /> <br /> I think it's a bit strange, since this film is not a great (or even good) but also not terrible (or very bad). What this movie really is ... depressing. Disappointing that the moviegoer of the US population is so ready to lap up the tasteless, the clichéd reheated, and welcome them as a spectacular new works. This film «RETREAD» written on it, from the storyline (Asimov uneasy mixture of modern and uber-action) on the nature of Smith's (clever cynics neck with a titanium spine), special effects (which is borrowed from the Matrix and some others) < br /> <br /> «I, Robot" is, unfortunately, quite possibly, the perfect action film for today's audience :. surface portion, tasteless instant dialogue, and lots and lots of adrenaline, Smith commonplace, but we already knew that (it seems to be the last unsuccessful attempt to create a blacklist of Hollywood Bruce Willis). The story has many holes in it, of all sizes, but I do not think most people are turning to this film quite critical minded notice. Perhaps blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie than a real winner.
