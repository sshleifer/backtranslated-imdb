History seen before, but it does'n business, if you can figure out to do the right storyboard. It is clear that the director did not carry out their work on the storyboard. At the same time, the operator has spent too much time resting angles that do not correspond to those of the film. The funny thing, though, if you look at the website of the film, you can read it on purpose, that the director decided to make a film with a bad camera angles. Because it reminds us of the hunt. But I've never heard of hunting with bad angles ;-) This will have a 1 star, because history is in order. It is a pity that Ti West, Sun spent more time to review its history. It's as if the film was more important than planning. Because you have a camera does not mean that you have to make the film immediately ... will come. Anyone can make a movie, but not all will be as well. Thus, a word of advice for Ti West: stop and labeling that you want. Use the time to start planning and taking off until everything is gone in the storyboard. Of course, you have the ability and the desire - so do not abuse your talent.
