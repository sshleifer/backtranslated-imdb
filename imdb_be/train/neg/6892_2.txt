Oh, my God. It was a real big mess, which simply could not help himself. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and is not going anywhere. While his mother meets a wealthy businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels), who she can marry. <br /> <br /> It would be a film the OK, when Heather was not playing its so annoying Jeffrey, from the start there is no chance in love with him, and he is only getting worse and worse. In the end, we have to love it, but there was no reason to, because he has not changed a selfish brute that he was at the very beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not seem to even try, and in a terrible form after 2007, because I said star Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Keaton and Heder, and where it is supposed to believe that their mother and son? The only salvation is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, though they do not look very interesting, too. Except for a few small smile, this film does not deserve to be called a comedy, simply because hardly anything to laugh! If your in the mood for a recent Diane Keaton movie to watch Mad Money or strangle, which are much better than this bottomless efforts.
