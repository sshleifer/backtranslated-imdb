"Maladolescenza" has the air of a dark fairy tale, with his children protagonists, protected forests, and the discovery of the ruins of the castle in. However, at its core, the film is essentially an unusual study of psychosexual teenagers. Opening with a dream sequence, which uses the not so subtle metaphor Fabrizio fights with his menacing dog, film detail of his psychological harassment of Laura, a girl who has taken her love for him, and his possible romance with Sylvia equally malicious. psychological complexity of the film do give credit for the film, but there is no doubt as excessively exploitative movie nudity and sex. view the film relies more on its excellent location, rather than a specific cinematic skill, and there is no doubt the greatest asset of the film is terrible, children's chorus, augmented soundtrack. Due to odd dreamlike quality, the film in the best case is interesting, but it pales next to the Louis Malle surreal and brilliant "Black Moon" from the same era. Certainly deserve the arts against the pornography debate, unlike many banned films, Pasolini's "Salo" or Larry Clark's "Ken Park", for example, the film is fairly unremarkable from an artistic point of view. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps "Maladolescenza" should be admired for holding this power thirty years after its release. However, the shock value alone is one reason why the film unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The film has its defenders. Nevertheless, like Nazism.
