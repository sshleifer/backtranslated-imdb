Two houses, one street, one telephone booth, one car, the girl next door, the boy next door and zombies. This list of ingredients must be large enough for a horror movie. All you need is some blue light, ambient and ... done. Not in the hands of Dutch filmmaker van Rouveroy though! <br /> <br /> I would like to organize a "bad movie nights" from time to time. The concept is very simple: to get a drink, get a movie-loving friends and plunge into the worst movie has to offer. For this evening, the world of mud is one of the best. Laughter guaranteed! <br /> <br /> The strange thing, van Rouveroy still protect the film, as if it was a great achievement. To be a witness to this you will have to listen to the DVD commentary track. Again: I do not believe and guaranteed laughs!
