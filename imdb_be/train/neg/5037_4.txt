Plot = Melissa a new girl in town, she was fifteen years old and her birthday comes within one week. Since Melissa is excellent, every boy in town wants to connect with her, but the little that manage to catch her interest mysteriously dies. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason that I wanted to see this movie because 13-pt Dana Kimmel Friday 3 was in it, which is not a proper reason to hurry up and watch a movie. When I started watching it, I realized that «Sweet Sixteen» is not very good slasher, this is really boring and boring and just does not go anywhere. After an hour, only three murders occurred, and the story is not very developed in every way possible. <br /> <br /> In the film, beautifully shot with very good photos and good directing, but just as with many other slasher clicks from the 80s, the film suffers from too dark at times. Action is actually very good, although the character of Melissa is easy to sympathize with, despite the fact that it is full of a whore. <br /> <br /> The storyline is not really garbage, but it's just too dull to keep you interested, the only thing that kept me interested was Melissa, she was stunning and Dana Kimmel is very sweet and cute in this movie. <br /> <br /> generally quite dull slasher flick that does not go anywhere, I would definitely Wouldn «t recommend it slasher fans.
