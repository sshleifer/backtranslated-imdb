this show is one of the worst show of all time! absolutely no original jokes and they are not always a year later. in 2009 they finally say something about fights Michael Vick. All members of the cast are people who like to be at the SNL, but had to go to the lowest of the low, crazy hour TV.its mad magazine witch jokes are not funny to begin with, said dire Wanna Bees Jon Stewart, so if you have any problems, tell me to have ID to hear the opinion of 3 people who watch this show. Griffin put it well, "Osama bin Laden is hiding in one place, no one would look, throwing a furious TV. There is a reason why no one is watching the show.
