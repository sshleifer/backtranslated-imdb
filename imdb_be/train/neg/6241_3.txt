Something that is not really going down directly from Al Gore (and his supporters) 's theory is all a matter of "consensus." <br /> <br /> If such a consensus, why is it that the "believers" in an omnipotent global warming feels the irresistible need to try and bully anyone who questioned them. <br /> <br /> Why is it that anyone who is not on global warming chord meet complacent or charges to be stupid or payroll oil companies (apparently, as a professional researcher of global warming does not mean that you have to pay anyone in this amazing world ...) Why is there the need to tell everyone how to solve all nN Anne, if it is the very nature of science honestly question assumptions? For some ideas about the answers to these questions, read on well know Prey gas puppet Michael Crichton ... Oh, wait, he's rich, and not for the salary of oil companies. He just took a huge the risk of a career in the sun wearing a green line and other Kyoto praying and told the truth as he examined it. by the way do you know what is necessary to live to the Kyoto Protocol will lead to almost no drop in temperature, in accordance with their patrons? Just a few questions that Al Gore did well to stay away from him not to get every penny of the environmental lobby in case he decides to run again. <br /> <br /> So who is a puppet ..?
