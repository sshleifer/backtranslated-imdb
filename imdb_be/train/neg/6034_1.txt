Oh, where to start ... this movie was horrible. Drafting was bad, it was bad action, special effects were bad. I think that the only good thing about this film is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie, but, of course, did not take! I thought it would be decent enough, as I am not picky. I watched a couple of bad horror movies. In fact, it is my goal to see all the horror movies, no matter how awful they can be. At one point in the film I made a comment about "corn syrup blood", and in particular they actually admit that it was Karo syrup (trade name corn syrup ...) The film had all the necessary things for a horror movie (blood, nudity, Var ' Yat killer silly moves), but it was just totally lacks anything to really do it well. The writer must either take some classes or just give up!
