This movie just goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought..mmmmm, cool movie may be a kind, but it's just pulling farther and farther, and in the end you do not know what's going on. Leading woman is a good actress and has played its role well, and psycho Fella, is terrible, but after a few you do not really care what happens, because this movie is simply delayed. Shame really, it could get much better. <br /> <br /> would like to say, however, that the main female and a psycho guy will have a good career in front of them, but they remember the film, to create their well known for being the film they are sorry when they ever done.
