This film. ,, I do not know. Why do they have such indellible character like Pippi and threw singularity unsightly Tami Erin, I'll never know. Why would they spend money on art direction and some are not all that bad, special effects, do not bother to change it right, I'll never know. Why did the sets and costumes are sometimes at a time and sometimes not whimsically, what they put into operation such a bad song, why the script does not make any sense at all (not even a silly, children's film level). ,,, What were they thinking ?? Nothing about this movie is not quite as it should be. Each part is duplicated (always bad) each sound effect is a little bit wrong, each revision in the wrong place, every bad performance in some way. It's really possible to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it never captures the magic that is the creation of Astrid Lindgren.
