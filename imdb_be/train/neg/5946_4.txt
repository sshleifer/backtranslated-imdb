There is absolutely no plot in this movie ... no character development ... NO ... nothing menopause. But there is some good action scenes, which are actually very good. So there you go ... as a movie in general is pretty bad, but if you like a mindless movie, which does not offer anything other than a good action scene, then watch this movie. Do not expect anything more than just that.Decent action and not too bad direction..A couple of cameos from Kimba and punish ... I looked to see Kara a little more in this movie..she a good fighter and a very hot girl. ... White great master of martial arts and a decent actor. I really hope he can land the best film in the future, so we can really enjoy it art..Imagine film with white and Jaa together ... it would be strange
