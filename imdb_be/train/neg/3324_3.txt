I saw it by chance one lazy summer day. He plays on the HBO Family programming. At first, I was involved in what I thought was a Disney animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found myself looking for the remote control, so that I could find Â«INFO BUTTON", to find out what was on my TV in the world. I have nothing against F. Harvey, I like him in many of his films, but one thing he is not is a voice-over artist. Of course, he has one of the most unique voices in Hollywood, but it works only as part of a larger visual package. Attaching his voice cute duck made to look pretty hard. As for the rest of the cast, uninspired. I think working on this film was not referring to a very good voice over talent there. <br /> <br /> Thus, weak voice talent, strong animation ... Who was this film targeting? Gay teens ducks? I do not understand. Is there really such a lack of role models for young gay and coming, that we should refer to the cartoon ducks? Cute story, and as the title of this movie I found hard to love, as well as the ugly duckling.
