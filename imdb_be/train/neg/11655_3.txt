I was very disappointed with this film. I thought that «Scary Movie», although not a big movie was very good and funny. «Scary Movie 2" on the other hand, was a sad, Sun funny and sometimes just stupid. <br /> <br /> Exorcist / The Amityville parody, probably the best part of the film. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit that I'm at a disadvantage, since I have not seen a few films, which is a parody, in contrast to the first, where I mostly saw them all. But a bad comedy is still bad comedy. <br /> <br /> What really hurts this film was the timing, which destroyed part of what might be a good joke. Scenes and fun way to pull out a long time. <br /> <br /> In addition, the same jokes continued to receive repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Well it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But he continued to receive repeated to the point of annoying. Routine guy between carriages and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was funny the first, but he continued to receive repeated and ultimately stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some of the jokes even got repeated from the first film. For example, the "settling" I suppose you could call him Cindy (Anna Faris) was ridiculous in the "Scary Movie" because Cindy spend on giving her boyfriend sex for so long that basically he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he cream "it. But this time it was ridiculous and not funny. <br /> <br /> in the bathroom and sexual humor in general has been a fun and timely for the first time. Ramp humor was excessive , though quite unnecessary in the second film. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was irritable and in fact there was no eaten in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I really enjoyed the kid (Marlon Wayans), who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot was one of my favorites from the second film . <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love family Wayans and their humor. that's why this film is so disappointing. ,, they have a lot more features than the endless comic Skate joke.
