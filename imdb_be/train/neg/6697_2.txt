Mad Gun pulled-incest-drive truck driver looking for revenge & obsessive-compulsive disorder control "Dad raped me when I was 12," handcuffs wearing all latex wear a prostitute a few characters, you'll be entered in the complete disgrace of the film that can be easily viewed on any cable TV station (IE: Skinemax) at 4 am on a Sunday evening. (?? And yes, I know there was a whole sentence, but a little bit with me people, it at length in a short review of mindless film) <br /> <br /> Filmed in "somewhere" Canada, almost. no budget, subject to this freak show entirely banal, the police in it, obviously never heard of the "State jurisdiction", because they end up chasing like Mia (whores) and Trent (idiocy, Anal Retentive, the Generic, dangerous college student ) across the US (and I thought that only FBI can do it). Luggage questionable, mediocre sex scenes and the action is so bad, it can actually cause flashback unintentional acid in films such as "Ishtar" and "Leonardo Part 6". <br /> <br /> As for the scenes of the skin to go (that's the only reason, even this film, do not even think about buying it), there are two of them. The first one is the only one worth watching though, which is a sex scene with Dominatrix Kari Salin and ____ (insert an unknown actor is not here, he's obviously done nothing else, it should be noted) in a seedy, disgusting motel room (like a bursting shell, dripping and carbonated water outside, which has only a blue toner remained therein). It's all S & M (riding culture, handcuffs, hot wax, and lingerie licks) people and, in the end, it gets left in a motel room, with no money and the cops are not waiting at his door (which goes to show you, guys, do not let him tie you up a prostitute in the "middle level" nowhere motel room). Unfortunately, though, Kari does not show the skin it should be remembered that alone can lead to a deep seeded traumatic experience for some masters, so it's definitely a loser in this flick. <br /> <br /> As for the ending, * Snicker * Snicker * I know that you probably will not mind if I revealed this to you, but I will not, you have to spend your hard earned money for. Overall I give it a 1/5 for action, for 3/5 of the skin (see last paragraph) and 0/0 for the action, character development or bizarre plot twists <br /> <br /> -. laughing man
