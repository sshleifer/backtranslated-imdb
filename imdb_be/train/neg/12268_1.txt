I saw about four other Japanese horror films, and they were not too impressive. Nevertheless, I felt that was a clever script path direction. <br /> <br /> Not here, not so. It is about a detective who is trying to link these killings that were taking place. If it finds a suspect to question suspects freaks, because they continue to see a ghost. Then the ghost begins to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and occupies more than half of the film. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? Oh, no. The film keeps switching perspectives of different characters that do not have much to do with history. I've seen this before in other films, where he shows a different perspective. Not the case. <br /> <br /> In addition, everything that happens on the screen that is actually tolerable ends quickly. For example, there are a few scenes with a small instrumental score that builds and ... then it just cuts to another scene. I understand that this may be a dramatic effect. It's definitely not going to here. It's just bad editing. <br /> <br /> And, finally, there is a "ghost", which just screams in a way that's not scary or unintentionally funny. It's frustrating, and it happens a lot throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All the panic has been done before in more efficient ways, so you can see them all coming. Then, after one of them, the movie ended. At this point, a wave of unrest swept the audience, I felt that we all felt that we wasted our time. Someone made a mock clapping and it was a laugh. It was better than the film. Simply put, to avoid.
