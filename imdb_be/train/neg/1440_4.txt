Swayze does not make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared with Stewart Granger; who grew up was my ultimate hero in films such as the 1952 "Scaramouche", 1952, "The Prisoner of Zenda" and 1950s "King Solomon's mines"; Patrick Swayze can not be completely even drawing senior Allan Quatermain by Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen." It was very good otherwise a great flop. also Allison Doody lacking affection Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive Ciriaco in Umbopa roles makes it very difficult for anyone to fill it (shoes) for !!! someone who was disappointed with 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain now I highly recommend it if you can not get your hands on a version of Granger.
