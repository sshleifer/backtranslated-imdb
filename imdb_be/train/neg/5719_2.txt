This film is very similar to the movie Hostel, except * BAD * action and not much suspense. Gore elements there, but in fact it does not feel anything for the characters, which makes the violence is not very effective. Some parts simply amazing ... like a snake forced down someone's throat. What to do? It is assumed that scary or mountains? It's just kind of ridiculous. With regard to torture, there really is no (for a guy getting hit, burned at the beginning, they did not indicate in any case except). The main bad guy goes on to say that "make them die slowly," but the butcher kills them all quickly. Death is relatively quick. Yes, I did watch "Unrated" version. So, in general, is not the worst film I've seen gusset, but not quite good. You do not miss anything if you skip this.
