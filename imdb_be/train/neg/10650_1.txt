This film is, without doubt, the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And that says a lot, considering that I have seen such ugly types like Demon of Paradise Lane lovers and Bloody Murder (who is a close friend). Nevertheless, I like bad horror movies, and, as you can tell from my user name, this is one really sticks out. Sometimes there's nothing more interesting than a poorly made slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a solarium, it seems, has no relation to the film at all, especially since the film can not tell you that this event took place 2 years to the rest of the film. The action does not exist, and most of the shoot cameras have a female shrinking area in spandex. A police officer was the stone-faced, monotone actor I've ever seen. The best / worst part of this film, however, has to be the murder weapon. Giant protective pin? What were they thinking? Who is the killer? Unhappy «Huggies» employee? I'd have to give this movie a common zero, but darned if I did not have blast watching it
