I went to see this movie just to see what all the hype is about, and I was disappointed as surprised as he received 6 (?) Oscar and 7.9 rating on IMDb, as it is today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow to be successful director ever to win best picture and best director Oscar for this kind of a really bad movie, and I wonder why? Does this mean the totally unrealistic "cowboy" a bomb disposal man Scene anything to someone that I was not able to see? Why do I get a mental image that this film was a remake of an old western on the wrong cowboy to make "bold case" in the Wild Wild West of the infected "harmful" Redskins; but only that it was installed in a different background this time? Oscar was given, because the director is a former James Cameron, did a good loser (gossip) history for daytime TV show to chew? Or is it some kind of clothes the emperor syndrome - where most people have realized that it was junk, but just could not say so because others seem to will not say it out loud <br /> <br /> And finally, what what happened to? sniper scene where they showed Kapanen sleeves in high-resolution, super-slow-mo, as if to convey a "deep connection" or something? Something in the lines Â«EOD guys are doing a good sniper and all of a sudden they get dirty terrorist constantly"? Was it just me who felt that there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the film squeezed in for no apparent reason? And you can get an Oscar for editing and directing for this ?? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do not waste your money on tickets. Wait until they go on television for several years. You're not going to miss a lot.
