Full House is one of the worst TV series! Why? Because all the characters are so annoying that it is impossible bear.The best character Joey even it is quite annoying occasionally.An, that girl DJ, who wrote her character? I want to kill my self every time she speaks.Not words, if Danny start with his philosophy <br /> <br /> An example :. DJ won ten thousand dollars or more in casino.However, she is not eighteen, so it should not be gambling in accordance with law.However casino was willing to pay her the money, but then Danny, her father Cought is his and not let her raise the money, because it is not eighteen.Oh come on, give me a break, will ya? Since I saw that it was stupid and childish scene, I immediately turned off the television.Some of the things they say, in this series, not even a child bought.Who in the world would have thought that Full House entertaining and funny? Every word they say in this series, it seems as Shakespeare wrote that it.Except Shakespere knew how to write, and besides, it will not be that children and silly to write something as stupid as they wrote the script for Full House! <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a bad heart, or any kind of ill-health or any will to live or to any sense of the real world, I strongly recommend "Do not watch Full HouseÂ»! Not even one episode as try it out.Avoid series.Save themselves from stupidity and nonsense.This worst TV show ever, I would prefer to watch the Teletubbies then this.'Do not look.
