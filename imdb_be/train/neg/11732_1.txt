IMDb guidelines say that you should announce when your comments contain "spoilers". <br /> <br /> well, the whole film is something spoiler ... a cautionary tale that celebrates the fact that he warns against, the story of lost youth, he did not know where he is going. <, Br /> <br /> I just saw this on the Tribeca festival. this film was not just bad, it is very bad. <br /> <br /> actor's controversial characters appear mostly clich√©s proposals with little depth, and acting Farnsworth was very poor in particular. <br /> <br /> from the condescending accents meaningless absurd storyline to "graphic" element of a recurring dialogue and scenario ... it sucked big. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for something more dramatic, an updated "Drugstore Cowboy" with a touch of "Natural Born Killers", but it is not where it is sensitive to the characters, as the former, and not where the shocking (outside some level of brotherhood gore) as a ladder. <br /> <br /> More than anything, someone had in fact) to edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are some things there to build on and clear <br /> < br /> deals with a subject worthy ... if clumsy attempt at this.) B) to edit the film. when it was cut to the core may be patency. <br /> <br /> I would be less than 1, if I could ... as possible zero Kelvin.
