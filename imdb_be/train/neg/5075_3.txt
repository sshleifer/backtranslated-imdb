The animation was good, the imagery was good, though not entirely original, but the story was too long, too complicated, and over the top dramatic. After about an hour I could not wait to get it from. With so many characters who have nothing to contribute and plot elements that have either come from nowhere and go nowhere, this film really was not a movie at all, and it would be better as a short series or possibly two films . If you like this kind of typical stories, maybe you will like it, but to be honest, I was spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort of message to tell. Go to a movie, Miyazaki and watch it twice, you get a lot more out of it.
