Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt one of the most stupid movies ever made. We are talking about a cruise ship waiter Shecky (Sandler) wants to be a comedian on a cruise ship. Firstly, there is not a funny or common line in the entire film honestly. It is so unfunny it's pathetic. There are surprisingly not too crude and sexual humor, but the f-word in abundance. The budget is really low, but also destroys the film. It takes place on the ship, but it seems to me that they only had the money to rent a small boat, and only had the money for extras 10 vessels, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Animated opening credits reeeeeaally cheap, and it's just pathetic. I hate this movie, and everything else that sees this will hate it too. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. Rating: R for language.
