It's made for television and rather unnecessary Sci-Fi Channel retelling of the story of Beowulf, especially after the recent 2005 film "Beowulf & Grendel." This film does not get into the story of Beowulf, but simply takes us through his fight against a beast known as Grendel, as it leaves the kingdom in absolute fear and despair while the powerful Viking warrior Beowulf is intended to relieve them from the violence of the monster. If it is successful, the king no longer have to sacrifice a child to keep him at bay. After several unsuccessful attempts, the creature dies, but the wicked and vengeful mother was soon attacked, leaving him to Beowulf, again, to lend its strong acts of courage and strength to defeat him. "Grendel" looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and CG effects are terrible. As I said, this film is absolutely superfluous.
