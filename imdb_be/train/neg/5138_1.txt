I watched the effigy of buzz around it. Well, I can not imagine someone loving this movie, because it's just bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the one who made this film does not know a thing about horror. The whole story is an unfortunate marriage of two genres: thriller (guns and criminals) and horror (live scarecrows). If criminals are killed one by one by a miserable looking stuffed animals, these two genres will automatically cancel each other out, because, firstly, they are criminals, but who cares about criminals, and secondly, because they are stupid criminals to boot! With zombies scared to go after them just does not work here. Where the horror is that? I wanted criminals die a horrible, painful death. <br /> <br /> But the story is so poorly constructed that the marriage of genres that could be original, if not handled well, NEVER gels. We just stayed a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of stuffed animals that "live" by some far-fetched reasons the filmmakers have come up with. Making things worse is the fact that the cinema is terrible (TV like) and, even worse crimes all whole bunch of dialogue speak switches, and we hear the silly dialogue spoken of disconnected images, as if we are seeing some kind of radio show. This region was a really BAD. The director was shot on the spot came up with such a stupid idea! I can not tell you how annoying that was. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, criminals stuffed surprisingly stupid. For example, if someone is suddenly found, gutted and filled with money and straw (for example, straw) in his huge open wound, others ask, "What kind of medicine he is now?" After they shoot a ton of bullets at him, unable to kill him (he was «zombiefied» for a scarecrow. Do not ask ...). Get a freaking clue, morons. I've never seen such stupid people in movies. And then there is a girl. I wanted one of the stuffed animals killed her quickly, because it was a pain in the ass. When she finds her father came to the effigy of "cross", in fact she blames faulty culprit in stages (bad acting), despite the fact that criminals would not be able to do it. What a fool she was! But a bogey greatest weakness in this very weak movement. They are not afraid. Nothing much said about them. They are simply a plot device in this portion of the device, the filled film. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley, removing face bogey for 30 seconds NonStop nothing but boredom causes. And this scene with a talking head in the refrigerator. Thanks for the laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, it should have been one of the worst movies I've seen lately (and I've seen a lot of movies these days!) By the same slide, or SILO killer scarecrows, I would Watcher SILO KILLER again. So stuffed that bad.
