Van Dien should wince with embarrassment at the memory of this absurdity bad film, as indeed should each individual involved. Frankly, I am rather embarrassed to admit I watched it from start to finish. Values ​​productions are somewhere between the original series "Crossroads" and "block cell conclusion H". Most will be able to come up with a five letnihov more realistic dialogue and a believable plot. As for the acting performances, if you can imagine the most trash porn you've never seen - one of those where the action is complemented with some endless "stories" to explain how some of the peroxide blonde chubby old boiler went to get twisted pair -roasted guys with mustache - you'll have some idea of ​​the standard operating «Maiden Voyage». To make matters worse, you can not fast forward to the sex scenes, because there are none. Terrible terrible film.
