When I saw the title, I thought we were going to get one more try-hard hip slasher, but I actually found «7eventy 5ive» be a little pass, and almost 80 atavism after a tedious slow middle section he picks up momentum for the final Half an hour, leading to it is outrageous sticky climax and ending at all to shirk. It will not win awards for originality, because it is as systematic as you can get, and steals his thunder in the way of thrills (usually a cheap jump scares), location (secluded mansion) and the motivation of the other films. Direction sparkling is the book and the material is quite jaded with poorly implemented red herring as part of its complex plotting and far-fetched scenario. Sometimes funny, but nevertheless I was entertained in the main because of its cruel and horrible acts of fleshy violence against some pretty insulting annoying students psychotic killer with a battle-ax. The performances were not bad in the form of a passionate young cast, but they drew the characters they were not particularly attractive. Always presentable Rutger Hauer is manifested in the short supporting role grizzled detective. Slickly made, but shallow and forgets addition to the crease.
