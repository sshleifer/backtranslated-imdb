I saw this movie for the first time, about twelve o'clock on Saturday night. It really is a great time for this. I've never seen a movie that was actually more predictable and imbued with stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting fighter, do not look, because you can lose the will to live in the middle. However, if you want to laugh, please watch! I even bought the collection thanks to Chuck Norris 3dvd my pleasant Saturday evening. What particularly struck me was the fact that every scene that will be expensive to copy was inserted with the Discovery documentary, or the old TV special on the US Army. In addition, I was struck by the fact that they do not put any effort in making production look real. Afghanistan, as far as I remember, nowhere near any of the sea and another with a single click Deke eludes terrorists sand castle with his jet pack and taken to the submarine (possibly Discovery). Later in the film, Deke throws Islam terrorist against the wall. In the slow movement of the stage you can see the fine long hair Korean stunt flap in the air as he crashed into the wall. Gotta love it. I recommend you watch it with friends and a good amount of beer, though, only then you will understand why I was crazy enough to spend 6.99 euros on the box.
