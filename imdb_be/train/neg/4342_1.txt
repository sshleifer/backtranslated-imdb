I must say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. They had a very good storyline to go on, but what spoiled it so bad. First of all, acting is not so, where is that van peeble (shit actor by the way) and puff daddy has come from ??? It seems that Carlito came from the hood, and is used to hang out with some real idiots. This film does not «Carlitos Way» any justice. I am so happy that the continuation of "Carlito's Way" came out first if I'd seen this first litter, I would never have given Pacino version a chance. And in any case, Pacino should read this story, I thought it was crap and make a sequel instead. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 out of 10. Way Carlito - 9 out of 10.
