Here we have two weird kids who never had a chance against the cruel poverty permeated existence: Robin Hoods singled out the police for prosecution because they were a little wild times. Gad! In accordance with this shit Bonn was the sweetest little thing west of Missouri, which was taught to be a psychopath killer on the fun-loving friend, who really does not want to offend anyone .... He just wanted things without putting a lot of energy in getting them. Bad acting, bad shot, unbelievable dialogue unrealistic use of weapons, gore, which was more like grape jelly than the real thing. Avoid this bilge water. Thumbs down. -5 stars.
