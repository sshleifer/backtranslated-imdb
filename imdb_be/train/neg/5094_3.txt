This movie sucks. Acting sucked, sucked the script and the movie in general sucks. There were two lines in the film that have not been developed and the audience had to do a bit of work to figure out what's going on. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that it should be spelled out, but you suddenly everything happens, and, as they say, as if you have no clue as to what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> negative comments about the character of the heroine. The viewer never indicated she did not even know anything about the guy, and he is tied to the death of her fiance. The viewer has a minimal impact on the guy's death, as well. <br /> <br /> In addition, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys who load and upsetting machine guns, and that's all that you see in front of cuts to other scenes. No explanations that da ever about guns and the people with them. HN <br /> <br /> We gave her a 3 because we did not feel we wanted our time ago. It was interesting to pouring mouth movie while watching it, so that at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)
