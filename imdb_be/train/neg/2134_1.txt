With this cast and a budget you will have to wait longer. <br /> <br /> John Cusack made a series of films that border on strange, but still working. Neither he, his sister, nor Sir Ben could not do anything to save this parody of the banal badly written trash. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing more than a series of gags and poor in this. The plot is not going anywhere, writing contrived and meaningless characters of tissue paper. If you think of the film as a three-dimensional, where the story and the characters bring the depth of the images, this bitch comes across as flat as Mickey steamer. <br /> <br /> The appearance Aykroyd this brings back memories of the other truly awful film one thousand nine hundred ninety-one nothing but trouble. To be honest, this film is the type of project that is killing his career and gets fired agents.
