I usually comment on the films that I like, appearing "all to his / her own taste," but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this film, which somehow seems lost in the shuffle, that these two selfish adults have a right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, get married, and cause untold suffering to their broods of children. Even taking into account the cultural authorized intoxication, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they are in motion. After all, "love" is all that matters, is not it? To hell with everyone else. Whether or not things "work in the end" is not really the point; in fact, it does not matter. The fact is that lack of respect for others, especially if they are young people, and especially if they are in a state of dependence, to make the world, and thereby amplify this film. There is much more innocuous behavior of these "parents" could have made that would have brought down the army of social workers on their head to the heart.
