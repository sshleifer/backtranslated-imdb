Having heard and enjoyed Omen II Comment Harvey Bernhard, I was shocked to find that it was also for this absolute garbage piece. It's like a really bad TV movie, you can look in the middle of the day when you have the flu and is too sick to get to the remote control. I think that in a bit where Michael Lerner faces that I can only describe as a high school Miserables cast my mouth dropped open in disbelief. And then my mouth up and down, because I was laughing so much. Dire. I do not know why I have to write a minimum of ten lines, I made my point succinctly, there is nothing reasonable about all this today lies.
