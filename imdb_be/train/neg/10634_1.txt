Writer / director Bart Sibrel bases its work here around the banks of the film, which he says he was mistakenly sent to him by NASA. He says it shows astronaut pretends television footage of his trip to the moon, using camera tricks. The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time, and editor of the earth, which is the raw material in just a few seconds of finished film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel study is so fuzzy that he does not understand it "behind the scenes" footage actually passed pretty much 30 minutes of live broadcast (also on this drum), which has been seen by millions, not hidden in the vaults of the NASA as it suggests. And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his conspiratorial story over the sound of astronauts in frames, because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly explained that the astronauts simply testing the camera, rather than pretend frames. <br /> <br /> Finally, everyone can see the raw material for themselves without having to buy a hacked up version Sibrel on it. (He shows you more murder Zapruder film of JFK than its "hot gunÂ».) Sibrel thinks he's the only one who saw it. More revealing clips of the raw footage, which Sibrel decided not to use, for example, clearly showing suitably distant Earth eclipsed window frames and so on, destroying his statement that Stein and transparencies were placed in the windows of the spacecraft to create the illusion of distant lands. <br /> <br /> As with most films of this type, Sibrel relies on innuendo, speculation unqualified, misleading comments error, and selective quotation manipulate the viewer in making the withdrawal, for which there is not a grain of actual evidence.
