Even though 99.99% of the people who saw this film a Brazilian, I will keep up with English as the language of the site. <br /> <br /> This film is part of cr * p, the worst I've seen in action for a loooong time. Children were so. Especially the boy. It was the first time I saw someone with a facial expression less than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a tone of voice as 5 years old kid reading before class. As someone so badly can be the main actor of the movie? The storyline is so shallow my daughter could do better (she is 3 years old). It is so simple that it can be written on a napkin, he said in 3 minutes <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities for someone to love this movie :. 1) you pre-teens; 2) You have been so brainwashed nonsense Globo, that you think that everything that has a seal Globo is awesome; 3) you have severe brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! Shame on Brazilian film scene.
