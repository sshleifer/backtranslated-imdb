This movie was bad. This movie was terrible. The acting was bad. The setting was unreal. The story was absurd: A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear in one night. Most of the population of the world decided to see the comet. Then, the next morning all but the chosen people was transformed into dust by radiation of the comet. People's clothes intact, there are plants that are still alive, but the people were turned into dust. No bones, no nothing. That's ridiculous. As radiation can incinerate people, but leave your clothes and other biological substances untouched? <br /> <br /> Even better, the comet mutate some people into flesh eating zombie monster. Their composition was not even looked scared of a newborn baby. Insane Clown Posse scare me anymore ... and they need to look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Then there were survivors. People who were surrounded began when the comet passed was spared from a zombie at home and death. As a steel block radiation of the comet, which supposedly incinerates people in their tracks? <br /> <br /> At least 60 hurt in this horror music playing in the background through a part of the film, or 80s hair rock, which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot a TV <br / > <br /> in a silly part of the film, however, focuses on the characters it :. two Valley Girls and Chakochite of Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were completely unrealistic. Who would pillage the next day after the apocalypse with meat eating mutants works everywhere? There were four scenes of 5 minutes of terror in the entire film, and most of them had a dream. In between these scenes, inexperienced dialogue that makes South Park, it seems smart. The silence between the elementary dialogue was painful. I could make a better film with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Nha see this movie, ever.
