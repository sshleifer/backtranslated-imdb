Bizarre take on the fairy tale of Cinderella. Awful Poor script, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty decent performance wicked stepmother. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning in some parts, but that's about it. In the period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. . Fast forward until you see something interesting and save the full 90 minutes of nonsense <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I believe, «Ever After: A Cinderella Story» or "glass slipper".
