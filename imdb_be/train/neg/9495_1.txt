This is a terrible film, not one scene ounce of true emotions. Symbols immutable clearly depicted, and predictable storyline obvious and typical Hollywood execution desires. <br /> <br /> William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this film was made, but he's playing someone in his early 40s, and looks like he's in his 60 s. Kay Lenz was 20 and had a script to find him irresistibly attractive. I think they found the dog on the side of the road it was hotter and had more life than their erotic connection <br /> <br /> character Holden. - the same age, like Clint Eastwood when he made this film, (not) match - contained with obvious attributes of the 60-ies to hippie Cool: bachelor, rocking Hi-Fi, dining in Yamashiro. But the film is funny disbanded, clang flashy old fogies desperately want to free the minds, which they saw in the sunset and in the Laurel Canyon them and their great Honkin 'sexy car. <br /> <br /> Uh find. Youth culture has never been that desperate. And I shudder to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for the youth, that he accepted the uncomfortable part.
