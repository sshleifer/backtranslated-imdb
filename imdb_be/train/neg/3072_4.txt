Margrethe Laurence, is probably not going to having any of her novels, made for the movie, not to mention the stone angel. Agar, as a character, was the one who constantly challenged the social norm (to challenge those who dare, anyone?), And ended up almost sacrificing its humanity in the process. The characters in the book (The Stone Angel, silver thread, etc., etc.) are a constant reminder of the struggle between the old and the new, and the massacre (so to speak) on the way. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is quite faithful book story (but it is not really a good-natured story of speaking, right?), I think I missed the point of capturing the spirit of the film. disobedience of Hagar (for disobedience) would not. Bram could be much more crude than painted, and Hagar's father could take a more "traditional", so to speak. If the director is insisting on a strong image, the film will drive home the point directly. <br /> <br /> In the same vein, why do we have to see, cell phones, organic products and other upgrades? Are we trying to do some things in order to create some points (for example, a Muslim friend and native people). Agar & Co. have all but politically correct in the book, so why do we need to see that in the film version. Modernization can be an excuse for a low-budget, but using it as an excuse to send subliminal politically correct messages, which do not have a relationship to the novel (and film), it seems that throwing punches below the intellect. <br /> <br /> There is also the audience. It seems that we have been accustomed to see the bitter old man, how sweet and cute. Why should laugh every time when Hagar her tantrums? Doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers laugh, or Hagar. These people are upset and full of yearning, and all that we do is to laugh at them. I do not think it did Hagar and the other people in her situation any justice.
