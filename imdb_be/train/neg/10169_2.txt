It's 1978, let it be, obviously too many black players on the team as well! Fans will be upset, and, of course, 75,000 seats will be full, only less fortunate there are so many black players on the field! This made-for-TV movie watchable Super Bowl. It's not a lot more, but it's really strange cast of talented actors that make appearance (for the time), probably in the first place Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, any goodness Sellki bring to the screen, quickly cancels the "actors" as Butkus. <br /> <br /> This is a silly story about a super balls bet. PJ Jackson is accused of "New York" (read mafia) to ensure that the game ends their favor, in this case the rate of $ 10 million. PJ is innocent enough, and seems to have a loose understanding of buying from a few people here and there. But everything seems to fall apart for him. Another man, the emergency Lainie, takes responsibility. For some time, the murder mystery is not known for certain, but it appears quite clearly in the final killing, Lainie is a new antagonist. <br /> <br /> It's a bad film, but it's watchable. Acting decently and filming in order. At least there were no bad typical 70s car chase (they have their place but not here). Just an open mind about the past stereotypes and cocaine era, and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (perhaps 2.5)
