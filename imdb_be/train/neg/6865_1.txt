This movie was so bad it was funny. I could not resist watching it, though. The plot is the standard serving pretty awful (with the support of actors, such as the nutty neighbor and friend of the lawyer were the best actors). Kind of funny, if you have some time to spend, and how to see the output to a dramatic story <br /> <br /> headliner, who plays "Katie" was just fascinating, because I could not decide when it is calm, flat affect. It was the result of a bad surgery or just a bad actor (I decided that this was so). This leaves a comment on the scenario, it was pretty scary. Pat remark, stupid decisions and foolish stupidity on the part of each character in the film. Maybe that's what was so riveting; I do not know. I was just looking to see how bad it can be. (In fact, dialogue is not even the right to be called "clich√©", -. But it is almost completely meaningless) <br /> <br /> In general, very bad, cheaply made film. Set, the same scene (house, building) have been shown again and again, no artistry or actual tie-in action; more props that have been accidentally dropped into effect in a bad game. The chase scene could be shot any minors in the warehouse or the old school: bad shot, cheap props, minimal action .... and I still would like to see the final. Go figure it out.
