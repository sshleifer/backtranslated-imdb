All participants (and the audience) should look for "candidate" to see how well this film could be. What happened in the history of South America? What was Julie Christie and Capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard expressions. So far I have liked every performance Gene Hackman and / or film. He was either disinterested (which I can hardly believe) or badly miscast. Also, I loved and defended Richard Gere (and vilify for him). But then he did not have the "power". He was never terrible, and only rarely convincing. In general, I was very disappointed. I really expected a lot more from this director and actors. If you can not find the "Candidate" look "Wag the Dog" again or "Bulvorte".
