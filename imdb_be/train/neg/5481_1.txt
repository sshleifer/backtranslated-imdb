<br /> <br /> Not only aliens look just like a fluffy armpitted human woman and not only the aliens are able to speak well in English (Australian accent) as they call their star with the same name, our Earth, astronomers have I gave them! <br /> <br /> and at the head of all that is, all alien life knows how mean, wicked, wasteful and destructive to us humans. And they are fully prepared to tell us how bad it is. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the opportunity to see this film, it is not necessary. Well, if you do not suffer from insomnia or versions of the film or an exploratory surgery without anesthesia. <br /> <br /> This film is trying to get the moral, ecological point across, but only succeeds in creating a yawn and pray that it will end soon,
