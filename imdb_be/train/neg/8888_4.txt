I'm rating Basic Instinct 2 high-tech, but the film was less than the rating of 4. The film only received a 4 from me, but it has a 7.3 with more than 600 people. I see no reason why they like this movie so much. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring because he almost never leaves those rooms in the big house broken. And it only has a total of 5 people in this movie. This has long been almost two hours, which are not needed. Many dialogs slow and pointless. The tone of the film as dark blue, which is depressing to watch. The film can be simply shortened to a few phrases. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of the "Three times," the director Hou Hsiao Hsien, that one just sad, too, equally boring dialogues. It also has a high rating! I had to stop watching that one of the first story is finished. <br /> <br /> In this film lacks passion or excitement.
