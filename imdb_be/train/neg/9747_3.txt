Well, first of all, this movie sucks. But let's look at why. The assumption is that the machine is able to transform matter into energy, store it and then transport it and reasembling is at least intriguing. But this is as far as they accept this premise. Rather than delve into what could happen if someone has done this kind of machine, they break the damn thing. It might be a good prerequisite. Responsibilty life with this kind of power, and it's a constant temptation, that is .. invisible man. But no .. they break feature. And Lembach wants to leave. So then the doctor-canister machines things together, and trying to transport himself. Only that he goofed his beautiful but dumb secretary (Spirit). Whatever happens, if Lembach not decided to leave. So now he is roaming the country side to kill people because of his little experiment was a failure, and they will not give him the money. Bax. Then, to make matters worse the movie, throw in a dry British relations between the two semi-competent teachers hired to help him. Between loving their sessions, they do a few half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills half of London. All of this could be prevented without breaking the damn machine that would never have happened if Lembach left. This film so I tried to give it an honest effort 2 star, but it would be better if they did not break the damn car, making Lembach leave, causing him to try again. Damn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
