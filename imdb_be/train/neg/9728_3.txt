Toba Hooper made great movies, so I was sure that it can not be bad. I did not read the reviews and tried to watch this film unintentionally humorous. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes I almost CRY for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I rated this 3/10 because his 1990 "horror" -movie and a lot of interesting and funny things happened there. Throughout the film, I was thinking something like "they simply can not add more things in this movie ..." .. but they did. <br /> <br /> Some say it is a kind of clone of Firestarter, but really the ISN "t . It is based on this idea, but that's all. It's a combination of horror, comedy, awesome religion / god things of Gore funny, simple effects, drama, terrible acts incredibly script..and more <br /> <br /> * spoilers * Story :. Government is trying to create the ultimate weapon using nuclear energy or something and fails during the process the child is born and 2 subjects. When she sings to her child after birth, as husband and wife burns and is self-ignition. The government hides all this and comes out of this child to live among other people ... and then in terms of e, this child grew up and realizes that he was born because of the stand and it can burn things with his brain. Then everything goes incredibly dirty nothing really does not explain anything .. well, if the government understands the "well now he can set this fire thing to work," they take it in a normal hospital, where some nuclear toxic items they are going to use for that man, because they could not kill him, no, they can not remove it, no! Argh .. and I think it will be enough to say, I promise there are more than 100 amazing things in this film. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want a good laugh watching it. Gosh.
