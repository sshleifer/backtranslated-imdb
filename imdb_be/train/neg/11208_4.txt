Raymond Burr stars as a lawyer caught up in the murder of his best friend (Dick FORAN), thanks to his love for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). It was a whole year before he began to make Perry Mason, so that the film may be of particular interest to his fans when he was the inspiration for his casting. <br /> <br /> There is not much else here, it's interesting, though. Lansbury is always good, but her character is very one-dimensional and the motives of her crime in secrecy are obvious. There's an interesting statement Lamont Johnson as an artist, who is also in love with the "femme fatale", but the nature of Burr is quite simple. It is open strange to see an actor like Burr makes this romantic scene with Lansbury and his stammering delivery does not correspond to his character here is very good as it does in most of the films that I've seen him. There is no mystery in fact, and all the unknown should be around the film's title and so that character sets the character of Barry Lansbury implicate themselves (double jeopardy prevents its original judge murder again, allegedly). He does it with a very large deck that she does not notice when she walks into the room, I think. <br /> <br /> A few may have unintentionally funny moments and basically all the other things could be done for TV.
