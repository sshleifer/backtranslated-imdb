This is by far the worst horror movie / thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers it free to tell them no. This film makes you stupid man for knowing you are watching it. The plot is not even the worst part of this film ..... his acting, camera work, lighting and sound. There is absolutely nothing like about this movie. who paid for this film I did undermined at present. I hope that the director never gets green light for another film. In his defense, this film was made quickly to try to capitalize on the capture of the actual BTCA killer, but I saw the movie of the week that looked like Oscar winners compared to this.
