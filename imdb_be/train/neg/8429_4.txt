This film does not offer anything new to the genre, which is traditionally indicated by cross-cultural love story supported by policies in the mid-20th century / before the Second World War in India, where the British and modern ways are poor and primitive, but honest and true Indians well. Of course, such clichéd depictions of the British rather passé now. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama that feeds the second part of the film's story is predictable, acting is a pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the direction is obvious and mundane. <br /> <br /> stories really need to be fleshed out and, of course, took advantage of another half-hour of screen time to give character and narrative more depth and give the audience something to feel some investment. <br /> <br /> generally pretty sad. Oh, and Linus Roache just can not make a tragedy - there is a squint with emotional pain just does not work for me!
