When I saw this "documentary" I was disappointed to see the Serbian propaganda in action again. While Serbia and its nationalist policy is the main cause of the collapse of Yugoslavia, it is not mentioned in this "documentary" which is made Bogdanovich, whose name tells us that he is a Serb, and his film that he is far from the target. This is one of the many lies Pull the Milosevic regime. All the others are to blame only the Serbs were right, and the victim, although the majority of the war criminals tried in The Hague Serbs, while the Serbs alone, CT about the genocide committed against Bosniaks and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia all independent countries recognized UN.Breakup Yugoslavia would not be avoided, because the Serbs did not want to release the power of nationalism put on the federal Yugoslav government, as Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent states in order to protect their interests.If you are interested in an objective documentary about the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and documentary cited the fact that it is not. You have to look "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation", made by Discovery Channel and the BBC.
