Sorry to go against the flow, but I thought that this movie was unrealistic, boring and too long. I'm tired of watching Gene Rowlands long hard fight with him, and the crisis, she felt. Maybe the film has a certain value or cinema represents an important step for the director, but for pure entertainment value I would have missed it.
