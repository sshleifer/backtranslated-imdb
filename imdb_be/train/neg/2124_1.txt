The film relates the story of Eddy, as indicated in the title, and his return to his homeland to old friends in a seaside community. The plot involves a group of friends, as it happens in the world that Eddy left as a means to deal with the death of a friend, in which he feels in some way responsible. But this is not essential, since the choices made in the production of very poor and not fully implemented. Screenplays not always need to be "chatty" but they should at least contribute to the development of history. Here attempt one line, such as "he just took off," or "I know that you have no love in the heart," just do not fully bring something worthwhile during the audience. In addition, every time a writer feels at a loss where to go to the next, he cuts to the musical montage of the protagonist, who goes through the field to the indie music mood. it's about trying to hard. If you are interested in a good movie, the type that gives quality and content throughout the style, it is not a film for you.
