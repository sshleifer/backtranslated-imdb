This film shows us nothing original. Every idea or (action) scenes can be found in many of the previously released films. Fabulous Nick completely plain here. Even Will Patton calmly and evil nor good. Mr. Duval is good, but has a very small part. Just Angelina, so how can we define it recently known stardom? In general, there are too many characters, so that nothing and no one particularly detailed. This makes it easy to forget the movie. Sorry, do not you think?
