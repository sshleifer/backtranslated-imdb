Despite the fact that someone was likely focus on this comment, among other 80+ for this film is low, I feel like I should say something about it. I'm not the kind of movie-watcher, who draws attention to the cost of production, food for thought dialogue, or brilliant acting and directing. Nevertheless, I would argue that this film sucks. I do not know why I do not like it ... I mean, that almost everything I want from a horror film: the blood, shocking, unintended humor, etc. According to this evidence it has to be my favorite. Nevertheless, Zombi 3 is baaad film. <br /> <br /> There are just too many things that make you shout at the screen. For example, if a girl comes out of the Army Man, when their car breaks down, to find water (it does not spoil anything, so do not worry). It is part of what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Did she not see that there was a lake in the middle of the damn building ??? Yes, she is looking for water, and passes to the lake. Why? Because she wants to know why the people (who are not here because this place is abandoned) would not respond to her when she cries? "Does anyone have a" Oh, it's just a little, small part of the big picture I'm painting. <br /> <br /> There is a reason, though, why I made this film more than 1 star. This is one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is, and I have a few times, you'll want to watch it again, because it just is top in every aspect. I called him to death in the first paragraph, but this film does not have a single drop of blood, it is the ocean of gore. In addition, he has a rather strange creature in it as well: the zombie-child (with adult-sized hands ???) and magically flew head, to name just the two <br /> <br /> You know when you're trying. think of the worst and Cheesiest films ever made, and you have come up with '50s sci-fi movies? I believe that ZOMBI 3 and a movie, he has to make them. It has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government warning on the radio apocalypse, army, battling monsters, and so on. This plan 9 from the 80s! While I will not say it's a waste of money if you want to buy it, just wait for the worst. And if you learn that expecting the worst underestimates ZOMBI 3, it will not be all that bad. You might actually like, I'm not saying it's impossible. <br /> <br /> I do not think I hate this film, I did not ... really. Oh, P.S. The killing of birds (aka Zombies 5) of the rules! (Did I just blow my authority?)
