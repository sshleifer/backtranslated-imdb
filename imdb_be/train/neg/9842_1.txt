It seems that everything in this film is the direction of Woody Allen. They stutter and stammer and pause a bit. Only for die-hard fans really DeNero! He tries to look like a sharp and artistically - but it comes off as looks like a very, very low budget film made by students. The most frequently used word in the entire film, "buzz". The film peg atmosphere of the late sixties / early seventies, though. If you like movies where people are constantly talking over each other, terrible lighting (even if it is for "the sake of art"), and makes you feel like you are sitting in a lame political meeting, you might have it, - but you have to be very boring. I found this CD in dollars bunker, and now I know why.
