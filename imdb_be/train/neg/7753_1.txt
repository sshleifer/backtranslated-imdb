Everything about this movie hog wash. Pathetic action awful dialogue, ugly native girl. this film plunges into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director had a weekend bender. Robert C. completely lost and not got a clue about what's going on. College kids the worst. A lot of acting talent in general, very silly argument, and just down right dumbbell. Special effects for the birds. The so-called security forces belong to the toy land around the park: with blunt promising devices, portable radio, who are useless; and a computer system, which takes a roll of toilet paper. when the park is under construction, and nothing works; Why invite potential customers, until it's over. authors should be the first victims of the disorder together with the producers and crew. The entire film is shot belongs to a septic tank to another planet to see. Which is a gem. Convicts have to look at it, so that they can commit suicide.
