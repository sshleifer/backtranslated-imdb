The film does not have enough confidence with helicopters, which did not exist before 1950. But no woman will do what has been done here, even a woman to the women's movement '60s and' 70s. On a single part of the movie, you could believe that Germany would like to know where the landing will be. Do not pay attention to the moment when the British captured all spies, but even if they did not, they would not allow one to wander around, how simple it is to reassure Germans that the landing will be in Calais. This is not one main thing that makes the film does not work. It is the culmination of all things wrong, making the film a failure. Bad directing, bad scripts, not attempt authentication (in general) all combine to make the film simply fall flat. Generally speaking spies should disappear in the woodwork. The suspension comes with spyware wondering if the information they have, rightly or wrongly, and worry about being identified. At the same time that the game was over from the start. This spy does nothing but espionage. Your only chance to get something that has a certain credibility and instills some uncertainty may read a book.
