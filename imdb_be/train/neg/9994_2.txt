Hmmm, a sports team in a plane crash, gets stranded on a snowy mountain, and faced with a difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions to survive. Sound familiar to anyone? I mean «Alive» 1993 single significant difference here, of course, it is that a large, white, drunk frightened sheep Yeti shows up several times to pull the dead. I believe that people taste better than yaks <br /> <br /> Silly :. Person has not in the first stage of a reliable firearm while hunting for Bigfoot, it also has no backup <br /> <br />. crash completely fake. It would be either blown up in the air, exploded when it hit the ground, or become destroyed. People would not have survived, but hey, it's a sci-fi <br /> <br /> Silly :. They survived, and they are cold. This may be a good idea to use some of the burning debris around to stay warm. Fire to be as warm as it is ... <br /> <br /> WTF: Pilot frost formed on his face while he was alive and talking, but oddly enough, no one does <br /> <br /. > Dumb: One of the guys said to the others, to look for matches or lighters, but there are parts of the plane scattered on FIRE around <br /> <br /> Silly :. They find a coat and sweatshirt, and still is, in the cold of the Himalayas, they can not use their hoods <br /> <br /> Stupid :. they are looking at a bunch of fagots, I repeat, there is a part of the plane was burning <br /> <br /> Silly: The Himalayas are known for their storms. It would be common sense for them to collect the garbage in order to reinforce the structure, rather than sit outside bickering. There are many pine trees around whose branches make excellent insulation <br /> <br /> WTF: .. If in doubt, use a dead man's hand like a splint <br /> <br /> WTF: If a guy knows so much about the winter habits squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, why is it not enough to make the vault and set a trap from the beginning to know? <br /> <br /> Silly: If you try to catch wild animals, meaningless conversation in the immediate vicinity of this trap always helps <br /> <br /> WTF :. Do you know how difficult it would be to reduce the frozen corpse of a piece of glass? <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was armed and ready to fight the Yeti, and the other two were defenseless. Yeti ripped guy's heart and stomped the girl's head, and the gang did not do anything. There's love. <br /> <br /> Thus, two yetis and convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever .... or so we thought. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues in the more idiotic, but the action takes place in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Nice thinking dart and chain, although it is some ingenuity (with magic which is a chain) that they did not have at the beginning of the film, when they could not even make the fire, despite the fact that it was all around them . <, Br /> <br /> as is typical for the Sci-Fi Originals, loving couple kissing at the end as if nothing terrible had just happened to them (not to mention they were eating human flesh and not brushed their teeth for a few days ). <br /> <br /> at the end, however, inaccurate quote.
