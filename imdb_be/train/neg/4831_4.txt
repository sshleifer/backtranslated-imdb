I made this film on Netflix after all won the Oscar, to see if it was really that good. <br /> <br /> The Hurt Locker is very realistic portrayal of (mostly) the rotation group of soldiers in Iraq. The film centers around Will James, a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline from heavy risk-taking, as well as bomb disposal. <br /> <br /> Where is the film does not seem to have enough in my view, plot and direction of the film. This film does not have a clear plot, unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down. What this film is trying to do is to focus on the characters and their different attitudes about the war. Bigelow does a good job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag. Hurt Locker 131 minutes long, but it feels like ,, 3:00 movie. <br /> <br /> One scene in the film, which was particularly badly, and destroyed the films ideal authority, it was the sniper scene in the middle of the film. It was unreal, and very long. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought that this movie was good, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of 7, because it was a major disappointment for a Best Picture win at the Oscars. I felt that this film could be a lot better, given Saving Private Ryan lost his best film, but was much better than the movie. Another characteristic mention Black Hawk Down, which only won 2 Oscars. I honestly do not know how it won best picture. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action packed war movie, Black Hawk Down hire. This film will be forgotten in a year or two.
