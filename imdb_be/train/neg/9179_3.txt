This cheese. If all you want is a video game, complete with what appear as the expression of the sequence straight out of the computer to the action of the film was too cheap to actually do special effects, this is it. My friend and I really had a great time seeing him as the theater was almost empty and we could leave for a bit. This film really demands barking. <br /> <br /> The plot? Was the plot? Well, some stupid college or later types to get an invitation to a "rave of the year" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ( "If only they were back in Seattle, they would have survived." - a direct quote, or nearly so.) To be present. They get there and everyone is gone, and the site is a bit broken (but hey, the barrel still full!). With the cover of an old captain and the Coast Guard the woman (who were only a little less rigid - and a little less, and - what Cynthia), they fight a lot of zombies (some of which spits acid), to receive a scolding from the bizarre legends and basically die. That's about it <br /> <br /> It's not quite as bad as Demonicus, but not much, and even better than a severed (they are kind of my personal alpha and omega for bad movies -. Former bad but insist fun and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once). On the other hand, if you expect the video game film as beautiful as Resident Evil, run !!! run away now !!! <br /> <br /> Well, some real big questions (without too many spoilers): Since when Spanish ships of the enterprise of the 18th century in the Pacific Northwest ????? Why would someone with smuggling guns of the Pacific Northwest, and someone - Canada, call loudly for ??? Why rave unnamed (oops, sorry, this is called "Isla del MuertoÂ», shya, right) San Juan Island - and outdoors while still having in mind that this is the Pacific NORTHWET. And rave has about 30 people in attendance - "rave of the year," my patoot <br /> <br /> Lucky thing there are many axes around .. Many of them. Everyone has them. There must be a point of sale near Hatchet. <br /> <br /> And finally, while the film began to play with a small "a travesty" (from pushing in I know what you've done and jaw), he did not carry it through close enough <br /> <br /> Well, actually, finally, -. when the opening (in voiceover, no less) chance to mention that one of the characters "abandoned her boyfriend to focus on his fencing" you can be darn sure that there is a fence at the end of the film. Not a good fence, but a few people hacking alone with swords, anyway.
