I loved the "Anchorman;. The Legend of Ron Burgundy," and hoped that it would be so ridiculous, but, unfortunately, it was not some bits excellent, although I thought the sports guy, Champ Kind, professing his love for Ron Burgundy. in the car filled with other news team members was fun. everyone ignores it, and it just gets more and more, and finally kisses Burgundy, who does not get recognized by some. But in general, the story does not gel. it is a noble attempt, however, to save unused bits from the first film, including the whole plot of Neka oryya fairly benign potential domestic terrorists called "Alarm". Maya Rudolph on Saturday Night Live is one of the members, and has a few funny lines, but mostly unused storyline has reason to be unused in the first film. The extras on this disc is pretty good , with the best two being filmed rehearsals with much improvisation comedy, and fake comments with Will Ferrell and "executive producer", which Ferrell discovers at an early stage is not even part of the film in any way shape or odds mA. It turns out that he is "just a guy", which entered the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. This is some pretty funny stuff, though, and continued for 10 or 15 minutes
