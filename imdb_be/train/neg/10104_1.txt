I only watched the first 30 minutes of this, and what I saw was a total piece of shit. Scenes I saw were just as bad as the film Ed Wood. No, it was a hundred times worse. Ed Wood has a reputation as the worst director ever, but it is not; idiot who sent this rubbish is the worst director ever. <br /> <br /> American police officer has a German accent! "Police station" was a table in the warehouse with the inscription «Police Station» hangs on the wall. There is a fist fight where the blows obviously miss about ten feet. <br /> <br /> This cop pulls over a woman, cuff them and brings them to the warehouse. He said his partner to wait in a police car. Then he comes out of the warehouse, which carries the bag. Partner police believes that it is possible that something is wrong, that his partner can be a bad cop who killed these women, but he is not sure that this is something that, because there is - it is a moron! Dialogue is absolutely ridiculous, horrible acting, and the characters act stupid I've ever seen on the screen. It is quite obvious to partner police that he had been unlawfully abducted these women, and he slapped them and taking them to the store and back to the car with a bag with the body in it, and yet, a partner who has it all together, does not know what It happens! <br /> <br /> The director of this film is a complete hack. I stopped the movie is 30 minutes, because I can not anymore. He must be one of the worst films I have ever started watching, and I will not spend more time on it to write this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing.
