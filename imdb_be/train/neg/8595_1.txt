Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both wonderful actors who can certainly cause any acting challenge put to them <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Looking Detectives (2007)" offers only one for both actors and spectators, .: not sleep during the mind-numbingly boring, very predictable and prosaic story. <br /> <br /> «Watching the Detective (2007)" is trying very hard to be funny, but the comedy forced, poorly directed and shame the verge of complete derision. <br /> <br /> After the third part of the film is still nothing that can even capture the most willing audience, as friends and relatives of the director, even a hint, let alone actually happening. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that all those who loved him fake it was fake, as the former girlfriend of the Nile did when he showed her the old B & W film, she could not care less about. "Watching the Detectives (2007)" is not a category B is somewhere between the Q & R, as the -Questions? and -Repress questions! The director knows what he's doing! Well, if his goal was to bore the audience to death, he did a very good job! <br /> <br /> «Looking Detective (2007)" was a waste of time for him, and Lucy Alexis Cillian Murphy, drill, please do not be a waste of time <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 0 100.
