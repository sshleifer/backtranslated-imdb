Last night I decided to see a prequel or should I say the so-called prequel to Carlito Way - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)", which went straight to DVD ... no wonder ..... it completely .. .and I mean completely S% & KS !!! waist of time watching it, and I think it will be purely a waist of time to write about it .... I do not understand how De Palma agreed to the production of this sh # t-festival of the movie .... just short of one fact I take my hat ... Jay Hernandez, who plays a young Brigante .... reminded me, as De Niro was in Brando boots to reflect the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but the difference is De Niro was amazing, and even He won an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez well he guts for trying to be a young Pacino .... too bad for him, I do not think he will play in the film more and, by the way, after I watched this sh # $% TY film, I sat down and watched an original way Carlitos, to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
