Given its popularity, I found this film a huge disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much from this film. In the end, this is one of the most famous martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could never understand why. History uninteresting. It is also very Talky film sequences sporadic actions. My biggest problem with the film is that the story does not give the character that I could cheer for, as the alleged hero idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and he is unable to hide the glaring shortcomings identified in the narrative. I know that this should not be high art, but I found the film boring. Definitely not the best example of this so beloved genre. His cult status escapes me. I recommend you to skip it.
