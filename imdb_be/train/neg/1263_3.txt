There's nothing like watching giant robots do battle over a desolate wasteland, and Robot Wars really deliver. Of course, the current lousy, subpar dialogue and characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! Special effects themselves are actually very good for this period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains a minimum of computer graphics, but instead uses a miniature, so she aged pretty well. Its shortcomings easy to overlook the film short lead time, and he has a certain sarcastic humor in parts, which make it very pleasant. I would recommend it to any fan of giant robots or cheese fiction who seek a carefree hour distraction.
