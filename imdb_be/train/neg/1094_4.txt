It's hard to describe this one - if you're a fan of Russ Meyer movies back in the day, you will certainly be pleased to see that Haji is still looking very hot, although Forry Ackerman had no luck so good (what he is still doing that making these films anyway? When I come to him with a camera, whether it be in my movie?). It was pretty fun premise - a superhero whose gigantic mammaries are its secret weapon - but sometimes it's not burned out along the entire length, and the jokes were on par with your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or, Abbott and Costello, if your business) - basically just a bad pun. However, I found the film interesting to watch, and more than 2 reasons. Good job, but still fundamentally contrived production.
