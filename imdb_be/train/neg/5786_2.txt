When you look at it now and hear all the language here, it's weird, it was rated «PG», but it's 1970 ranking system for you. Peter Falk spewing the Lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this film! However, some people find that offensive, and, of course, not thugs who make movies, not people who "bet" their <br /> <br /> throw the key to the film as the hypocrites can be: . Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gene Rowlands and Paul Sorvino not really actors, you would not find in «The Sound Of Music». <br /> <br /> I like Heist movies and many movies directed by William Friedkin, but the script does not deliver, and it just has too many of the "70 sleazy" feel to it, visually and aurally. For those who Falk enjoys the television series «Columbo» he must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in the movie. This is not the only case.
