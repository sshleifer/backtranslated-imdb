Mad scientist girlfriend decapitated, so he brings her head back to life. Honestly this is the plot of the film. He tried to get her into another body, he is looking for in the area of ​​the city next to nothing for that perfect body. For some reason, it looks ugly monster in the closet in his cabin. The style of the film is ridiculously cheap. Nobody in the film could not really act, including the head. Closet Monster man with a mask tie, and you can say for sure. The plot is slow, weak, and the ending is so badly done. See Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this movement. Believe me people, I would not watch this movie alone.
