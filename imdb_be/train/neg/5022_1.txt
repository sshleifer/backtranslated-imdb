Oh, this movie was bad for different reasons. I expected to see a very low figure for this film and was a bit surprised too all score.Sorry, but appreciate it highly, as many of them, this is a joke! Once you get past the one-shot / black-and-white film stunt, which was a good idea, the film stretches, even during the whole 66 minutes. The sequence of credits in the beginning was so annoying too! In the van guys suffer later and modify the terms of, wow, that was necessary in history! How slow was chasing guys and actually manage to injure Campbell ?? They did not seem to bother to continue to pursue it ... I'm too happy to sigh..I, I got it for free special edition of Evil Dead !!
