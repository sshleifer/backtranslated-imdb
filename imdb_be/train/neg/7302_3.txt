The first five minutes of the film showed potential. After that he went straight from something, perhaps an honest to some illegal comedy. The best part is that I could not stop thinking about Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for the mere fact of learning how to do the film. There are so many scenes in this film that makes one just stop and wonder where all the cast and crew just stopped caring at some point. The fact is that most strikes me about this film is that it has collected $ 22 million at the box office, and only cost about $ 1.5 million to make. Congratulations to the gate of Leo for what to draw in a state that a single.
