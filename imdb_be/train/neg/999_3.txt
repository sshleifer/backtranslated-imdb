I saw last night, "Descent" at the film festival in Stockholm movie and it was a huge disappointment. Disappointment, because the plot was a potentially powerful perspective to see Rosario Dawson in a small intimate movie was exciting, and being a fan (sounds a pervert, I'm not!) With "rape / revenge 'clicks' 70s, I was too say, very interesting check out this film with. My conclusion: let's stick to the classics! Yes, the plot has potential, but the dialogues are flat, unconvincing actors. Even empty Dawson. Someone might say that this is the right image of the world of college in the United States that serve to void the characters and all that jazz, but it just makes the whole film is negligible. Just as the scene where Dawson gets raped: it is seriously lacking in intensity! I did not expect anything «Irreversible 'style, but still, we do not expect to feel compassion for her? I did not. Nya for a moment, she was so lame all the way ;-) And I read that the picture was impressive. Well, it's good actually, but nothing groundbreaking anything. I must admit that screening at the festival was not so good, so maybe I missed something here, but at the end of the film, I could not help thinking: "I feel like Argento look" again Inferno ". lol. More seriously, the first scene in the club beautifully filmed and everything, but I had a bitter feeling to look longer and more sad version of the scene in a dirty bar near the US-Canadian border in Lynch's "Twin Peaks - Fire Walk With Me» .. . the raw red and blue light, heavy bass music, the total lustful / decadent atmosphere ... no, I just could not get into this film. Too bad.
