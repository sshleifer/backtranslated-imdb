This may well be the worst movie I have ever seen. Despite the fact that the claims Mikshelt, this film is not even close to the historically accurate. It starts badly, and then it all got worse. We have Hitler's father cursing his misfortune on the "fact" that he married his niece! They were actually second cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called his father, Alois, "uncle" because Alois was adopted and raised by his grandfather Clara and raised as his son, when he was actually his nephew. Alois was considerably older than Clara and, as a child she got into the habit challenge Alois "uncle." <br /> <br /> The scenes in the trenches, where Hitler mocked his colleagues and decided to take him up on his dog a disgrace and an insult to the intellect of the audience. We see Hitler to drive a dog through a trench when he catches the poor man, he passes on to thrash him for disobeying him. In the distance we see and hear of his fellow soldiers continue to mock and punish cowardly little man, but then the shell land directly on his pursuers, and every last one, we are told, killed on the spot. How, then, if Hitler was the only person to survive the scene, did the story of cruelty and cowardice come to tell? Hitler himself go "bragging" about it? - I do not think so <br /> <br /> Next, Hitler bullies and intimidates the poor, underline, and the war weary Jewish officer in giving him the Iron Cross.! I can only assume that this officer was Jewish moneylender to fight for their country, and he thoughtfully brought along a few of the promised medals from his shop, because I am sure that the iron crosses were not handed out, how to get into the comic farce. <br /> <br /> All grotesque clich√©s here, not least the calming and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on the little man. If only the producers kept Ian Kershaw on the side. Then they might have discovered that Franz Lehar's "The Merry Widow" is more likely to float the boat of the Fuhrer than any "Flying Dutchman" by Richard Wagner from the gun! <br /> <br /> Hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people, but how can he ever be forgiven for his terrible taste in music? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I would be on it for a few hours. <br /> <br /> give it a miss.
