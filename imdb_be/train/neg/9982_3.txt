The story begins slowly and not anything funny going on for some time. All actions in the end, but you do not have to laugh, because the movie is funny, but because the story is a pity. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous when Harvey "I do not paranoia" Keitel really loses and the referee begins to slaughter. Oscars for this guy!
