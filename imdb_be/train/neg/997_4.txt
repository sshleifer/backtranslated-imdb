Just recently again seen "Lipstick" for the first time in decades, I supported his "Descent", although I have heard more negative comments than good friends from other film with flavors as varied as mine. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to contrast as a unique niche Rape Revenge Film has developed over the last 32 years, from full-on gore "I Spit on Your Grave" in tasteless sensationalism "Lipstick" in exquisite handling of the question in the "accused" . But the "Descent", while making some important points, never gives us anything really new in terms of revelatory sense. No, "The Descent" so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that restrict any significant message that he could hope to do --- reports that on closer examination, it is not that innovative. <br /> <br /> I pretty much knew the story takes place. What I would like to see * was * in the "descent" or a set of character Dawson. Being a big fan of Rosario, I really wanted to see the layers are discarded and its psyche be slowly twisted ... you know, kind of figure DeNiro brings to the "taxi driver". Unfortunately, the script and the choice of director / writer does not give any credible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is a second act. It became obvious that the intentions were directed to this segment, a jump of the club, drug, and possession of a large black stallion Adrian (nightmare every white boy, of course) from the Q & A on the DVD, but this tour is in the nature of Dawson never plausibly extended . We do not know what the hell she was doing half the time than it is after and why it does it. Low quality audio / video again does not help, but the sequence is too damn long and pointless. It destroys any momentum and investment in leading character sets during the otherwise very well done the first act. By the time we get to the finals, our interest has waned. <br /> <br /> One success point that Dawson does point in the Q and A, which until the end of "revenge" scenes we pumped reckoning understands how to stretch and ugly reality. While this is certainly true, it does not make the scene more intriguing. <br /> <br /> If you have a DVD, check remote "class" scene. This excellent 8 minutes plus Outtake, that crackles with energy and provocation (though verbal) and shows you exactly slow crack to Dawson materialization as she admiringly vivisects prissy, indulgent dorm adviser poor Francie Swift. When more intelligent scene was added, as it is more than the average third of the cut down, we could have an interesting psychological study of the influence of senseless acts of violence. <br /> <br /> As the film stands in the final version, though, we all get what we've seen before, but in a more graphical visualization. So what?
