Warning: Spoilers Galore <br /> <br /> Tim Burton is remaking it in its own way a movie is about as reasonable as remaking Psycho - oh, so, some idiot has done this - I rest my case <br /> <br !. /> The film begins with chimpnaut erroneous simulation, proving that he is not that smart to begin with. Marky Mark appears in the frame without its characteristic panties showing, then dropped a simple woman who prefers to touch a chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> formal plan address space station in orbit around Saturn for no apparent reason, the interior of the ship a-bustle with genetic experiments on monkeys. Should we travel 1.3 billion kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it <br /> <br /> Chimpanzees Marky dives lost in this staple 60 sci-fi movie -. Time warp. Marky then demonstrates the staggering absurdity Security Space Station stealing pod nobody noticed, while at the same time demonstrating their extreme stupidity in deep space to mount a rescue mission in a worm hole to test a single chimpanzee, with millions of dollars in vehicles with limited fuel and oxygen supply. <br /> <br /> Before anyone could say `meaningless RemakeÂ» Marky has moved into the wormhole, he crashed on an alien planet, took off his helmet, without any thoughts of mortality atmosphere and being chased through the soundstage is almost reminiscent of a lush tropical forest, if it were not in kliegs illuminated plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! It APES makes coinage - or, at least, he was a * b * surprise when no one has seen Planet of the Apes thirty-three years ago <br /> <br /> Since Marky Mark did not get to show off their chest. , Take off his pants, or the bust of his lame rap Whiteboy he characterless. gorilla teeth Michael Clarke Duncan is inserted crooked helped greatly in creating a * his * spinelessness. Bonham Carter (aka annoying chimpanzee activist), without loss in Shakespeare's script has done an excellent job frets like Marky and Clark, as most cardboard expression. Paul Giamatti, orangutan slave, provided the comic role of markers and interspecies complainant. Although I grew up hearing the gall puns related to this film, one review headline captures the essence of the Planet of the Apes 'rethinking': `Monkeys Company. While the rest of the chopped searching as extras from a million years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth as Chimpanzee THADE, chews scenery and a huge number of throws cocoa splendiferously. As entertaining as it is an image of a psychotic THADE was, his character did not grab behavioral arcs: THADE angry when we first met him ... and he's pretty much on the same level with the mind at the end of the film. . Good turn <br /> <br /> original Pot (1968) has shown, the leading character, Taylor Charlton Heston, which he so disappointed with humanity, that he left the earth in space with no regrets - even as the movie progressed, Taylor unwittingly trapped in a battle to prove the value of humanity - as a unified champion! The original film was ultimately a story of humiliation, not salvation if Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his views were not resisted. Is there anything that the cerebral or ironic Leo Marky Mark? THADE or Roth? No, but there is a lot of work <br /> <br /> The slogans cry :. .But it take Planet Planet of the Apes. In this film, humans and primates emergency landing here with people being degenerated into cavepeople, allowing primates acquire speech and sensual body armor; Monkey deserve to inherit the planet! Along comes Marky Mark, in the true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that people have to be apex predators, simply because they are there. `Taking it back" just ridiculous, like a monkey landing here in 2001, complaining, `planet where humans are descended from apes ?? !! and then causes problems with their replays and hairy ass <br /> <br /> Heston was cast in 1968 Pot because he established his reputation as a freethinker :. it was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses to toss him like a mute, who chased the animal in a strange society was to stun the audience's expectations, in: how crazy world to be where our man Charlton can not command respect? Marky Mark is currently the only set What he has close cowards. <br /> <br /> Although Heston was constantly blame the monkey board, he dominated the screen with his charisma and huge replay. If Marky Mark is trying to instill zeal in mongoloid people, it's like an unpopular guy in school suddenly made in the class monitor that tells you to stop drawing penises on the board, and you throw a shoe at him. the Burton tries to pick Marky icon humanity, but it comes off as Chittering deviant. In the original film, the monkey is considered deviant Taylor, but he was, the audience and the great apes, so that the icon of humanity. . This is the paradox again <br /> <br /> He was inclined that the man who erected a stage for acting chewing technique - Heston - should play a father prima scene-chewing this film, Thaddeus Roth. Once the monkey dad company, Charlton says his own immortal line, rebelled against the people at this time, `Damn them! Damn them all to hell! "<br /> <br /> The film becomes blunt and Dumber to the end. While giving Marky Thaddeus ass-beat lesson pod descends from the height chimpnaut Marky it. Apes are demonstrating their stupidity bowing in respect to this ignorant creatures, while Marky proves his stupidity on muttering, `Let us teach the monkey on evolution. Firstly, they are not monkeys, you ape! Secondly, it was a genetic tampering and imbecilic story fabrications that led monkeys at this moment, not evolution. What are you going to teach them, blast them away with a secret lasergun called misanthropy, not evolution. <br /> <br /> Giving a twist ending will only confuse the audience, assuming that half Nekkid role Estella Warren was actually an integral part of the story (be still my pants.) <br /> <br /> Regardless of the fact that he was the last hope of mankind underpanted. in the end, the police primates take away Marky Plot prison terms, where he was last heard ululating, `This is a madhouse! Madhouse !! ...
