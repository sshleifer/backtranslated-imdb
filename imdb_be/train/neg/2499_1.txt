The cast of this film contain some of the best of New Zealand actors, many of whom I had seen in the fabulous cast, this film, but fills me with a deep shame just be the same country as they are. Fake American accents are the first sign that things are going to go spectacularly wrong. Another review said quite astutely luxury cruise ship on a really old car ferry, decorated with a few of the several colored flags stolen from a used car lot. Most of the actors seem to be of the (large) long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It's as if the film was coined on Shortland Street Christmas party cast, the result of too much Gina, and perhaps a little salmonella. Imagine, «Under Siege» meets «The Love Boat», directed by your local primary school and autistic film director and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you're an actor, I recommend you see this movie, as a study of how to kill a nurse.
