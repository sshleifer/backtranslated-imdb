The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad scenario is beyond me. It really has to be one of the worst films, in addition to the "Haunted Highway" I have ever seen. BAD actors, and a very bad story. There's no normal reaction to any event in this film, even if it's Halloween, normal people will have a reaction when they witnessed their parents being killed, not to mention gutted people with tape covering their airways without being able to breathe (in a room with at least 50 people, I might add) and some people dressed as Satan dragging death of his home, even 8-year-old to see the difference between a doll and a human. Not to mention the fact that one can not be so naive and stupid to believe the reality of Satan and Jesus' appearances on the same day as this guy does. When I was 8, I am sure, had more brains than that. <br /> <br /> But, really stupid thing that everyone else seems to be falling on the silent Satan double as well, no questions asked. The question throughout the film whether it is really Satan, or this is some crazy person killing people whenever he feels like it? Well, he has a human hand, hand, built and all, so I think he should be in the film as well, otherwise they did a lousy job, which hides it. Then, this man is a man, and all that he was able to kill an old woman, a man and his mistress, 5 (!! ???) cops (all with weapons and training, I believe), and several others. .... and obviously all just stood there, waiting for him, or what? <br /> <br /> not the whole concept and a way to tell the story is absolutely the worst I've ever seen, and I would not recommend anyone to spend 1 hour and 30 minutes of your life to see this shit.
