I really can not believe that this film is not the worst in the IMDB 250, it's awful. When I initially saw it, I remember talking about it in a college classroom and two other people also saw it. We were all telling the other members of the class, not to see it, because it was so awful. By the time we wanted to see some of the other it was made only because they could not believe that something was as bad as we were told that it was. Do not be like them, just pass it by. I am sure that all members of this film also prefer you would have never seen them in the film.
