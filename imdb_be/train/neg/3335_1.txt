This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of the lot, and is positive proof that the five-minute bike Sun feature film making. Poor Sid Caesar as a vain emperor, it is made to look so foolish that it's hard to watch him. How cleverly tailor, Robert Morse has not an ounce of charm. Nor does his hapless nephew (Jason Carter) "Song" terrible and only slow that down on the area. The direction is practically absent, and the supporting characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is quite like a daughter of the Emperor, but her voice was clearly duplicated for some reason, the fate shared by many of the secondary players. And the film is crawling at a snails pace. Hans Christian Andersen was turning somersaults in his grave, if it appears. You can honestly say, at least, with the film fairy tale, it is not surprising that he went straight to the video Summer.
