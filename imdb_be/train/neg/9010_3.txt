If you want to have every member of the dragon actor, you know that for a bad ride. <br /> <br /> I came up with a very, very low expectations after reading some of the other comments, and not later. Unlike some other cheap and unsuccessful films, but this one really is not funny (unintentionally) funny throughout. <br /> <br /> -SPOILERS following <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is very contradictory. Looking past the "minor" errors, such as a dragon, who grew up in 3 hours, the whole idea is based on the messed up. See the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites, which were actually dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show some peasant poking at one of its forks and dragon pops up. Later, a mandatory "mad scientist" fellow chatters on about how dragons survived the dinosaurs. So, obviously, the people were around when dinosaurs were, or are we just a great little plot hole here. Another important thing is that the lab exploded with the force of "twice as strong" as that which was used to Hiroshima. Then two guys go later to check everything out, and it's almost a whole! There's even another dragon, which grew out of who knows what. In general, it is very predictable. As soon as the man mentioned cloning, I assumed that they would clone a dragon. This means that our Mr. Smarty-pants security guy is not so intuitive and clever, as the movie would have you believe, if you ignore that I knew this film would be about, you know, the dragon. <br /> <br /> Assuming that aside, the second worst, there is a "special effects". Others mentioned fake stones that fall during the beginning of the helicopter CG and the dragon. It looks a little better than a drop, but he destroyed everything he had going for him as he trudged down the hall at the same time the method after time. To their credit, flying dragons in the beginning looked good from afar (though alone in a cave, probably the worst in the entire film.) These things are funny to watch though. Scene, wherein said a million different images of the same persons face different methods are not. And while the "Introduction" screen with vital statistics. <br /> <br /> Coming to the actors, they are not the greatest, but I think at least they tried? They seemed to be very enthusiastic, what they do, than many of the actors involved in the recent "BloodRayne", for example, and you have to give them points for that. One thing I noticed though that a woman who Meredith plays often had her face covered with makeup that had a lot of shades lighter than the rest of her. she looked like she had a bad fight with some white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and cheesy. you do not notice the music but in fact it is not so bad, for the most part. <br /> <br /> the point is not to watch it, if you do not want tse see it, because you hear is bad (like I did), although only the interesting things the bad effects of the CG. Also, do not waste your time and money.
