How the hell did they get it? Positioning itself as a comedy caper, the infamous "$", in fact a couple of hours people muttering fragments of sentences. Usually reliable Warren Beatty looks drunk, and usually cheerful Goldie Hawn acts like she is soothing. As for Gert Fröbe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - infinitely more remarkable than his character here. Not even a guy with a bottle of champagne LSD can save this litany futility. <br /> <br /> Can I comparing this film "Plan 9 from Outer Space"? I would not do such a thing, even if someone paid me. «P9FOS» was stupidly done, but ultimately hilarious; it was made an idiot and makes you feel like your brain is just hot from the ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn to compensate for this, when they together starred in "Shampoo", but then they were shot together in a terrible "City & Country». Maybe they're just not one of the main roles in the film. In general, I'd rather cut off my skin than have to look at it again. Awful. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should remake it with Jackie Chan. Then I would have paid to see it.
