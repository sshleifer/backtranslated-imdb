After reading the comments on the website, I feel compelled to write for the first time. It seems that this film, like Marmite and share the audience. I must say that while I agree movies do not make sense to be enjoyable (see Mulholland Drive), they still have to engage you with the characters. Now, when I was completely absorbed in a murderous lesbian affair opus Lynch, I have to say that I could not give the excrement of Mr. Green or other cardboard gangsters who inhabited this dayglo world. <br /> <br /> In addition, while many people seem to try and say that you did not use, because you did not get it, I would have to disagree - I did not like because I was bored . I wanted the film to the end and constantly listen to these quotes again and again to no avail. Call it a reasonable, if you will. - I think it repeats <br /> <br /> However, my main reason for writing to ask all the other reviewer matter - were not the end of the credits for the printing of the film I've seen, just music to black. And I look hopeless seal or certificate of pretentiousness in GR? Or everyone involved in the film to look rough and removed their name ???
