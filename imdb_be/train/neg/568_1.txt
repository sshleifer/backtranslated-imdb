It "debuted" today at the SciFi Channel, and all I can say, "I am speechless" I taped today, so I could watch it tonight after work. I had high expectations, and now I'm breaking the wardrobes, looking at the length of the rope so I could hang myself. Possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I would like to say something good, like, "It was fun to make fun of this movie", but this film does not give me anything to work with. I know that you shall not post spoilers here with a prior warning, but I will in any case, "This movie sucks" There, I said it! They need to show this film to remove a student to show them what not to do! My nine year old niece could do a better film. The only decent thing about this film, sound and / or audio track. OH! I just found a rusty C-clamp on my old tool box. I'm going to put it on the thumb of his left hand and tighten it until the pain does not erase the memory of what my eyes have seen. I just could not tape over it VHS, but I think it will be lit on fire him instead. I could wash with soap and water, but I'm afraid that will never be clean. Christmas is coming. Buy this film and give it to the people you hate. -Mike
