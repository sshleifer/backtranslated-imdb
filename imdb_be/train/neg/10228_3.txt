Honestly, I've heard that it's very bad, before I decided to look at, but I have never one to let others influence my views, I actually likely to see anything out of spite!. Bullwhip has one thing going for me to view, in any case, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes was there I was immediately interested. The picture is not very good, and it's actually very morally questionable, all the characters are corrupt and run in one direction or another, all the motive of greed and egocentric victory, it's all good, when the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of disgusting people and create a tight menopause intermittently picture. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can not scream that you were tricked into viewing a pretty bad movie, no one in the cast did not come from a loan from the leading man Guy Madison painfully wooden in the extreme . <br /> <br /> not a great Rhonda can make me recommend to anyone, 3/10
