If you liked the first two films, I'm sorry to say that you are not going to like it. It really is garbage and waste on the video, probably, TV has continued. Even stupid, but good scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family, and he has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of the statue, Wayne is so stupid, he squeezes his statue of himself with his brother. Then he squeezes his wife and daughter too. Now, adults must find a way to get the baby out of the house to get more of them. Quite a lot of repetition of the other two with only one or two new things, such as a toy car bitter, bathing in swimming, etc. Pretty poor!
