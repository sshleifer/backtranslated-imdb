Most of the films I can sit easily, even if I do not particularly love the movie. I am a person who recognizes the great movies, even if I do not like the genre. This is the first film that I could not bear to watch. Cat in the Hat worst film I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. It works well (Myers well as a cat, it's just that it's really annoying). Pet cat silly songs were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot stretches further and the audience have to suffer due to poor communication. The "clever" parental observations disgusting, not funny (I remember what a terrible commentary on the garden cultivator to compare, well, the type of people the person referred to as "x"). Despite the fact that the film is very short, it seemed, forever. Do not waste your time. I know that young children who hated this movie. If children can not stand it, I do not know how any adult can. I would like to throw more about this film, but I did not feel like spending more time writing the review about it. I hated! So, in general, do not waste 90 minutes of your life watching this! See a good movie <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest review I have ever given film.
