Just I watched it after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here will not be far to realize how awful this movie is actually, although it has to be one of the funniest things I've ever seen! I never bother to leave a comment here before, but this piece of shit really deserves it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the whole story is ridiculous and pointless. Brother of the protagonist (or Ben or Arthur, I forgot that there is, and, frankly, never very clear) wants to stop the kind of same-sex marriages, killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is an abomination to the Christians, but apparently , ISN mass murder "t. Then there's some other shit thrown in one of the former wife of a gay couple trying to get him to remarry her at gunpoint. This leads to nothing, but gives us one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the "movie" of all - "? I does not make sense does not make sense is who makes sense. " Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Then there's the action that simply brutal. You must see to believe. My personal favorite, apparently struck by the lawyer of the civil rights of women, which clearly read her lines from something, but still manage to stain them. Enough said. Gay-p can not be less convincing. There's also vaguely attractive and completely stupid guy and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon man test Bisto advertising. Only fatter. And the less talented. <br /> <br /> Â«Film" was also filmed by someone who is not able to hold the camera remotely and even the number of errors during the strange. The whole thing kicks off with the fat guy in the main bed with a pair of boots on. Yes. <br /> <br /> But in any case, we all know how scary this thing, so I would like to draw attention to some of the most precious moments of comedy that "film" provides. <br /> <br /> - When the fat man set the church on fire, and then reared as a six-year-old girl across the parking lot to make his escape. . Merry <br /> <br /> - Mildread! I do not know what relation she is the main character - sometimes they know it, sometimes not, but it pops up in a couple of scenes, however. . Merry <br /> <br /> - The beat lawyer. Already mentioned it, but it's so funny that it's worth another mention <br /> <br /> - .. Evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lies on for their guests <br /> <br /> - anti-evil brother gay medicine <br /> <br /> -. cats evil brother <br /> <br /> -. ending, which I will not give up, because it must be seen to be believed. I warn you, though, make sure that you do not eat at the time !!!! Tub of lard protagonist / director / producer is exposed. It is a foul. <br /> <br /> In fact, Ben and Arthur indescribably bad, but unintentionally comical thing that you'll see in a long time. Literally, nothing good about it for about a film director with a thug even manages to make the opening credits as a joke by writing your own name about 15 times.
