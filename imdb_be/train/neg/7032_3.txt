If Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins to look into his brother's death, she begins to suspect that something more sinister than "natural causes." The closer it gets to the truth, the more it becomes a threat to her daughter, Fiona (Helga line), and the rest of the local Satanists. They will do whatever is necessary to put an end to its curious ways. <br /> <br /> If you are sloppy, satanic-themed movies, black candles has a lot to offer. The film is filled with lots of nudity and soft core sex ritual. One scene in particular, with the participation of young women and goats must be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, all the sleaze in the world can not save black candles. Much of the film is a common hole. Except for one scene I mentioned above, not many shocking scenes of sex and, of course, not sexy. Acting spotty at best. Even genre favorite Helga line gives disappointing results. The plot does not really matter. Its main function seems to be to keep the string of stupid sex scenes together. I am familiar with only one other film directed by José Ramón Larraz. Compared with his Daughters of Darkness, which artfully mixes eroticism and horror, the black candle off as amateurish. 3/10 about the best I can do.
