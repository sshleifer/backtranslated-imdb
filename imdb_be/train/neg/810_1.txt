If you are one of those who find "According to Jim" great TV comedy, it will rock your world. And I might add, kudos to prove that good talent, good writing and charismatic star is all you really need any other network ABC, which prefers the air shit like Jim Belushi show year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a big, steaming, brown, size German Shepherd "thank you" for all geniuses, who like the first film. This is exactly what the proponents of this film and smaller Belushi deserve. comic chops and a selection of projects in Jim never far behind its ability Butcher blues standard. Look at him, to try to show all his diverse talent is not enough in each project, which he throws to the public as surly chimp zoo. <br /> <br /> If you like the work of Jim, this movie is your reward.
