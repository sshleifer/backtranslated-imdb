The fact that this film made it all the way to Norway in rentalrack amazing. This film is simply awful. This image quality is just one small little better than you get a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad. The main character is just annoying, and the rest just suck. Every person associated with this film should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this film put his name to this extraordinary. And distributors; they even see it? This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. In order to designate a comedy insult to humanity. I urge you not to support this movie, buy or rent it.
