I'm not sure that Diana Silver thinks she is doing this movie, but it obviously has nothing to do with the novel by Richard Wright, a film is based. <br /> <br /> We have read the novel last summer for AP English 12, and just watched the movie. When the note-taking and periodic inspection hours, I contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning. Of course, the sky was perfectly clear, and I had to watch the rest of the film ... and then write a 5 paragraph essay on it. <br /> <br /> Roman Wright discussed the very real threads to the mind killer and psychology behind it. Silver film turned killer as a sacrifice, which is not something that Wright wanted (see "How Bigger born" 454). <br /> <br /> I'm going to make this short and sweet: if you want to leave your consciousness, according to Raphael Lambert, clean, skip the movie and read the book. 1986 adaptation entirely thought-provoking material. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: Now I have to write an essay.
