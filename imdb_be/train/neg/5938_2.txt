if you do not live in the 90s or not to listen to the rapper FOREVER !! this movie can be good for you, but not for any fan or any one person who has ever listened to rap this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where I said, it will be interesting, or I do not know that. Another thing that bugged me was done it looked like anything in his life, he made a very easy, there was no struggle, he did look like a light jail, selling drugs, and even rapping was not realistic. I think if a movie which is released in about 15 years, now he can have more of an impact can be !!! good rap movies hustle and flow, to get rich or die trying not infamous
