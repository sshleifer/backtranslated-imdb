Released on DVD in the UK, as the Ax, suction teen slasher that does not pretty much every department: the history of almost non-existent, resulting in a film that includes mostly of people wandering around the dark building; with the exception of the two characters (which is quite obvious, destined to be a survivor of the film), all thoroughly undesirable, and this means that the audience could not care less if they are slaughtered; death is not enough bloody (if short shot pound of ground beef, covered in fake blood does not make your stomach); and gratuitous sex scenes features next to no nudity (an unforgivable mistake to make in the chopper with a wave!). <br /> <br /> The finest story to see the members of the punk band closed within what appears to be the world's largest nightclub (there are endless deserted corridors and rooms I have ever seen, unlike any club), where they were filming an invisible assailant. To reinforce the low budget production values ​​in order, and the actors all seem quite capable actors, but not enough of these scares, unwillingness to get really dirty (this slasher, so where is the graphical splash?) Too many terrible dialogue (in specifically, a non-dead, soon enough drummer), and some bad recommended to use sticky video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the film quickly becomes very boring.
