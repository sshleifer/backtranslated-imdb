As an advocate of movies like «Fire Sale", "Where's Dad", "Airplane" I saw it, because he was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedy and satire, as the aforementioned. Well, wrong conclusions! <br /> <br /> Not only is it not funny, it makes you angry, because it is not bad in schlocky, nice way, but in a very bad condition. This is bad-bad. The script does not contain a single funny line, which is more in the way when you're trying to entertain his audience with humor. <br /> <br /> speech impediment Adam Arkin is probably the most annoying thing in this film. Nevertheless, the cruelty of nature prevents it from being complacent throughout the film, and it is difficult not to look at the camera. This is an amateur without charisma fits perfectly in with the permanent continuity errors and awkward stories - if you can find one <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon. - I had to think about Jay Leno's too late talk show night person, who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen a few films Lena and he Laurence Olivier in comparison with McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good, however. In a few lines, which he gave. I'm not just scared of bad comedies, so I kept watching, and look for all the quasi-jokes every 5 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> The movie really becomes a kind of comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over - he literally does: First 75 minutes of the film, he is in every scene. But it's too little, too late. <br /> <br /> If the movie trying to get you to believe their lack of professionalism is the reason you have to love them because they have the right intentions, they remind me of the fact that students are not prepared for the exam. In these cases, you should be strict and class must be «F». (But please do not think I'm a teacher. This is a profession of respectable somewhere between a politician and child molesters). <br /> <br /> If you are actually looking pretty schlocky horror / SciFi movie, which is fun to watch and contain no joke trying to "The Man with the screaming brain" Bruce Campbell. Or playing Sunshine / Core, if you prefer modern loud SciFi small hack. It is equally ridiculous, albeit unwittingly.
