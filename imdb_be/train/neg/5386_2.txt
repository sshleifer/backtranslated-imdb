at the same time one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me sage understanding, I know very little about what was first there ... and that end up on the screen. I remember the original cut of "incoming freshman" and was very pleased. it was funny, sexy, raunchy, all the basic requirements of the film passing through. You have to remember this was filmed and released before everything else ... the animal home, greasy, etc ... so that in its own way, this film was really ahead of its time. for whatever reasons, the film was given the major distributors who edit out half of the original film and then edited in the (should I say "mixed?"), the most random scenes ever. fat, people with goat heads .... what the hell all this? I'm sure it was put for an additional T & A, but it was so slow, it caused something happening in front of him to grind to a painful yelp and stop. but overall, it's a fun memory for me ... especially that I can say that the worst movie I have ever seen ... I'm in!
