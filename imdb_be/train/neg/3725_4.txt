This is an interesting treatment of a subject which is very controversial (just read the other comments on this film). Apparently, you either love it or hate it, and it seems that most people make the difference on the basis they believe the Tribulation, and the end time will be as portrayed in the film <br /> <br /> In fact, the film - . And its sequels - were made about $ 1.30 each. Production values ​​are right up there with "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and operating at approximately the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (my apologies to Ed Wood). Leaving aside the religious message, the story as scary as they come . Add in even the slightest thought that the story can be really close to something that might happen in the future, and it gets even worse. <br /> <br /> this film and its sequels, Sun tried bring into the reasons why there was a misfortune when it happened. «Left Behind» and «Omega code" was trying to get around, "Thief" did and explain all policies and maneuvers in the Middle East, which led to it. The net effect was a "thief" has done a much better job of scary parts of the movie, not on yourself too thin, trying to explain what's going on . Middle East, at the same time <br /> <br /> Forget about the politics and watch this movie, and its sequels, for what they are -. the horror stories that they can tell horror stories, indirectly, God makes them just that much worse. If it makes you think about the subject, he did his job - even if you never believe.
