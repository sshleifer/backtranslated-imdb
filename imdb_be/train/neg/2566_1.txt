Caught part of GEORGE 2 on TV lately, but I could not bring myself to watch it until the end. Just awful! I can not even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula the first film, which was bad enough. There's a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing was so bad and choppy, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. With original voice Ape Monkey ago, it was not nearly enough to make me warm to it. GEORGE 2 is perhaps the worst sequel I've ever seen, and that says something. Jeez, due to the IMDb in 10 lines of the rules, I have to continue to print, if I do not have anything more to say about this crapulastic due sequel television. Disney, hang his head in shame.
