Show on average. Do not tell me specifically. Nevertheless, I think that Courtney really brings it down. She does not look natural. It has three ways to say all Robotic. She speaks quietly (no tone), she said okay (no tone), or she does this thing where she begins to talk normally, and starts yelling gradually. However, her cries, as the "let's pretend that I'm crying because I should not be too loud on the set." <br /> <br /> It is constantly aware of itself be this cute actress does this funny thing. It's annoying. You can not get her face, because she does not actually produce emotions, and not to worry. She has this man who does all these stupid things, and there is no response from her. Very dry and plain action.
