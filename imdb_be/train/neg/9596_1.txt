There's just no use in trying to glorify any part of this film. <br /> <br /> He was just garbage. In the beginning, you may think that you are in a visually stunning piece of cinema ... and then soon after that you get a big sack (burlap) to FAIL! Fighting just fighting, teetering on the edge of the current pair, and the music is not worth describing. There is quite a story that created a reason for this film was made. Decisions about what the characters are doing and the way that they deal with situations that are weak, and did nothing but frustrate me. I think the only reason this film came about, to act as a bit of fan service using Yumiko Shaku.
