After viewing Awake, I am led to the conclusion that the director and screenwriter Joby Harold Awake made with the intention of laughing at the audience, for the simple fact that the film is full of absurd elements.Awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and grotesque elements (eg, hospital uniform spirit the protagonist uses ... did the doctor ghost leave it in the field?). the concept of this film is a bit of genius, but all the plot holes and absurd things make this stupid and crappy film.With save more Lena Olin, all the actors bring bad performances.Hayden Christensen has zero expression, and the same goes for Jessica Alba.The unusual actor Terrence Howard extraordinarily spend money on his role.Awake makes laugh so funny and full of absurd things that you can not accept this recommendation in seriously.My spectator.It in: Skip this crappy movie.
