There was nothing of value in the original film, this one was even lamer. The fact that I even found that the lease has been absolutely amazing. Anyone connected to this film should be high on something! So what's the storyline? What's with the girl? It was the audience should get a storyline in the first four minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, I tried a few times to watch it. I even borrowed a child from someone to get feedback. The child said that it was stupid, and he was four years old. I believe that perhaps some credit can go to the director of cinematography, as perhaps some footage from the film more than a B movie. This may be pushing it. I loved the song. Well, it was only a dollar, it's worth it. I suppose you could enjoy the film when you were high as the cast and crew had to be. Is the Banking Law in France?
