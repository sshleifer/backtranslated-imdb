First to die in 2003 <br /> <br /> I admit my mistake first, I did not understand what it was made for TV movie. I was "thrown off" the certification «R». The plot is strong, but the film is about 40 minutes too long. Direction and continuity were excellent. Most of the cast were exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The reverse side of the film is that it will definitely fall into the "chick flick" genre. Although there are some scenes of violence, none of the violence should not call for the rating «R». There's no nudity or gratuitous sex scenes. In fact, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (which is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all guests at the SG-1 series, but the film did not do anything to advance their careers, as they have been used as reference actresses low level. Robert Patrick was fantastic, as was his custom, and Mitch Pileggi made me think about the contemporary Lee Marvin. Very talented Megan Gallagher, I came to respect as an actor in the series Millennium, it was not given a big deal, to show her range of abilities. The biggest disappointment with the cast was Pollan. In addition, below the average actress and not very attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself muting the TV during a dialogue. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a Lifetime TV-type programs. I would not recommend paying money to see this movie, however. Considering I found nothing that would cause the censorship, it is a film that deserves only to be viewed on a TV, because nothing will be cut. In the TV movie, I would rate it as a 5 out of 10. As a feature film with the certification of «R», and such a strong cast, I appreciate it as a 2 out of ten.
