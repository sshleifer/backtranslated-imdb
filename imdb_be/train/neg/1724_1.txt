... and this film. I believe that if there is indeed a negative afterworld, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch, and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it's not so bad, but it's probably the worst film I've ever seen next to the Â«Manos, Hands of Fate" ... and I've seen a lot of bad movies believe me. <br /> <br /> It's just disgusting In the movie, a bad film-making at its best (or is it worst?) What I really like about this film is the idiotic duo they threw in the comedy relief. Now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but a big part of the film focuses on the adventures of these two idiots, and not on the "heroes" of the film, which in fact it has less time than them! <br /> <br /> To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the film, adding bad music and do a bad job editing. But, to be honest, it's probably a bad film to begin with, so that the crown could not really have done so much to damage it. <br /> <br /> It really should be in the lower list 100. I would not want this on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is my kind of sweet in a movie. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my one star.
