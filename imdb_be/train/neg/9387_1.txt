I saw this film when it was first released. The memory of how bad it was stayed with me for almost forty years. I could not believe their own feelings about the movie when I saw it, so I consulted movie review, published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day, the mood has confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the film was incoherent, decoding and sad, small study shows that the manufacturer was the husband of the star Leslie Caron, thus breathing nepotism involves the beginning of this terrible film. Registry film capable of many actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Graham, and James Sikking among others - suggests that it has some promise. But the death of the film due to its terrible scenario. "Secret" is involved so unclear and so few shows throughout the film that the audience left at a loss from scene to scene. The film seems torn between a detective and mystery spy thriller, but it never settles on one side or the other. The feeling of uncertainty is completely absent. The main characters of the game to settle on dry, unfeeling types in a fashion that does not cause any sympathy at all. Cinema pedestrian. The result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters, the plot, and in the end, the film itself. I'm a little surprised that there is no version of this wretched film is available for purchase. I hope that if TCM detects the imprint of the film and feels compelled to ventilate it, that it is securely removed in the 4:00 am slot.
