Words can not describe how silly this story (and therefore bad this film) is! Basinger, Del Toro ... what do you think ?? Thus, there is a shopping center and its parking lot is full. Basinger character goes to buy a cup of tea and a bit of wrapping paper. <br /> <br /> When it comes out, the whole place is so empty that no one can hear two shots fired next ?? Despite the fact that she lives there, when it departs from the villains, it is the most remote and wilderness possible, instead of the nearest police station, or at least in a public place ?? GO !!! I will not even go into the infamous red tools, as other people have done it before. Not to mention how it kills moronic thugs one by one. <br /> <br /> It's so stupid, without any logic, I can only warn you watch it, it's a waste of time, to be honest !!
