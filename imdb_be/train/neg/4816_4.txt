I believe that young people who participate in the creation of "necromancer" (aka "witching" plus a bunch of other names), must have felt a little weird being on the set of a horror movie with someone who: was John Houseman in the production of the proletarian games ( "The Cradle Will Rock"); scared people into thinking that it was an alien invasion ( "War of the worlds"), and directed and starred in the film, most of all time ( "Citizen Kane") Now Orson Welles starring in. the third speed of the wave of a satanic cult. <br /> <br /> There is no prospect in ntsype nothing creative in this movie. A lot of nudity, but the background music is always very distracting. Even if the film was not very predictable, it still was not worth seeing. How low Wells sunk. Fortunately, in the final thirteen years of his life he handed documentary «Bugs Bunny Superstar» (on the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s) and was the documentary "The Man who saw Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but this is not one. Just avoid. <br /> <br /> In addition, starring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
