KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, I remember that the rating BOMB) was my introduction to the cult director of Honda; this one is not necessarily better ?? it's just that I've learned to be more tolerant to such animals internally fare! <br /> <br /> Here we actually get two for the price of one of Congo: ugly and sluggish kind of giant monkeys and a variety of robot out of it, which is even worse! Simian creature lives on Mondo Island (!) ?? where he showed some fight other monsters, and a trio of friendly people. Naturally, it falls on the light (and soft) character; in fact, more intriguing is fatal in collusion with the criminal insane genius of the movie ?? Doctor Who called sports anemia and appearance of the cape and is usually associated with the vampire !! <br /> <br /> He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes him to get the element X, which is embedded in the icy waste to the north pole; apparently giant ape greater immunity to radiation than its mechanical analog (and, to ensure its full cooperation, who even grabs his three "companions")! A female agent, that is a change of heart, it helps the heroes (one of which is usually a subtle US) and killed Who. Kong eventually escapes and makes it in Tokyo, where she has a final showdown with the robot. Doctor escapes moved mayhem in his sub ?? who, at the request of the Congo Dreamgirl Sexy Lingerie, in total smashed the giant ape.
