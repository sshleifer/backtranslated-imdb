Weak plot, hardly the fault of the car, and feel helpless characters. At first I thought that this film was made in the seventies, as the image quality, as well as the plot and the drama seemed to take from the old series Kojac. When I checked and found that it was actually done back in -97, I was amazed. This is definitely one of the worst and least (thriller) films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, advise, if you see that you spend time when you could do something more exciting as watching paint dry.
