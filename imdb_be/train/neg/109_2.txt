I think I'm going to do a film next weekend. Oh wait, I working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in. It seems that the one who made this film fit. I hope that the creators of this shit day of work, because this movie sucked !!! It looks like someone home movies, and I do not think it's more than $ 100 was spent to do it !!! Total crap !!! Who let this material will be released?!?!?!
