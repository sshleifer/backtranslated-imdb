It was a disappointing film. People seem to have no substance, the leading hero Martin Cahil has zero redemptive value, because everything in it, including Jon Voight represents sleeze. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Violence is unpleasant, though skilfully done. Filming is black, at least, the print I saw fit this category. Disappointment.
