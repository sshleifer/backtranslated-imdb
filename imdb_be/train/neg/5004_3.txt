Wow this is ironic, since this film was for a while, I think someone has just reviewed it a couple of days ago. <br /> <br /> In any case, I watched this movie just because it has Nick Stahl, for the record. <, Br /> <br /> The film was funny. Characters drove me crazy, they were so clich√© and stereotype. This film has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. . It had too many twists and <br /> <br /> There is one scene in the film is worth a look nevertheless the scene: "The warm heart, cold gun" where Nick Stahl kills backward girl in the shower. (Well, actually they were unpleasant.) But its action in this scene was perfect. The look on his face, he looked like a American Psycho (good movie). The scene is worth a look, but do not see the rest of the film to, do yourself a favor and do not watch.
