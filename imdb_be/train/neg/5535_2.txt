I believe that the inability of most things can be, to be sad. Poor is actually better than boring. This thing has no breathing. It is an interesting fact happening in Cambodia. How many American films of the 30s taking place in Cambodia. However, the conflict is a little hard to understand. Even the movement of troops a little confusing. What draws him to stop ringing is a love story. Why are these two guys so completely freezes for Dippy Blonde I do not know. I thought that it should continue to use their zombie ~ d (such as they are) and forget about it. The film is simply pulled together. The ideal microcosm, where one of the main characters should Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the characters (or any other) that explain how to turn people into zombies is saved. I thought that they would never get there. One guy takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. Another guy hiding behind multiple columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy is hiding behind the bushes. This is a film in a nutshell. Then there's the bad actions and insipid dialogue. I actually have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This is an intolerable one. By the way, a more appropriate title would be Rebellion Hypnotized.
