This should be one of the 5 worst movies ever. The plot looked intriguing, both in Passenger 57. But with the last film it somehow worked much better. The plot was developed in the worst form. Few of the terrible moments in the film, a flight attendant standing in the open doorway of a flying 747 and tries to close the door without sucked 250 miles per hour winds?!? After that, the ground plane from a few miles, starting at 8,000 feet, it would be impossible even for the 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. If the runway (quite right, of course), it is instructed to pull the flaps, yes !! Let's wings are there to provide a lift at low speeds when the runway you are using reverse thrust on the engines and give maximum power! I could go on and on about small and large errors mainly in the movies, but then my answer would have been the size of a dictionary of the English language. This is a movie that you want to miss, take my word for it!
