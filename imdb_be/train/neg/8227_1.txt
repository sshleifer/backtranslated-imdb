I'll keep it quick and sweet. Five girls on their way home from a football game decided to take a "short path" that leads them on a deserted forest road ridden. Of course, nothing but good things will happen to them, and they safely arrive at their destination. <br /> <br /> Well, they do not. Soon they hunted mad chick who has some serious mental problems, and that comes 90 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope never to see any of these actors in any film ever again. Their screams, screeching voice gave me a headache, and the script was so poorly written that it includes a lot of repetitive phrases and senseless hysterical scream. In general, one of the worst of cheap horror films I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
