OK it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I was able to sit and watch it twice !!! The storyline was pretty creepy, and during the first part of the first story, I thought, what the hell, I watched, but at the same time it was so bad, I loved it cheap laughs all the way. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this film, the only thing that let him down was halfway through this group ceased to silly name calling. <br /> <br /> the whole movie was quite perfetic, but if your after a cheap laugh, and you see it in pounds on the ground to walk on it.
