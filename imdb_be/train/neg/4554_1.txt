Bingo game, garbage name. Rarely screen was smeared with a bag of immature undermined conspiracy theories, Puritan bigotry and New Age delusion. Most of the stories is set to Viciente, of Cristian resort in the Peruvian jungle. Think Rivendell Tolkien meets Star Trek Planet Baku populated minded followers not so mysterious, but surprisingly narrow-minded cult of love and peace. Due to the action will be sticky and production design (rainbow color visualization of "energy" healing all mysterious, particularly disgusting), "The Celestine Prophecy" looks and feels abandoned 1980 episode of "Dark Zone". Factual errors regarding church history and nomenclatures are many. I can not believe that Elizondo has agreed to be part of it. Perhaps this was done without his consent, Bowfinger style. May the Lord have mercy on the director, screenwriter, author of the novel, and the poor souls who see a movie or read a book.
