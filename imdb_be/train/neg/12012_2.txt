The dialogue was pretty awful. The plot is actually not all that inspired than obvious twist it represents. Nha visually stunning. In fact, visually annoying at times. Most definitely one of those movies that you will find it easier to complete if you keep your finger on the button fast. If you could see it for free, has absolutely no other options open at the moment, and you really dig to see a little poltergeist lady ... well, maybe I would recommend it to you, but not anyone else that I could think of at the moment ,,
