Several years ago, the same person who created Paris, J'TAIME., Who was not perfect, but very pleasant (my rating was 7), has created this piece of garbage near New York City. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I Love You (J'taime) created a sensation in Paris and it was done in many parts of the beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> in this movie, I did not recognize the city of New York, I do not feel that I was in the city of my birth. <br /> <br /> New York does have 5 townships, I have not seen scenes in the Bronx or Quincy There is one scene in Brooklyn (Brighton Beach), I saw a silent scene in Times Square and Greenwich Village / NO the scenes of the beautiful hotels or theaters. He's got a great cast, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest grade. <br /> <br /> Very few humorous moments of all the course of a sexual nature, or very offensive to many small New Yorkers that we all know and love .. <br /> <br /> Some of the films nominated for the prize "Golden Raspberry "was much better <br /> <br /> Ratings :. * (C 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> In my way of thinking, I think the title should be <br /> <br /> New York, I love you I hate.
