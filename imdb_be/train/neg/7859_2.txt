Oh, my God. This movie was terrible. I can not complain about it too much. I went to see him just being dirty. It was enough, sort of. It's funny that the most shocking part of the film was in the very, very beginning, where an extremely bright woman forced to give birth to a badly mutated children. <br /> <br /> I also think it's funny that the most noteworthy actor in the film was a Hispanic soldier who was supporting actor next Friday. Everything in the film made a terrible actor's work. These are some of the worst acts I have ever paid to see. <br /> <br /> I also expect that it will be far more terrible than the first. It was not. I expected that it will be more terrible, because it is a continuation of the sequels and horror films tend to be much less successful than their predecessors. I expected that it will be more terrible, since blood and violence, tend to sell horror these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but it actually was not nearly as as disgusting as the first, another disappointment. <br /> <br /> mutants in the first were a kind of wake-up, but the filmmakers are trying so hard in this, to make them terrible, they were absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also hated the whole concept of the show clip female soldier son on her camera phones saying "I love you, Mom" ​​quadruple It was foolish to show this in the first place because they are. just trying to make us feel worse for vulnerable mothers than other men, and it was even more absurd to continue to try to make us feel worse for it, showing it three more times, for no apparent reason. this film was a joke.
