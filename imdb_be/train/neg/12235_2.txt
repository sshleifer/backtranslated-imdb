If you want to know what music people listened to white in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins, as well (see my comments on My Girl 1 for reference) <br /> <br /> indulgent reception :. I went to My Girl 2 with cynicism and irritation, just consider his predecessor. But, as adopted is preparing to finally set in search of my birthmother, My Girl 2 made me, the theme of the mother searches. <br /> <br /> In other words, everything that I liked My Girl 2 was nothing at all to do from My Girl 2, but in connection with the main character, who asks how many adopted children, "Who is my mother?" And if you have home movies of my mother in the acting troupe, I will be sure to make your own movie about it. <br /> <br /> People sluggish. Films should not be sluggish. My Girl 2 (as My Girl 1) just ... sluggish. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you do not complete the juice, which is comforted by a series of minor irritations.
