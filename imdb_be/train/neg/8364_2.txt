I can see the guys doing the preparation of the budget for this film. "Well, let's see now, we spend 50% to give Dirk Benidict, causing Battle Star Galactic and the A-Team were cool. WE spend 40% makes the Demon costume, not to mention the fact that the demon should be disembodied in the script. And we do all the rest making the movie. " It was very bad and very clich√© .... have a favorite person present during playback (or bring a good book)
