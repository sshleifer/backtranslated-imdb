February with a capital "A". It should be one of, if not, unfunniest shows on television right now. I mean, as an anti-bush, as it gets, but the show did not even get a chuckle out of me. What do you think Bush as president has absolutely nothing to do with you or do not like this piece of shit show. This "joke" is not funny. For example, in the scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head: "Welcome to the Al-Qa-EEDA camp." There's nothing funny about it. Is this even has to be a joke? Commercials, which have been shown in a few weeks before the show, hyping it was funnier than the show itself, and it's just boring. I hope it does not even get considered for a second season. He should not have even the first.
