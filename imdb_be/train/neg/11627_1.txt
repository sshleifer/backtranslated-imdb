I wonder who was responsible for this mess. Joke would not work on Gilligan's Island. If it went to series, there will be jokes about Auschwitz, or Eve would have to replace it with an oven, only to have Adolf offer views that seats 50 ?? Another post comparing this show I love Lucy. The problem with this is that Lucille Ball was a genius in the physical comedy and strange situations, and this confusion was just a poorly done and insult my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the Nazis damage done to England, and the number of people they killed, I think that the concept comedy about Hitler seemed to be very disgusting and most normal people would kill this concept to some episodes were made .
