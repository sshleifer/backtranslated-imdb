The only thing I remember about this movie two things: firstly, as twelve years and I even thought it was smelly. Secondly, it was so bad that when Mad magazine did a parody of it, they go away after the first page, and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page, saying that they are completely disavowed it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see more babble comedies of this period, the animals try at home. This is so stupid and vulgar it goes to a high art. Another good choice would be Caddyshack, classic with dead Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray, before he became annoyingly charming, with great lines, as the greens keeper Carl Spackler in "Correct me if I'm wrong, Sandy, but if I kill all player golf, they "will lock me up and throw away the key."
