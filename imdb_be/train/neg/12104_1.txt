Religulous Bill Maher is not an attack on organized religion. The attack on Christianity and Islam. Besides making fun bunch of rabbis invented deformed car to get around the rules of Sabbath's, he actually does not attack Judaism and seems to be angry when the rabbi actually disputed the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his theory to its logical conclusion, it would have realized that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories are based on the so-called "holy books" organized religion. This indicates their full and complete lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film. <br /> <br /> I think it's really hard to believe that a person is an atheist, or even all that reasonable. Anyone can go to a religious man, and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs, but what you have to offer them in return? Nowhere is it actually tell them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes it "rational" person in the room? In a sense, this reflects the way he really is not, and in the process ends up being just as stupid as these people. <br /> <br / > If you want to watch a good movie / documentary about the real evil of religion and how religion can actually be harmful to human civilization, see Richard Dawkins "root of all evil?". it's brilliantly researched documentary, clearly showing that he hopes to achieve and like. <br /> <br /> Religulous Bill Maher is not funny, is not ikavyya questions and does not give any idea about such a controversial topic. It seems to be talking nonsense and old unhappy with his Catholic upbringing. I almost feel sorry for him.
