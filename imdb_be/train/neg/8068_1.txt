I did not have huge expectations of the film for rental for $ 1 in the video store, but the box at least showed little promise of its "killer cut" from the "more blood! More sex! "Can not go wrong there! Well ... I, of course, the box fraud. How in the hell did the actor and actress of the caliber to sign for a film of this low? <br /> <br /> All of this opens up drunk college girl leaving home or brotherhoods of some other buildings, as well as what some say is useless crap boyfriend (?) as a camera on a bad Steadicam follows. Then she gets chased by some dude in a transparent plastic mask, and grabbed another. They cut his wrists no real reason, and you can see when they are "cut" to her that someone pay cuts that looks like a pencil. <br /> <br /> From here, follow the same theme girls receive coining / unbrutally killed two guys for about 84 minutes more. Add a tit shot. Ie Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I would not have had a problem with this film was not a box frauded I rent Flick. When I rent a bad movie, which claims that there is more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex! One full-frontal shot in the 85th minute from a chick who obviously androginous and Gore that would not frighten the child does not cut it. If this is the killer Cut, Theatrical Cut that?! Of course, I doubt that this waste was actually introduced in the cinema in the first place. Shame actors in this film. I could see that they make their screen debuts here, because they have not done before, but all of them were created before it was released. I do not know when it was taken before they were created and the studio sitting on the film until they were half a big name or not. But what I want to know .... they really have spent $ 14 million of this film?
