I do not think it was possible, but I found the film worse than «Body Melt». This film is really too bad! And what makes it worse is that it is another Australian film ... <br /> <br /> Filmed on what looks like a VHS, and with a terrible 80-rock soundtrack, it just keep getting worse and worse, it is hard to believe seeing as there are bad start (peel a man hanging upside down in a white tomato sprayed the room anyone?). <br /> <br /> And why their accents are constantly changing? From bad in New York drawl that prim British, purely Aussie! And this is the whole cast! <br /> <br /> This film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover (I think it was a festival of the Utah Film). It was not a lie, because no one in their right mind would push it to something (perhaps Golden Rasberries but I think it is too bad for this Aswell). <br /> <br /> Well, guys! This film should be number 1 on the bottom 100 !!! It should be ten times as bad as these films are already there. <br /> <br /> Well done "film" makers of this stuff, to prove there is a reason not to watch movies ..... 0/10
