a very unprofessional of computer programmers One movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that the authors of the film do not know the specifics of the real world programmers. <br /> <br /> 20 best programmers in the world, the programs have their own satellites (for what?), a program that, using satellite FREQ., someone to kill someone to steal the codes (why?) and much more dull moments in this film. <br /> <br /> peoples who are not programmers will not see anything terrible in this film, because it is not experts on the subject. But people will not see the real thing, <br /> <br /> programmers will find this film a strange and terrible -. (Why? SciFi film was not in this case), because a lot of moments in the film are not related real life.
