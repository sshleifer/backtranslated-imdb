How can I tell you, despite earlier comments, the commentors posted by others, this film is now available on DVD. I found it a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> He is on Value DVD label, and I paid the result of 98 cents plus tax for it. I found him on the 98-cent store for food among the racks of plastic cups and disposable chopsticks. Now you are not the people who laid the gentleman coup bucks for a super-duper version of the Swedish import limited edition feel like you have ??? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This film was actually worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I could start to argue with you. But it is clear that it is worth 98 cents. And remember, they say that you pay for. Only mavens slasher.
