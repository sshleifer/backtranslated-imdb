Trailer of the movie interested me enough to warrant a DVD rental. Nevertheless, with the result that the film absolutely lamentable! ! However, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst movie this year, but it came damn close <br /> <br /> The main issue is the film, not knowing what she wants to be: Comedy, Drama adult, thriller, teen porn? The history is interesting, as it has to deal with traps mail order brides, but the film is a mess. What begins as a moderately interesting "comedy" (I use the word in the loosest terms), then it goes completely in the opposite direction, and degenerates into a very dark and unpleasant misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin in vain! How is Vincent Cassel and Mathieu Kassovitz, which I can only assume, do it for the money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad film in pretty much every aspect. It's not funny, it's almost as sexist, that you could almost forgive Benny Hill all that he did, and dramatic elements only very ugly. The film should be avoided unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in each of his films!
