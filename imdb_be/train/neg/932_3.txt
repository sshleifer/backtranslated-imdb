I watched this movie, and hoped to get better all the time. What is so great about a guy with no emotions? * Yawn * <br /> <br /> You'll never see Alex show emotion for any other than his son. Yes, I know that this is why his son, the only one who will make him lose his self-control (if you can call it that), I get it. <br /> <br /> The characters underdeveloped, are irrelevant given enough time to understand. In one scene, Sarah says that they do not fall in love, and the next time we see her, she says that his death really shook it, because they were so close? Logic synapses abound in this film. <br /> <br /> It's like someone is watching Boogie Nights and wrote this piece to simulate Little Bill. Even the scene where he "lost his temper" is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife, down to facial expressions (or lack thereof). For example, William H. Mays, well reflect a man without emotions - been there, done that? - You can tell Magnolia <br /> <br /> This film not only lacks emotion, it would not matter, a good script, developed the character and the story. And this, of course, is not enough my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
