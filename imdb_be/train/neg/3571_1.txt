B super sexy actress has another cameo role as a friend of the future «Goodfellas» star Ray Liotta in the box office bomb. She plays Marion, there is only one line of dialogue, and a single word in the dialogue on the matter. She shouts, "Joe!" Because the character ing violates the poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinklers. This film is so bad, even though it becomes funny, fun at times. The guys in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 will love it! Check hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and cheese all editing and effects that they do to try to show how bad character Pia is worried. Pia plays aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora as a writer? Yeah, right. Pia hardly speak, let alone write! Pia completely and totally miscast in this role mute. But who cares? The real star of the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her cameo, according to the cat! Rock on glory!
