Three story lines and not enough tying them together, «Inside Man» was very nervous and incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. While having their moments, the film began, like a fast thriller that quickly grounded to a slow crawl, jump quickly between highs and lows, and only slightly gained momentum again in the last 20 minutes. I will give credit Denzel Washington, he played his role very well with the full knowledge of his human side, not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did very well with his dual parts as the "evil genius" and a "criminal genius" (the two are not the same in retrospect). In general, though, each person individually has created large slice. However, if the parts finally came together, and all felt that there was no sudden "ah-ha!" Or the whole sum. All this will end up with very little power, he began by saying, with a large number of plot holes, tons of questions, and, as I mentioned earlier, where near normal level of Spike Lee. I have to completely disagree with so-called "professional critic" ... this is not the movie they play to be.
