I was looking for this film for ages, because it is quite rare to find, as it was one of the video nasty. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year, this is a very low budget film's story revolves around the Amazon jungle tribes living in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model, kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America. They take her to the jungle Laure protects some ridiculous natives, who calls himself "the Devil" it needs to go, even though all the unpleasant things, while they will not be happy. Dev chained. The Devil shows eats meat in a terrible way. Peter Weston, the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and save her,
