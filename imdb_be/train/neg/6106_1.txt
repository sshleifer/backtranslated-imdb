It was just awful, the story was just OK, but the rest was bad. I mean come on a puppet and then they even tried to make the film digitally, and that made it even worse! Normally I would have a low-budget film, but it's just a waste of time and almost made me want to return to the set that he came to. I have about a dozen low-budget film set from 6-8 movies on them, and I must say that this is the worst movie of all of them. In addition, the formulation is possible and they are using fake plastic machete, who did not even look like a real one, they can be used with one that looked even a little closer to the real, so save your time and money, not to look at it horrorible film.
