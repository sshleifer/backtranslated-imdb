I must admit that I am a big fan of the show, so you must know how disappointed I was when I watched this movie. First of all, the story was awful, I thought it would be something more interesting, like to see what happened to Arnold parents, or something a little more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, maniac wants to destroy the house of Arnold, among many other places, so many people He is trying to stop it. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the story was not so bad, but what really sucked were the steps that Arnold and his friends are doing to stop this maniac, they become friends spy; they ride the bus (on the basis of a video game, for God's sake), and worst of all, they make super-moves on the bus, then, that many people have tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, because they who are experts in video games. <br /> <br /> Frankly, my mother, my sister, even I was very disappointed after watching this movie, because it was the worst way to end a very good cartoon. I must admit that I loved "Hey Arnold!" It was one of my favorite cartoon on the Nickelodeon, but after that crap movie, I'm not quite sure if I'll be watching "Hey Arnold!" As I used to watch it on the past. <br /> <br /> Another thing, the Nickelodeon, with this huge amount of dynamite, I can assure you that not just a street exploded, I think that the whole town could explode, well, and, please, if all your future films of good cartoons are going to be like, what not to do more movies, you give a bad critic and cartoons that used to be good. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think it was the worst way to end the show, good show turns into a shit movie.
