During the Christmas holidays, a group of college friends to stay, to help prepare the hostel to be demolished and replaced by apartment buildings. In order to make the job a little more difficult, destructive, wearing Chucks psycho wanders the corridors of the hostel, hunting groups in various violent ways. <br /> <br /> Registered as one of 74 "video nasty" is listed in the UK in the 1980s, hostel, which was dripping blood had a good reputation, built for him before the first show. The term "video ugly" strike in mind some images of some great explicit gore, violence, sex, etc:.. All things horror fan dreams So, after listening to all of that information, I settled into license (. alt name) waiting sleazy experience chopper ,,. and this is what he was trying to be, but not to a large extent completely. Visually, the film is not great. inematagrafiya blood (for a couple of scenes, except), and the general direction of all fail. It's just not nice to look at. unoriginal script is not enough, and often throws in random things without any real reason (for example, the opening of the murder). There some interesting death scenes, including a fairly good face of the melt (which can be seen on the poster), but that is about it positively. Action is very bad, the story seems to be unimportant, the killer is not cool or scary, and it suffers from one major error that any slasher flick should always grooves byagats: it is a bit sad. In general, the film spent several students UCLA film for $ 90,000 (which would be more than twice as much as today), The Dorm That dripping is not a complete mess. She has a few good things, and quite watchable. ,, But as the chopper swing looking to be at the level of films such as House on Sorority Row and play. ,, He just can not match. Do not expect much, and you may at least be entertained. I do not want to say it, but this is one of the few films that I've seen that would actually be better off with a remake. ,, And yet, they go after the big jobs like Black Christmas. Oh, well. ,. <br /> <br /> Horror Required items: <br /> <br /> - subgenre: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some cool tough kills, and blood in order for the most part . ,, but nothing special. In addition, they are not quite screening some of the best kills <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: .. There's a little bit unattractive (for me) nudity, but not very much <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Nah. The ending monologue (a) the killer made him / her rather dissolved <br /> <br /> - scary / unclear: .. jump scare or two, but not very effective <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I believe, yeah, but I just did not care enough, and it is as obvious as the nose on your face killer <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> the final verdict :. 3.75 / 10 Ba! Nonsense! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
