I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues, if this film anything to go by. I was expecting something better from Thurman that was the reason I suffered my way through this experience in the first place. Only a terrible film with music as a sacrificial quality. I winked just a shame that we are not able to give 0 out of 10 of these reviews. This film deserves.
