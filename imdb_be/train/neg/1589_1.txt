It is incredible that a scenario like a cliché and totally absurd can do any screen, even a little. Dialogue in the film Catwoman does seem high culture classic. Billy Zane plays a bad ass harmonica playing, Elvis impersonating, gunslinging, martial arts master, who gambles on life down with nested elements of the former footballer turned gambling addict plays the winner craptastic show channel NBC «Next Action Star.» His performance cold ice and not in a cool way. "The film" takes place in Las Vegas, and as people are playing poker there writers feel that the ideal place for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against the ubiquitous rich player who offered his goal of $ 2.4 million if he can do it every other day. and that's hunting occurs. smelly hunting with unimpressive explosions installations construction yard, poor cinematography and jokes that contain the word "bet" or "adventure". The female winner is also thrown into the mix, but for some reason I have no idea. Yes, but do not worry «NAS» supporters lost make them memorable cameo as well. Unexpected end will knock your socks off, if you like the predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should reconsider its decision to sell even more. I wish he could give me the hours of my life ago.
