Miike is like Chabrol, alternating art of dreck, sometimes confuse the two? Is it the speed of fifty / fifty-some claim to Chabrol? Do we see here too much or too little Miike? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill ten lines only with reference to Chakushin Ari (One Missed Call) steals, hints and clich√©s. Others are hit on most of them, although it may not be, saimin Ochiai (hypnosis) for running TV tease supernatural things. Only once, when Yumi takes the zombie as a mother in her arms, she made One Missed Call scare me a little bit <br /> <br /> One other point of interest :. Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken), as a detective. Ishibashi offensive in history to audition, as well as live or dead, Aoki boss vat of excrement drowning or more, may be the most convincing actor evil character I've ever seen. So he was a policeman.
