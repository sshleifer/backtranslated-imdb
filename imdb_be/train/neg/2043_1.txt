Awful, awful, awful. <br /> <br /> condescending remark at the beginning and a few unpleasant autopsy photos are not good film does. Once again I am amazed at the determination and skill that some people in the achievement of a movie production and yet they do not have the honor to understand what they have done is a complete load of crap. <br /> <br /> I sat there and tried to think about saving function so that I can at least balance my criticism, but the only one I could think of was that the opening track on the Pink was pretty good .... I wonder if she saw it? <br /> <br /> Look at this at your own risk, nostalgia can kill you.
