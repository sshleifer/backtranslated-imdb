I have no idea how someone turned out not to sleep during the show. The action was clumsy and amateurish, the story was old news, and the development of the plot (or lack thereof) has always been my eyelids sag less than in the middle of each episode. That's all there is to say about this, because it really did not have any kind of substance. <br /> <br /> How can you people like shit like this? This is fucking stupid is an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it further ... It is as if some of you will look at the litter thoughtlessly, as it is only because you like the way some actors look like, or because, for some insane reason, you haven 't seen the same formula in dozens of shows in a million times. <br /> <br /> I just .. forget. The show sucked, and fortunately, it is gone forever. I wish they would get a job for the demolition of lonely hearts once and for all.
