I just put it here, it was the worst sequel to the classic Disney film I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released the fact that I come from, as one of his greatest films of all time. Now Take great songs, add a bad story that reminds us that the TV show Lost. "Put it together and what do you get?" The biggest load Crud I've ever seen. After I saw it, I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should have ended "and they lived happily ever after." It's not garbage. This film does not deserve to continue like this. I thought it would be as a "twist of time", which was reasonable, but it's better than that. In addition, we care Anastasia? She moved to the side, how he did, but it did not help anyone.
