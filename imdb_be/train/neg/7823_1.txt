This film was very poorly conceived from any angle, in addition to technology. I stood and watched all falls out of the theater, their faces drained, how their lives flashed before their eyes - eyes wandering to his neighbor, I wonder if it's just them. I mean, as if the film is really bad. Nobody'll admit it, this is a classic case of The Emperor wears no clothes. "Who am I to question the movie that contains the guy who stops jetliner?" But the fact is that every member of the audience thinks I'm writing now. I actually plagiarized their faces. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Lois only caused the power, it will not even have a cup of coffee with Superman with glasses, who will stop at jetliner. This may not be a look at "their" eyes in the depths of his soul or something like that. In the old Supermans, she had some level of communication with him, he was not number 1 priority, obviously, but it strengthened her character, that she was "broken." I bet Henry Kissinger would have even won that before Lois Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now it's official, does Superman Krypton that eating at McDonalds makes on average. people. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN «ONE» He loses his land of his father, he finds his true super dad, magical story every step of the way. He is a man, he treats people, and he feels love for the people he refers to the Lyceum students, it refers to people who feel differently. He treats. Superman Returns Superman seems to apply only to Superpeople, and it seems that he just "does the job" when he saves people. <br /> <br /> There's something about Clark that Lois loves, she really in love with him internally, but can 't recognize him, and when he comes into the picture, like Superman, he throws a kink in love on-rock. Without Superman, she had fallen in love with Clark (at least that's what the point in the movie, so that was it intentionally or not). Superman returns is a love story between a woman and Superman, Clark like a pile of horse maneur to Lois. In a literal sense, . <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO I just watched it again. As a child I "thought" I enjoyed the action, but now I know that it was a story that held me then, too, watch it again and again . If I saw Superman Returns, as a child, I would have hated him then, too, it seems to me. <br /> <br /> There is so much heart and soul and bypass superpower in this film, he is sick. Superman gives his strength to love as a global conspiracy going on and meanwhile, it is Lex Luthor got something fantastic sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THE THIRD It is now a three-way love story between Superman and Clark and Lana, only humanity wins, and the intrinsic nature of Clark's Superman has power, because if it SUPERmoral nature disappeared and he superhuman (making man things with his super powers), she sees that it does not force the Superman that she was in love, it is not SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman, she loves - and that is really super. And when she tells Clark that she "prefers" his Superman, he raised, he made a human connection again. He wants to be accepted for who he is, not only for its ability to bend steel. This is the kind of stuff that is not in Superman Returns <br /> <br /> Clark super-sneezes to help small to get hit -. Mankind again. Also, what is the use of INERESTING superpowers. He did not just use brute force strength. <br /> <br /> He grinds the coal into a diamond for his woman, because she had to sell it, love is the only thing that makes him use his second than to save power. <br /> <br /> it seems, there is nothing at stake in Superman Returns. Even Superman three, we see the damage caused by Nemesis world domination plot .. we see suffering, we see how this affects Pryor and others, and in the middle of it .. there is no damage, officials. emotional story from Lex to sink the United States. We see Globa crystal thrown into space .. Superman had to get very creative approach in the first three Supermans, to stop the conspiracy against him, he could not just "access" its superpowers. In the first, he had to stop the two missiles that go in different directions, and then break it down a universal mandate and erase history, to save the life of Lois ... (it was thirty years ago !! ") In the second, he must was to outwit three guys that he was more powerful than that, but combined with the genius of Lex and immoral tactics villains, Superman was overwhelming enough, he had to work against each other and outsmart them ... in Superman III, again superpowers was not enough to win .. he had to outwit amputar, we calculated everything that he saw. He could not use direct aggression on the computer, because it is calculated in advance, so he had to use a benign acid, which would only be fatal to a computer after the computer answered the aggression and he found the acid before, when he could not just use his superpowers to blow out the fire, because it was a chemical fire, so he had to use his superbrains. - could not carry water, so that it has frozen the lake and threw in the fire .. Now Superman Returns, he just throws island in Outerspace, as the night temperature for IBPA. He did not need to know anything, he just uses his "super power". And shine Lex Luther was shown at the level of intentional drug addict who just ran out of the garbage. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that he threw the island into Outerspace after getting stabbed with a knife in blood kyrptonite rights and the island itself is dripping krypton controversy in his face, but he just turned his eyes and nose, as it was not gray Poupon he looked.
