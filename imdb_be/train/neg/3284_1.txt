I've seen the worst movie? Perhaps only «Manos: Hands of Fate" dragged more than «Dukes». I had more fun poking at the giant plot holes than the film gave me at any time. Let's touch on a few ... <br /> <br /> It was apparent death and rebirth scenario when Sheev talking with the princes, and they do not respond. He shrugs his shoulders and goes on, as neither Knoxville and Scott knows that he says (and we do not). It was like the engine died and was restored. <br /> <br /> Several times General Lee to fly through the air it was not even that interesting. Nothing I have not seen on the TV series. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo Luc upset for stealing the girl he loved. The only reason why it works is that the script is actually forshadowed it (although some). Rest of the time he seems distant and forced. <br /> <br /> how, how focus Seann William Scott (or its absence). <br /> <br /> I hated the job Willie Nelson. Were bad jokes have to be cute? I wanted to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson comes across great on the big screen. It actually felt like one of the best actors in the film. That's saying how awful this movie. She is a goddess. <br /> <br /> During the climax of the film, I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the bad guys, to iron out all the Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his associates. A nuclear bomb would be enough. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the dismantling of a coherent film and frustration in the bottomless release writing and performance that could be really touching movie. <, Br /> <br /> If only we could erase and start all over again ...
