Despite the fact that there is a Flying Guillotine as a part of the name of this film, he has no connection with the original Flying Guillotine (1975) and its sequel Flying Guillotine II (1978). Two originals are masterpieces a kung fu movie, and still stands as a classic. It is much worse than a copy of the original, and even as a normal kung fu movie, it is below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film is not replete with action. This is one meaningless fight scene after another, and the flying guillotine did not play a major role in them. The history of some of the Shaolin monks, who track down some villains who already withdrew from the holy book, and the evil prince, who owns part of this book is part of the story. The same evil prince plans to involve monks and use the flying guillotine them. <br /> <br /> There are four films with a flying guillotine as a part of its name. This is in my opinion the least quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three that this film was made by another person from the other three. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is no chemistry deviations from unintentionally funny because of poor production. <br /> <br /> It is better to miss it and watch two of the original.
