My friend gave me this movie. My friend is now in hospital, he had a team of doctors trying to surgically remove the DVD from his body ***. <br /> <br /> I got excited to throw prospects at the other Chabon film. After all of his novels have brought me a lot of entertainment and devices previous scripts have been great, but boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all the people who did the casting must have slept in while doing it. I believe that the cast went something like this. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I like fish very much." "I wonder full, you have hired. There is some money.Â» <br /> <br /> What is the script. I read Chabon, which I hope, blind before he could see this piece of dong, and it has absolutely nothing to do with romance. I do not know why throw it annoys me how it was, but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to speech impaired 90-year-old drunken duck hunter the right cranial lobe dysfunction would be treated in comparison with the one-liners in the 2nd degree model Massacre children spat <br /> <br /> This is the current line from the movie. "If you tell me something that you've never spoken aloud to anyone before in this moment becomes unique!" Unique? Does it make? Is there really really? Of course, you do not plank. please pass me the imodium. I'll be a whole **** ing band. <br /> <br /> Destination ... well. I have nothing. Maybe, Rawson Marshall Thurber has just received word of his grandmother pulled down or something. Stick to guides comedies. Nha adhere to the guide rollers. <br /> <br /> This film is so horrible that left me banging my head against the wall so hard that he brought me back to the Stone Age. I give 2 stars because I do not want to be the guy who watched 1 movie star.
