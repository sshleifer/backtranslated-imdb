Loaded with great actors, I expected much more from a "fraudster" than was delivered. The plot is very contrived and manipulative. Many memories only add to the confusion. Plausibility flies out of the window and the end becomes unbearable and ridiculous. I strongly advise anyone who likes their movies sites to be based on the fact that, at least, it is possible to avoid "cheater", because you will be very disappointed. Maybe I'm just not hip enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others have been completely lost in the storyline and especially in the final. Blurring the line between reality and lies just does not work, because the whole film does not make sense. - MERK
