(Spoilers ahead) Russian fantasy "thriller" (and I use the term loosely), I tried to look for a year. I finally got to the end, and now I wish I had not put in repeated efforts. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to keep the two minutes of my life I'm going to tell you that he's a guy a site that has the ability to project a long knife from his hand returned home to see his mother. Things turn nasty after he shot down one of the old mafia girl friend. He takes revenge on a guy if he brings a girl home. Guys Mafia mom sends people to take revenge, and the police start looking for him as well. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. no explanation really given anything (for example, why they close the ID friend in an insane asylum) and the action, for the most part is the screen all away. The film is mainly composed of a guy who looks like Brody, looking intense and does not say anything, killing people (from the screen, most of the action takes place off-screen). It looks good, well acted, and if there was some form of reasons for what is happening this may have been a good film. Hell, I would like to make some sense of real character development or history (we all know that this guy was picked on as a child). The film works better part of two hours and it feels like it's six. If they were not going to tell us everything that they could at least pick up the pace, so it seemed that it was moving too fast. Lot instead we get a character on the boat. Hero on the bus, on foot hero, the hero seeks disturbed.Hero with his girlfriend. It really annoys me, because I think it might be a good movie, if they just do something or somebody was actually saying something significant other than to give instructions "to get this guy." <br /> <br /> 4 of 10. Its about four hours (all my attempts to see it), I will never go back. Only for those who want to see a thoughtful Russian fighter with very little action
