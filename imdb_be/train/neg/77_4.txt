I saw this film the first weekend in Australia in anticipation of a great cast Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush, that is the ultimate story of Ned Kelly will unfold in front of me. Unfortunately, despite the excellent performance of Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin .... that does not inspire me to "Our Sun". There were some other plus points, support acting on Edgerton, in particular, guaranteed the direction of the Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo soldier, a), and the production of a project that gave a real sense of rudeness in the Australian bush, but as Irish immigrants in the early 19 th century have probably seen it. But I can not shake the feeling that another opportunity was missed to tell the real story of the Australian folk hero (or he?) .... in fact, I suspect that this is a concession to Hollywood and sell the paintings to the United States. Well, at least Jordan and the producers do not agree to lose his beard in favor of Universal ... <br /> <br /> I guess I just have to be satisfied perfectly "Secret History of Peter Carey Kelly GangÂ». 4/10
