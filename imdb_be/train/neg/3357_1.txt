As the audience react to this new "device" books by Shirley Jackson, who was raised as not a remake of the original 1963 film (quite true), to be based, as I suspect, the following: those who were big fans of a book or the original movie is not will think much of it ... and those who have never been exposed to anything, and that is a big fan of the current Hollywood trend towards "special effects", being the first and last word in how "good" film, love it " br /> <br /> What I did not like about this device :. <br /> <br /> 1. It was not a true adaptation of the book From the articles I've read that this film was supposed to cover other aspects of the book that the first one did not bother and that seemed reasonable.. , no film can not cover the book word for word, if it is not the length of the booth! (And not even then), but there are things in this film that were never any means not mentioned or even hinted at film. reminded me of how they decided to kill the black man in the original version of the film shining. I do not want that, either. That the press release of the film had to say it ... "We got a basic, very simple, the idea of ​​a book by Shirley Jackson, we have kept the same name of the house and a few (but not all) leading character names, but then we decided to write his own story, and what the hell, we observed substitution and shine and GHOST first, and decided to throw in a few of them, too. "<br /> <br /> 2. They are completely lost in the topic parapyschologist inviting carefully selected guest who had all had a brush with the paranormal in their past to explore the house, which really seemed to be "Born bad". No, instead, the "doctor" was all in the house under the false pretext of studying their "insomnia" (in fact, he invited them there to scare them to death, and then to see how they reacted to them ... like the fear laboratory rats that he did not speak and did not get told that they are part of the experiment ... a good guy). This doctor, who does not have the same name, by the way, was in contrast to the specialized professionals of the original film, as night from day. <br /> <br /> 3. In direct contradiction to the statement that was used to promote both films "some homes are just born bad," this house was not born bad, and became ill because of what happened there. .. and, this time, Nel becomes to unravel the mystery (Changeling shades). The only problem was the so-called secret was so vaguely said that I am sure that it remained a mystery to the majority of the audience ... but it was no secret in the first place (not in the book), because the house was bad to begin with. This is the first "victim" died before ever setting eyes on it. <br /> <br /> 4. The way the character was portrayed by Luke it was absolutely ridiculous. He had to be polite to a playboy who was ever done to the house (and was a true skeptic is "history") ... and in it, he was just a winey voice, awkward nerd who could not sleep (insomnia remember) and He was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also annoyed by how the film almost jumped out of trying to recreate the original scenes word for word (the scene with the family's sister Nel, and few opening remarks, Mrs. Dudley ...) to leave in flights of fantasy that made me think more of these films than achieve. It's like it can not make up his mind what he wanted to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed the story Nel through the whole movie. The original was so much like a Gothic novel in the way that the story was largely told in the first person through the eyes Nel, and we have always been devoted to her thought. This is quite a unique touch was completely lost in the new version. They also tried to do a lot more Nel heroine. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was bitter people (it can be any other way after sacrificing 11 years of his life the old woman's selfish and spiteful sister?), And she loved to moan, and she lost her self-control. .. This one was too good to be true. This was never more evident than in the film's climax, where, obviously, the writer observed GHOST too many times. <br /> <br /> 7. They changed the history of the house, and it occupents too much. There was not Abigail Crane (daughter of Hugh, whose legend loomed in the original version), there was no "satellite", and there was no nursery. There, too, it was not "Grace" (the wife of the original doctor) and his wife, Hugh Crane died in completely different directions. These changes altered the story too much. I do not know, the producers of this movie should be pleased, Shirley Jackson no longer walks on this earth, or they have to regret ... (if I get my drift !!! The ghosts she could not imagine being lightly. With !!!) <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me leave you with some words from the original Luke (corresponding to the replacement of the word "home" for the "film"): "This" movie "to be burned, and the earth is sprinkled salt! "My favorite movie of all time is. No competition with it.
