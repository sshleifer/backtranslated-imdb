Although I am generally a supporter of a well-made film, I do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries, and most of all I enjoy and admire films that successfully "break the rules." And it is quite true that the director Pasolini violates rules movie set. But it is also my opinion that he does not violate them successfully or any actual point. <br /> <br /> work Pasolini visually jarring, but it is less a question of what is actually on the screen, than how it is removed, and the nervousness of his films seems less a matter of artistic choice than as a result of the amateur cinematography. This is true Decameron. Pasolini often prefers to use a non-actor, and while many directors have done a great result, under the direction of Pasolini has non-actors, as a rule, are non-actors. This also applies to the Decameron. Pasolini often includes images designed to shock, insult or otherwise confuse the audience. Such elements can often be used to amazing effect, but in the hands of such elements Pasolini rarely seems to really contribute anything to the film. This also applies to the Decameron. <br /> <br /> I was given to understand that there are many people who love, even addicted to films of Pasolini. However, I have never met any of them, and I've never been able to do anything about Pasolini and his work, which made the reason for this sympathy or admiration understandable for me to read. Judging him only from his works, I'm of the opinion that it was in fact an amateur filmmaker who does not "break the rules", so much to choose from, both because of lack of skill - and that was initially applauded by intellectuals of his time for the "existential audacity ", thereby confirming its just to bad habits as a filmmaker. I believe that his work tedious, unimpressive and pretentious. And this is also true of the Decameron. Also, unfortunately, the truth almost every movie Pasolini it was my misfortune to endure.
