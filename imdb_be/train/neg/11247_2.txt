This movie was way overhyped. Many viewers who thought it was "strange" to be in the old school films, cause the entire film is set in the past. At first I thought that the film was just showing something from the past, so I expect that dreamy lost as lighting on the characters to go through, but it's only going to. Basically it was a movie tries to mix the future with the past, i 2 is not mixed very well in this film, even with special effects. You can actually see the blue screen actors have worked with. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this film made, so that there are no grounds for criticism, to inflate the film says, "is the greatest film ever made." It's just shit on a stick. It did not help that the storyline was sooo crappy. I do not understand why Hollywood would agree this film made, and I do not understand how the actors / actresses in this film wants to be in a film like this. It's almost as if all read the script and forgot to read the fine print ... "This will all be done on the computer." It was a film that was supposed to be in the film network, because there was nothing revolutionary about this movie. I am very upset with him for the payment of money to see it. Whatever you do, do not waste time and money on this film today or tomorrow.
