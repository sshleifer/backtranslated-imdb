This is the worst piece of shit I've seen lately. There is nothing good in this movie. The plot is just stupid, dialog boxes do not have any meaning, humorous scenes never anything about the real humor never heard of. Actors just do not play, the worse they do not even try. The script several, which is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this film, the fighting. They are well-choreographed, as one would expect from the guys in Hong Kong, and the only reason to watch Prince Sun. Although I believe that the battle just have to fill the empty space so that the writers do not have to worry about thinking about the storyline. However, this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end. Avoid it if you're not a fan of the Dragon Lady Cynthia.
