I am one of millions of them-that addicts around the world, and just watched the episode that started it all, on the British Channel 5. It is interesting to think that emerged from this so-so movie, and I can only wonder who saw a huge potential «Columbo» and added all the little touches that make this such a wonderful and classic series. However, this film is not as good as everyone else (for heavy and patronizing the last episode of the British series except). If Columbo has been made in accordance with the initial "pilot" is, of course, I would not go for very long, or being watched and loved all over the world. In this film, Lt Columbo smartly dressed, drives a normal car, have a partner, is not talking about his alleged relatives, and come across as a very aggressive. There's also none of the chemistry of cat-and-mouse game between Columbia and "villain". Watchable, but only for the novelty of seeing how Columbo began.
