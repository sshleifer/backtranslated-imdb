This film does not encourage children to be better and have a better relationship as a family film should, and it will not be a family in any case, because there are some things in it that children should not see. Not the best film ABC Family, if you ask me. If there were fewer sexual themes in the film, then perhaps it would be better. Hollywood does not do anything to make the film better, adding in sexual situations. There really is no reason for them. At least, this TV movie. I would not want to spend money on this garbage, surrendering it. If you have other things to do than watch this movie, please go to them.
