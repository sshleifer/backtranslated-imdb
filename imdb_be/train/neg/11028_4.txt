Close to the very beginning, after it was found that the outlaw John Dillinger (Warren Oates), a selfish tyrant, another thug with a 1930 driven in the farmhouse, surrounded by FBI. Secondly, in the command of Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), examines the situation, stick a lit cigar in his mouth, raises two loaded .45 caliber automatics and stalks off into the distant house alone. Bang, bang, bang. Purvis overlooks one of the house, carrying a female hostage, the villain dead. All at risk. <br /> <br /> If you are enthusiastic about these stories of Red Riding Hood, it should have considerable appeal. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is as much fun as it is meaningless. Pretty Boy Floyd meets his demise dramatically. Numerous violations of the civil code. Many shoot outs with automatic rifles and pistols. Blood all over. <br /> <br /> In a story stinks. Few remember Porvis FBI hero, partly, I think, because of his name. Porvis? We all remember the J. Edgar Hoover, who shot Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the fight for the public's attention, though. <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by John Milius. He's a guy, he wrote in his contract that if any of the animals to be shot during one of his works, it must be assigned to the shooter. Milius is the guy ended gun freak who was Teddy Roosevelt Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War, shouting quotations from Henry V -. "St. Crispin's Day" and all that <br /> <br /> Exciting, yes, and complete garbage. "I knew that I would never take him alive, and I do not try too hard, not one." That is, kill them all and let God sort them out. <br /> <br /> You will just love it.
