I'll start to apologize filmmakers everywhere to use the term "director", "film" or "film" in this regard, but "criminal" and "crimes against humanity", it seems a bit steep. <br /> <br /> The writing :. pathetic <br /> <br /> directorial :. pathetic <br /> <br /> action :. pathetic <br /> <br /> cinema too inappropriate for words. <br /> <br /> technical skills, which are used for the assembly of this atrocity .: NONE AT ALL <br /> <br /> This piece of waste can hardly be called a movie. Most home family films come together to make this distinction than revenge Quest. No, it's just a jumble of 10 cars caught on video. <br /> <br /> We will miss the plot in this review, because there are too many holes, which will be covered at one time. Let's just say that it stinks worse than the rest of the film. To call the current one-dimensional to give them credit. What little there is, is disgusting to begin with, and did much worse than horrible video editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this brutality, though, except for the section would have to be the result ... or rather, lack of it disturbing. There are no gaps in the gun, no flashpots, and the fact that there were some sound effects were either action "guns" sounds, or they have been generated in the mouth (yes, you read that right). The director actually had the gall to write "shhh" sound for the elevator door; I think he felt it made them sound more futuristic It must be installed in 2031, in the end it does not explain the sound he created the mouth for.. fist fight scenes, however. <br /> <br /> If that was not bad enough, the sound quality is terrible (he was just using a microphone that was installed on the camcorder, and it shows), the use of weapons-grade sound was almost worse than not using any sound at all. The sound effects highlight They are from the rest of the soundtrack, like a drunken yak herd of sheep, and they are just as clumsy Picture this:. The bad guy enters the office building to find their prey One woman begins to work in fear He raises the gun (Uzi).. and shakes it. We hear the sound, which is clearly not an ultrasound. a woman runs away from the camera, and suddenly a blood bag (only 1) blows on the back (it seems that she was surprised paintball), she falls flat on her face. <br /> <br /> Note pretend that my description makes too much equity in the mediocrity of the actual sequence. <br /> <br /> in the other sequence, one of which is almost but not quite- makes the movie quite funny to watch, there in the hallway, the bad guy is driving good guy and the house, it protects down the stairs, shaking his plastic uzi all the way. You can duck; there badly timed sound effects were flying everywhere. <br /> <br /> I've got Alan DeHerrera can not be closed in the conception of this train wreck, but he did not follow through all the way to the editing and release it if there is any justice, there is bound to be some food there with his name on it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see this piece of industrial waste and I would strongly advise IT- sure to look for the entire scene of lifted almost verbatim from Bladerunner and radio AM, which doubles as a rule. Try not to focus too much on the site; it will only hurt you more if you do. <br /> <br /> 0 stars 10. And it is to be generous.
