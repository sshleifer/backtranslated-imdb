No matter how well meaning his "message" - the film is not terrible did Trainwreck - horrible actions limped camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and remove the stutter - it is lousy at it. You are looking at the extras on the DVD and the way in which he has a camera to follow him around - he just sucks it - he likes to be the center of attention. He is a bad actor - it reminds me of another arrogant film director - Eric Shaffer. Some, like the bark of this film were shown in urban youth centers and New Age churches - where people are looking for the damaged reinforcement and attention to the most talk about how film touched them, and maybe it did - but the film itself is a jerk, predictable and juicy.
