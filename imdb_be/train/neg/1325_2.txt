Richard Dreyfuss, really, in this film, but in a fairly small portion. He is not "obsessed" director - he is the business manager / accountant group. Even the box describes the film inaccurately. There's no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as advertised, when one does not use the term "erotic" rather loosely. I would not consider watching the movie without Richard Dreyfuss, being in it as a main character. I could, but if I knew that the famous 60-anthem, Leonard Cohen «Suzanne», was the artistic influence. In addition to short pronunciations lines from the end of James Joyce's "Ulysses", and interesting visual reference to the late Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal" I found it a poor attempt to combine symbolic elements and moods are immortalized in the film "Last year at Marianbad» and «Andalusian Dog ". If you like the idea of ​​the eccentric art troupe, there are many superior films from« Bye, Bye, Brazil "on« Cecil B. dementia. "
