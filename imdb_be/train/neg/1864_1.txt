I can not be a critic, but here's what I think about this movie. Well, just watched the movie on Cinemax, and first of all I must say how much I hate the scene I mean come on what makes a snowman frightened but young children, and secondly it is quite bloody, but I bet, as the film is so low budget they probably used the ketchup so my critical voices IS THE BOMB !!! nice try and continue to be sucked in twice.
