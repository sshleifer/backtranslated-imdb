It is his merit-x; Morvern Callar is and dignity and disappointment. She is so mysterious, so original. Whether it is her method of dealing with the pain of the lost one that makes it this far and not-Relatable? Or she, as one reviewer called it revolutionary? Personally, I would call it dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern completely weaning itself. Placing your boyfriend without thinking about informing the families or to use the money he had given her for a proper burial, she selfishly throws on a trip to Spain. It seems so devoid of personal greed bar against people. The only element that allows the audience to see the human side of her by her close friend, she takes a rest with her. While the rest of her girlfriend dumped and Morvern has nothing that connects it to mankind. She might as well have killed herself. <br /> <br /> Despite managing to Spain look grim and fresh, as the United Kingdom directed by arrows were lovely, light and color made the film is visually stunning. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame that the film has nothing in it that keeps the interest. This is slightly more than 90 minutes, but it feels a lot more. They manage to make Morvern seem interesting to grab your attention, but nothing to do with it just to push it away from you even to the point where you do not care about the characters or the film.
