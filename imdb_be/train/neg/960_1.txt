Dear. I was so disappointed that the film was just a rip-off Japanese Ringu. Well, I believe that the US has made their version of it as well, but at least it was open remake. So, so sad. I love to watch movies Filipino and know some great things can come out of such a small country, so I can not believe that this was bound to happen. Claudine and Kris are great names out there, wondering, they will be linked to plagiarism. For any aspiring filmmakers out there in the Philippines: You do not have to bend down so low as to make money. There are many movie lovers who watch movies, Filipinos put out and enjoying them!
