There is no way to avoid comparisons between the Cat in the Hat and the Grinch who stole Christmas, so let this part of the journey. First of all, let me say that I think that the Grinch has been underestimated and underrated film. The cat was ... well, just awful. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly committed to over the top, outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell to his old tricks. <br /> <br /> Why, why, why Mike Myers ?? The children could care less, and demographic Austin Powers is not going to spy on this film. So what was in the studio thinking? <br /> <br /> The cat was also apparently associated with Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why New York Accent? Not entirely consistent with what Dr. Seuss never wrote. Myers even allowed to enter his Scottish chip. I wonder how many different voices of the director and the studio tried to edit previously they just gave, and said, "as long as you do not say fahklemptÂ», you can maintain their accents. "Meyers never give up, to find any comfort, either with the costume, makeup, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> jokes that almost was rude and inappropriate age. If Myers raises garden hoe and delivers to the camera: "a dirty ho", all but the shot missed the rim, and even that would not help <br /> <br /> The same people who created the "Whoville. "Obviously, he had a hand in the creation of the city and home to the" Cat ". Sets and props were very attractive, giving the viewer a much-needed distraction from the poor writing, direction and Myers. <br /> <br /> There was some fun was with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in the movie based on the classic Dr. Seuss, and stayed true to the genre. <br /> <br /> Call the SPCA. This cat must be sterilized and will never be allowed to play again. Please, please, not a sequel.
