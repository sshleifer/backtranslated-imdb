This disorder is so bad that not even qualify as horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon talent is completely wasted in this film. She was not even a villain. The rest of the actors look like porn copycats and the story is so lame I will not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip to the credits to hear the band's future TwoMarlowe perform «Better Than sex" is only 80 candy disco song. Nice to the tempo of the song Gambleing & Sex. Way more interesting than the «Bleed». Let's just say, if one has the equipment to copy the video, but only decides to record a song at the end of the movie, you have to actually «BAD» film.
