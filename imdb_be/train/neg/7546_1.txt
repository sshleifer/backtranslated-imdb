I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage, and I never thought that it would work on a film like this. I could not believe the other reviews, and I thought it should not be bad to see it at least once ... but believe me, it is. <br /> <br /> I have not seen an old movie. .But why they want to remake a film like this. The very basic idea of ​​a good horror movie, or it must have a very clever script, or it has to be as clear. This film does not fall into either of those and only remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie in the hope to get interesting at some point, but he never does. <br /> <br /> So this film is a big no no for both fans of horror films, as well as for fans of Cage. You could probably, for this show on television.
