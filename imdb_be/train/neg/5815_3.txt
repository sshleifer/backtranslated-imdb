I'm really looking forward to this movie based on a preview and press it got, but after seeing it I was terribly disappointed. Slums is completely unfunny film mixed with a type Solond disturbing family reality SANs Todd brand of humor. The history stretches along and each scene is worse than in the past. Maybe I missed the point, but if this film is an example of the experience of growing up every girl, I'm glad to be a man.
