After a very entertaining presentation by Mr Brosnan as a cad in "The Tailor of Panama" (which I rate 10/10 on all fronts: casting, acting, script, story editing, tempo, music, emotional impact, etc.), I enthusiastically anticipated this film. I was very disappointed. This script does not read the movie vulgar to be vulgar, bankrupt in every way that "The Tailor of Panama" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater, waiting for the "good side"; he never came. I neither laughed nor cried, although one line of dialogue made me smile. Worth $ 7? Hardly.
