I saw this step a few years ago in the Central Festival in Florida film, if I remember. I liked it, he showed a lot of potential. I think most people here will explode this film, because the film seemed to be limping along (by his own admission director at the official website - short was exhibited as a "rough cut"). <br /> <br /> But, nevertheless, it was a good-natured comedy. I think that many people are trying to read too much into a comedy. All they have to do is make you laugh - that's all. I did just that on his show, so get on this level. Just my 2 cents anyway.
