This movie sucks from start to (especially) at the end. You probably will not get the "t worse, drama, story, picture, camera work, and so on, it's all bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But this is what makes it "big" watch, this will give you more than enough good laughs. The worse, the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no clue what so ever about what these people thought that making this film. Serious Viking movie? History damn funny, this is more like a comedy in disguise, such as the Mafia, is also pointless, but damn funny. <br /> <br /> And pay attention to the very end of the movie ... Ukhum.
