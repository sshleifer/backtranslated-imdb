With critics, I expected more from this film, and Tamara Jenkins. History simply bent along and does not seem to be a point or area. And I think that it's hard not to believe that the 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or not) will be so filled with the receipt of loss of virginity "over with." Maybe I'm too young to tie (I was four years old, in 1976), but I did not have any problems connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in love and Life is beautiful, and I was not alive for any of these parameters. The cast is very good, but, unfortunately for them, the script does not Alow them to attract an audience. In general, the slum had their moments, but if you do not yearn to remember over the halter tops and socks tube, I'd say skip this one.
