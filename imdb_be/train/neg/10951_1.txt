I have no idea what idiots made this film Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1999, because it was disgusting! I actually looked at all the things simply because I could not believe someone would do such a useless film. There's nothing interesting story, the characters lack depth, and there is no attempt to provide any setting with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to spend 2:00 of his life, watching this film, do not forget to bring something to throw, because the cinematography just someone running around with a handheld camera, and half the time you can not even see the main objects. This style has been used much more successful in such films as "The Blair Witch Project" because it creates intrigue. In the Rosetta, no plot and no suspense to which this style lend anything. I should have known better when he came on at 2:00 in the morning, he's going to be awful.
