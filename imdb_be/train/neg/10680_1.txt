Spoilers ahead <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's just. There is not a sacrificial quality of the film. The first 10 minutes is difficult - they actually lead you to believe that this film is shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat. Instead, you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while viewing stolen and badly made scenes work without any organization. The lake was funny, he looked like an aquarium, and had the same plant in different parts of the lake. Symbols indicate their advanced teleportation powers, for example, Alex Thomas, who fall into the lake (drunk), and then end with a boat in the bay. Angie Harmon put a worthless job, Kate, made worse by the space-time continuum, razor- dialogue, which seems to have been written at the last minute a fifth grader. An example of this would be when she said, "torch" in such a stupid way that it shows the threshold of how much the human body can falter before it snaps in half. Finally, the editing of the film was by far the most bizarre and monstrous, that I have ever seen. It was like a bunch of chimps were cameramen, who were given cameras scientists. An example of this would be if we suddenly get a close-up headlamps on Alex's car. I would bet that there was very little time to edit this movie. The ending was completely harmless. The authors have tried to explicitly create a kind of mysterious storyline that made the audience said, "Oh, yes!" Instead, we're left to watch some dumb pictures of spider, which somehow fits into the storyline. Unfortunately, there is no one in millions of prospects out there who could save the film from being a piece of shit festering. <br /> <br /> I give it 0.5 out of 10, 0.5 to be the fact that this film was recorded on film, rather than to become a picture book.
