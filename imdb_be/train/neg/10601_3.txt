This is the official sequel thriller '92 sci-fi. In the original, Van Damme was among several dead veterans of the Vietnam War revived to be perfect soldiers (Unisols). This is, I think, about ten years later, as Van Damme has a daughter that age. He is now working with the government in a secret installation to prepare the last Unisols - codenamed UNISOL 2500 for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: a super-computer on site (named Seth - like a snake in the «King Cobra» in the same year) is power crazy, takes command Unisols, and even upload your own computer brain in the new super-UNISOL body (Jai White). We look at the next stage of evolution, man! Most of Van Damme fights are one especially in view of UNISOL (Goldberg of The Wrestler), which just keeps on comin: drop him off a building - not good; Sun to run him down with a truck - do not go! Kill him, burn him - forgetaboutit! Much of the humor can be seen in how Van Damme is now obsolete and out-classed (he even graying at the edges). But, although it takes lickin he continues Kickin '! Most sequels of such pretty lame - a pale imitation of the original, and although it is one, of course, not a genius, he manages to be consistently interesting, especially if you are a pro-wrestling fan.
