This film seems to be misinterpreted. There may be a morality without Christ. Poeple of other religions, I believe, can go to heaven. I am a Catholic who goes to church every week, but I do not agree with the Christian arrogance. This is the worst time travel movie I've ever seen, and I have seen Timeline.
