Ben & Arthur ish was 10. Sam Mraavich written, directed, watched and produced this film. Sam had to give his idea a good writer, director, and left acting for someone else who could act. is a good example of a person having control over all products. there was no one to tell him, "Sam is bad, very bad." <br /> <br /> actor Jamie Brett GABEL was the only good point, but it could be much better with a good director, and best actor to work with. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad, I think Sam Mraavich must be tied to a chair and forced to watch this movie (twice). acting and direction was so bad that the film has been transformed into a comedy. You just had to laugh, and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> A second good point .... it would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you quit watching a movie and pay more attention to your date!
