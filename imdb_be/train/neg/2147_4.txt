Original relaxing hours with some truly memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the continuation, but not the worst of the DTV sequels completely lacks spark. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the lack of history. How Magical World Belle, the characters speak through a series of vignettes. Magical world, while a little better, do manage to make a mess of history. Between vignettes, we see a mouse at work, and I personally think that the antics JAQ and Gus is redemptive merit of this film. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best, Cinderella getting used to to be a princess. This is the best, because the mice were they funny here. Worse vignettes, when Jacques turns into a man pretty at times, but has the disadvantage of fantasy. Last vignette when Anastasia falls, and cute. The problem was that I could not imagine Anastasia friendliness with Cinderella, I thought she was angrier of the stepsisters. It has also been overshadowed by a rather funny story about Lucifer fell in love with Pompon <br /> <br /> musical accompaniment was very pleasant to listen to., However, I hated these songs, they were really uninspired and nothing like the beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original. <br /> <br /> The characters were the strongest development here. Cinderella at the same time care has lost its sincerity, and a lot of its charm from the original, although it is to wear some very pretty clothes. Duke had some really funny moments, but they were not enough to save the film, also with Prudence and king. As I have said, the mice were redemptive merit of the film, so as soon as they have contributed to the film wit. I must also say that the animation is surprisingly colorful and above average voice acting and well. <br /> <br /> In general, my dear, if unoriginal sequel, which has been marred by a lack of songs and story. 4/10 mice, voice, animation and some beautiful dresses.
