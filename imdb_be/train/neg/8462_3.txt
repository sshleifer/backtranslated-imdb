"Toreador" was made in 2000, but has now been released on video in 5 years, for whatever reason. I wonder why? Maybe: Intricate plot incomprehensible dialogue Oliver said Martinez, editing and annoying? It should be. I think the story was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacques (Olivier Martinez) to go on a mystical journey. They meet a lot of eccentric characters and avoid some evil, too. The film looks great and has a lot of style but no substance. Most of the movies, when you try to thin, not to attract attention to the unanswered events of the plot, and weak special effects <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by a few :. Willem Defoe therein for 2 minutes at most.
