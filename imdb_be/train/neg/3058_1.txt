When I was a kid in the 1970 seat theater had children matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (anyone remember those?). They showed this thing one year during the Christmas holidays. Me and some friends went to see him. I was expecting a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was awful duplicated (you might say) and truly awful film. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician (do not ask me what those two are doing in the same film) to fight Satan (some joker in the silly devil costume complete with horns!). Images were me cringing in his place. I have always found the Santa ghost, to begin with, so that did not help. The guy in the suit has not helped Satan. But what really horrified me were wooden reindeer reins, pulled by Santa's sleigh. If he got them, and a terrible sound, which they have done, and movement - I remember that nightmares about those things! All these years later, I still remember leaving the theater more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends were like frightened them too. I just saw an ad for it on TV and all those nightmares roaring back. This is a terrible, disturbing little Christmas movie that will probably scare the pants of any young child who sees it. Avoid this one - if you really want to punish your children. This is the first
