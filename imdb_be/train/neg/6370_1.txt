For some reason, TV Guide has given the two and a half stars, plus Faye Dunaway in it, so it definitely looked like something to see. Has, oh, my, this may be the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever. With his terrible actions (every time she asks the boy what had happened to him, I shouted to the TV, "I can not act!" When she asks him what he wants, I cry "I need acting lessons!" To an incredibly bad dialogue ( "Give me back my organs!"). <br /> <br /> And De Palma wannabe ending, too, it was only badly. I wanted to like it. Dunaway is one of the best actors when either. And the production values ​​were pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Wowzers, it was me laugh, laugh!, most of the time. <br /> <b r /> do not even bother with curiosity, it was my first mistake. Staying with it was determined my second, third and fourth.
