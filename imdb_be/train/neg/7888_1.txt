Nothing about the film do not know what it was based on the salable book.Tried guessing from the opening scenes, it would be on the assumption treasures and death list.That lasted about 15 minutes, when I got a sneaking suspicion that the film was crap .I'll not bore you with how bad the plot and the action was, but the one who gave him more than the two stars should work for makers.I movie watched until the hero does not jumped in his corvette slip into hospital.He had it on his suit, shirt and tie, arrived at the hospital in jeans and / shirt.Couldn't even get the right to succession. I got a Christian theme, it is difficult to miss.
