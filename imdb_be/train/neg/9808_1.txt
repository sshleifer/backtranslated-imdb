Worst show I've ever seen. The story of a group of teenagers who, for some inexplicable reason, have the supernormal, and if they use some special tools, they become amazing, ill-designed costumes. Action if they do not appear in the late suits well. Definitely not good, but not the worst actor I have ever seen. However, when wearing their costumes, action actors go from bad to worse; much, much worse. Hyper-animated idiots there are many unnecessary movements that they make. Even if they say they look like they're seizures. Villains sillier Rangers. Each episode, some weak, stupid villain comes with some sort of plan to destroy the Rangers. Then he / she sends power hyper-animated aliens attack the Rangers. Rangers then initialize their 10-hour transforming animation, they destroy the aliens. Then, poorly designed villain who can be either an armored villain who actually looks and acts the evil humanoid ladybug-like creature with tubes attached to his back, which shows clear signs of mental retardation. Power Rangers fight off villain, the villain turns into Godzilla, whether rain or nuclear missile cloud (so they shoot a nuclear weapon at the creatures and beings are transformed into a giant). Rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper-animation and call their Zords, which, obviously, toys, show that manufacturers use special effects to make them look real. Rangers win, the villain angry, they all teach "valuable" lesson and the show ends. That's all. Twenty-five minutes brainwashing, fake kung fu fighting.
