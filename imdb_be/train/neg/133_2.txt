Well, the reason to see it in a movie, it was a preview, I'd never seen this terrible teenage slasher movie. I mean we did not have enough of this yet? Yelling and Scary Movie, at least as they took them seriously! The plot sucks, and the action is the worst I've seen. (Only Godzilla can be compared, which is also the only film in competition is the worst that I've seen in a movie with this.) <br /> <br /> There are so many plot holes in the story, and the girls are so much alike that you do not do this even now, someone was killed, and who has not. (And do not bother.) The only one I knew in advance was Dennis, and she was the least talent actress I've never seen this poor foundation for the film. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this in the movie as possible. (2/10)
