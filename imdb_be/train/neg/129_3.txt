I Am Curious really two films in one - half of them are sexually experimental side of the Lena and the other half of her curiosity with the political / socialism. Regardless of the intentions of the director, the two networks are not very together. The director should have just stuck with the romantic side of Lena and made a separate film for the policy. There is a strange mixture of political / military marches, Dr. King, serious political interviews, slapping his chest and pubic hair. The film feels more fictional documentary than a movie. In addition to interesting sex scenes, you'll miss a dry watch this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think that the nude / sex scenes are exaggerated for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. Distributed nudity is a major distraction from what the story is. I think that the cast did an excellent job, however. They played their roles believable. There is little in the more-topness I used to see in American films during this time.
