This film is often extrapolates quantum mechanics, in order to justify the senseless ideas, capped statements such as "we all create our own reality." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the people, the reality is that true for all of us, not just the gullible. <br /> <br /> idea that "everything is possible" is not tenable upon closer inspection: if possible, in spite of the things that something of this is possible, and so nothing is possible. This leads to a post-modern nonsense, which is nothing but an attempt to humiliate the truth, so that all ideas, reasonable and foolish, are equal. <br /> <br /> quote visionary Philip K. Dick, who has put it so well, "the reality is that when you stop believing in it, does not go away."
