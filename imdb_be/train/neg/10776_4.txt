When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought that it could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts, and all we talked to said they loved it. <br /> <br /> We were misled, in spades. <br /> <br /> For my part, I felt the character of Billy Crystal was extremely one-dimensional and do very little for the film. Of course, he cracked a couple of good jokes, but as the character he has done nothing but taking up space. <br /> <br /> And the poor Julia Roberts. In the past, it shows that it plays well as a strong-willed, self-determination lady. In this film, it seems very depressed and there was very little fire. It's not Julia Roberts, that my wife likes to watch. <br /> <br /> Well, if I were to find one good thing, it would have to be Christopher Walken. Now this is entertainment. But, just as Billy Crystal, almost did not show anything of his character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of mad laughter little redemptive value to go see. But if you are looking for intelligent, romantic comedy, this is not your movie. It is not higher.
