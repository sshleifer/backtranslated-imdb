First of all, if you'r supporter comics, well, you will be very disappointed, I'm sure! Low budget movie !!! Largo should be Serbian in the comics, and now he suddenly becomes the Croatian, pfff! producers of chicken, he gave spices and courage comic (By the way, in the film, his father says, Serbian and Croatian, he says ... lol). Amazing N.Y. Winch building becoming a common medium of a small yacht in H.K. Cute Largo becomes a kind of unshaven Tzigan / Turkish guy that look. Freddy cool «Scarface» pilot gets a little fat, out of shape, the sad, the average guy. Simon, a good friend of Largo, does not exist at all !? He gave some pepper! Largo did not throw knives at all, but only some snakes look ... The whole story is confused and looks pretentious TV movie. French directors and producers, if you have no money, ability or technology properly adapt the comic, please stick to some romance, shot in Paris. Very very bad movie, a good thing, I just take it off, do not count on me to see a continuation (if any!).
