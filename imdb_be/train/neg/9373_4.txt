A kind of charisma Koslek Martin brings a certain credence to the nature of disturbed artist. He fills his dialogue with an odd sense of realism that makes Marcel sculptor convincing individually. The character manages to come across as a real person, rather than as a typical B movie villain. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the storyline to write home about, and many scenes are dull. What makes his work a strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as vines. talkative, philosophical Kosleck contrasted with the low key Hutton, monosyllabic approach. Creeper character is not developed far beyond the base level of the monster, but Hutton offers undeveloped opportunities and raises questions about its history. <br /> <br /> This film was Shock Theater a lot when I was a kid, so I have a certain nostalgic love for her. It is worth to see once in any case, for those who love horror movies of the forties.
