After reading very good reviews about this movie I thought I would give it a watch and after very disappointed with the film I thought I would give it your own review. This is my first ever so bare with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would scratch the horror of the genre, whatever the extent to which this horrible or frightening to a lesser extent (except for a few weak attempts to make you jump, unfortunately, one of whom worked for the me.) I would say that calling this film a thriller pushes him, as I was not particularly excited, like! A film about the spoiled mischievous girl who fainted several times. At this time she visits the house, which she painted, she decides after each visit, to add something else to the house to make it a little more alive is one of the hallmarks of being a boring little boy, who is also sick actually. She is friends with the boy, she realizes that her imaginary world that she has created is actually better than the real world, it is. As long as it does not add to it consistently away to the house of his father, in connection with misdrawing her father is evil, and it and the boy has to escape from its clutches. <br /> <br /> I think that its going to be a little softer version of A Nightmare on Elm Street, but more like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, my generous 3/10, we hope, to stop at least one of you viewing this monotony!
