As an ardent fan of the books by George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman, I was looking forward very much to see on the big screen screams when the film was first released. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before returning to see it again, but it was no better the second time. Mr. Fraser is an extremely skilled writer, but I'm not a fan of his film script with Richard Lester. Tendency to farce spoiled "Three Musketeers" for me, and the same applies here. For me, the whole tone and feeling of the film wrong. The Flashman books deafening funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. There is a lot of seriousness in the way of adventure, which Flashman is - in the end, it is involved in dangerous situations. It is transmitted in the novels, but does not transmit at all in the film because of its comedic style. It is a huge shame, as this can have a great film, if there was a more accurate adaptation of the book of style. When I first read this book had to be removed, the article says that the film was to star Oliver Reed. I was happy that I was the embodiment of Reed Flashman. How I would have loved to see him in this role. Malcolm McDowell good actor, but it does not fit into a visual image created by Flashman books (too skinny look! Flashman, is supposed to be a big guy strapping). Neverheless Reed were perfectly Bismarck. What kills the film is that it is made in the form of comedy. The only scene in which he creates the atmosphere of the book scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet (Tom Bell). A great shame, because the production values, costumes, scenery, etc. fine casting and usually excellent - just about everything in the film are well matched to each Malcolm McDowell. Perhaps superintendence Richard Lester was responsible for the film, as the recent adaptation of the radio "Flash For Freedom", adapted from Mr. Fraser worked very well. Maybe one day we can see Flashman do justice on the screen.
