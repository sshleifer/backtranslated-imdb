Program John Goodman was pretty awful, but this thing just stinks. One and united in this mess that made me smile recognize the voice of Patrick Starfish as frosty. History hopeless, written by someone who has the distorted memories of childhood rebellion, but never received any adult sense of perspective in the coming years. Paranoia runs a dark world that these characters inhabit. All this is unpleasant, and for no reason. The plot is predictable, but the show rolls on the other unexplained unrelated scenes to another such nonsensical way, there is no pleasure in viewing it. The worst part is that no one in the crew of the production does not give up, never seen snow!
