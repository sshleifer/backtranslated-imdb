The theme is certainly compelling: a group of people take their love of the game one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and locks. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon, deep into our collective need to "get away" from reality and sometimes mundaneness of our existence - something that almost everyone can relate to. Symbols are predictable mixture of Lord of the Rings Star Trek nerds and hobbyists. This is enough to get most people to watch. However, very soon the film turns into the field of view of insiders with Wargaming with almost stereotypical flipping the nose to the audience, who "do not get it." The filmmakers seem to take the subject Wargaming, and this particular one, waaaaay too seriously, not once in a while recognizing humor and pleasure in making a film about adults drssing in medieval transmission and pounding each other with foam swords. It is very difficult for those who are not sitting at your computer for 7-10 hours a day playing the game or the latest star destroyer designed to understand what the characters say and why should we even care. However, the creators of the film does not seem to care about the choice to concentrate solely on the subject of the game, rather than build a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand. In addition, the characters themselves are not so convincing, and you'll quickly get tired of them: a big no-no if you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
