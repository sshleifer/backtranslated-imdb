This is the stencil covered and the worst romantic comedy I have ever seen. Each scene is worthy of perverts and two lead actors - Cory and Danny are soo annoying. Measles is very stupid and naive and did not have to listen to false promises Denis. <br /> <br /> Neve Campbell and murderers of Urban Legend is the only redeeming quality to this poor attempt to film. Denis (Dean Paras) looks in his late thirties, and the girl he is trying to sleep - Measles looks as if she was still in college <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this film is called Too Smooth ;. There is nothing smooth about the movie at all. 1/10 Avoid
