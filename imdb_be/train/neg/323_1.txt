This movie was so bad that I could not sit through it, do something else. There was no plot and no sense. I was completely sad and film about stand up comedian, I could not remember an anecdote or a funny line worthy of description. Politicians who do not have the charisma says technical jargon may not be less interested. <br /> <br /> So how is it done? There are quality controls in the film? Watching girls in bikini was the only entertainment during this horrible experience. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, which became popular and appeared in fine comedies managed to survive after such exposure. He was not funny in the slightest degree in this film, it proves that the email is vital for an effective comedy.
