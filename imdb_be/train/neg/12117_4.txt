You may say to yourself, "Don Johnson, like Elvis? Can it work? Is it possible? It seems like a terrible choice for me, but maybe I should have an open mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he can pull it off. "<br /> <br /> No! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he was terribly Elvis. He is too short, too weak a voice too sharp features. .. well, you've already imagined how bad it will be. Add to this a fake black wig and heavy-handed eye liner and mascara, and it's a big fat embarrassing mess. <br /> <br /> the best thing I can say that since Johnson's action is decent and, since its incarnation so far, after a while you do not even think of it as more than Elvis. you see it as some kind of another crazy pop star instead. Then, at this level, the film becomes watchable. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist also not perfectly cast as high, beauty queens, Linda Thompson. But it is attractive in its own right and plays role with honesty, elegance and intelligence, we have come to expect from all their roles. There may be too much intelligence in its performance .. you must have some kind of dope dope dope stick with abuse <br /> <br /> There's nothing new in this story; We have heard it many times. If you are looking for new information or enlightenment, you will not find it. He told how a love story - unrequited one: Linda Elvis Elvis for drugs.
