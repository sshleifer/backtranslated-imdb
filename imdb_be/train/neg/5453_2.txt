Well, I caught this movie halfway through, but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially the guy who is now teachers and Book Group, although at least he proved that he can do if he wants to! (The part where someone has a heart attack stands as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of action scripts and general plausibility) This clearly shows how the cash in trafficking, but while it's not the best movie ever, at least the original and were actors whose delivery does not resemble that seriously, yet hopeless GCSE students try to get counted. Not so much as human trafficking, as a bit of a car accident!
