If there was a strange inversion Oscar Academy Awards Festival this film would have won it all. It has all the gods, great story, extreme special effects combined with extremely good acting skills and, of course, in every role there is a celebrity superstar. Well, it might be scenario if the world was on the opposite, but it is not. Instead it is the worst horror film ever made, not only bad actors, who seem to read scripts from a teletype with bad dyslexia, but very few special effects. For example, a devil costume (which, incidentally, is a must-see), which is one of the most fun I have ever seen. Every time I saw the red-and-black, the so-called monster on the screen, I could not hold back his laughter. And on top of things it looked like fun being transported by conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as I did. Check IMDB seeing that the film was released in 2003, there were fewer than five votes and thinking: - .. "Well, it's worth a shot, can not be so badÂ» <br /> <br /> Yes, it can <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to spend more words on this film.
