This is easily the worst film by Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott has a great director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, and totally miscast in a film about overly aggressive girl is going to the army. Very silly. And never one scene that is convincing in any case. It's really not difficult to make a film like this. The whole crew of the brand could be the idea of ​​just anyone. The authors do not have a lot of inspiration either; many senseless dialogues, which makes no sense at all; and some mindless action. I strongly recommend to stay away from this garbage. I hope that many talented people who are involved in this project to implement this type of film is not worthy of their attention, and that in the future they will work on a more honorable and more intelligent films than this useless mess.
