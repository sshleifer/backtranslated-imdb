Kalifornia alarming. I believe that there are no grounds for this story to be told. It is neither entertaining and has no social value. Technically, the film is very well made, shows the top rate and first class. The story takes place in the form of intrigues, who holds an interest. But shun sicken and decorum at the end of this film. I recommend anyone Kalifornia.
