Quentin Crisp once said that when things seem too pretty, romantic one. When things show unbearably gloomy, they are realistic. And if something gets ironic treatment, they are in place. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second categorization :. This director is clearly overdone make Spanish "Ken Loach" type of movie, without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that elevate Loach films from simple "depressing." Los-Lunes al Sol, just, just depressing. Things unrealistically gloomy. Characters final moments of suffering all culminate at the same point, and if the story is not grim enough, Aranoa washes story visually more with gray and muddy color palette. The films were ridiculously overvalued Goyas. The film, which shows empathy for the weaker people in society, in this case, an unemployed harbor, machine does not make for a good movie, although I would be the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This film is only possible to make me grow disinterested in their lives. In the 21 th century Spain, unemployed people do not live like beggars, and transport public toilets ferries are decent, and it's hard to find a bar with a small number of professional players and so little joy to be found in it. Leon de Aranoa, obviously does not have the slightest idea of ​​the class in Spain, and does not make it any good. Pretentious only conclusion that I can do. The scene in which the men watching a football match for free, has been copied from a film that deals much more "realistic" with the theme of "poverty" traps, namely: "Purely Belter", which is far more interesting, with sense of humor, and yet sad.
