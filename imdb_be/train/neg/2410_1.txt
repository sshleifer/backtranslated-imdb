Hood of the Living Dead and all other films directed these guys like they got together and filmed it with their friends who have zero talent one day, when they missed (line completely unexpected and inconclusive). I believe that 95% of amateur films and 90% of the home video shots better than the movie (although the similarities between them, justifying comparison). "Hey, let's see if anyone dumb enough to buy our movies!". I hope no one was not. My apologies to those who are involved in the Flick in this review a few harsh, but I was a dope who reads your fake testimonials and bought the film.
