Hull Foe tells the story of a boy who lost his mother and feels certain complex Oedepus later. <br /> <br /> This is something like 95 minutes long, but it is better tenfold. There's the same as an hour in the middle, where it makes the practice of climbing on rooftops, and habits in the church tower, like Quasimodo (only it is much less sympathetic). <br /> <br /> there is an amazing love story that involved doesn "t have anything to do with anything. She happens to look like his mother, but so what? We know that he misses his mother, is that the first ten minutes were about. They just had to put the beginning and end together, and it would be a suitable short film. Now it is a portrait of a character who does not change. He's a guy that stuff happens. The only active choice, he has the whole middle of the film, to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> There's also this whole Oedepus thing going on which, presumably, to make us reflect on their character. He paints his face, dress in women's clothes and wears a dead Badger on his head. Badger! You should see the end! He returns to his home of a badger on his head (and it is removed as a tacky horror movie) to kill the new wife of his father (which he had sex with in the beginning). And somehow they thought that it would not be interesting enough that they put some indie-punk music in the background. I must admit, though, I'm kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on the nose. It feels like the Mackenzie director / boyfriend / whatever is trying to show us that he also studied psychology in school. You are so smart! Thank you for these forgotten theory of why in our memories! You really dig! What Wallraff! Okay, so now I realized that this film is based on a random book, but in any case .. <br /> <br /> PhotoWise is sad. Many of the talking heads. Plus editor changed color from scene to scene, you know, cold and heat, etc .. why? It can be "Hull Foe» is both a function and a test film for color blind people. Or maybe they just thought that the drama will not be enough to tell us that he feels lonely, so they increased the blue, so that we actually get it. <br /> <br /> I do not even want to comment on the cliche indie-da-da-da cute image they are made in the presentation. And all the "cute" sex thing going on. All of this is an independent film clichés. But I recommend. I laughed more than a few times. Although it is really annoying to be a student film and see how crap it gets through the machine.
