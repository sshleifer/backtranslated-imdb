I read another review that suggested that the platoon was an endless cycle of sea infantry of killing people, killing, taking drugs and talk trash. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with this, because the film was actually more, but this way I can see that this person is trying to say :. it has no real story - that point I agree with <br /> <br /> This self-indulgent rock in its best. He really wanted to show not only how war leads to death, but as this is an extremely traumatic to the survivors. Unfortunately, the film seems to be on the "glory" that aspect and Finale simply too champagne, grand standing, Oscar hunt "let's create a strong image" for my taste. <br /> <br /> The problems I have with the stone and other directors of his ilk is that they do not understand, it's just a concept: depicting a scary bloody death of waste that the war does not prove or even reflect on what has been unfair or immoral war, we saw the same thing, there is. point with Iraq. In case you missed the point, let me tell you n AMA: if you saw how really bloody Second World War and how damaging it is to the life of the surviving soldiers, do you think it was an unjust war If this fact alone does not convince you that it was an unjust war, why depictions of horror? Vietnam should convince you that it was wrong to go to war in this case. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support America's decision to go to war in Vietnam, but I certainly do not subscribe to the the theory of "this war is wrong, because people were killed and injured." I do not think that the motivation is always the default radio, because war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> It says nothing about what the end or final big "turn" was a bit ridiculous. However, this is not the first stones eccentric departure. Wall Street was a great movie, until the last 30 minutes or so, when he made a horrible "wrong turn.Â» JFK, probably one of the few films, Stone made that actually ended very well. <br /> <br /> But it does not matter in this, because there was very little story to this point of the film revolves around. And that's why I gave him such a bad score. It was almost the story less and ultimately sad - if you do not fall for the generated sharpness.
