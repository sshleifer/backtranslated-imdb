Well, it is true, as an Orthodox woman who lives in Bora Park, I'm going to be a little biased against this film. Nevertheless, it seemed that the only purpose of Boaz Yakin in the making of this film was Orthodox-bashing. With our wigs, modest clothing and a separate living room, we have a fairly easy target already. Yakin has never made it past the surface. As a result, a film with a lot of holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yossi says Sonya from someone who loves him more than G-d, or their parents. Then he deliberately defies his father ordered that he did not swim because of his poor health. 2. Sonia turns over the circumcision of his son. Why Hasidic woman Mons has such a strong reaction? It is hard to believe that she never attended one before. Let's face it, even Reform Jews hold dear Brice ceremony today. 3. Mendel was sleeping during his chosson classes? It must satisfy the passion of his wife in bed, and refrain from kissing her on the street. Especially in the middle of a busy street in the Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel have been married for a year and he only now noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little hint - a marriage of convenience does not mean that she should take the first guy to her parents to install it with. It will not be the community, if the marriage does not work. 5. If Sonia really wants to get into the jewelry business that bad, she had to go through her lecherous brother-in-law. There are Orthodox women doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came off as a more plaintive than friendly. Instead, to take control of her life, she leaned back and waited for things happen, and then complained that she did not like the result. It is not standing in their midst; that pandering to the stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.
