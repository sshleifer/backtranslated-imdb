Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in the hype of characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice to the end Sellers career. The plot was very simplistic, and if done the right way, may have been treated well, but instead it was poorly executed. Part of the reason why this film has been so good beggar dialogue, cheap laughs, impulsive direction, and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete. <br /> <br /> action, on the other hand, was in fact the only thing that held back my interest for this mixed picture. I found Sellers drawing diabolical Manchurian brilliantly done, with a few lines that will be remembered. For example, there is a scene where Fu Manchu confused that there's henchman, in which he says: ". Oh, you all look the same to me," I hate to admit it, but I laugh with that line. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, a handful of strong supporting character really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the Backstabbing Constable David Tomilson Sir Roger Avary (his last film, not a way to end his career), and Sid ceasar (which gives a rather bizarre performance of Al Capone relative who works for the FBI). These symbols are also kept looking at me. <br /> <br /> Many were also good. Oriental design and English society in 1933 were shown to the elegance of this rags-of-a-picture. <br /> <br /> To be honest, my advice to you is to see the movie, if you're a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise, you'd better stop chewing aluminum foil.
