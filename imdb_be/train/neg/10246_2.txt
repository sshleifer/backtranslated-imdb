End of the World is an unprecedented film, which is surprising, since it has to be a complete destruction of the Earth. The protagonist is a scientist, I'm not quite sure what kind. He has two jobs in the government (?) The object is protected by four guards. His first job monitoring programs in space and from space (although it's actually more like a hobby, which he does when he is not working at work # 2). Job number 2 requires him to wear a protective suit and go into a dark room ... at least, that's the best that I can understand. Apparently, the "factory" is not a top-secret, as a scientist brings his wife. She hangs out (they are on the way to dinner) when it detects a message from outer space: Disruption Major Earth, repeated again and again. He says something about what the first message from space, he was never able to decipher; his wife tells him that they're going to be late for dinner. So they leave and go to the side (!?!). After a few moments, he recognizes that China suffered a major earthquake. From there, the film does not go anywhere ...! So, Christopher Lee in it, but it does not really help much. In addition, Lee gives a vague performance along the lines of its appearance in Howling II. This film is boring, but it has a fairly blunt items that you can suffer through it once, if you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade science fiction. In addition, there are a lot of footage of land destroyed.
