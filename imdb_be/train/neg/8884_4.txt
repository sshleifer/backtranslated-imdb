"Dominique" is one of those movies that the expression "slow as molasses," must have been invented for. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how many times we see Robertson walked down the stairs slowly, because he could hear someone playing the piano?). It almost paid off in the end, by a strange twist, which, unfortunately, followed by a second twist, which is a success only in leaving a bad taste in the mouth. Not a very enjoyable film.
