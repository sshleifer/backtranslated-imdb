Unfortunately all ,,, I know that it must be "art" film ,, but wow, they were handed out weapons to screening so that people can blow their brains rather than watching. Although the design stage and photographic direction was excellent, the story is too painful to watch. Absence track was severe. In loooonnnnng shots were too long. How long can you watch two people just sit there and talk? Especially if two people complain dialogue. I was really hard to just get through this film. The performances were great, but how many of those dark, dismal, uninspired, the material can take? The only thing that I liked, Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise, it was a rip-Bergman. And I'm not a fan of his either. I think anyone who says they used the 1 1/2 hours it ,, well, lying.
