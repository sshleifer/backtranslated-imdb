I found it to be a complete waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always shows a lack of creativity when creating a "straight to video" film - but to paraphrase the plot of the original film with the "new view" is a record low ... soon they will simply re-releasing the original films with new animations and new songs and call it the "new version of the film we all love." Nathan Lane unexpectedly returns to his role as Timon again. Timon and Pumbaa animated animals from the original "Lion King" world embark on a narrative journey, to tell us the original GIS Thorium as it actually happened ... like they did. <br /> <br /> Of course, Timon now the hero of the story, Yadda Yadda Yadda, blah blah blah ... <br /> <br / > musical sequence lame and animation crap. The vocal talents are great for video features, but then again, when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg and Nathan Lane to be anything real commercial substance? in general, if you liked the original, you'll hate it. It's a shame, because it is unfair to children and adults. And what about sums it up.
