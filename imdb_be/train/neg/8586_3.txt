What a disappointment ... admittedly, the best of the sequels, but the story is weak, rushed to the plot and the end result is simply a collection of set pieces, poorly implemented and fastened together amateurish. There are numerous continuity errors that conflict with the provocative original films, and the appearance of Darth Vader has been processed so scared that it might be a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead of cheese olive, which is derided for many years. I will not complain bottomless dialogue, as this Star Wars ... the original three films had style, the cult of feelings and cracking stories and strange dialogue added charm. In the prequel were minor attempts to make more money, and this lack of love manifests itself in spades. Utterly disappointing.
