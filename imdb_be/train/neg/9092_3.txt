Friz Freleng in «Speedy Gonzalez» was the second cartoon to show the main character after Robert McKimson in «Cat Tails for Two". In this cartoon, Speedy was an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth, but his second appearance had already been adopted well-known design. Although much looks more beautiful, Speedy never developed into a large part of the character. Grand slam, great speed and bad Mexican accent is not a classic make-up character, and that's pretty much all Speedy never had to go after him. However, daring mouse proved to be extremely popular, and went on to star in many shorts, including some really bottomless films of recent days in the studio. While these early Speedy shorts better than those later atrocities, in which he often (but oddly) paired with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired on the basis of predictable gags, usually based around chase similar formula. This self-titled episode, Speedy recruited some of the other mice to steal from the local cheese factory for them, which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat. Despite the fact that it brings the additional weight of a star turn in the animated film, Sylvester role here could just as easily have been filled by any other ordinary cartoon cat. His identity is undermined by his forced into predictable. unpretentious role of the pursuer. It has always been a problem in cartoons Tweety too, but Speedy makes even boring enemy because of its abhorrent audacity and inability to open his capture. Poor old Sylvester will have to appear next to Speedy for many years. Despite this, after a fairly basic formula and showing the minimum laughs, «Speedy Gonzalez» won an Oscar and well worth a star was born.
