This bottomless part of the story. It's about an hour in the film before we do a lot of what it should be about; Characters often mumbled incoherently; actions often seem to have no relation to each other; no one seems to care about who really killed the girl; a pair of frightening children to bathe in the waters, that seem threatening, but nothing happens; Irishman gets his fist in the face of one of his friends, without any reason ... to continue to be as boring as the movie itself. Only half an element of entertainment landscape photography; but who could point the camera at the Australian outback and get memorable images. Overall - a dull, incoherent, pretentious - and downright annoying to spend so much time viewer.
