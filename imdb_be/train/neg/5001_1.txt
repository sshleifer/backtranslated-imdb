I do not know why I am commenting on this stupid reality show I had to watch a few episodes (cable broadcasting marathon, when the air 5 episodes in a row or something, I did not watch the whole thing though.Only like three episodes), I was nine months pregnant and about to go to work every day.Maybe I'm just bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Britney, I really do.For all her money and fame, she seems to have very little meaning dignity.Or it egotistical to extreme.She married insignificance Federline (well someone can make a mistake) and the fact that she "starred" ge Something terrible show about their daily lives with him, where she puts the camera, where it feels like it, no matter when it is in someone's face or in the shower as Federline standing there. She was talking about her sex life, leaving nothing to your imagination, I do not care about me, but I can not help wondering how she feels about it now, when it divorced.And yes, I'm embarrassed for her .But I do not have be.She, seems to be living a fairly empty, shallow life though.I do not want to change her life, even if they could. Road kill the TV if you like.
