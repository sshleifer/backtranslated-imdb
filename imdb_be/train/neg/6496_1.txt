This movie was a disappointment. I'm looking forward to see a good film. I am a person who begins the movie and does not turn it until the end, but I force myself not to turn it off. <br /> <br /> TheOnly reason why I did not turn it off because I am a big fan of Christian Slater, and I would like to see him act in it. I was really speechless after I finished watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This film was one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Christian Slater Thanks for putting some humor in it. If you were not in this movie, I would have been sad with my mind. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins must adhere to the current. By the time the film is over, I do not even plot. I was so embarrassed and upset.
