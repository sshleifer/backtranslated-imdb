Hiya people, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie sucks actually. Think «Love Actually» in the opposite direction. Nothing fits quite right, nothing coherent, and, of course, nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a complete failure. As has been shown, however, there are three redeeming point about the potential of the movie distorted. <br /> <br /> A) star billing Jennifer Love Hewitt will be hordes of guys who served with affection view this is only a glimpse of a tiny Hewitt with a form fitting clothes. To tell you now, guys .... there are some promising scene .... but it is actually a weak eye candy. The "opportunities" are mitigated. However, I have observed all this a seducer at the next stage you know that ..... tickles! <br /> <br /> B) ending romantic and positive. And that it is contrary to the "top" urgent ..... so far for me was still a positive thing. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays amourous friendly guy ........ refreshing! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2.5, unfit your 10 or so dollars. <br /> <br /> 2/3's the way through, I was convinced, Jennifer Love Hewitt become the next legend erotic. Although I believe that back right now ..... it is heavily dependent on her next film. <br /> <br /> Yes, and the way her sister is stupid. Her husband path stupid ... and what the hell, it is the way stupid. <br /> <br /> The next time. can not wait for the next Love Actually with JLH!
