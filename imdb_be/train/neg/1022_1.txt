Starting with the poster (only involving Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the entire film was a hoax. One after the other stereotypes, this film was nothing - or nothing new, at least. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J to read your way through another cop movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, the story of a corrupt system in some city, all secretly support the backbone of business in the city, under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politician. On top of the all-powerful and legitimate organization called the Brotherhood, and guess what? they have a kick-ass crazy police shooting and beating at liberty - suspects, friends, you name it. Frat police are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that are expressed by the young and talented (!!!) told reporters. An hour later, after a series of incredibly badly made shooting scenes and more stereotyped lines, all ends happily, and we have served the last line, you can not beat the system. Bah! Do not see this film waste. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 minutes in total!
