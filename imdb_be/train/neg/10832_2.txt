Normally I have no problem with gratuitous swearing in movies, but it really annoys me. All they did was to swear. The entire movie. (And, as someone pointed out that to get cancer) It was a dull, chaotic and pretentious. I Wouldnt If I were you. <br /> <br /> It is also not that I do not like movies that, like most of the people who love it will take "to observe life." I love est.Po man woman, and all that happens is that the Taiwanese people are loading their lives. But I could relate to him. I've never met anyone who swore as much as the "actors" in this film, and I was working at a construction site. So go figure it out. Having said that, William H. Macy made me smile. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid if you do not use sad.
