I always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I have ever seen (and then Peter Pan 2, and some of the other sequels as The Lion King 2 and The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All of these movies are made with the same idea; because the film has no plot, they try to compensate for this by filling his jokes. I'm not saying that to be trifled with, but they make up a large part of the film. The first time I saw the film, I would give it a 1/10. But now I think about it, most kids do not care how good the original film was, they just care about the fact that the movie is interesting. I still think it was a bad movie sequel, but it does not mean that it's awful. Now I think he deserves a 3/10.
