I found this film to look ashamed. I felt that it was a plot to shove down my throat, as if I could not pick up the subtleties I need a voice to all of their spells for me all the time. <br /> <br /> Having a father who still IS an alcoholic, I do not really feel like it was a movie about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, real alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion, of course. They find it difficult to communicate, something that the protagonist had no problems with exactly except that he has a problem to say I love you on one point-that was a bit of a weak force in establishing its cold nature. He was constantly surrounded by people well? <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that at no point we were actually one of the characters to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil. I could not connect with the character and felt no connection at all with the view of my father. I did not feel anything at all, when he finished, only relief was completed. <br /> <br /> McKidd is a good actor, but not a tough guy peculiarity of lead! Clockwork Orange thing was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old to teenagers, they need to have three different characters or stages to avoid teenagers and concentrated more on adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> On a good note, I felt like a little boy actor was really good at the beginning of the movie !!
