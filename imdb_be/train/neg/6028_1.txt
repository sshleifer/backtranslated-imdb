I am a Christian ... and I feel that this film is terrible. HN <br /> <br /> Nobody but hardened Bible belt Christians are going to like this movie. The message is too in your face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be much more subtle. You can not have a daddy waving the Bible around and carry it with you in every scene. FUNNY! <br /> <br /> A bad direction. Identify people missing have been scared, but it was funny. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of the old Ed Wood movies: "My God, people are missing!" The scene on the plane just stupid. Think about it: if you find clothes your family close to you, you do not just yell, "Oh my god, they are gone, they are missing" and begins to cry and scream.!. You would first be in denial ... you just do not jump to that conclusion. Watch Jodie Foster in Flightplan. My favorite shot of a dog sitting on the lawn with a bunch of clothes and shoes, sitting next to him. I about fell off the couch, I was laughing so hard. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad, and so distracting. It was as if the composer was in his own world killed their own films. "This is my chance to make a thriller," "this is my chance to make the action!" STOP tell me how to feel JAMES Covell! Good account supports what is happening on the screen ... this film, you need more points I agree, but instead it was so in your face, the message was. <br /> <br /> The works was bland. So was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was worse: "You do not understand people do not have enough!". Brad Johnson was ridiculous. Two stand out performances came from the Antichrist and the older guy (sorry, can not remember their names) Watching "manufacture" (answer to my question about "what they thought ???"), the producers and filmmakers and actors are simply wrong ... saying, "we're going to reach a wide audience" and "Brad Johnson is awesome" and "it's just like a Hollywood movie." I came to the conclusion that they simply do not know what the "hell" that they do. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the effort. Messages received for the general public, this is a fantastic idea. The film is the best way you can do. Look at films like cheerful, SIGNS, of CONTACT, the Passion of Christ, even O'BROTHER, where are you? The bottom line is that the film had to be people who have the talent and vision. Unfortunately, it was not.
