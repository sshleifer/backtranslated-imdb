As you all know, Sun JIGSAW Blackbuster break due to a member of their own staff full moon, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells all video circuitry. He recently released the film, bleed, which he sold in Blackbuster at the same time as a jigsaw. He persuaded the buyer Blackbuster not take any jigsaw, and double the amount of bleeding. The result is something that looks JIGSAW flop, and bleeding looks like a punch. The main problem is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever, and, as we all know, JIGSAW, well, gold. I urge all of you to go to the page bleed on the Internet and vote for the film that offended a jigsaw, and all your talents. In addition, you have to go to the page and cast jigsaw highest votes for it (if you already have not). We need to fret at least 8 or 8.5, and bleed down around 2 (thus putting it on the Internet 100 worst listing films). . Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same thing <br /> <br /> I hope you all are doing well - Matt
