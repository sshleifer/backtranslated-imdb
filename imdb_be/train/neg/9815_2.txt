The film begins to be somehow original idea, but it was a big disappointment in the future. What's the deal has the original start, when the rest of the film has done little to avoid the clich√©d plot? The film itself is very incredible. I would like to know how someone comes to the clinic, the nurse receives meetings kills doctor takes the patient in her bed, he puts in his Chevy pickup and leaves? I think no one can answer this question, so they just jumped to another scene hiding those little details. Performances are simply bad. The villain is just another "crazy annoying antagonist", not depth, completely linear. After 20 minutes of the film, most of the scenes incredible, it seemed that they had been placed there only for 90 minutes, so they were not needed. Doctor woman see clearly under strong medication, it refuses to investigate, he gets kicked out of the house and just go quietly? The ending scene made me burst into laughter, only Mickey Mouse could make more of a reality. I give it 2 out of 10 for the first lets say 10 minutes of the film.
