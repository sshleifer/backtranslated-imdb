At least I was able to enjoy mocking the film, which is strange, because I could hardly sit through it. Frankly, I think the DVD cover to the body worth more than the whole movie. And to say that it is the same director as Bugimno when a new version which just came out ... nice touch, guys, it's been quite a mistake to lasso me. The only thing that bothered me more than the intolerable actions to copycat his haircut. Usually you only see the kind of hair on the ten-year-old boy and a character acted as he did. The film looks like it was shot by D + a film school graduate students excited to use every technique of the movie, he never learned while attending classes .... sometimes less is more friend. Through that I got lost from random plot twists that did not lead anywhere or have been inexplicable. All this makes a bad film, but when the end not even close to pulling it together, well, that makes it very bad film. Without a doubt, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, and that includes the French final form of my friends to the senior year of high school, but hey, maybe I'm a little biased, I mean I can play extras. PS I do not think it deserves a star ... not even half. No FOR YOU !!
