Italian / American co-production starring Linda Blair and David "HoffÂ» Hasselhoff: how could any fan of bad horror resist such delicacies <br /> <br /> Well, on the basis of an unprecedented, very tiring ,? and utterly meaningless the first forty minutes or so, I would have said: "very easy"; Fortunately, however, still end up getting a little more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those who are lucky enough to find the directing instance, a small amount of nudity as well (unfortunately, my copy of the optical edited to remove such offensive material) . <br /> <br /> into stars Hoff, Gary, a photographer who is accompanied by his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) at the run-down on a seemingly deserted island, to take pictures of her latest project, a book about witches; while there, frustrated Gary also hopes to try to cure a severe case of blue balls, freeing Leslie virginity. <br /> <br /> His Nookie plans are scuppered, however, the unexpected arrival of developers and Freddie Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), and their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son Tommy (Michael Manchester), pretty nympho architect Linda Sullivan (Hiklend), and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who came to inspect the hotel island. <br /> <br /> After explaining their sudden presence on the island, Gary and Leslie meet new hotel owners, who and when a violent storm suddenly raises, making it dangerous to return to the mainland, all agreed, to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to new guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (Kneph) requiring human sacrifices in order to bring itself back to life. One after another, the victims are drawn into the swirling vortex of red (that is guaranteed to provide the desired laughing) before meeting the terrible fate. <br /> <br /> All of this does not make sense, and the action is brutal (Manchester Tommy particularly bad, while Hasselhoff is one of the best performers, who talk about others), but those viewers who do his past dismal first half rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: Rose's lips sewn together before roasting alive in the fireplace; Jerry crucified and burned alive; Linda Cargo tortured and impaled on a sword-fish (!!); Freddy vein pulsate and erupt geysers blood; Gary gets stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Yes, and Leslie raped guy without lips and Blair gets hung up (again).
