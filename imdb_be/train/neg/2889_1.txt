The fact is, the best part of the movie, but this in itself is not worth the purchase price. I expected that, "Based on a true story" movie only to find the home video shot on a hodgepodge of poorly shot videos associated with the pathetic action and unrelated scenes of carnage. scenes video has many fast-situations that have been used, probably to increase the length of the function, rather than the effects. I started this review, before I was even halfway through the movie, and waited until she was finished only in the case if it was better, but the end is low, and so he only got worse. If I could indicate any reduction would have a negative ten. Learn from my mistakes and save your money and time with this.
