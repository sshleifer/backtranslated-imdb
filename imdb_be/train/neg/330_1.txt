I wanted to hit TV. Watching it was torture. I hated it. Do not watch this movie. annoying the terrorists. Adam Sandler annoying. I used to love it, but not this. I wanted to rip DVD. This is the most annoying movie in the world. Comedian he is jealous of an unpleasant. Only remotely funny part of the rocker with black teeth to get all the girls. It was so annoying I wanted to hit TV. Do not buy THIS FILM If you do not want to annoy anyone. If you even like Adam Sandler bit, do not buy it. It will just make you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, cover to put it all at risk of buying it. Its a waste of $ 1.99 I paid for it.
