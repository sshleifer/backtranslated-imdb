It is somewhat noteworthy that the majority of big review of the movie on IMDb all come from people who have only considered one film in all its IMDb career, and yes, you guessed it, the film «Parasomnia». I often suspected suspiciously good reviews on IMDb for what turns out to be nothing but good films like sneaking marketing, but it seems pretty clear in this case. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that Parasomnia scary, but it stops much less in order to be a good or a great film it had the potential to be. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it has a great villain in Patrick Kilpatrick, who is doing a brilliant job, which acts as a menacing and evil, I could easily see that he's having what it takes to play for real memorable villain on par with Hannibal Lecter. There are some interesting visual effects in a dream sequence, in fact, if the film was decided to explore the area more it might be something better. The very concept of a roundabout abuse hypnosis is too great. <br /> <br /> While I understand the suspension of disbelief necessary to dive in any good story, it's a sign of a good story, it succeeds in that allows you to make, when you find yourself irritated by what you find illogical, or just stupid, then you lose the history, and that's what kept me going with this film. Other reviewers have mentioned this here, and I do not want to get into the territory of a spoiler, but I will say, the installation in the final was particularly absurd and frustration, not to mention too volatile mental age of a character who is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life. <br /> <br /> In general, there is the germ of a good idea here devilishly abuse hypnosis, but, unfortunately, this film is not able to implement it into something special.
