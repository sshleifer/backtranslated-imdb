For movie lovers who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's "Ghosts of Hill House") and never seen in 1963. Robert Wise production with Julie Harris, this remake will seem too damn bad. <br /> <br /> for those of us who have, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> The bad actions (that Nissan is thinking?), goofy improving computer, and even move away from the scene of the death of Jackson's remake. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and take the original film. He is still effectively deters counterfeiting without special effects. To act in a professional and believable. <b r /> <br /> For the readers of the book, since 1963 is behind it is much closer.
