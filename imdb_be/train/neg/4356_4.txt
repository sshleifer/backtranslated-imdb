Since I'm not blood and fan intestine I found the bloody scene completely unnecessary (it is written) and too real for my taste, if you're the kind of person who gets his rocks off at the beheading on the Internet or snuff films that I say go for it then believe that such a person is sick wants to shit though. <br /> <br /> In addition, it has the potential to be a great movie, music was also a high-class (through the movie and especially the end credits). Some parts, although they were a bit unbelievable, as you just have found your friend's trust to which they are expected to torture and death, and all you have to do is tell her about what happened and how you got there (why he did not ask her if she happened to have a napkin or even some freshening air or gum while he was at it?), come on now, most likely, simply shout "hurry up and untied me, then lets get p *** hence FAST! ". where were Flys, insect larvae, etc., and if the girl accidentally stumbled on the spot, of course, the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded more alarm! I would only recommend this film Dennis each Niellson and the like, I am sure that the video, as it would have done in a similar sickos have a very happy Christmas.
