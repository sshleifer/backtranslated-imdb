I took this film for $ 5 dollars on discount in the store, Adam Sandler is an amazing actor, i, I thought it would be a good movie, well, it was not. There was no absolutely no storyline at all, bad jokes and other comic said: «F-Word» every word he said, cursing usually dosen't bother me, but it was over the top. And even worse than no part of the storyline was when Sandler would just start talking into the camera on random parts in the movie, it reminded me of Dora, where they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions. And at last, when they accidentally put in bikini girls shots at random times in the film. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, its a waste of money
