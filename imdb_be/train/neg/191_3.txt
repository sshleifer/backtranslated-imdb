... not to live in Montana and especially not live there at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Â«river runs through it", of course, well-made film with cineastic confrontation point. Great scenery, Redford works well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a history in general). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry the storyteller / author, dry, close to nature as well as his father, a preacher. Driving, not driving his own life, it remains to be seen, like his brother, who is also holder in a small town, losing his life. The author does not even come close to undestand motivations of his brother, but at least understand that it is not the smallest amount homour / pleasure. Everything is there, fly fishing, where it stands even the old style of his father. <br /> <br /> In the end it is not surprising, it is foreseeable from the outset. <br /> <br /> should definitely not see (3/10) <br /> <br />
