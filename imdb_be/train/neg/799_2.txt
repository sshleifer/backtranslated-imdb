In a sense, the concept behind the storyline was pretty interesting mixture of several types of typical films in interesting combinations.

I felt as if I was hit on the head so-called mysterious to explain the man kills the disease. <br /> <br /> The author seems to have just raised clich√©s from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted the actual characters. Actors do not help matters. A lot of chemistry. I believe that they had to develop some sort of attractive, if only for the reason that this is an essential element of these stories.

SABATO character, is supposed to be discredited doctor who just can not seem to play by the rules. Think about the character of Jeff Goldblum in "Independence Day". As a rule, this kind of character should demonstrate some talent or brilliance. SABATO character is not displayed. He Cassandra with just a mind and all prophetic skills of the magic eight ball. He seems to be right chance. <br /> <br /> Death Scenes comic. Each actor really tried more than a little difficult to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them. Symptoms looked like a bad claymation, such as videos from the 80s, Peter Gabriel, I think.
