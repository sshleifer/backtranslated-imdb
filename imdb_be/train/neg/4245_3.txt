This film was based on fact? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We will see what appears to be, many armed police emptied equal number of guns on the 2 guys who just got an armored torso. This is a great idea; seek to armor! ... I'm sorry, but what about those big fat you can not miss the head or feet to urge loudly. Or there were the invisible tanks that protect them? they were from Krypton? Did I miss something here? <br /> <br /> This film started decent enough, but after 20 minutes of the shoot it really does turn to boringlane. <br /> <br /> And that documentary style does not work for me, too, but that's just something one finds pleasant or not. <br /> <br /> It is an incredible thing that makes it hard to see it through "to the end. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for fine editing.
