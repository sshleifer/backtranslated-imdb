It really is a terrible film. Plot (e.g., as this) completely illegible. (I think it has something to do with blackmail, but I'm not quite sure.) <br /> <br /> Half of the dialogue consists of a useless cliche. The other half say the various actors in such obscure imitations "southern" accents that (fortunately), the words can not be recognized. <br /> <br /> But one real tragedy of the film is the fact that such a historical flair and Mary Tyler Moore, seems to have been in such serious financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it. <br /> <br />
