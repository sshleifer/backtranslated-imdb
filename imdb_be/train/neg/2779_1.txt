Obviously, if you offer an actor enough money, they will do anything. I do not know how John Rys-Daves received, but most of the money he made to go as a supporter of their apology even associated with this rotten film. Special effects were worse than the effects of the 1950 th years in the film and the rest of the acts of gypsum have been even worse. As for how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my eyes. English was very accented, and I think that no one could actually even say in English, they just remember how the words should sound, instead of memorizing a script and trying to make their character as a "life like" and real.
