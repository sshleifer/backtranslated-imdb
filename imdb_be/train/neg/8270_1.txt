There is no story, tons of poorly designed / super-cheesy scenes (sniper / world famous snipers, who can not even beat their targets in a few feet? Plus the fact that the end? ---> a bunch of law enforcement desecration of a carnival shooting gallery? WTH?) technical mistakes (how many bullets can be placed Glock magazine? 100+? These people fire weapons without having to reboot). The film is so bad that even older Hollywood actor Michael Biehn (Alien, Terminator) can not save this stuff. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie (I realized that I wasted a few good 100 minutes of my precious life on this). Hopefully, the Director will either stop making movies, or to find out more for his next film.
