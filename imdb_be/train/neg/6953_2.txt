Rating: 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> As we approach this mini-series, and we were well aware of this over the past six months, as the Sci-Fi Channel continues to pepper their shows with BG ads confess I felt a growing concern, as I learned more. <br /> <br /> As in any work of cinematic art that has stood up to a certain time of the test, different people come up to him to see different things. In this regard, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some, this chrome warriors with an oscillating red light in them visor. For others, it's the love that they had for the special effects, which were very evolutionarily for its time. Many people forget about the state of special effects in the late 70s, especially on television. For some memories to solve around story arcs. Others still remember how the relationship as the relationship itself has helped to overcome the difficulties they face. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was with the last group. The core of Battlestar Galactica were the people who pull together to save each other from the evil empire. Yes, evil. Cylons had nothing to gain, but the annihilation of the human race yet they did it. While the basic stars revolve around a man and a woman come together to face the enemy with almost unlimited resources, and somehow they managed to survive until the next show. They do not survive because they had better technology, and more firepower. They survived because they care about and trust each other, to get to the next show. <br /> <br /> The show had its disadvantages, and at times it was juicy, but they were people you could care about. <, Br /> <br /> The authors of this current version, it never seemed to understand this. In a sense, he took the least significant part of the original show, character names and take on the arc of history and fit into what they see no less than a rethinking of science fiction television. After all, it was their purpose, they can be judged on how well they have done it: denial. It was far from rethinking. In fact, it was in many ways one of the most derivitive science fiction effort for a long time. It borrows freely from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5, and even Battlefield Earth. I believe that the unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore was a contribution to popular science fiction for over a decade and has made contributions to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see. One of the difficulties with which he seems to have been the fact that there can be no conflict in the bridge of the Enterprise D & E. it was a firm rule Roddenberry ST: TNG. Like many others who have lived in the fact that the rules of others, which then take any opportunity to break the rules, if they are no longer under that authority, Ron Moore seem to have forgotten some of the lessons learned in the framework of the acclaimed master of science fiction: Gene Roddenberry. Here, instead of having to write the best story possible, he created dysfuntional actors I've ever seen in order to create as much as possible the pronunciation of the conflict as he could. In addition to being dysfunctional, some of them were not even slightly believable. Anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not have received a couple of days "in tricks" they could obtain performance, and they would never have received the next day. This would not have happened, period, especially during the war. <br /> <br /> The thing that I remember most of the early works of Ron Moore was that he was the one who wrote about the death of the captain. James Kirk. He scored the Captain Kirk, and unfortunately for me, he killed Battlestar Galactica.
