Very outdated film with a terrible clich√©-ridden dialogue and sweet and very bad design. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk constantly replay. Pseudo "a good movie." It takes time to discover how catastrophic an intelligent turkey. The first stage is a total hole filled with theatrical and hysterical exchanges. It sounds terrible. camera movements have no idea how this building marks. A lot of poetry, or a thin psychology, any interesting shots. Actors are constantly smoking, and we see an advertisement for beer drinks. Very cheap, actually. (With one exception: Ned Beatty "It's nice and easy way to play the killer).
