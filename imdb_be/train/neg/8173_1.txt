One of the saddest slashers ever .. If you can even call it that. I would not see it, even when he ended up being some kind of porn movie, which it fully resembles. The fact that you see a small group of middle-aged people in the forest is really unbearable. They have made these kinds of films for teenagers, so who are they actually for the purpose, when they made this dream festival? My favorite part of the film cover, and this is the only reason why I decided to look for this film, which happened to be part of an exciting Classics 50 Movie Updates .. and after watching the other movies in the 50 package, you "understand that he belongs nowhere. So if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods, I recommend before dawn and The Final Terror.
