It is very old and cheaply made film - a typical low-budget B-West in many ways. Gary Cooper was not a star, and this film is very reminiscent of the early films of John Wayne, which were made for the "gray poverty" studios. Both actors, their familiar style and persona is not yet fully formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not seem much like Cooper a few years later (he says more in the earlier film, by the way). <br /> <br /> However, in contrast to the average B-movie era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make this film unique (if not good). If you ever want to see a woman, who was married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita stars as the female love interest, and it is very, very strange casting choice as it has a strong accent (she was French) and was not even close to a "movie star pretty." By the way, she also was married to director Michael Curtis. <br /> <br /> But for me the most memorable and bizarre aspect of the film seems to be a gay story - such as Brokeback Mountain from the 1930s (and we thought that it was a new idea). Gary Cooper character was raised by two men who hate women, and do whatever they can for the most part of the film, to Cooper away from women. Only in this misogyny it does not necessarily mean that a lot, but there are so many clues throughout the film, which shows the filmmakers really tried to reflect them as a gay couple. In particular, until the end, if one of them died, the other hit by an arrow and contains from die long enough to crawl to the body of his dead friend, and then drops - with hands cupped around it! It was a pretty sharp material time, and I think it makes this dull film really exciting today! How Cooper story to go, the film bit of a disappointment and very skipping state. If you do not want to know, Damita or homosexual semitone, do yourself a favor and find the best Western.
