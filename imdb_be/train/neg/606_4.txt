The potential was there. Creep I saw and thought, "Ohhh, it gets interesting," several times. Nevertheless, somehow interesting storylines bred unexplained or ignore as they never happened. The main character was annoying throughout the film, and at some point my Fella me and shouted that we wanted her to die. There are some really awful / terrible moments, but they are greatly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me. This is another one of those horror films that comes up and intrigue you for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the filmmakers were trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The elegance of this one movie a bad guy, but if a villain more likable than the main character, you know, that loser.
