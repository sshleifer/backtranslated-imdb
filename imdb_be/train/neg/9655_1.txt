I ended up watching the film before even going through any of the reviews, at the request of the woman. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me know when there are people who actually encourage others to see this movie. I am quite shocked to find such a long and positive reviews on this site, which leads me to conclude that it is a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as my opinion, I have to ask, "the filmmaker retarded or do they believe that the audience backward?" The film is disgusting on many levels, and I'm not even talking about the history or presentation <br /> <br /> So, it's a bunch of guys plus one girl (lead actress) form a musical group. guessing by the constant presence of guitar it should be a rock band. Hell, when the dancers started to become part of the rock band ??? anyway let me take this as-Bollywood-version-in-a-rock band, but quite entertaining to all ly, which were actually the two guitarists are doing all kinds of cool Â«ROCK Gestures" and I think that they played instruments, the guitar sound was completely lacking !!! I just can not understand the magnitude of stupidity here .... <br /> <br /> I just want to conclude here, because this is absolutely do not specify any additional defects in the film. Bollywood director, seems to have no longer any shame !!!!!!!!
