I had to go through teenage years, high school angst and family conflicts, almost all show. I really do not care about high school girls wear due to the overestimation of their relationship. I spent my time in Hell solve such questions, and I do not care about the fictional teenies, passing through the "lite" version of the horror I moved. I want science fiction. This is the only reason why I'm here. There were a few seconds of science fiction at the end of the show. We finally see the proto-Cylons. It was good, but one problem. Its red-eye point is fixed on the object of interest. We all know that the Cylons eyedots always scan back and forth, giving the car a world map. Red-eye point does not always stop the movement back and forth. <br /> <br /> I really hope that the authors to correct this abuse before the second episode.
