If 1977 «Exorcist II: The Heretic" not done him any good, it is difficult to imagine that the tragedians extraordinaire Richard Burton saw this homogeneity in the exercise of non-thrill. You've seen it all before: Burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age, he has the power to move inanimate objects with his mind (and you thought «Carrie» does not have any impact on Hollywood!). Although it borrowed from the novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" plays as processed products, although the special effects in the final of the cathedral are solid (if generic). Remick or more is present as a doctor, but the rest of the supporting cast is extremely weak. Burton exaggerated, but tired ... not even telekinesis can save it at this point. * 1/2 ****
