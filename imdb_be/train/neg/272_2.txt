When I was younger, I really enjoyed watching a bad TV. We are all guilty of this at some time, but my excuse to see things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is as follows: I was young and naive; not knowing what makes the show really worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I now appreciate the good stuff. Stargate SG-1 is not good. 12-year-old, I would like a little bit each downed it, every line of dialogue unnatural, every bit of unnecessary technobabble. Compilation of bland; so bland and uninspired that makes one miss the Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me long Trek worst show ever, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> Stargate film is a great glee, anchor two solid performances of James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a great musical score, and interesting ideas of science fiction. Except for a few of the original music, neither the things that made a funny movie it is in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who did MacGyver Legend watchable and interesting, it seems that he is half asleep most of the episodes. <br /> <br /> The budget should be very low, since the sets sometimes look as if someone has a basement. Cinematography is not much better, because the vanilla and boring as scripts. It is surprising to me that shows with more style (as Farscape) and the substance (e.g., Reimagined Battlestar Galactica) have a smaller, less than Awesome fanbases this boom. He simply does not deserve.
