We have a lake. We have animated meteor crashes. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with fins. So let's call this film crater LAKE MONSTER. What else can you add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie & Mitch, to determine the final definition of "comic". We must also have a sheriff who does not really do a damn thing in this film, and that no one is listening. Aw shit, we're halfway through the movie, and we forgot to put the bad guy! Do not worry, let's look at some guy with a mustache, have to rob the store, to show that he's a bad guy, he has come out somewhere near the lake, pursued him through the woods, and all this with the sole purpose of it ending up in a dinosaur snack. This should work. <br /> <br /> full, awkward mess this film. His logic is to turn your mind to get a laugh out of you. The first film to show Dave Allen as a "stop-head of the movement." After that, he teamed up with Charles Group for several years, until the mid-nineties, when the group ran out of money to pay him, I think. dinosaur effects charming and the whole damn movie unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing that can be said for it. <br /> <br /> Well the harm? Yes. Hallucinogenic logic in the story should be reason enough to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
