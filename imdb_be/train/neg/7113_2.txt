Shouts turtles (1 lost its 5 stars) This movie has some pretty cool opening credits (voiceover narrator warns that the film cartridges will be offered free burial when they die from the fear of watching this film, a terrible picture of the skull, which results from benign pool and everywhere scared music), but, unfortunately, the film is deteriorated. Widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion ... to slander his servant and friend, the new Mrs. has a very fragile arrangement because of the tragedy in her past. Well, no time at all, she begins to see and hear the mysterious things that no one can. Her husband assures her that everything is just in my head, and ... well, you can probably see where this is all. You found out what was going on long before our unfortunate heroine ... because you've probably seen the same story in a hundred other movies and TV shows (and do better, too). To add to the sins of the most popular movie, it seems, most cuts of the film (in the many cheap DVD compilations), Edward grabbed several key scenes. You can see that the heroine goes slowly to the window ... she goes to open it ... you know, that she was going to see something terrible ... and then ... suddenly cuts to a scene of her crying in the arms of her husband. So what she sees ??? I believe that we will never know.
