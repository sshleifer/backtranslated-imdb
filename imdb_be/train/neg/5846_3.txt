Yes, this is one of those movies so horrible, so bland, so banal, that you can not stop laughing. I watched a comedy, a good comedy, and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. Other comments give an idea well enough. The characters are so unpleasant to cheer on rats, the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class knew that acting-- second acting-- talk of tired dialogue and faulty breaks. <br /> <br /> But the rat, yes, a big rat. Why we did not get to see the rat to the end and did not surprise me. Often the "big one" does not indicate to the end, because the budget is limited and good effect to chew so much money. I believe, however, that in this case a large rat was hidden until the end, because the filmmakers were ashamed that in the best case they have had a guy running around dressed like a marmot with the third world dentistry. <br /> <br /> the highest part of the film is the scene of the elevator. Once find that rats can not stand loud noise (from a bad migraine actions?), main dude machines to a fire alarm to dispatch it a rat in a rage. If you ever wanted to see a couple of rats waltz, and squeezes the blood out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you. In fact, you need to remove it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But no more than 99 cents, OK?
