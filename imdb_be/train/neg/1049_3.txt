This film has a very Broadway feeling - a backdrop, the current, the «noise'- and yet it all has. A "sense" of the Broadway without an explosion. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, the picture is fragmented, singing "pops up" on you so that you suddenly remember that it is a musical. <br /> <br /> Poor: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Unbearable: fiancé Sinatra --- certainly a step and the emphasis in her voice there was no need. <br /> <br /> Acceptable: Mr. "I remember the numbers on my bones" <br /> <br /> Delight: Brando understated singing (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: how much Gene Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in her scenes of Havana. This bone structure! How I would have killed to see Miss Lee in the role again defies Brando.
