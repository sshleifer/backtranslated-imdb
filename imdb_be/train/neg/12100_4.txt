Do not get me wrong. If you need insightful summary of all that is wrong with the history of human civilization, as well as a perfect way to the bright future of mankind, it is better to turn to than comedian and pop-culture practices? If you need a healthy dose of solid good reasons why religion has gone through this utility and then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not Bill Maher for God (?) Sake! This is a good time, and all by itself. Maher denies our religious past as a neurological disorder, usually oblivious to how his entire society, science and art is rooted in it. <br /> <br /> In this film, it strongly depends on the skill set sharpened irony and cynicism to make his point, trying to sound erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intelligence is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh, but this is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, he responds to the interviewees (and I use the term loosely, as they are clearly all «ambushees») assertion that the existence of Jesus is a historical fact, with a straight "No, it's not" followed by a long look I wanted to convey contempt naive subject (device sickening abuse in this film). The problem lies in the fact that the man was right and Maher is wrong in his assertion that Jesus is mentioned only in the fact that he believes in historically- suspect gospels. I think Mr. Meyer had never read a modern historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But the masses flock to this pseudo-documentary, they are fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they will be loud roar and laughter (they are, of course, in my show). <br /> <br /> This is twice as eloquent, but that is the loudest and most mules as piercing occurred in about 70% of the running time, the film is dedicated to his anti-Christian tirade while the audience was completely silent in token 10% devoted to criticizing call themselves a religion of peace. Hmmm. Any critic of Islam extend beyond hip and liberal target audience or they simply are afraid to laugh. Very revealing, anyway ..
