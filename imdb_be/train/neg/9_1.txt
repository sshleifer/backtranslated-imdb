This is one of the stupidest movie I've ever seen. He rips almost ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them. <br /> <br /> There is not one good line or a sign of the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought, and as far as the action goes, there is nothing good to say so, Ill say nothing. I really can not understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and in fact released, if anyone does not know, at some stage, to think: "Oh my god, this is really load of crap" and call it a day. Its shit like this, there are people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least, if you have downloaded it, you do not waste your time or money, do not waste your time, it hurts.
