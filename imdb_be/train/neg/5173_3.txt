When I saw it in the store, I thought it looked very good and original. As Wolfs Creek meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and I mean that only costs three pounds (about $ 6). Frankly, I do not think it's even worth it. <br /> <br /> It is directors- in the "butcher" the brothers could not decide whether or not wanted to make an artsy kind of horror or bloody slasher horror. He finished with a clich√©-ridden bloody sadistic hour and fifteen minutes of all the characters to be one-dimensional, and you could not care less what happened to them, but to try to make the care the audience about the characters they added useless monologue at the end and beginning of the film, to be absolutely honest, it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> The only good part really was the middle of / the end I will not spoil it for you. But it was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> In general, meaningless to watch. It was like a two hour movie, but it was actually only 75 minutes. If you want to make a pretentious film-not to bother. If you want to slasher film entirely bother- film moves so slowly, nothing ever happens.
