Yes, I'm sure this can really be a nation. ,, When the four of them were all standing on the four corners of the world, and the other two cloned several billion times. Man, I'm really glad I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of George Romero's films, and I'm sure that if he had seen it, he'd probably throw up laughing too hard. I mean, it was a raccoon girl posing in a zombie and walk around as Devils Charlie? It really helped also that the composer chose the trash fashion show music for when the zombies came to him a killer, especially the part where they go to the warehouse drawing furniture store / police station / flat / apartment / any room was a gong in the background but a living woman was arguing about a closed furniture store. I could not even say what nationality the killer, and the fact that his accent drew attention to some few countries did not help. Well, what can I expect from the film, where they throw in a random fight scene without good reason in the warehouse, where they are, apparently, the air box ship worldwide. Thus, for all those who worship the Mystery Science Theater 3000, or if you are just as boring on the bad films C (C for Craptastic), then this is the movie for you. Or not.
