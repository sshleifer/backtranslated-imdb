The problem with a book, "Memoirs of a Geisha," is that he had a Japanese surface, but beneath the surface it was the American way of thinking people. Reading a book, how to look beautiful ballet with great music, sets and costumes by another animal threshing floor, dressed in the costumes ?? so far from the Japanese way of thinking were the characters. <br /> <br /> The film ISN "t about Japan or the real geisha. This is a story about a few American men of misconceptions about Japan and the geisha to filter through their own ignorance and delusion. So this film if it is not about Japan or geisha? Whether it's pure fantasy, like many people have said? Yes, but then why do it in the American imagination? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture in which there is no puritanical hang-ups, no connotation sin of sex. Sex is a natural and normal. How sex is handled in this film? Exactly. As it was dirty. Closest to the sex scene in the movie is Sayuri wrinkling his nose and grimacing in disgust for five seconds, as if a man tries to install it released a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. <br /> <br /> Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? No. One of the characters is called diverse, but all we see her pushing her lover, because it looks as if she does not want to get caught doing something dirty. This typical American Puritanism has no place in a movie about a Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Maybe Sayuri enjoy her first Ravishing some old crank after her cherry was sold at auction? No. It is like a cold piece of meat on the chopping block. Of course, it does not enjoy it. And that's what I mean about this film. Why they gave her something like that? Why all the sex to be sinful and wrong? <br /> <br /> For Mameha was chaired by the secret patron of Sayuri, and as such it was an auction for her virginity. He could have rigged auction and he won it. Nobu did not even rate. So why is the chairman let this old codger to win it, and the old man stink propahnuvshy getting his fingers all over his naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive someone for what? <br /> <br /> Let's try to understand this. As for Mameha Chairman debt incurred for training geisha Sayuri in. In order to pay back their debts Chairman Sayuri was sold to Dr. Krabi. Through Mameha Chairman Sayuri sold sexual services to these old eccentrics so that the chair can make money out of it. -Chairman was not its patron. He was her pimp! Some of romantic love story. <br /> <br /> So, the film is gorgeous, but it seems like a very attractive beauty, seductive transvestite whose voice, look and every touch is thrilling. But at the same time very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. Under the wrong which is a Japanese film surface lurks a sinister secret that the heart, the soul, the spirit and the essence of the film is completely American and men. Not the best, that when she is trying to be different than the lies, distortions, and horribly wrong <br /> <br /> Some of the contrasts between Japan and MSM :. <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Graceful, elegant simplicity. MSY style ?? Peking Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Hair swept up. May Geisha ?? Loose hair, which certainly must have received all gunked into a thick paste of white make-up <br /> <br /> Japanese ice shavings -. The Japanese are quite strict about seasonal rites. Shaved ice is treated strictly in the summer. USDA shaved ice - Chairman buys Chii young Sayuri Suzuki played amazing Wow, this is fun during the cherry blossom season, which is considered. The thought made my whole body shivering with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Qualified and experienced animators. USDA geisha. - unkempt <br /> <br /> Japanese wind chime - is used in the summer, because he heard the sound it makes, thanks to the wind, the Japanese feel somehow steeper. MSY wind chime - door chime! If a person is standing in front of someone's house and made noise with wind chimes, they will be considered a lunatic, not gain entry. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? Emphasis on human relations, group-oriented. MOA ?? "I want life, my" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance ?? The refined elegance. Almost geometrical and mechanical accuracy. MSY dance ?? Martha Graham uncontrolled LSD while wearing nya-very-favorable Japanese white funeral shroud. Made Geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha-ha-ha! There is a strip club, where they made the most of his research geisha? <br /> <br /> Japan fire ?? Installing or even allow a fire to break out worse than murder, because it is such a terrible threat to society. Fires can rip through the wooden villages, towns and cities, destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people as possible. MSY house fire - Big appendage to the fight scene, but there is zero effect and because it is no longer needed because the fire under control miraculously puts himself out. Technically, the film ended here because, at least, would be ostracized Sayuri and joined his sister among those who have never heard. What, where and Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall must be expelled. <br /> <br /> It is enough. The movie stinks.
