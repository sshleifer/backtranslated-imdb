Let me tell you something about this movie. I saw him twice. The first time when I was a child, and the film was very interesting for me. I really liked it. I thought it was fun and interesting, and the main character was kind of cool. <br /> <br /> I saw him again a few days ago. It was awful. In fact. I do not know why I thought it was funny before, but now ... I do not laugh at all. There was nothing even a little interesting. It was just stupid. The story was weak. Action was not anything special. There are great actors in this film, but still acting mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> What's the worst thing is that this film is racist. In fact. Do not get me wrong, I do not usually complain about racism in the movie. However, I've seen people complain about the lack of black men in movies such as "Shaolin Temple", or that the only black man in «The Street Fighter» is one of the bad guys, or ... Whatever you get the point . There are people who see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to the film as «The Meteor Man». Why? I'll tell you why. There's no Asians in this film. There are no white people among the good guys. In fact there is only one white guy in the whole film, and he is the leader of the bad guys. All the good guys blacks. Do not get me wrong, I do not care it's a good kid, black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I care about is the fact that we can only see a white man in this movie. This is the only film like that I have ever seen. It's just not realistic. If there is only one black person in the Japanese film, which in the case of «The Street Fighter» no problem - most people in Japan Asians. But if there is only one white man in an American film, there is a problem - most people are white in the United States. It's like shooting a Japanese movie with stark white plaster, and the only one from Asia, as the bad guy. Just not realistic. <br /> <br /> That is. I give the film speed is 4/10. It would be 1/10, if I did not have fun with it as a child.
