This is the second film that I have seen in Horrorfest last weekend, The Gravedancers be the first. Gravedancers better. I can only guess, watching this, that the production must have been very limited. I admit, the story began an interesting, but in fact failed for me in the end. We were not really given time to empathize with and understand any of the characters that are just with each of his erratic performance even more annoying. I should mention that there is also a little MIS-casting with a 12-year-old boy acting sheriff. The only reason why I spent the entire film should have known that there was a big secret, which was not all that interesting. Some have a background of the family helped, but they do not really seem like a family at all to begin with. <br /> <br /> For me, this film is so amateur that I could not even see, putting it on the DVD. Four ratings for the initial building could be history. It was the one to miss for horrorfest.
