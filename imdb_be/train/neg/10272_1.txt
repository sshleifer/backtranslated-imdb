When I read the back of the DVD casing, I thought, that sounds very interesting ... so ... I had my mother to throw it in a bunch of movies in the "4 for $ 20" in Blockbuster. When we returned home, and popped in the movie ... twenty minutes with her, we found out, turning to each other, there is a "this sucks. Let's put it in something else. "I admit, some of the lines from your friends at the cafe made us smile a little. But let's at least get some decent actors! Every once in a while in the movie, when the acting is bad, and the film does not go into the painfully slow pace and really sounds interesting, I can gut it and get a few laughs, they are above (or below) makes them a line. But I can only take so much. Crying scene looked like the actors having hysterical fits of laughter, there was no delivery of their lines ... a lover not even come close to the action in this movie. <br /> <br /> Those who come here saying that this film was a good would have been some really good drugs while they are watching a movie. This is the most nonsensical thing I've ever had the displeasure to watch. NOT SEE OR BUY THIS MOVIE !!!!!
