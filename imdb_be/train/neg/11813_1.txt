By Stan Laurel has become less than half of all the greatest comedy team of the time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson cheapies series, many of which were parodies of the main features of Hollywood. After a dispute with Anderson, Laurel all unofficial parody series at Joe Rocco smaller (and never have) production company. <br /> <br /> Most of parody films Laurel were only slightly funny at the time, and even less funny for modern viewers who have not seen the original film, which Laurel parody. "West Hot Dog» is a rather general parody of cowboy poslematchevyhem window. It's a little peculiar parody of "West of Pecos," two years earlier without the protagonists issued oater. After all, "West Pecos" was never a great success, it is difficult to understand why the film unit Stan chose this film as a target for their lampoonery, much less why they waited so long after its release parody it. And where do they get the title of "the West of a hot dog? Maybe it boils down to that" hot dog! had sexual interjection favored American libertine in the 1920s. (As in the first scene in the play "mechanical».) <br /> <br /> «West hot dog" and was manufactured from rock-director Joe. Among his achievements, Rock introduced Lois Laurel Nilsson, and he later was the best man at their wedding. Full disclosure: In the last years of his life, I had the great honor of friends Joe Rock and his interview. Almost ninety years old at the time, the memory of Rock was impressively clear ... but he did not remember anything at all about "West Hot Dog», and I can not blame him. This film is a highly forgettable <br /> <br /> The leading lady character named Little Mustard :. If it's meant to be a parody of something to "West of Pecos," I do not understand. There are several 'impossible' gags here, including the Laurel method for mounting a horse. Just one point in the film, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly ran away. "West Hot Dog» vaguely similar in subject matter and a short ton to Keaton comedy «The Frozen North", but much funnier version of Keaton. The plot of this film is slightly ahead of the situation in particular Keaton "Our Hospitality", but (again) suffers from the comparison here, two brothers cruelly mischievous wait to inherit the last chance saloon, but the previous owner willed wimp Tenderfoot Stan. Nevertheless, the brothers are the rightful heirs, when Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> If it is serious, then: a testament legal? As soon as Stan takes possession of property, of course, any additional issues related to the ownership or inheritance was his decision, not the decision of the previous owner. I had enough time to consider these questions right, watching this stupid comedy. <br /> <br /> At some point, the gag involves some rough animation is drawn directly on the film. It looks cheap and not funny <br /> <br /> This «Hot Dog» Weiner does not and is not a winner :. It's just a whiner My assessment:. One point out of 10. Hold on, Stan: in a few years you'll be half comedy legend .
