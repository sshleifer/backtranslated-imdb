Probably New Zealands worst film ever made <br /> <br /> They are not jokes funny. Used from other films and simply banal Acts bad, although there is a large cast <br /> <br /> The story is not interesting and sad has more cheese then pizza lovers home cheese pizza kind of actions were done 1,000 times before <br /> <br /> I watched it when it came on TV, but it was so sad he could only withstand 30 minutes of this. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks <br /> <br /> Or do not look, <br /> <br /> Watch paint dry instead
