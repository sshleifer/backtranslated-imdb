poorly aimed garbage. mediocre nihilist sadistic Gorefest ... if you're the kind of person who likes that ... see shrinkage. even if you're the kind of person, it does not make a good film that works really bad, history is full of plot holes, the director really should just give up and find a real job because he has no talent for it. I can understand why people do not like Uwe Boll .. we had a few of his films in recent years, and this is the best of them, really sad! The complete absence of any kind of humanity seems to suit some people, but here it's just grates. horror movies may be full of desolation, they can be miniature works of art, they may be just a good view, if there is nothing else on ... SEED just really poor.
