Flat characters that you do not and never will care about. Creep cause the dialogue on the ground. Quite a few twists (they do not think they are, but if you do not figure it out after about 40mins you are not too bright). Many well-known actors in the roles and performances, which, fortunately for all involved, will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll. <br /> <br /> I do not mind the "slow" films, but they have to go _somewhere_. This one does not. <br /> <br /> The plot is not what made this film straight to DVD, it's just a pretty handy reason to try to drum up some fake controversy. <br /> <br /> Ace-off lists 37 (!) ten (10) evaluation should be from people connected with the production.
