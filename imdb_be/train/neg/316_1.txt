This movie is definitely the worst film ever made. If you have to create a film costarring guy who plays Lars in heavyweights, than do the damn film. I must say that I can watch Leprechaun in space 6 times before I can watch the trailer of this movie POS. Adam Sandler must be restricted from any film after this disgrace. Watching this film, as a mixture of listening to Cher and willingly put your dick in a blender. Anyone with half a brain cell realize that this movie is not worth a dime. If I had an extra dollar, and should have it, I would have given it to the support base Lorraina Bobbitt before buying this film.
