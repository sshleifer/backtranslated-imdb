Ya I take it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent premise establishes otherwise embarrassing stories with no real gain, but at least he had a good shot. Director John Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a fake ghosts home with a real danger inside. In most cases, it should be a slam dunk, but this little bitch pretty quickly derailed. Cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best, but the story and the letter is simply terrible. Slow scenes go on forever, and scary too few and far between with no real climax of the film. Terrible mood set in the beginning, but it loses gloss horror turns before any type, and I found that bored to death and make another sandwich ... Cover is attractive, and I believe that it is worth a rental if you are looking for mindless dreck for the low-budget, but if you like a good story and eventful ending, reach for something else.
