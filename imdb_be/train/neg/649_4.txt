OK, this film was made for one reason and one reason only, to make money !! manufacturers obviously do not care about the murder of the classic horror film. I knew that this film is going to suck as soon as it is PG-13, as the crushing PG-13 movies were good? That's like asking how many women have been on the moon? There is no answer !! Prom 1980 he was not aware of a masterpiece, but it certainly deserves to be recognized as a film that stays true to its genre and deosnt try something more than that. <br /> <br /> May issue with Prom Night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and I have 3 main problems associated with it ................ ..... <br /> <br /> 1) the way he escapes, he was locked up in a mental institution, and it exits through the vent air conditioning !! What the hell? why do they have air conditioning vent hole in the patient's room? Do they want him to be comfortable during their stay, or something? 2) His intention somewhat vague killer wants all families and friends of the main victims of the dead, so that he could have her all to himself, he says he loves her, but the next minute he TRYS to kill her, so he wants to kill her, love her or just raped her ?? 3) The murderer too well how he develop your skills? Previously, he was a teacher, so in this one scene where he kills the main victim of one while HES is mainly on the upper part of her sleep, and she does not notice all this stupid 2 stars out of 10 scary, silly, silly attempts horror
