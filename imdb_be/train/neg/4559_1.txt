I'm surprised that anyone connected with the production of this series actually admits responsibility. The script is so unfunny it must be written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Union of Canadian comedy writers (and this is saying something!). Binoculars away from here, if you want, but there is nothing like a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett was flat broke to stoop to this rubbish. The rest of the cast is so lacking in any action or comedic abilities, I'm surprised it lasted past the first episode - correction, by auditions. All I can say to those who are amused by the fact that they should be very easy to have fun. And it is obvious that the cost of production should be all â‚¤ 100 per episode. And just in case anyone thinks that I comment as a foreigner, who is not familiar with English humor, I must add that I was actually in English.
