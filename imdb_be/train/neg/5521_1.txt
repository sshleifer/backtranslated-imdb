I just came to see the film and decided to see what others thought about it. I left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews seen the same film! This is potentially a very good story, but he did not hit the target. The script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that it would make a big net fishing scene. These characters were not well developed and the plot jumps around so much that I found myself asking the question: "How did we get here?" At least half a dozen times during the film. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of any chemistry between the actors. This is probably due to the antics of Lindsay Lohan during the filming. It was quite clear that all came in and did his job, but did not commit to their role. <br /> <br /> This is not a film is worth a look ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a good warm bath, and save your money for something that is worth it!
