The plot of the film hangs on one important point: that the killer was also responsible, loving, caring father. Not that being a father and a killer is impossible. But this man is shown killing a teenage girl without provocation or reason and the emotions. This girl was someone's daughter. I do not think that a father who cares so much about his own daughter could be so conscious to someone else's daughter. Or, alternatively, it could be so cold-blooded and yet worry about and take care of his own daughter. And the idea that a convicted murderer will actually ask the parents of the victim, and to take care of her daughter, is beyond belief. <br /> <br /> However, the characters have acted with conviction actors. I thought that a change in eye color in Baku Scott did it seem colder and threatening than usual. You could not see his eyes at all.
