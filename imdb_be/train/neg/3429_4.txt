I got a copy from the author of the film on the Soulseek. I must say that this is a miserable and painful to watch two cops act, but I saw the movie as a joke and, as a tribute to the subway August I accidentally saw it in my book, as a strange film, his quality and everything about it is quite bad, but its interesting and something to talk about, among your friends. Reminiscent of Troma, but good things. I recommend to watch it on two conditions, when you are bored and need a good laugh, or high, or just let it be. We recommend for sure. about murder and quite funny. For example, if a zombie rips a member of Satan and stabs someone in the head.
