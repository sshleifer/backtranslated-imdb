I'm a big fan of Italian films of the seventies, and I would not hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bush among my favorite actresses of all time, so I went to this movie with some hope. However, it soon becomes clear that it is largely pointless film that is not going to go anywhere. It is clear that no one would have gone into this expecting a lot more, but the fact that it is pointless getting more annoying, if you think it's also pretty boring, and none of the characters are not interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on the "rogue"; in this case one that steals, womanises and manifests material. It's basically all the story that this film has. The film does have a real "seventies style" to it and the idea of ​​it is constantly very carefree gets through well. Sometimes it seems that the director Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to crank some point, although that point is does not come across very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and it is so here; she picked the best thing about the film and the sequence in which it is hanging from bare machine is the best part of the film. In general, the Rogue will likely have appeal to people who like the style of the seventies, but, unfortunately, it is not much else to offer.
