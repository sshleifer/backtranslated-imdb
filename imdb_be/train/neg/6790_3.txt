Ooooh brutality, Ohhhhh dying breed, a sense of loss Ohhhh, Ohhhh prejudice! Jeez, when all of you are going to stop whiney revisionist Westerns analysis for calling loudly? S ** t occurs. If this offends your sense of social engineering then return to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> homogeneous and very tedious waste celluloid, especially in light of the presence Coburn / Hackman / Bergen. Nothing interesting or intriguing here if you are not obsessed with the 19th Century dentisty desert. Maybe a little better without the constant leakage of the idle position of the Mexican guy with a bad tooth. Monument stupid ultra left creeping sensitivity of 60/70's. It is practically impossible to sit through the entire movie. I think I'd rather make my eyes open for the entire series Lucky Luke / Trinity. 4 Horses / 10 deader'n all hell.
