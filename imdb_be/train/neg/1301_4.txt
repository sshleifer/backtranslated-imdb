Recently, I saw it in 2009 Palm Springs International Film Festival. This feature-length directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and on the basis of my observations it should be her last. I hate movies that are so improbable that you choose from one another in almost every scene. This film just leaves you scratching your head. as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend, who works for an international aid organizations have a leisurely drive through the mountains of Afghanistan under Taliban control, a conversation about love, when the rocket stopped the truck in front of them. They come out of the car to see how Talliban fighters equipped with grenade launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades to fulfill all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) begins to photograph it all when he said one of the militants, LOBS hand grenade at them, who kills his girlfriend. because they are from the hands of throwing at a distance can not be more than 50 yards yet he somehow gets away. His girlfriend was blown up, and it takes a snapshot of the moment of impact grenade that kills her and wins the prize as the Photographer of the Year in the photo. Each scene and the situation in the film is as funny as it is opening. The next year, Bob finds himself on the instructions of National Geographic in the Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and inserts itself into its seedy underworld of international drug traffickers. Avoid this movie. I would give it a 4.0 out of 10.
