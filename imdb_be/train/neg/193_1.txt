History of Norman Maclean's is a masterpiece; Redford movie is mediocre. It adds a banal scene McLean brothers, who go over the falls and their double love in a seedy bar, which is not even hinted at in the story. Cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul MacLean, a genius in the open air, is either ridiculous or depressing, depending on what the original story mean to you. Some of casting flies beautiful scene. In addition, Tom Skerritt as father and Craig Sheffer as Norman and strong men, because men were once expected. None of the women does not come across in the film, which is regrettable, because McLean loved a woman in its history, and made it clear, even poetic.
