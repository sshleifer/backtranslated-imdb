Not one of the best pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> The two legendary Pokémon come into the story. You can see how much can be Celebi, although he turns evil first. <br /> <br /> Suicune also pretends that it does not seem that strong. <br /> <br /> Marauder Useless' t have a lot of strong Pokemon at all, except taranitar? Some fight scenes with his Pokémon could have done it better. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meet much younger oak professor, although they do not understand. Misty, I thought it was the end, but she did not get. I saw it in the credits. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much here, the worst of the series so far.
