Lamas star as Jack Kelly `Solider` ex-Vietnam vet and a renegade cop who is on the search and destroy mission to save his sister from the hinterland of cattle. Brutal film is so cheaply made and so bad that Ron smoke is the third account, and still have 3 minutes of screen time, and even those that are not any good. Overall, a terrible film, but the scenes with Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a tree calibrated and gagged worth several (unintentional) laugh. Following the improved sequel.
