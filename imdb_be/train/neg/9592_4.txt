I saw the movie, only in recent years, although it appeared in 2001, I was hoping to see an entertaining movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade nothing compared to Azuma. "Princess" is not much of a talker, as you may have noticed ... It reminded me of Jean-Claude Van Damme, who was looking just to make his point of view, and then beat the crap out of your opponents. Throughout the film, I expected to hear at least the recognition of the fact that she likes, why she is fighting who she loves and trust. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Crappy dialogue. Do not watch it if you do not want to be bored with your mind! It is so bad that in the end, I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour later. About. I give 4/10.
