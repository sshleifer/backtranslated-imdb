The film is almost laughable to Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters united as a mother convicted murderers. With terrifying reputation after the trial, the two women together and leave New York to California, to open and a song and dance studio Shirley Temple as girls. <br /> <br /> From the outset, it is clear that Reynolds had made a mistake in making Winters with her in California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who, more and more, it seems, is about to leave her rolling pin. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the women, who live together, receive threatening phone calls. Reynolds, who wears a wig blond, quickly courted by a wealthy father of one of his students, playing well Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorehead, in one of his last films, briefly considered as a sister Alma, that winter is the best listener. <br /> <br /> film really belongs to Shelly Winters. It is hard and heavy, seemed to make it even better effect. Winters have always done well in the role of testing her nerves. <br /> <br /> The ending with the terrible and who can forget Winters pounded the piano with this totally crazy eyes?
