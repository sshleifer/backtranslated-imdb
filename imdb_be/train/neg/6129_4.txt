According to this film, and a strong man, made in the same year, I would not put Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent comedians screen. There's just not enough there. Maybe he was on his way to the development of his style, but sabotage yourself by taking their first big success too seriously. In any case, all his tricks are more reminiscent of funny people, but it lacks the acrobatic skills Keaton and Lloyd tremendous ingenuity. It also undermines his own person dressing and walk like Chaplin tramp character. His trademarks are the childlike innocence, shyness approach and a tendency to under-react to disasters, looking in amazement, batting his eyes and pursed lips touching the tip of the index finger. Comedy films Langdon results from the fate of throwing various obstacles in its path, which he tries to overcome Wimpy or naive methods or with a minimum of corporeality, such as throwing stones at the upcoming tornado to drive it away, propping up crumbling building two to four or dodging boulders, raising the leg so that they roll under it. In this story about the son of a shoemaker, who joins hiking cross-country race to advertise shoes rival company, it manages to win by a fluke. There's nothing that has not been done much better than the Big Three.
