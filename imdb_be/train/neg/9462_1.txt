Inappropriate. Rating PG, this film gets another huge deficiencies in the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13, but this film gets a PG? Please. Parents do not be fooled into taking the initial child's school in this film is a huge mistake. There were many times I found myself to be uncomfortable, not only because the humor was inappropriate for children, but also because it was completely out of the blue and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But all this aside, the Cat in the Hat is still a scary movie. Casting and overall look of the film is the only saving grace. Beautiful Kelly Preston and always likable (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles, but Preston's almost too beautiful for a role like this. Children are conditioned by the actors, and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only man aspect of the film that kept me watching and do not throw things on the screen. <br /> <br /> I was there was too much talking cat in this film? Mike Myers is absolutely abysmal. I did not like it as the voice of Shrek, and I really believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the area of ​​children's films ever again. His image Cats slightly softened version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cat was to come, he should not have to stay away, but he came, even if only for a day, he destroyed the 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and discord. <br /> <br /> The cat may be the worst kids in the movie hat ever.
