I was excited to see a comedy, which I hope will be of Indian Candians, but I found that the show is not funny. The producers and cast, probably happy to get both good and bad feed back, because as far as they are concerned, that is to get talking! I was prepared for some of the stereotypes and do not have any problem with it, because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually right. But in fact there was nothing funny about these stereotypical characters. "Fresh boats' dad, who does not understand his daughter. Radical feminist Muslim daughter (who, incidentally, is a terrible actress), young and modern Indian man trying to run their mosque as politically correct as it can (it is a very good actor, I can only see it getting better). <, Br /> <br /> it is very contrived and dialogue does not flow that well. It had so much potential for something like this, but unfortunately, I think this is not possible, and do not really care to watch another episode. <br /> <br /> I did however enjoy watching the great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, it is always a treat, and natural in all that she does, too bad her daughter in the show did not have the same acting abilities!
