The script for this film Columbo, seemed to be pulled directly from the juicy 1980 soap opera. Deeply symbolic driven movies are great, but only if the characters are compelling. And in this film, the only convincing was my desire to change the channel. Villain dialogue sounds as if it was written by novelist novel. Even the great Lt. Columbo is no where near its famous, cute, dedication, crumpled himself; and the bride / kidnap victim is crying dimensional girl-in-distress (she cringes in fear of a tiny scalpel, flimsily held in the hand of her abductor - come on !!! I could have knocked out the scalpel out of his hand and pushed him to you you know that in 2 seconds). In a certain sense of reality, this figure would have been at least tried to fight or resist, at least a little. And if we talk about reality .... the story revolves around the kidnapping, who worked and solved by the police. ?? police Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI takes over EVERY kidnapping case. It was not Columbo, only a small and predictable crime drama with our friends lieutenant Columbia written in and stretched to 2 hours.
