I'm still trying to figure out whether there is a point in the film. <br /> <br /> In terms of content, is supposed to be so "rebellious" and "controversial" that gives students Maddox terribly lame, students seem to be easily swayed by vague anti-authoritarian attitudes and scraps of unintelligible words scrawled on the leaflets. Rebel, whole. <br /> <br /> I believe that it would be too much to ask that the teen rebellion movie where the fire alarm does not get credit school. <br /> <br /> It seems that "a huge fight on the football field," is the struggle, which consists of two people. <br /> <br /> The characters face seem to be different from each other in a random order. Football jockey who Maddox fought (and which later became a staple on the face) is all smiles and apologies the next day. <br /> <br /> the fact that it does not come to a real conclusion section makes me feel that all of this could have missed the half-hour after-school special. If they cut most of the attempts at pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
