The disappointment of the film. <br /> <br /> In the history of our hero created as Chris, "youth", but a broken individual drift without doing much. In fact, it does very little to move the story at the same time it does not surprise me to see the focus shifted to her relatives. It is a pity, though, Chris, it seems like an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and sometimes felt formulated. So the question now is when will we see Campions, Jacksons and off the ground in a convincing Tamahori, cinematically, to tell a story that will inspire, entertain and not on a paid two-time? <br /> <br /> Technically, a disgusting film shot.
