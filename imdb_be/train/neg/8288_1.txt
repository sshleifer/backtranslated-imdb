What a shame that Alan Clark should be associated with this scar. This does not exclude it, however; get a group of guys and some Stellas together and whale of a time running this again and again and roll on the floor in tears of laughter. Big night a vain thing. Al Hunter house in the well-publicized theme of the late 80s-, that the hooligans were well organized and not very interested in football with a respectable job (real estate agent ???) itself- often. But Clark can convince us that any of the two-bit actors deviating from the other low-quality television productions (Grange Hill) or in the near future to go to the poor quality of the drama (Eastenders) may be for a nanosecond to make us believe that they are violent football thugs laughable. We really believe that the ICF (which, of course, based drama) will EVER go to another city, to fight only with SIX guys? <br /> <br /> ICF will displace the subway station, etc. With hundreds. Andy Nichols Scally need to read before even contemplating the history of this nature. The acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs- Oldman as the camp is incredible. Most of them look as if they should be in a bubble bath Mr. Matthew. Real inspiration for anyone with a digital camera that thinks that they can do flick- go for it.
