Just a dumb old movie. First Stanwyck's son gets his leg really dumb way into a trap, and then her husband, his leg trapped in a different way to really dumb. In an attempt to save him, Stanwyck gets lucky once again and catches escaped convict. She has a chance to kill him, but not in a very stupid way to. In the end, her husband was saved, and Stanwyck speaks to us through the story of that silent message of the film. All is well, what ends dumb <br /> <br /> I could never understand how unattractive woman as Stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in glamor-oriented Hollywood golden era. the nose is so beautiful ?? So photogenic ?? The film is mercifully short, running just over an hour. It is as if the director felt that he was doing shit, so he decided that it was better to keep the short shit.
