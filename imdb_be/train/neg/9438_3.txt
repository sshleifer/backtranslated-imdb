Ever I watched the movie, which has lost the plot? Well, it's not even really have one to begin with. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The aching tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with virtually no sense of threat or apprehension created even during the apparently permanent thunderstorms (not surprisingly never actually heard in the house, a large double-glazing)? The house, which apparently only a few miles from the city a few hours away (?) Or the third girl that serves no purpose to the plot, except to provide a surprisingly quick bloody murder as well as the longing becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning of that suggests wave 20+ kills throughout the area, even if it is not obvious that the killer never dare to far from home? Or bizarre ritual with salt and pepper, that pretty much sums up most of the films characterized by a lack of leadership. <br /> <br /> Add a lead actress who can not act, but at least willing to make some totally inappropriate naked soul scene and this video is really disgusting, but not the way you hope. <br /> <br /> Given the following just for the fact that it is forbidden in the UK in the 80th year (mainly due to the final country for longer murder) it does not offer anything other than curiosity value, and a "Daft" Kill CLASSIC (do not worry, his telegram, at least ten minutes in advance). <br /> <br /> After a walk in the forest our victim comes at a fairly steep slope upwards, which they obviously struggle to. In the middle they see the figure above, dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. What are they doing? Go down and work like the rest of us? No, of course not- they fight to the top and stand comfortably and nicely right before the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> It's really only in the movies, as they say ..
