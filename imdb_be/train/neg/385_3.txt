Poorly written plot Drama / Mystery of the possibility that AIDS was presented to the public the government. Wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers - in this foggy area will be difficult for anyone to find. In spite of the cinema itself is commendable, the camera craves the true depth of the characters, instead of small, amateur acting, unfortunately, must pass. Rating: D +
