* Possible Spoiler * <br /> <br /> «Return to the cabin on the lake" useless film. Act was not good, and the plot was not even remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> «Little House on the Lake" good TV movie. A sequel was not. Judd Nelson was very good in the first film and put a lot more in his character than this. It seemed that he was not even interested in doing a sequel. His acting was good, but it could be better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the cast, because in my opinion, they are not even worth mentioning. But I'll do it. Alison character does not even hardly featured in the first part of the film. Suddenly she was in the spotlight next to Stanley Caldwell. The role made no sense, and it has to be thought out a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. Its effect was significantly lower than decent and casting people had to look for someone else, someone else. Director Mike was confused character. He seemed to aim for being there, but it seemed his death was necessary. Acting on this part was good, nothing special, but better. <br /> <br /> Salem plot was real lousy if you think about it. Stanley, who is presumed dead, makes his way to the set of "Little House on the Lake", the film based on his script. He stumbles upon a director and for a short time, the director died, and Stanley running the show. So, out of the blue crew just going to let this stranger came into the picture and finish the film about it knew nothing. There's some kind of murder, not a lot, and one that said funny. One of the actresses on the set getting an electric shock during the filming of the scene. Another character gets chewed on a motorboat. And one becomes entangled in the plant before you drown. These writers have been hard for concern. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not impressed filmed. How it has changed from looking low budget back to normal I started to get irritated very quickly. Furthermore, the new cabin on the lake was poorly designed. We do not show it, but only in a few scenes, and all of this chain was of no use in the cellar. He worked in the first film only because they showed us the room much more, but it does not work in this. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. All of them except for a few had no reason to be there. Actions that little show was very bad, and ... they just do not have a purpose in this film. <br /> <br /> In general, "Return to the Cabin on the Lake" is the sequel to collect from where the first left off. "Little House on the lake," I can take, but it's just not impressive. Judd Nelson should avoid this one and so should. It's nothing like the first, and he went all too slowly. Nothing happened during the first hour, and he continued to reach for second. Not to mention the fact that the letter was terrible. Put it only if you need help to sleep. <br /> <br /> Thus, we see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and well. By the way, he says, it sounds as it could be a possible third contribution to cinema is only good in itself. Quit throwing in the spinoffs, and we can not be good! <br /> <br /> (or the filmmakers do not realize that they showed us how they filmed the scene on the lake from the first? They are all made in the side. Never, never reveal the secrets of filming). <br /> <br />
