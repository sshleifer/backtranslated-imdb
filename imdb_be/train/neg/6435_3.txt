I find it hard to believe that someone has put this film in the same context as an exorcist. Where the exorcist was a subtle and terrible, Stigmata was blunt, clumsy, and too formulaic. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen in a while, but do not shoot for a downward spiral patronizing statement, which makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film was at its peak, when it was compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official website of rose that interest. The web site had a lot of stories about the "real" stigmata throughout history. However, scene by scene, the film is so obsessed with his search for a "genuine", it becomes comical at first, then once it is difficult to look towards the end. I started to get suspicious when a priest asked to investigate the possibility of miracles goes to a beauty salon, where our heroine potential cuts hair and apparently flirting with priests <br /> <br /> The plot :. A woman without a belief in God begins to receive Christ's wounds (stigmata), and confused and upset tests. The priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Is Frankie possessed by Satan, or vessel for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this film is that it finally ends.
