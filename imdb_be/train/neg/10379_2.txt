The film begins in 1840, Japan, which Slashes man his wife and her lover to death and committed suicide. It is very bloody, bloody sequence. Then he jumps to the present day ... well, 1982 to be exact. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George), and their annoying little baby step in Japan for her husband's work. They rent a house, and - surprise! surprise - it just happens to be the house where the murder took place! Three of the dead people around as ghosts (makeup is hysterically bad), and make life hell for the family <br /> <br /> That sounds fine. - but it's really hopeless. There's a bloody hole and does not end, and nothing happens between them. There is an attack of giant crabs, which is simply a violent! They look so fake - I swear I saw one pulling the strings along - and they were muttering !!!!! There's also a meaningless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (maybe just to show George the body), another 40 minutes later (but it was necessary to the plot), and really stupid exorcism through. The fight between Albert and arcs McClure must see to believe <br /> <br /> As for the action -. Albert was in order, as a husband and McClure were pretty good as a family friend. But George - as always - stunning in a lousy movie. It gives the film a much needed upgrade - but could not save him. I give it 2 just for her and the bloody opening and closing. That aside, this is a very sad movie.
