The current figure is a little tight, as if it were the first time the people of the actors appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the best actresses, Gene Simmons (played many bit roles on television as in Star Trek TNG in the Heat of the Night), die quickly, and then its effect can be noticeably missed. <br /> <br /> leading role Ballard is drawn Cliff Robertson. Cliff to wear this film with his body language for most of the time. He does not do a bad job, but it's a bit too much to ask the actor to connect the oceans empty screen time, during which the characters spend their time do not say, and do not act. The most memorable part of Robertson, perhaps Uncle Ben in the last three Spider-Man films (starring Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. Husband kills his rich wife for her money. After that, his wife seem to return and haunt the husband behind the wheel with his mind, until he comes out of a high window (fearing the ghost of his dead wife, his upcoming) that day, he predicted does not die, no less. <br /> <br /> second driver employs Ballard looks like the British Mark Hamill. Strange indeed! The only thing that stands out is a complete disregard for the dialogue. Many minutes pass in silence, no one speaks, and little action. It's a shame MST3K guys never got hold of this film. It could have been much better if not as predictably, with great dialogue, or shorter scenes "nothingness." <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for the red-eye G'Mork to emerge from the shadows and declare that he was working on the "nothing" that inhabits this film.
