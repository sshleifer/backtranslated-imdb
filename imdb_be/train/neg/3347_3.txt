I do not know why I like Dolph Lundgren. I think he saw it on the screen makes me feel that anyone who works can succeed, regardless of talent. It is a good feeling for all of us who do not have enough talent. Some of the other reviews indicate how dumb detention there, but many people forget to point out the positives. <br /> <br /> Any film in which at least one annoying teenager dies can not be all bad. Why are so many movies that are acting teenager should always include the stereotypical teenager? Is not there any other kind of teenagers? Is every group of teenagers alone angry black guy? One genius nerd that nobody likes? One slutty girl who is very friendly and (in the film) is pregnant? One bothered antisocial white kid from a dysfunctional family who all agree talented (but what is talent?). And one laid a black child, which is in harmony with the universe, and so great that all other neurotic children trust him. Then add a few general supplies teenager any color. They do not say much, but get a shot at some point. <br /> <br /> The detention would have been better if the bad guys got to blow up the school. Advantageously, the authors inside. The dialogue is bad, and the plot is worse. If the bad guys (and girls), and finally, to steal a van full of drugs, they are sitting in a van decorated. They drive the van to the school because they want to repaint the wagon in the paint shop of the school, but they never get around to re-paint the van. By the way, it would be easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or other van or truck and drive away without repainting police van. Moreover, they never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with a large number. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide that they should kill the children and teachers (Dolph Lundgren), although if the villains take on at school nobody remotely aware of this, because it is after school. A handful of people still in school have nothing to do with the painting of vehicles, so why go after them? <br /> <br /> In any case, the best part of this movie is that all the thieves are armed with numerous guns, and they continue to find a teenager (including the guy in the wheelchair), and they continue to fire hundreds of bullets adolescence and usually miss. Toward the end of the film there is a bloodbath. For every time someone gets shot, there should be at least three hundred bullets that miss. Tricks pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one review that said that the film had a budget of $ 10 million, and I'm surprised. When I saw the film, I thought maybe Lundgren did so in some charity work of a film school, where he is a teacher. How can it be, this film has been their year-end exam. It was a test, to see him, but I passed.
