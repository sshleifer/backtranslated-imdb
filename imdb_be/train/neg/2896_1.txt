I could not sit through the whole movie itself. There are families, like this actually exist somewhere? There has been a lot of comments that describe the family as a sister LLBean models and such, and I think it's a great description of how they behaved. <br /> <br /> More than absurd incredibly recording / actions occur how we meet the character mentioned in high school as a «Pigface», which, of course, grew up in the drop-dead gorgeous 20-year-old the Harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but only do good in the world, not for money), and it is Steve Carrel bed on the first date. That's when I stopped watching ... <br /> <br /> If you can fully suspend disbelief for two hours, and then, perhaps, you will enjoy this sentimental, self-indulgent waste of time.
