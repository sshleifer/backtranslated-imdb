This series is interesting to observe how the MST3K feature, but for today's audience that the whole thing. I was very surprised to see what year it was made in 1952. Considering the fact that only makes this solid (modest?) 2 in my book. Cars used do not look modern, they look at things from the 30s. It basically Cody (lonely world salvation? Sheesh talk about insulting all the others, as the military), in any case, it Kodte his nipple rings flying suit against Graber and Daley are two dumb * ss henchman who sports guns and gun it will from time to time the beam is quite lame in its own right, enjoy. If you want to look really good serial flashing Gordon, it is full of missiles that are attacking each other, and good evil nemesis, as well as look good woman, it does not have any of it. And the outbreak was made 15 years or so before that shit, so you can give him some slack. What has been done in 1952, it's bad, deserves 2. Nuff said. give it a 6 if your watch MST3K episode, these guys have good fun with it; My version of the nipple Here tweek here and I'm flying! And now, as an added bonus, I bring you the theme song Commander Cody as originally performed by Joel and his two signs boots Tom Servo and Blood on board the satellite of love to a series of eight The Enemy Planet: <br /> <br /> (singing the beginning of the loan); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO sings) YOUR WATCHING COMMANDER CODY .... he is a new sign with the Republic, <br /> <br /> He gets into an accident every week ... but he saved by editing < br /> <br /> JUST TWEAK OF nipple ... SENDS his way, <br /> <br /> pumpkin head and jetpack .. .. save the day, <br /> <br /> (Joel pet ) HIS LABRATORY IS boxing ring ... IF NOT GUYS COME TO MIX IT UP, <br /> <br /> SOMEBODY ALWAYS steals. .. and Cody to fix it, <br /> <br /> He drinks tea AT AL'S CAFE ... and flies TOGETHER ON THE WIRES, <br /> <br /> beats crooks and fly hook .. . And to put out forest fires, <br /> <br /> (CROW sings) <br /> <br /> bad guys BEWARE ... CODY there, <br /> <br /> you will be like his hair is under HIS HELMUT ... And because we can not think of a good rhyme, <br /> <br /> This is the end theme song ... COMMANDER Cody to sit straight back from outside GRANITE, <br /> <br /> & WATCHES section VIII, CAUSE an enemy PLANET
