Pretty scary, but watchable and entertaining. It's the same old story (if you lived in the 80s). Vietnam vets fight together against the injustice of his friends in the United States. A-Team meets the desire for death, my favorite! <br /> <br /> As time goes by, the soldiers go home, and a few years later, a friend in trouble. No, wait - in fact, one dead, and his father, who is in trouble. Our first hero, Joey killed very scary (super pointy) meat tenderizer, as he tries to protect his father's small shop on the local "protection" of the gang despite the wheelchair with the war. Desperate to help his father talking with Sarge, the old block leader Joey from Vietnam when Sarge indicates a funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, squeaky wheel gets the grease, and the old gang saddles up for the city. You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that drove me crazy that Sarge holds the flame of his people about planning and how they are actually a good thing that they do when they are planning ahead. But Joe would not put in a wheelchair shot in Vietnam in the first place, if the device was not dawdle! Then, when things are going very well in the city, as they struggle with gangs, they do it again. For no reason at all, they completely bypass their plan and try to beat the gang without all those present. FN !!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Nonsense! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspect when all present members of the bloc not forget to try heroin, they snatch from the gang to make sure that it's real. Every one of them. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Keep looking, I guess. The film is not very scary to watch, but it's teasing. There are all these climactic moments when nothing is actually happening is not completed. The most dramatic things that happen are at the beginning of the movie -. Explosives in Vietnam, the death fight Joey and the gang brutally kicking innocent teddy bear away (! Poor Teddy) <br /> <br /> I think my main beef with this film, I feel pulled them. Even podagovory confused with the "mysterious helpers" and their bizarre motives cross appointments have not been enough to keep him in the end. But someday, maybe it will all come right, and they will make a sequel. Ha ha ha ha !!!
