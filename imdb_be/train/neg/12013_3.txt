I have realized that any film with a poltergeist lady will not be good at it. It actually begins well, but at the time of the first murder scene did you know that the movie that you are watching this film within a film. There are people sitting in a movie theater watching this film. One girl in the audience is so annoying that I'd turned and strangled her. A bit strange, but it is far from good.
