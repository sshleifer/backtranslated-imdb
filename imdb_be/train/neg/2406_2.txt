From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of cinematic sludge. Presumably, based on the work Haggard, the only similarity bonded to anything Haggard actually wrote that this is happening in Africa (although Africa, which has the dinosaur - what our intrepid adventurers used to pull their canoes), and has some characters with the same names. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John COLICO), mounted on a treasure hunt, armed only with a medallion, and ultimately exactly where the treasure, pure chance. On the way they meet a motley assortment of very poor monsters to choose a French chef, and McCallum dealing with the Queen of Phenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so funny, is the cry. This is the only reason why I did not give him one.
