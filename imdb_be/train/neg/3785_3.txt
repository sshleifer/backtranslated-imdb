Spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an Gangsta. History is not worse than any number of gangster movies, but never confuse this movie with Godfather I or II of, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film occasionally painful to watch all these Italian American swaggering around dropping bad gangsta line in worse u'an fake accent. Pacino would be great if they could just duplicate it. I'm looking forward to see Abrahams and Lodge, but their accents steenky spoiled the fun. <br /> <br /> Also, the scenario is not too hot, either. Don Corleone would have made it disappear in five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the back all the time.
