I would give this film scratch. Funny effects and action. The only reason to watch this film so you can see how bad it is. Let's start with the child, who plays Brian. What a freak! I could not believe that the mullet! Then there was a conversation with himself. I believe that they can not simply remain silent film, but still. Of course, they had to have it, too skinny naked is not something that I would like to see. Jared gave a great performance, in comparison with the special effects department. All of the bear before the accident was that I could make myself better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had nothing to do with the production, seeing how the film was not even called Buyan. Finally, I do not think that the writer never read the book, seeing as nothing was the same. I think that this book was great, but this film is like stinky smelly goat!
