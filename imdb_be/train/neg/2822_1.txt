OMG this is one of the scariest movies IV have ever seen and I've seen a lot IV student of cinema. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie is in this film? She needs the money that bad? I love AJ and saw almost everything Shes ever been in so I watched this 2 Check other off. It was SOO bad! even not good bad, just bad bad. It was 1 or 2 funny moments, but overall it was a bad waste of paragraph 101 minutes. I can not even say, the AJ looked good in it, because well she did not. The plot is predictable, if you do not expect Mr. retelling of Romeo and Juliet, it is not. All around disappointing. Maybe if your 12 it may be a good movie, or I do not recommend it.
