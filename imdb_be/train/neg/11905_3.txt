With a tendency to repeat itself, Wenders has been a consistent disappointment since he hit it big in "Paris Texas". <br /> <br /> Â«land of plenty" is no exception. Given the fact that I was expecting mediocre mid-film before, when I went to the ambitions Wenders seems to always get the best of him. Needed for grated today his films are heavy-handed and pompous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I was watching a comedy that makes fun of middle America or a thriller. The result of the nature of Diehl is quite predictable. Wender insistence on layering a lot a lot of scenes with some rock song too much irritating. He covered the hole in his screenplay and direction jazzing scenes. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that many people will find this film is important and resonant, but in all honestly, it's clumsy and teaching efforts only say poor direction. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Wenders publicly that doing "Paris Texas", he had a lot of help from Sam Sheppard scenario. Yes, it was Wenders better and he needs to understand now he needs a good writer. His films of the last 15 years + have been a mess.
