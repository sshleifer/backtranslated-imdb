well, this film f * ck in the rules. it is without a doubt one of the most technically inept piece of cinema ever made. absolutely awful, but you have to see it. rent it with your friends and come up with a drinking game or simply have fun, it's fun. and behind the scenes of the short film proves it, you can do anything with paper plates and paint with your fingers. strange. in order to rent it only for this one scene: two characters actually WALKING for about 3 minutes in the frame. Director (in the comments) says "yes, tracking was so smooth, it looks as if they are ...". Yes, the man, they go completely in place. it's so funny.
