When I first saw this movie, I thought that it must come from the children's section - This is a very fun and sometimes humorous, and is actually a very good story, but it is severely lacking "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are able to supply. I should note that Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and his performance extraordinary, but it is the only exception. This film is a bit forced, direction lacks substance, and yes ... music ridiculously horrible, he did not put me in a good mood. But if you do not expect intelligent, well thought-out comedy / romance tale, it can certainly be interesting, as I said..it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends a good relief from the boring, almost tense search for Tim Robbins to steal the heart of Meg Ryan. A very controversial film, but by the time it is not serious it may be a good movie.
