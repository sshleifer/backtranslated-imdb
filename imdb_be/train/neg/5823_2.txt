"Drawing restraint 9" is a kind of movie either love or hate; Fortunately or not, but I left him with a strong sense of wasted time and be thoroughly stuffed "whaling is bad" propaganda Aesthetically, the film could be pleasant,. especially its first half, it is not clear that every action depicted allegory serve different aspects of whale hunting. as long as it can be a bit funny to look at the daily chores of working in Japan, but later it becomes obvious that everything that appears onpropaganda screen appears, and no frame is no exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film uses mostly old morality play device, where the "good" and "bad" does not appear in the action, but set in stone. Maybe it's just me, but I find this kind of art shallow and biased, even if it's all about the noble (no sarcasm here) seeking to protect the environment. <br /> <br /> in my opinion, it is a mortal sin if the material is drawn out of the film, without any justification, etc. Only in the stretch. In my opinion, Â«Drawing restraint 9" could have easily fit in 75 minutes, but it has a winding length of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but it was not enough to leave the 15-minute intervals nothingness without notice. The film does not have a standard script, and there is no evolution of the characters, but also is not a documentary, but rather a kind of conceptual installation. This is an unusual shape for a movie, but it still can be considered as art, even if the concept is simple and naive as it is here. Here I also think that the director must have some integrity and do not pretend that it can be delivered only in not less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, the music score is mainly reminiscent of whale sounds. How strange. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
