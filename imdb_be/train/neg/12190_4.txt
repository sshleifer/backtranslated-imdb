One of the worst Scorsese. Average thriller; The only thing to recommend this De Niro plays a psycho. Finals, as a rule of the genre, ie, over-the-top, with another almost invincible, immune-to-pain villain. I do not like the 60s original, and this version was not much improve on it. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted their time on rework. Again, given how bad his last films were (I mean it dull Buddhist cinema and all those with his new favorite actress, blond girl DiCaprio), it is not even so bad in comparison. And considering Spielberg wanted to make a remake of ... could be much worse.
