I was not totally impressed by this film. It was originally named the Sin Eater and was to remain so, given that it's everything that was said during the last half of the film. I'm not even sure that the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any with the rest of it. It was very slow, and there was a choice of RoboCop (Peter Weller) as one of the protagonists. It was a sad moment. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd say check it out if you are in things related to the Catholic religion, but do not expect Exorcist or from this movie Stigmata. This is definitely a flop in a few days, and the word gets out.
