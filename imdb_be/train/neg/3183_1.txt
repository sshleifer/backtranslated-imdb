Sergio Leon rotating in his grave ... If there was a movie that violates a person's life is his work. "Lone Wolf" bravado protagonist is boring and lame, and the script was written, apparently the monkey with the formation of eight classes. Whoever had the idea it should be horse whipped. The only reason why I spend time trashing it is because there is a minimum of 10 lines. Sergio Leone's family should sue, and not because his shit, but because now it perpetuated crap MST 3000. Shame. Aversion. I blame Hollywood ... at least, Gary Busey doing shit that wont hurt, but cocaine users and experts of weapons ... this film is pure blasphemy.
