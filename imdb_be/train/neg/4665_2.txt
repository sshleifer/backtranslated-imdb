I really wanted to love pillow book. Intriguing plot, interesting characters shape, Ewan McGregor in a very nice at all. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway was so captured by presenting the film clearly, and not in favor of the film. I did not even get into the bottomless action Vivian B. <br /> <br /> You are distracted from the story of 4 billion tiny windows and calligraphy, which rolls along the bottom of the screen displays the lyrics of the music being played. He seems to have lost sight of real history and development of the plot, and confused with Foo-Foo decorations, which have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like a portrait by John Singer Sargeant in Chintzy frames Hallmark, who says "Grandma loves me!". In big shiny letters <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a victim of ego filmmaker director instead of what it might be - exciting and terribly beautiful. In the hands of another director (Wife? Coppola?) This could be a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it is best attributed to the fine arts classes, who are also taking themselves too seriously.
