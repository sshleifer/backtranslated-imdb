I can see a good movie now and then bloody. I've seen some pretty sick stuff. Nevertheless, it is one of the few films that I found to be grotesque in a way that was just disgusting and vile. I love movies gore when they have fun. Wen I like it a lot of creativity behind them. The blood in this film is not creative. He's sick. It's disgusting. This is quite unpleasant. Because of this, this movie is certainly not interesting. The film is a horror film, but it lacks the horror stories. So pretty much the only reason why one would watch this movie for gore, but it is the most unsightly and ugly aspect of the film, and that says a lot. Actions scary story does not make sense, and the music is really annoying and too electronic sounding. All this took me right out of the movie. Pretty much the entire movie is one big long depressing ordeal. There's this guy who has an accident in the shuttle and waking up at the hospital to find that his skin dissolves and melts away. I think that after that he goes and eats human flesh, to slow the melting process. There's some strange podagovor involving an old couple getting chased by a dog, some dismembered head floats flow and ending with man in the electric chair. There were times when I was trying really hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the entire film, I thought that even the entertainment was a scene early on in which a nurse escapes hospital corridor in slow motion. If you love the ugly, ugly, ugly advertising horror movies, this one is for you.
