The plot sounded like it was a promise. Honestly, I have not watched the whole movie. About an hour into the movie, I had to make a decision. Not this film worth watching, as he concluded? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body can not receive a transplant from another species, not rejecting it. Also the room that he was being chased by secret government agencies for human / wolf transplant. This was because the film was poorly written, acting lacked emotion, and I did not realize some dream sequences with wolves and buffalo. When it was launched to the zoo with a dog and a flock of leaving them in front of the zoo gates saying "If you can not run with the big dogs do not go out on the porch," hovering in my mind to be bored. Save time and skip this movie. I can guarantee, if you can watch it you'll sit there slack-jawed, as I wonder why someone would spend money, time, energy and effort to make this insulting outrage in the American cinema.
