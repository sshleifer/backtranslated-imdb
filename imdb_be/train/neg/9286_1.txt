OK first of all let me say that I still wonder how the story sucks, <br /> <br /> But than again it movie that sequels to the film Steven Segal Steven Seagal is not only OMG !!! <, Br /> <br /> just occasional low budget action scenes really does not make sense, I 'm not still wonder I burned 90 minutes to do this shit !! <br /> <br /> just to make a film of Jackie Chan or go see WWF more fun and never has, and can not afford to have the plot !!! plz plz plz avoid !! By the way the best actor playing nO Goldberg and it says a lot !! <br /> <br /> and no he does not play very well, as I said, plz avoid this Pfff, I still can not believe I wasted 90 minutes and spent 10 minutes longer writing this !! :)
