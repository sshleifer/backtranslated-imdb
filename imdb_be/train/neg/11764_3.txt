I must say that I'm really looking forward to viewing the film and find a new life in it that would separate him from the sad and extremely intent Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I trusted Sexo, Pudor in Lagrimas be the one to give freshness and confidence in our non-existent industry. Maybe it's because the soundtrack (which I listened to before I saw the film) sounded different, maybe it's because he has dared to include new faces (except Demián Bichir, which is always a favorite of Mexican directors) and, presumably, gathered in this script with modern social behavior, it may be because I have seen pictures in the trailers were vivid and realistic rather than theatrical. The film turned out to be the main grandstand and the main disappointment. Serrano that actually has to deal with here is a very old-fashioned "Battle of the Sexes", as in "all men are the same" and "why is it that all women ..."; blah-blah-blah. There is nothing new in it, not even the fact that it does not use as many common and cliché that he eventually makes fun of himself, leaving no valuable reflection on women's / men's condition. Full normal tramp on the audience, as safe fun on the stamps that I mentioned earlier (they always work, always) and shouted speech (it is well acted film in its context) and yell .. I mean, literally. In the first more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demián Bichir are in accordance with Serrano over the helpless one. I do not agree with Serrano, they did not have to be processed in such a way only to serve as stooges for his lesson to come through ... it is certain that we have received HIS message and completely destroyed their roles, which were the only solid ground, what is the story could have stood. Anyway, it's still a very interesting film at times, and you probably have a good time, seeing it (if you are taking in order to manipulate them).
