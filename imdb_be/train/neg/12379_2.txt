"Condemned to become a" cult "?? The theater was packed, apparently, with friends and families of the production crew, because only a few of us went out in the first hour. <br /> <br /> songs were literally the most I've ever heard in a musical ?? "Do not take a short cut, honey, there's a wolf in the woods ..". Debbie Mazar eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most of the tunes lasted only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, who plays the wolf in this story to be a charming and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, formerly N'Syncer, lives up to his last name, he does not get old. He did not quite flexible with additional 50 pounds and junior high school quality cosmetics and is singing the melody. Seriously, this guy was in the vocal group? The rest of the actors are gender-appropriate, but can not do much about the sad scenario.

And it was not as offensive as «Crash».
