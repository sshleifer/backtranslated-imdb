This story of a romantic triangle between the n-th. African bugger, French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and Russian waiter who did not speak French and did not seem to have a shave. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, dreary and depressing, or shot on a foggy, cloudy winter days or in poorly lit rooms, where all bathed in a strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know, it's because the white balance was not. Each pale and haggard and exhausted looks shabby and dirty. Bony body and shot at close range, they look very ugly and unattractive. Moles, greasy hair. UK. Bad news in the film, where people spend a lot of time, either naked or sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother dies. All three characters return to his native village, where Stephanie, through a bunch of memories in the desert and predictably gloomy interiors, we see a little child Stephanie as a boy named Pierre. Mother dies. Well ... and that's about it, really. Character development is minimized, as is the history of denouement. <br /> <br /> I believe that the storyline is not linear (it would explain a lot, does not sequiteurs), but in fact, after the payment of my seven euros I do not feel in order to build the film itself: here that the director takes my money. Waiting for me to join the process of history clear and get your hands dirty, so to speak, asking too much. <br /> <br /> The film is a bunch of pretentious rubbish is made primarily from the desire to epater eh bourgeois (ie shock straights). I can see how it was shoo-in for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can understand why he did not get anywhere.
