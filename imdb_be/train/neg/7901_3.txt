,,, And that's bad because, at least, if it was a film Troma, it would have senseless violence and a greater sense of anarchic abandon what may have brought its ranking a bit. <br /> <br /> So, what we have instead is very tame (PG rated), lukewarm, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director, who remained unknown after) Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) -wannabe almost exclusively flat humor, a little logic, which made Gremlins works so well - fancy logic or not, no stress, no sense of adventure, and no violence or nudity, to replenish it <br /> <br /> While I'm sure a few. problems inherent to the film scenario - let's face it, no one could put those jokes so that they will be funny - it seems that the greatest blame must fall on his knees director, Bettina Hirsch. In more skilled hands, Munchies could be interesting. <br /> <br /> In the end, it starts as a lot of great adventure films. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) in Peru at an archaeological site. Simon slightly eccentric archaeologist who always floating the theory about the connection between the ancient sites and extraterrestrial civilizations. For example, he believes that he sees evidence of laser cutting on the ancient masonry. Thus, they are in Machu Picchu are looking for further evidence of Simon's theories, when they come to the secret chamber. Inside, they quickly find the animal they later dub "Arnold", one of the title Munchies. <br /> <br /> They take Arnold back home to a small California desert town. Simon, who thinks that Arnold probably alien creature has to go to a lecture colleagues, and he plans to tell a colleague that he finally has a foreign sample. Paul and his very cute girlfriend Cindy (Nadine van der Velde) remained in the care of Arnold, but since they have not seen each other for a long time, they leave Arnold unattended while they hop in the sack. <, Br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the brother of Simon Cecil (Corman also plays in a dual role), the owner of a successful snack companies, wants to pay off the house and the land of Simon - they're, adjacent to his own. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil hits the scheme to steal Arnold. Things gradually spiral out of control, and Munchies, having a mean streak to go along with their cravings for unhealthy food, begin flooding the city. <br /> <br /> That reads better as a whole than it is playing on the screen. The best shots in the film are those with the natural landscape in the background, for example, if the control characters on the edge of the desert cities. Interiors, except Cecil home, tend to look bad decorated, cheap sets, and, more importantly, they tend to show that Hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting up shots. Ironically, given the lack of design production as a whole, Cecil house totally gem, soaked in the inflated style of the 1980s, the first years up to the smallest detail, and stepson Cecil, Dude (John Stafford) was a fun counterpoint. Too bad, then, that he was a movie so quickly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Corman is a funny actor, but he comes across much better here, Simon, than Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up missing for most of the film. Cecil, wherein physically ridiculous wig and hair on the face, it is not only "evil capitalists" of the film, he is one of the classic inconsiderate, boorish character in Corman - it was one of his specialties, often capitalized as «Carol Burnett Show» (1967) parody. Unlike «The Carol Burnett Show», which is usually successful, because the director Clark Jones and Dave Powers was to explore ways to push parody just on the border of chaos, Hirsch is in the reins Corman way too far, and the character of Cecil simply do not work wrong. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems related to the director, not the least of which is a precarious walk and editing are completely FOC any possible suspension or convincing dramatic impact of the film. Even the scenes that should have been shoe-ins for drama amplifiers - for example, if Munchies pressed the old lady on the road - together too uncomfortable to have a big impact <br /> <br />. There is also a serious logical problems with the story as it stands. Location Munchie in the chamber to Machu Picchu come from? movie trailer, seems to indicate the answer to this question, but it was edited out of the final cut. A more serious problem is that, unlike the gremlins, there is no clear reason for Munchies go from cute, fluffy furballs-threatening monster. It just happens. In addition, since the PG Munchies persisted, and violence continues to soften when there are a monster phase, they never really threatening. They are also easy to send, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> However, the essence of the film is no suspense, horror, drama or making any of this other stuff, but the humor. It is intended more as a parody of Gremlins and countless robberies in his wake. The only problem is that the film is just not funny, although I chuckled a few times. A surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are soft clichés. Too much of the remaining material consists of non-sequiturs. Given the wrong time by Hirsch, it all just falls flat. There was the potential to make a film that while the parody was funny and scary, fun and anxious, cheese and suspenseful, all at the same time, ala Killer Clowns From Space (1988). Too bad, then, that the Munchies comes nowhere near.
