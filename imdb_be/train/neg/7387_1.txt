DVD was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes were terrible with the synchronization of sound and voice Segal did not it !!!! Pathetic! If the audio synchronization was better for about 5 minutes a poor story, the line and the actors have to get another job, because the movie business is not where none should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal had several good films in the early days of the most recent ones are a joke and should be an embarrassment to him, and the company that made it. <br /> <br /> If Seagal was one that he handled it better to what the other party has to run the show, because he has no talent what so ever in this. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete disgrace to everyone involved in its production, and a disgrace to all who saw it. I turned it off for about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will ask for their money back at Block Buster! Mark from Ontario, Canada
