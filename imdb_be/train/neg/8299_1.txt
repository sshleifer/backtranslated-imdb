Christmas Story holiday classic and my favorite movie. Yes, of course, I could not get enough if this film was released in 1994, I saw him on the opening day and was ready to enjoy. I went and having Digusted. Feeling that Rang True Christmas Story in a curious absence from this disorder. Red Ryder BB Gun is better to get than the Chinese top.And It's not very funny. Grodin is good but Buck Stops There. Bottom line: 1 star. Do not even worry.
