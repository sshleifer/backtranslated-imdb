***** WARNING may contain spoilers to be more exciting than THIS scar. **** <br /> <br /> Heres some good advice for anyone living in the UK Every time the channel 5 has an old 80's comedy on late at night, read a book instead. I am currently in the process of recovery after an attack, due to reading some of the comments on this film here. I'm actually shocked that someone actually said this movie was realistic! All I can say is, thank God, the Cold War never escalated anyway we might as well have given a Communist at our borders ... I found this film to the maximum deplorable hypocrisy, maybe it's just my perception of the British, which makes funny movie, who knows? But in all aspects of this film is not just terrible, his teeth grindingly terrible. <br /> <br /> I've never been a supporter of Bill Murray and his rubbish like this that justify his feelings for him. Do not get me wrong, I loved Ghostbuster, which was made only three years after this film. But it only brings Bill Murray really is. I can confidently say that I have not wasted my time so openly like this, as we see the first move operation Delta Force here, though the two films have more in common than you might think. 1 for first, they both have horrible workflow from start to finish, and 2nd. They were both riddled with cheesy cliché, everywhere. <br /> <br /> Heres one thing, these guys should be «U.S Army." However, they can roll around their camp, Willy nilly, the seduction of women of military police, and then fucks them silly in the Generals Quarters. It's about Random! This movie is terrible for this, I'm afraid. Do not get me wrong, I'm not a feminist sympathy, but the fact that the two women actually give hands on heels in love with the two characters soon after their arrest, allowing them to go free ... Twice, it is simply an insult to women's race. The fact that one ragged hair, fat bum mouth (Winger) and his hapless sidekick Ramis could just sweet talk myself in underwear deputy to which they fall madly in love with the two of them other than the ridiculous. <, Br /> <br /> Then there training scenes, where you can meet the detachment «Phycho», who unconvincingly threatened to kill anyone who touches him or his things, and then overweight guy (played by the late and great John Candy) who claims that he joined the army to "not pay $ 400 for an anger management class." leading loud neck Murray to pay tribute to the «Giant toe,» (WTF?) «Drill Seargent», who genuinely could not organize a pi $$ up in the distillery, not to mention his group of recruits. this whole scene is to make this a prelude loads of action scenes, with people who say "the way of your ass!" all the time, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> The scenes are then on display a rag tag bunch of solutions to pronounce tits of themselves on the assault course leading to the scene, where one of them fired wildly into the air on some passing bird with a gun, sprinkling clock tower with bullets. (Just like that. Yes, I said the film was a chance ... He narrowly escapes undisciplined and ...) in the end, leading up to the passing parade, where the hapless squad to make a magical turn around for two hours, (Mood to me, a miracle!) Thanks to some wise words of Murray, to which they then sent massive military none like dance routine to "General Provisions" geriatric before other troops. All this immense pleasure from their two girlfriends on the bench, which is actually supposed to be arresting them ... Everyone laughs it, though. This bit is not nothing but a strange, though. He then picks them to guard the new multi-million dollar prototype of Armored Vehicles in Italy (which turns out to be just a mobile home painted in green with gadgets loads on the inner side), stating that "This is exactly what you need this army!" Good. .. <br /> <br /> Then there is the sad ending, where Murray and Ramis decide to steal the top-secret prototype military vehicle to pick up his newly purchased and several hyperactivity MP Girlfriend in Germany. On that unlucky captain (Larroquette), I learned that a detachment of recruits and leads to the search for a mission of this vehicle. What they then take a "wrong turn" in the route and end up in the Soviet Held Czechoslovakia, where they were captured. (As we did not see that coming ...) Thus, begins an attempt to rescue Ramis and Murray + Bird in the hand to which, where a big fight, loads of shooting from the hip and tanks blowing up. they returned to the national heroes, humiliate Russian, calling them "pussies", etc., etc. The end. that's right. not the military tribunals nothing. They just stole a prototype military vehicle, drove it into the Warsaw Pact and the AMA l caused an international incident that could have sparked WW3! <br /> <br /> This film is honestly more fun that are diagnosed with a terminal illness, I know what it meant to be a comedy, it's got all the right actors for the him, but where in the hell is this? 5 canal cuts these bits? the only mitigating in this film is the re-use of naked women taking showers and female Mud Wrestling. (As I said, Random) not that she It helps to distract from the fact that it is absolutely crap movie, of course. This film should really be directed to immature 9-year-old year, unfortunately, we have to watch it instead. 1 star with 10 - Total scar. My advice is to do something more useful with your time. How to castrate myself ...
