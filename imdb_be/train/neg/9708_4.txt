When the theater staff to find the old reel, they decided to show it in the north of the screening of Night of the Living Dead, if we assume that this old previous drums. Unfortunately, this is actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns viewers into the shuffling hordes of mindless zombies. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the hatred of the film. This low-budget independent production with a lot of the camp, but he does not deserve "1.1" here on IMDb. It's so much fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have sufficient knowledge and love of old horror movies, and they have created an entertaining tribute to them and sprinkled with references to the various honors them. It has the form of things like Night of the Living Dead (in many respects, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of darkness, and various others. <br /> <br /> I liked the explanation of how the zombies, but actually just hypnotized to think that they are zombies, actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead incredible, maybe, but I appreciate the effort on the part of authors to explain this. Gore effects were decent for the budget, the action was all right, and the story was interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked.
