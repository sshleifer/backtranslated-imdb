Blank Check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties. The plot is completely pointless; its overtones of helpless loneliness. Do you really believe in the twelve-year-old acting as a personal assistant to a millionaire can do everything in this movie, how to buy a mansion just $ 300,000. The concept, not to mention the price dumping will believe only the most gullible audience. Please respect your intelligence and do not look that terrible, terrible film.
