To sit, how awful Shield, you would have to write, so suffice it to say pages and pages, it is a monument to bad directing. <br /> <br /> Â«If Director awry" should have been the title of this production. Indeed, leaders must infuse their work with a sense of visual style and narrative that propels the story forward. <br /> <br /> How is constantly shaking the camera and play with zoom lens "style"? As it is throwing the story forward? Of course, there are also "editing random numbers" nonsense. Apparently, it has become fashionable to simply cut at random. <br /> <br /> I think it's too much work to do a good editing. <br /> <br /> Well, I did it too much work for most people to see the shield, which languished as one of the most overhyped and unwatched shows of all time.
