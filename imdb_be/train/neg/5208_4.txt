This mini-series, also based on the book by Alex Haley, as he was `Queen», tried to use similar formulas, that is, building a family life following a long history of over many years. While in the `Queen» the result was a powerful, here Mama Flora inspiration is not enough. First, perhaps the most, and, of course, the book is in this television production. Too much is put in too much haste for many years, so that the disclosure of the saga is shallow, superficial, almost as naturally as in `Queen». Full marks for scenification in the earlier parts of the film, which has been prepared with great care, but as the movie progressed, it seemed, in his degenerate race dallasian-forsythian disagreeable mixture in the last third of his three-hour or so period. I was hoping for more; but, obviously, Haley was less inspired this story than his almost biographical `Queen», and Peter Werner III are not suitable for John Erman. Only recommended for those who have an appetite for these stories grow long generations.
