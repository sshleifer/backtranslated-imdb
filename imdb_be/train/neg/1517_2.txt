In the title, I am writing this story is ludicrous. Below I will go into detail and explain why, in my humble opinion, the ruins of this film. <br /> <br /> Gere and Danes are doing their job, and even though this is not their best work, it is quite normal. The rest of the cast, though, doing a very poor job. Keep in mind that this is not the actors fault. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones that have characters that have at least some room to the cinema to really give any depth. All other characters are either too little space in the film to create any depth, or the nature of such a cliché that it does not matter how much the actors try. <br /> <br /> Directed by Se7en bit complex, but looking only at the direction of, I think it does the job OK. <br /> <br /> but the story. This kind of scenario that is bad in two ways. First of all, it's a bad movie script. Shallow characters (for characters Gere and Danes, except), cliché villains and actions of the characters is absolutely incredible. In addition, the authors should have a program where they want to get our attitudes and ethical norms in a hundred years. This is the kind of movie that say that some criminals are still criminals, regardless of whether they have paid the price that society has given them. It is also a kind of film that says, although only between the lines, that every form of sexual deviation should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And, of course, in the film, everything that is not in the missionary position sex couple is sexual deviation. <br /> <br /> So if you are going to film school and want an example of a bad script, or if you write scripts himself and wants ego boost. Look. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
