Not worth the time or the video store or occasional efforts. <br /> <br /> * Cosmetics that a child can do. * Responsibilities ended did ... bad directing. * Editing was very choppy ... many things does not make sense or just seemed gratuitous. * The sound was poorly dubbed. * The music was very inappropriate. * The casting was very different ... I was on crack. * Zombies, what to say ... not to mention drive, dance, work ... just makes me mad. * A bad guy ... Holy Crap! How badly cast, he was ... he was the most beautiful of all the zombies. Which does not say anything. <br /> <br /> The cover was good, but very misleading ... as it was the main menu on the DVD ... a great work of art and music. <br /> <br /> DON "T worry!
