I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This film is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not an ounce of humor, Sun ounce of talent around. <br /> <br /> I am lazy. <br /> <br /> Usually, I see a bad movie and a curse. It was so bad, I actually did a survey to try to save others from very sad mess I was the victim. <br /> <br /> I'm breaking your copy of this film. <br /> <br /> it is too inaccurate to use even to clean the room. So sad. See "Blood Sucking Freaks" or "Shock, shock, shock" absolute crap, which makes sense as entertainment. This sludge looks terrible, terrible, and whoever did it must feel terrible.
