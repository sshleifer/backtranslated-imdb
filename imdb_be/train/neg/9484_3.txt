If I have to give this film points on a linear scale, I have to give it a low score 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was interesting, and there are some good things to say about the film. <br /> <br /> psychiatrist James Bishop candidate is appointed to St Andrews Hospital for their residents, and is closed, and aims to "change the world". <br /> <br /> from the beginning of the movie, you know that the hospital is hiding evil True, but James thinks he can make a difference and does not accept this evil. <br /> <br /> The story builds good enough, you know, all the time, what is true is that the patients talk about some kind of Resident Evil, and I wonder when and how to detect it, James. In addition, when a break occurs, James, in a sense, hunted by evil, and you feel some intrigue to "fight" is over. <br /> <br /> Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend who arrives at the wrong time, and other standard elements of horror, and you get the picture. <br /> <br /> increase your character is actually quite good, you introduced for the majority of people who are killed, some of them you "know." <, Br /> <br /> film sets unpleasant scene, it is also done quite well. There are secrets that are open. - acceptable way <br /> <br /> The main character, James is very true - story of eager student begins to work well in this situation <br /> <br. /> What kills this film: * The stupid special effects - a modern version of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" -type bad (evil monster looks like a stuffed red) * some bad action (or perhaps very little interest, if shooting) - protagonists sometimes it acts badly and Somtimes well. * Sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> All the time I thought, "I could make a film like this with my home video camera" throughout the film.
