Wow ... the existing luster. <br /> <br /> Turn Thriller / suspense / horror comedy. <br /> <br />, before ... funny story of 3 characters that have been developed just insanely After watching this I have never laughed so hard in a horror movie. - or it is not written in the depth or too much depth <br /> <br /> If you want to watch completely written a horror film with a silly dialogue, the plot spoiled, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and rotten development as a whole, it is one to watch. <br /> <br /> Be sure to keep focused for the classic "food processor" scene and totally unsuitable police investigation scenes. <, Br /> <br /> This is a wonderful new low productivity and screen writing and sit through it during the whole time makes you a stupid, brave or courageous.
