This is the first film Guinea Pig from Japan, and it hurts my eyes. A bunch of guys trying Woman in a few days, before finally killing her. And at this moment, I would say that these films are not real! They fake horror movies that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scenes feel sick, but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, if they push the girl in the field, we can clearly see how they push and stump on the floor next to her! And how stupid it looks! Sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include the gut of animals, abandoned the girl, the girl is exposed to loud sounds over many hours, ripping off fingernails, worm, located on the wounds in the body of the girls, her eyes pierced and mutilated in a horrific details and the like. Very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing of value or kinematic significant. This is the first record of a patient and the most amateur Guinea Pig, though it is not as bloody footprints of the Flowers of flesh and blood, which is trying to be shocking, as much as possible <br /> <br /> guinea pig :. Devil experiment, possibly painful thing I've seen, and the closest to the tobacco there. This is still (of course) to forge a (n / m) uh, the only difference between the true "Snuff" is that no one dies or is hurt for real in this film. I can not recommend this to anyone as Thi S as S **** y and repels. Those who believe that this is a great horror film do not understand anything about the movie and the real meaning of this. I watched it as a curiosity (as in other parts of the series), and now I know how little trash it. They work only on the level of shock, and it is not too valuable cinematic achievement. Devil experiment, perhaps a sick movie that I have seen, and the mermaid in the mine (Guinea Pig 4), perhaps the most disgusting movie I have seen. So it's pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
