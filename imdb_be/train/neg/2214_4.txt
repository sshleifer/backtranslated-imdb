this film was absolutely brutal, but it was very bad. the current was actually very good! Jeffrey Combs made a heck of a good job as a mad scientist who is a kind of his specialty, if you do not know these things: D. Bill Forsyth .. Well, I'm not quite sure why he was in this movie. he's too good to do interesting things, and its role is not very demanding. I rented it on the strength of these two wires, and I was not disappointed. I mean, hell, it's a film about the half-man / half-shark. This is not Shakespeare people. In addition to the story, which is full of holes, and bad dialogue, I would like to point out that the cinema is also a lot of things left to be desired. shots were they trying to look "cool", but ultimately obscuring the scene, or just takes a simple cheezy. They also blew it many times when they had a decent dialogue and cut off prematurely in the face can even put a line. it was very bad. but if you're a fan Jeffrey Combs, this one is worth checking out. He gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. Foresight is not bad, and is either a female role. hell, I remember her name though. The bottom line, I would not waste my time otherwise.
