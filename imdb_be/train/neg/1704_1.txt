You would not expect a movie as well, and it is not. This is not a budget, ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a handheld camera is not bad ... and it's fun. Actors, obviously, never acted before, and it shows in their dreadful cheerful readings. There is no plot, so as not to be seen. Small plot I could find, it would seem that the government survived the experiment and a group of zombies seems to be terrorizing a couple of families. Gore effects are actually some of the most disgusting I have ever seen. It seems that Gore effects people raided the butcher shop for all parts of the body, and many of the scenes connected with the division of zombies eating people and their authorities. It is funny and sick movie, and that's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie <br /> <br /> My rating :. BOMB / ****. 90 min.
