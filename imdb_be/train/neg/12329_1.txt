Back in my days doorman "Private Lessons" played in the 4-Plex I worked. It was a sleeper hit sold out Friday and Saturday for a few weeks. I never bothered to see him, but saw that the cable this last weekend, so I decided to give it a chance. What I've seen over the next 90 minutes was one of the worst films I have ever seen, and one that made me very uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> the main story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexual maid (Sylvia Kristel). It also seems to feel attracted to a boy, but for more sinister reasons. Thus, we get the boy scene, watching as she undresses her to invite him to look at. And it goes from there. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, as a teenager, to be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. His "frightened" reaction whenever Sylvia removes an item of clothing or if she touches his awful. I did not laugh once during this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And let's not get started on the plot maid and driver planning to extort money from the kid. Let's just say it involves faking death, burying the body .... I could go on and on, but it becomes more and more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The sex scene is the worst I have ever seen. While Eric Brown was older than he looked, the fact that he looks like a child. It turns out that he has no idea how to kiss a woman (if it works then maybe I should rethink Brown has critical remarks), and it just came too close to the border with child pornography erotic. I've never been so excluded sex scenes, even if Miss Kristel quite nicely, and without clothes. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** I should make mention of the last scene. For me, it's just sick, but I remember the audience applause as freezing a frame of the film and dissolved in loans. Our hero is back in school and begins to take care of one of the teachers. He asks her out to dinner, and she gives him a look as if Tom Cruise just asked her. She nods yes, and it goes away, smiling at the camera in triumph. Give me a break! Yes, I'm sure the teacher would just around risking all plain looking teenage child. <br /> <br /> I could never understand the appeal of this film was in 1982. Of course, it was more than poverty, because there was a lot of teenage sex comedy with nudity, which bombed at the box office. And to think that these same young people who welcomed this film 22 years ago, is currently working its way up the corporate ladder, and perhaps helping to run the country. What a scary thought.
