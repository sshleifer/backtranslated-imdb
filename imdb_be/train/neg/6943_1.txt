This film is deeply idiotic. Man wants revenge for crime-, but when he plays his revenge- have a video camera showed up at him all the time. What is a person with a brain cell in your head will sit there and do it for so long in front of a video camera? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this scenario can not happen except with someone unable to dress themselves ruined it for me, but he was stupid !!! <br /> <br /> I mean, the writers have serious habits that prepare their brain cells and make them miss the plot holes you can drive a battalion of armored through <br /> <br /> site :. man seeks to avenge the death of loved ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes completely wrong, then suddenly unfolds <br /> <br /> If. Only those people who write the story was not so foolish as to write a completely unrealistic plot turns that can never happen. For writers, I say- seek help from your serious mental problems.
