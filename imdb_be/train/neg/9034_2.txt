History is a bit slow and a bit ridiculous. Greta Garbo did not look very good, and I could not understand half of what she said, because her accent, which has been exaggerated for the role. Melvyn Douglas, meanwhile, is playing its normal role of unsympathetic and Constance Bennett just for a couple of her screams, which were funny, except. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I want it to be more lines, he disappeared in the second half of the story. It was also interesting to see Ruth Gordon looks so young. I've only seen her in such a crazy role she played with the end of the 60s to the 80s and exhausted old woman. History-wise, the best part may have been the last few minutes, when we see that a stuntman doing strange things on skis, pretending Douglas falls down the slope. It was strange and humorous shots <br /> <br /> In general, I can see where this film. - Garbo in the past - was not a box office success. He just pulls too much going on and on about deceptions. It's annoying story. Garbo knew it, too, and called it quits.
