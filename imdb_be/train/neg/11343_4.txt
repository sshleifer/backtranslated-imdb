First observed 2003/02/02 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Kammerud Jim & Brian Smith): Drab and un-spectacular assumed continuation of the original animated classic '101 Dalmatians. " Thus, the film continues where it left off in the first, but the problem is that he plays just like the original. One of the biggest things was the original Shagan history, which this one does not. The animation is also very nya entertainment for Disney and we all get the same characters who go through the same stories over and over again. If Disney is going to stop boring us with sequels and re-do, etc .. etc. Perhaps when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare, that they put out.
