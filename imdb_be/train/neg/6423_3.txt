The first 30 minutes were Tinseltown my finger poised on the remote control is ready to be poured around to watch something else. The premise of the two writers, down on their luck, living in self-storage space "Ben" was a little funny, but painfully insipid <br /> <br /> The introduction of the character played by Joe Pantoliano. - a big deal movie guy living in the park and sleeping in the toilet, offered hope, and I decided to give him a few more minutes. And then a little more until the introduction of Kristy Swansons as a promising director and a borderline nymphomaniac, I added a bit of spice. Her firm implementation of the action raised the presence of above and beyond to include only very polite eye candy. <br /> <br /> In the end, a clear impact on the low-budget film with a bad shot scenes, stuttured pace and sham-treatment with some moments. Some of my favorite films of all time was a low budget, Whithnail and I be the one that also has to do with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck. <br /> <br /> However, for my money, the actors keep the Tinseltown of the "Terrible movie" archives and just about pushing it into a "cult could be" archives. I laughed at some of the scenes featuring the character Pantoliano ~ d in. In particular, the penultimate scene in the clich√©d scary, but it's still funny, rich, but, screwed-up marks the house where the story unravels in the side of his last moments. <br /> <br /> I can see how Tinseltown was a great stage play, and while the filmmakers have done their best to put it on film, it just did not work, and while I laughed at some of the scenes and ships I think the first 30 minutes dulled their feelings and expectations of such a degree I would laugh at anything. <br /> <br /> If you do not get stuck in the novelty coffee coaster, Sun take it when you see it in the bargain bin.
