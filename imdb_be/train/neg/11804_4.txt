This 1973 TV remake of the classic Billy Wilder inferior to the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, the good stuff. Lee J. Cobb makes a stunning Barton Keyes. He's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but it is the only reason to look at it. The only improvement in this remake of the original is that it reduces the role of Lola Dietrichson, stepdaughter on the femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's it for the good things. <br /> <br /> bad things for a long time. Director writes all indifferent: if you are watching a movie with the sound muffled, you are unlikely to get the impression that there is nothing particularly interesting happened. Because of modern bad taste, the film must be in color rather than black and white. Due 1970s bad taste, all the sets dissatisfied ugly. expensive apartment Walter Neff, in particular, is repugnant. <br /> <br /> The modern installation hurts many small things. Train rides were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s, so the solution g-Dietrichson, to take the train, seems to be more fiction. The men stopped wearing hats to prevent Walter from covering his brown hair, and create as a gray-haired gentleman Dietrichson. Women in mourning ceased to wear the veil, which robs Samantha Eggar of props Barbara Stanwyck made excellent use of a key stage. (Oddly enough, Lola still has a line where she reveals that her stepmother tries on a black hat and veil, before it needs them.) <br /> <br /> Steven Bochco retains much of the script Billy Uaylder- raymond Chandler same. But it makes a lot of small, unexplained changes in the dialogue, who reserves the script a bit senile, where once he was thin and muscular. Angered, the famous motorcycle cop banter there, but look closely and you'll see what looks like a post-production cut, where the lines were. Bochco may not be to blame. <br /> <br /> tilt pass as Walter Neff. What could make this version tolerant really lovely Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead, we get Samantha Eggar, who comes off as time thief with "Barnaby Jones." But who can blame Eggar? With a director who hardly seems interested in what is happening in front of the camera, as if Barbara Stanwyck he came off well?
