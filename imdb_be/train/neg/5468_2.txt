I absolutely love the series of "The Toxic Avenger", but it's a weak sentence people TROMA makes no sense, and it had me yawning all the time. <br /> <br /> leaking nuclear power plant (and weeds next to him) makes the youth with Tromaville High mad, which causes them to join a gang, sex, blow, and everything. In addition, there is some kind of monster breeding in high school ... my God, this film is a mess. <br /> <br /> The actors largely ceased their efforts after this, and they should. (Estimated) replay started on my nerves about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> unsatisfactory. 2/10.
