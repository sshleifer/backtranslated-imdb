There is no way to describe how really, really, really bad this film. It's a shame that I actually sat through this movie, it is a very tedious and predictable film. What happened to him? Acting: There is not a job that even remotely close to even being subpar (at least they are all very beautiful). Soundtrack (the song): "If we get the Orgy on the soundtrack, then everyone will know that they are watching a horror movie"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but anyone with a keyboard can make satisfactory Soundtrack these days. Do not even get me started on the "What the hell?" Moment, here are some of them: The killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens the actress is no one there, turns back, there is something sitting before her. From now, it shows where the killer with a drill, really great! The filmmakers get points, at least, to connect it, but can I really believe that the killer took the time to find an outlet to plug it. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Grail, and I want to say "where you get an electric drill?". I could go on and on about how bad this film, but I have only 1000 words. I'll give it 2 out of ten stars. one star made me laugh, and another star for all splitting. Seriously, do not waste your time with this.
