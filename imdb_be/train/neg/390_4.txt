I loved the student during the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now with the season 5? (Or is it 6?) Things are getting just too tiring. <br /> <br /> Earlier, I love the show, but became Donald trumps own ego Festival. Submitted its your company, you will work for, but come on! some of the things they say "you're fired" just insulting. <br /> <br /> After watching the show, I would not want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, proud or so. Its just that the show is unrealistic, and how he handles things just makes me squirm. Good entertainment? Yes, but tiring as back stabbing becomes so tiring .. it is not a command job, it's not personal, its just business. Watch connector back.
