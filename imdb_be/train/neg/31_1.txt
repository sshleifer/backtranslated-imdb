This is the biggest insult TMNT ever. Fortunantely, Venus officially does not exist in the canonical TMNT. There will never be a female turtle's gender, it happened on the tragic tale of men's 4 unique mutants that will never have their own family, when there was not more than. The biggest mistake was crossing over Power Rangers in TMNT with the terrible episode; turtles voices were wrong, and they all act out of character. They could do a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /> <br /> do not bother with these people ... it's crawling worthy material. flap lips slowly and looks unnatural. they are very disrespectful Schroeder. the main villain, a Dragonlord corny dude. Turtle looked corny with things hanging from their bodies, that thing around the thigh in the Rough? Silly looking sculptural plastron? <br /> <br /> If they look normal, act of nature and get rid of Venus, by getting rid of stupid kiddie cartoon sounds ... and better writing it might be good.
