The plot of the female nurse, named Anna, caught in the middle of the chaos of the world, as the flesh-eating zombies begin to rise up and take over the world and attacking the living. She runs to the street and the police rescued a black officer. So far, so good! I usually use a horror movie, but this part of the film does not deserve to be called horror. It does not even care, just ridiculous.Even «The Flintstones" or «Kukla, Fran and Oli" will give you more excitement. It's like watching a bunch of blood thirsty drinkers not being able to get to the mall to more than liquor. Heroes who made themselves inside the shopping-mall, not to be eaten by hooligans in the street, not better either. Despite the fact that they seem not to drink, they give the impression of mentally retarded children. Save your money instead of spending it on it!
