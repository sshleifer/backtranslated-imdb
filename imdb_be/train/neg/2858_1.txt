This should be one of the worst films of all time. The graphics were horrible, the effect would be the film and the effects were simply the Nintendo 64 qualified. You would think that they would put a little more effort into it. Of course, this movie Scifi channel so you have to expect that it will be a low speed, but this takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, as you shake your head in this movie sure this one does well. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there seems to be some "known" actors and actresses, that I find it hard to believe that they do not understand that the quality of this film is worth their time and effort. <br /> <br /> graphics may have been well into the 60s or even early 70s, but come on, it's 2009! I will not give spoilers with, let's just say that if you played in the "Jurassic Park" on the Nintendo 64, you'll be very familiar with what you see in this movie <br /> <br /> It is definitely has no price took 2:00 to sit through things
