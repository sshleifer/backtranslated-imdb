This must be the worst horror film I have ever seen. I remember watching him years ago when he first came out on video and for some strange reason, I thought that I loved it. So, like an idiot, I ran out to buy a DVD, when it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I will not even go into the plot, because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyway. I am a supporter of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to the cheese congealed blood effects and bad acting, but these people make it a completely different level. It's almost as if they are deliberately trying to make the worst film humanly possible ... if that was their goal, they suceeded. If they are intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way, shape, or form, that it is real, then they have failed ... miserably! Avoid this movie ... read the synopsis of the story, and you've seen it!
