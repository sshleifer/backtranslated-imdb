The golden era of Disney cartoons from the time of the end dies 90s. This show charlatanism package should not even be considered as a spin DuckTales, because the show just did not have anything to do with DuckTales. It is about a teenager, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, as they make trouble for his uncle Donald and speak in hip-hop slang, and they are fully dressed, in contrast DuckTales. I prefer a little adventure nephews with DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg and ducks are the only animals that live in Duckburg. There's no mention of Scrooge McDuck. History repeats itself, the plot boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of slapstick humor, I recommend it to you. If you want the best Disney shows to watch "Black Cloak" or "DuckTales".
