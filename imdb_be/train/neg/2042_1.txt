Zodiac. 1 out of 10. The worst acts ever. No actually not the worst acts ever. David Hess (Last House on the Left. ?? No ?? one of the seventies. Rent is very good) is the worst of the bunch (Pretty tough competition, but it is surprising god-awful.) It would be difficult to find a member of the cinema home with such inconvenient presence chamber. The film is actually painful screeches to a staggering stop, when he is on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities to Mr. Hess to death. He was removed from the home movie camera and appears to be quite old complete with attached boom microphone. A lot of post-production ever. Well, there has to be some sort of five-year shovelware computer could use that can clear the picture. Throw in bizarre footage film autopsy years of ups and carriers, and this is one screwed up image visually. Image autopsy intervened path of Italian cannibal films inserted into a god-awful real-life murder of animals. And the Navy personnel must be some kind of anti-war statement (Because we all know bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy) What in the world does the Lion Gate releasing this garbage? It would embarrass TROMA. The plot of the Zodiac (last seen in Dirty Harry. ?? No ?? one of the seventies. Rent is very good) Someone gets shot in the stomach in Los Angeles, and the police believe that the Zodiac was back? Uh-huh. What can you expect from a film that does not know that the DSM IV book is not a mental disorder, and where the young killer of an elderly man, the relationship resembles a congressional page and retired congressman? Yes Eighties haircuts and production value meet story NAMBLA. Sign me up.
