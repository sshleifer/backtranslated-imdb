I found this film to be a good idea not to put. It seems that they have found a way to build suspense, but they could not put their winnings very well. In one case, the police are on the watch, to find refuge kidnappers. They painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match dental records. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) comes out through the elevator shaft. After all accumulation, the police arrived at the same time he gets free, it is very anti-climactic to say the least. There are also great narrative scenes that take us "inside the mind" of terrorized husband and wife, which detracts from the unknown, rather than adding to it. We are fully aware of their strength, and vote for the insult and deprives the viewer of any chance of personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock proved time and again, is much more effective. The biggest disappointment to sit through the whole movie, and get a quick, relatively soft end. I mean it's just ... "ends" in snoring.
