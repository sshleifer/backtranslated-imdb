Worst film in the world. I do not even know where to start, but I hope I can save another person from punishment himself with this film. When it comes to action and lighting, this film looks like a bad porn without sex. Actors are among the worst I've ever seen, and could not be worse, even if they try to make a complete mockery of the film. The film was supposed to be a record low budget, which I'm sure was spent almost exclusively on the cover of the film. This film has now become a joke with my friends and has become the standard for comparing other trash films. I would like to note that none of the other film, does not even begin to compare. I feel personally responsible for the offer of a friend and me to watch this movie, and I'm surprised that she still considers me a friend after suffering I put us later. Nha see this movie!
