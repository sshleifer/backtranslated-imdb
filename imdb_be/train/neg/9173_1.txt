I've never seen the worst movie <br /> <br /> It is possible to take up shooting video game and turn it into a decent movie <br /> <br /> Error 1: .. absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this film, you do not communicate with any of the characters, because ... you do not get a chance <br /> <br /> The only character that pretty or interesting it is a deck hand :. Salish how to play Clint Howard. for this unique character with the exception of the outcome of the film does not make sense, because all the characters were lifeless from the start <br /> <br /> Error 2 :. worst shootout scene ever. I love the shootout. I love when the characters discover on badguys and clean house. Hell, I even like to watch Badguy clean home time. But this skirmish was strange, I think the best way to describe it is "indifferent" I've seen people shoot with a lot of feelings and emotions while playing video games. In this film, it looked and felt like the "actors" just went through shooting anything that moves without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where talking trash? where, in tangles of anger among the shots? They must be children who were caught at a rave spoiled ... but even real soldiers who act professionally and relentlessly show our humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want a good horror film about a detached house full of monsters, I recommend the Evil Dead series to Sam Rami. Do not see the evil that the house of the dead. I hope they burn the master and all copies of the film.
