When I saw previews for this film, I did not expect much to begin with - around the second-year teen horror film. But wow, this movie was absolutely horrible. And that future generous. <br /> <br /> First of all, the casting for the movie was awful. You do not feel any compassion (or for that matter any painful feelings) for the characters. The action was so scared that I was just waiting and hoping on God awful things to the end. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are moments in the film, which had no relation to the story at all. Can someone please explain to me why a girl's looking boy starts screaming "Pancakes !!!" at the top of their lungs, going to the Jackie Chan moves I've never seen before, and even more bites a guy who has virus? Why is the baby's father continue to be angry with the virus infected the guy and go to redneck hunting spree to find it? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said out loud: "Where the hell did that come from?Â» <br /> <br /> I just could not believe what I saw. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Fever tops them all. This film made me want to vomit, then vomit again. Then blow my brains out. <br /> <br /> Please, save yourself a half hour and do something more productive. Watching grass grow is perhaps an appropriate alternative.
