Camp Blood III is a significant improvement in the Camp Blood II, as it sounds mainly in the right places and rudimentary plot. This time they ventured a little farther away from the parking lot the other two films were made in which this is a good move, as you can no longer hear cars driving past, which should be remote desert. <br /> <br /> this time, there is a reality show and a fake clown to scare the opponent. This is hardly a new idea, I saw at least three other horror movies with exactly the same location where the real killer turns up, but at least this one has a story, rather than people just randomly stab wounds with a knife. <, Br /> <br /> Unlike the other two in the series is one of at least good for a few laughs. I liked how there gunshot sound effect, when someone gets a knife at an early stage and as the boom microphone hovering over people like a ghost. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone would want to do a third film camp blood, I would have thought that it would be better to start from scratch, but they at least tried it. Half-naked woman was too deformed, it looks to me like they were trying to maintain continuity in hiring some freak who would get her clothes for $ 5 in the same way as they did in the second movie. They have not yet been developed that machetes used to cut not to prick, but oh well, this film Camp Blood that you waiting for? If you want to buckwheat films you get a kick out of it.
