You know those movies that you are locked in a movie? You are stuck there in the best place in the house, in the middle of the line in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you get just the right place - and after that feels like 13 hours you are still closed there uncomfortable and itchy, thinking, "F *** if this film ever END ???» (you know the feeling - think of AI and the Village). <br /> <br /> Well, Visitor Q provides an amazing version of the senses. I sat there in the first 30 minutes wondering if the thing is going to f *** ing start! It's an endless! So «Arty» it hurts. This is the first film Miike Takashi I watched. Apparently, he does from a dozen movies and when they are all the same pretentious @ nk, as I suspect it will be the last. <br /> <br /> I do not mind the Pretentious @ nk. David Lynch there among the top 10 directors for me, but for the Q rating will cut rate, cheap and disgusting as pretentious @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you've worked out now - I hated it.
