Double has its moments, but they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is a class B mix of pop psycho-thriller, ghost stories and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who haunts the demons of her past (most of her family was killed, and she was, at least in one instance, the prime suspect), or whether it is just a very bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newbern her new room mate, and most of the action centers on him. <br /> <br /> character Newbern is quite sympathetic, and he and Barrymore do a decent job (though not well). Indirectly to the (sometimes) quite monstrous scenarios and fuzzy directing it seems to have teamed up to sink the remaining performances of the past. Leslie Hope unforgettable character, but it's annoying that you want to forget about it. <br /> <br /> The plot eventually splits into a bifurcated (one story arc psychological realism, the other supernatural horror) strange climax, which is so poorly planned, acted and photographed, which effectively prevents the majority from the fact that the film value reached earlier . <br /> <br /> as a whole, the film has the feeling that he could count on the result of M. Night Shamalyan first undergraduate film class. Actions and the script for the two wires just good enough that you care little about them. - at least until the film derailed completely and not fully <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send double, but avoid the first meeting of many people.
