I actually felt bad for the actors in these things. Without a doubt, a high school drama class can do a better job, or at least, as well as work. Actors need to think that this is their big chance to work in a movie, it certainly was not. Besides acting terrible story was sad and largely predictable. One of the remote control does not even make any sense. For bad reasons for this was the best room in the heap. <br /> <br /> I'm all for supporting low-budget films and filmmakers of the new fair chance, but it's turkey time-wasting and insulting the audience. I only watched it because of the good comments posted here. They have been planted by people with ties to the film. You can fool the people to see, but you can not fool them into liking what they saw. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 instead of 1, because at least the history of a boxer trying to be heart warming. Of course, it's not terrible, but he was trying. I leave for 1 second for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this dig. I would like to.
