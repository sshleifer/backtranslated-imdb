Wow. It was probably the worst ever DCOM. I watched the first half hour, and I laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, a popular girl with a hot jock boyfriend and stayed friends, which is defined as Homecoming Queen. She must save the world, as a warrior, and Trunks come to her aid, to help her with her martial arts. Shin teaches her skills snake, tiger, etc., and it should receive specific methods to save the world. <br /> <br /> This film is ideal for children who want to learn martial arts and Chinese culture but action and casting was horrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song comedienne, and I can not see that it plays a major role. It was laugh out loud funny to watch as she cries over Shin. Shin could not act at all, and it was absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie and tried to think of something like that, and that I was about Power Rangers. This film is so fake and tricks were so Power Ranger-squire, it was just corny and silly. The characters were not pretty, and I just could not stand to watch it. Disney really have the time to do some decent films. High School Musical is the only film that deserves to be on the Disney Channel, as well as with other films like Jumping Ship, the color of friendship, Go Figure, Read It and weep, and stuck to the suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like adventure and corny jokes, you'll love this movie.
