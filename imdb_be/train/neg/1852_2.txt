Whoever made this film was to make it as a joke. I mean, it was a stupid movie that I think I have ever seen !! The killer snowman terrorizes a small town? Give me a break. I love it when he takes off behind the wheel of a police car. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want to laugh, rent it. If you really want to, horror, stay away from it !!
