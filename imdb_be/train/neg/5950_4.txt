My first question after watching this movie was, "Why LIAM name?" If the goal was to tell the story of a boy's point of view, it has not been carried out successfully. Of course, it was formulaic use of angles in scenes of the boy, but most of the decisive action took place outside his field of vision. With the "main" character can not talk (obviously, providing silent, the weak position of the child) makes it difficult to give this character great depth <br /> <br /> Romance is defined as :. "Dramatic or another literary work is characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, exaggeration emotions and language, simplistic morality, and the conflictÂ» LIAM fits this definition to a T. viewer is struck on the head with the typical stereotypes of fire and brimstone of the Catholic Church in the MARM stern school and well-fed priest draining money from the believers. (Stereotype, which becomes very tedious.) Moreover - Jewish symbols lenders and breeders <br /> <br /> Most of the film was predictable ... Who did not think that we see Theresa scrub the toilet after her mother I told her, "no, my daughter would not clean the toilet of another woman!" I am a supporter of British realism, if it is done well. In my opinion, there is Liam. <br /> <br />
