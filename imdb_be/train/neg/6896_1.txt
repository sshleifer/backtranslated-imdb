Unfortunately, IMDb will not allow me to evaluate judges is lower than 1. What a shame. This terrible movie so bad that I actually turned the damn thing long before the finals. The script was a few bright moments, but directing, editing, acting, sound quality, and especially the delivery time on the line was so disgusting, how to judge completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Judge was advertised as like modern day comics in western style, but really did not have anything like this. What is most like a dog food on the bottom of the shoe. You can try to pretend that it's good, but it just keeps smelly. <br /> <br /> Why Video Store think it's okay to wear this kind of shit with constant gaps in the audio and worse than a high school drama class acting is beyond me. We rent movies to see something that is best on TV. But the judge is worse than the most miserable original SciFi Channel. I'm going to demand their money back from Hollywood Video.
