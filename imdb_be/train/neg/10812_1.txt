Pathetic film. <br /> <br /> I will not spend much time commenting about it. . I'm still trying to get back a couple of hours I wasted on it <br /> <br /> Let me just leave it out - Shaq has no business to be an actor or a singer. He is completely without talent on both discplines. It is a crying shame that more talented people wither in public theaters and karaoke bars, and Shaq used his name as a basketball player to unfairly get cast in a movie and cut a CD. <br /> <br /> Most of the failure of this film was not miserable nya-a talent that Shaq.
