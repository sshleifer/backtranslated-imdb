The film may have a weak production values, but it is also what makes it so good. The special effects are rough, and well done. My favorite part of the movie was to be played by Chris Janelle Brady. It is very hot and has a good nude scenes. Robert Prichard as a gang leader cheerful, like the other members. This film is actually trying to make a point of saying that nuclear waste is bad. 4/10 Fair comedy, gross from the film.
