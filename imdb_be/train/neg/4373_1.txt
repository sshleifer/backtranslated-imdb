I suppose I'll just blame the giant frustration that "Nedra virgin." You already know, or wait for a cinematic masterpiece, when you see a juicy and proudly promoted the title as it is the first impression only gets further confirmed when seeing a film with 'is the production in the mid-80s in Japan. Now, there are quite a lot of crazy and sick filmmakers active in Japan, but Kazuo Commission surpasses them all with its thoroughly depraved and dreary trilogy revolving nothing but aggressive sex and sadystskag young girls to violence. does not even try to tell a story, "Nedra virgin" is just a hodgepodge UN exciting semi-pornographic sex and really poor Gore-effects that do not even like the most unpretentious fan cheesy 80's horror. Image heap of photographers and their models inexplicable fashion interspersed with scenes of dirty pervert, having raw sex with a decent under age girl. It resets its not even a minute after finished (typical), and she asks him to stay, even if it has to share it with other women. I do not understand. Whether it is to represent the general male fantasy? Because it is really formulaic and unlawful. Anyway, back to the bunch of horny photographers and compliant models. Startled to be fog on the way home, the group establishes itself in an abandoned farmhouse, where they have a terrible sex and eventually become a victim of a ridiculous sex demon that kills them all. Acting amateurish performances, dialogues senseless and primitive and direction Komizu is weak and uninspired. I can tolerate it all, including women-unfriendly image of sex, but I came too close to the conversion from film during unbearably vile order to combat. One of the men cruelly beats, kicks and throws around one of the girls and called her a dirty whore as she literally wrote her panties and cries of pain. This sequence is, in my humble opinion, the absolute low point of Asian cinema operation. One to avoid, and perhaps even boycott.
