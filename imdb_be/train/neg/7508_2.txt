I want Spike Lee chose another name for your movie. «Summer Of Sam» creates the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer David Berkowitz. It is not. This gritty, earthy portrait of the streets of New York City life during the hot summer of '77, when Berkowitz terrorized this city. <br /> <br /> The film is a few young fictional characters in Italian-American neighborhoods, and their response to the threat of the son of Sam. There Winnie and his wife Dionna; I have Richie and Ruby, and several other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not likeable. They are usually annoying and sometimes unbearable. Or then belabors their high energy, chaotic lives that are filled with anger, thirst and general bustle. There are at least two lengthy fight scene between Winnie and his wife, reserved disk dance scene, countless gabfests ... Again and again I kept thinking: where the film editor <br /> <br /> At the same time, all that the main movie passes up the opportunity to convey any real sense of fear and fear arising from the dangers of the Son of Sam, too much in the background. It is more successful when displaying all sorts of threats arising from the neighborhood vigilante groups. <br /> <br /> To act uniformly good. This, combined with the 70s disco music and generous attention to costume and production design, so you really feel like you are in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York in 1977. <br /> <br /> Outside the authenticity of the film, however, was not enough to offset the unintelligible, overblown script about the life of people much annoying.
