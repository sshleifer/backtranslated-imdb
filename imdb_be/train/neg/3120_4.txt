I did not expect much from «The Night Listener», and I actually never heard of it until I saw the cover to the video service. Nevertheless, the film is very effective when it comes to making the suspension and tension. Sometimes she pulls a little bit, but it really helps to keep you wondering what will happen, and what is more important: if. In the course of the film, the character played by Robin Williams gets dragged into a "cat and mouse" misadventures to the point where he becomes obsessed to know the truth and the existence of the 14-year-old abused child who no one seemed ever seen in person. Night Listener interesting history as great in the creation of the suspension throughout the film, and you're pretty much kept in the dark about who is lying and what is real. However, in the end, a kind of disappointing and does not live up to the potential could have been. It really does not give you a detailed and plausible explanation as to the other main character, which would be useful and interesting.
