I am sorry to report that I've seen this movie several times. If bombed at the box office, repeated every night for a month on HBO. And I watched it over and over again, because television is so bad at all - or was it at the time. I do not watch, so this may be fine now - as Samuel L. Jackson talks about pigs, "It may taste like sweet potato pie, but I'll never know, because I do not eat dirty IBEC." Let's see. Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the wilderness, always a few steps behind Moses. He left immediately after the life of Brian, so you can guess where the inspiration for this came. Several mildly funny bits go too long until you simply close your eyes and bite the bullet. There's one scene where Arthur and Dom DeLuise found in the desert, they both pulled out and dried, dying of thirst. Then they found the old friends who do not really know each other very well, promising to do lunch. It might be funny. <br /> <br /> But the scene I remember most clearly is the meeting with Pharaoh, in which Pharaoh black Homeless done in the full regalia of King Tut. He should read the line right, because at some point, before leaving, they overdubbed his scene with the Hollywood equivalent of a black street slang voiced by Jimmy Walker wannabe (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or it could be Jimmy Walker - who knows? What is the difference. They managed to turn substantially sad scene in a very racist, very unfunny, very long piece of excrement, one of those legendary things that just will not be on the same level, no matter how many times you try to make you leave it there for someone else to have business. <br /> <br /> Well, here's my review. If you rent this film (not buy it, whatever you do!) Prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six-pack of Corona. <br /> <br /> Now that they have altered Poseiden Adventure, this one is probably high on the list of remakes. Maybe they will hire a comedian this time.
