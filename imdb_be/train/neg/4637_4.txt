Bangville police allegedly marked the debut of Keystone Kopsov, named after the studio they worked. In this case, however, they were not dressed in police silly costumes or ride a fast-paced car that is their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a farm girl here who pleaded with her father to the calf. Later, she sees some strange people in a barn and quickly call the police. One of the answers and the chase on. Further, Mabel slams her door just as someone comes in. It turns out that it was her mother who jumps to the conclusion of the robbers out there! Thus, while Mabel blocks her door with furniture, mother and father are trying to fight their way in! It was probably the most fun part with some short bursts of a police car. It was a short 7 minute that went so quickly that it was over before it began. The only feature that is designed to Mabel, who exudes charm with only her face and big eyes and seem so optimistic cheerful here, except, of course, if she's scared. It is easy to see why she became a star. This is largely because of her that I recommend seeing it at least once, so I give it a 4.
