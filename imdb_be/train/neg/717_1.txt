He was supposed to be a parody of LOTR-trilogy. But it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Bad action, bad script, bad. This is my personal opinion. I have no doubt that the second, that there are people who will enjoy this feeling of "humor", but there were the best parodies of the films of famous directors like Mel Brooks or the Zucker brothers. I am working in a movie theater and a DVD-shop, and the success of this film was the same in both areas: it was good in the movie (but not great at all) success in the first two weeks, but then, when the feedback from those who have seen, it is not too good, the film fell very quickly. Available DVD is good for a short time, but then nobody asked about it any more. Over the past ten years, two worst films I have ever seen in The Ring Thing and torque. I can not decide which one was worse, but I'm glad that there are so many good films, so I do not think too much on the subject.
