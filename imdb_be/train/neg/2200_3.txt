SciFi Channel and had a marathon of them, which led to premiere its new original paintings, hammer sharks frenzy. based on the previews, it seemed, he had to be very funny. essentially a remake of creatures Benchley, actually. it is preceded by showing shark attack 3: Megalodon, that shark movie fun at its best. I was in the mood; I was ready to go. bring it, hammer-mad-scientist-man! Oh, my God, was that the film is not so. <br /> <br /> wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br /> patient. twisted.
