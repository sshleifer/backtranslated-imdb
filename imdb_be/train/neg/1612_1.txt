It's unbelievable that with all the countless crimes that were uncovered and laid one on the verge of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag Archipelago Cultural Revolution in the Khmer Rouge, one still finds supporters of communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and still the propaganda in his favor. He simply shows the moral degradation of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In this film psychotic killer glorified. It goes without saying that neither his crime nor his psychotic proclamations were included. This is as a director and an actor waiting for the audience to sit through this seemingly endless propaganda film shows the tunnel vision that they have with regard to their object of worship.
