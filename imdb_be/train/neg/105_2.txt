There's tons of pretty women in this film. Unfortunately, this movie nudity free. Grrrrrrrrrr strike one. <br /> <br /> Hmm. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters behind the wheel Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you know, this film was released in stereoscopic 3D. This is the most disgusting effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if someone messed up work on this issue, but there was no 3D, just double vision blurs. I had the same problem with other of 3D-films of this company, the hunting season and CAMP BLOOD. Of course, 3D in those sucked too, but with them I could see similarities 3D-effect. <br /> <br /> This thing is a big ball of nothing. <br /> <br /> And who the women were played the daughter's ear that feeds the house it! I would like to see more of her. In the movies, as well. It seems Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
