I was «Goodnight Mister Tom» is familiar with the fantastic book for absolutely ages, and it was only recently when I got a chance to watch this adaptation it. I have heard many positive comments about it, so I had high hopes. After the film was finished, I was horrified. <br /> <br /> This film is not a good movie at all. "Goodnight Mister Tom" was extremely poor adaptation and almost 4.5 / 10 books has been missed. In particular, I found that many of the characters and some of the big scenes in the book is not that. There was not a lot of dialogue, and it was delivered too fast moving, but I was mostly disappointed by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this film, which was true later. Casting is not all that good, either. I thought that it might be very good, but it was so different from the book! Anextremely poor adaptation, one of the worst I've seen. It deserves a decent remake, it's better to be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage.
