For me it's a story that begins with some funny jokes about Franks fanatasies, when he travels to the stairs, and when he is sitting in business meetings ... The problem is that when you watched this movie for an hour you will see one and the same fantasy / funny situations again and again and again. It is predictable. It's more to do with television history, where you can leave and come back, not missing anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren like Frank, but this is not enough, even if it's a comedy, he should have more variation and some kind of message to his audience .... <br /> <br />
