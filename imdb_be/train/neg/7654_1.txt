I remember reading all the terrible, terrible reviews for this movie when it came out. I mean, to see how horrible it was, but it was out of theaters for three weeks. The only film to run, that is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the film was released on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it is. I could not think of a pure horrible note that this film gets the opportunity. After seeing it, I can understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. There's a good shot at the start, showing the bullet fires from inside the pistol, which I thought was neat. And then, as the monsters in the film die is a kind of fun to watch; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If a bad game is a sin, then hell would have tossed Tara Reid just because it is so incredibly awful in this film, it's impossible. And all the roles she plays curator. Now, when she played stupid, led by empty sex toys, then maybe I might be able to forgive her for the way she relates to her character. It seems that Uwe Boll did not realize that, even though he seems to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people will see it. He just did not understand what makes her do it in the middle of the film, in the absolute wrong time just made the movie more funny bad. And that Mexican song or anything during the scene dry Humping? I could not tell. <br /> <br /> This brings me to my next complaint: In the Ball shows some of the worst leadership skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I'd give Dead House of two (and I only do it for very few films), but HotD would kill at least, B compared with this spinning piece of junk. The film starts with a very, very long story, which causes an immediate confusion (and read terrible narrator), and then, cuts, really, really stupid. There's this one point where Slater and Reed looked around the building, which was destroyed, and blackens the screen. When he returned, Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and all of a sudden, the whole army joined them. And? <br /> <br /> And someone did not bother to check for errors in this film. At some point, the team breaks through the glass, but the glass is broken, before they touch it. earrings Tara Reid switched colors in the middle of a scene and after Slater goes from a dead comrade, you can see, she started to get up. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... I'm really lost. Something about an old tribe releasing the darkness and someone "paves the way" or something, and all the evil monsters pop up. It's just an excuse to have a lot of weapons scenes (the technology is so perfect that no one character never have to reboot in this film), which are, quite simply, boring. <br /> <br /> I bought this film hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I do not laugh, but I still think that this is nonsense. Very, very, very silly.
