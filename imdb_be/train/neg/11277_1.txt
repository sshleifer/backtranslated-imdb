There is no doubt that this film has a great cast, but, unfortunately, it does not help with the major disadvantages of the film. I will never understand why the directors to ask the actors / actresses use accents are not their own, if it is obvious to everyone that they can not convince. Fiennes simply can not do the Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. If the voice is not the case, no matter how well the character will never be convincing. As for the main problem .... story .... there was one? I think there was some kind of plot involved, but it was so full of holes that I just could not wait for the movie to the end ... it was funny. Save 90 minutes of your life and this film is not to look!
