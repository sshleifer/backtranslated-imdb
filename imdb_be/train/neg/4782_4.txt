First observed 12/24/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff that does not really get specific enough to explain the real story took place in the actual human incident basis, which mistakenly put in jail, trying to get the job done for his family 'and to make Christmas happen for them. Three children in the family, then run away from home for a campaign in Washington, DC, to bring the then US President Herbert Hoover. This hike gives some side stories, as well as their positive meeting with a tramp and puppeteer that makes the story kind of like Disney "animal on the run" and the movie does not quite fit here. In the final, there are no details given about how the President helped the family and this is another downpoint in the movie, in my opinion. The film did eventually bring tears, but it takes too long to get to this. The film should not be an original TV movie (on IMDb), but it has obvious damping, which make it look like ?? so I'm not sure that their information is accurate. In general, it's just a movie (which might be more difficult) with happy Christmas, as a story, but play safely and without much substance.
