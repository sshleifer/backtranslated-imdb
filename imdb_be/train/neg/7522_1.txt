Wow ... where to start ... I picked it up at Big Lots for $ 2.99. That's three dollars, I'll never see again ... never ... and for what? I'll tell ya. After an hour and fifteen minutes, boring, sad, sad conversations and college angst that seemed more appropriate for a lifetime movie than a horror movie advertised on the box. (May marketing droids have developed to burn forever in hell). Follow this with a small amount of cheap gore (even not well baked blood, mind you ...) and plot twist at the end that does not come out of nowhere, and it makes no sense. Awful, awful, awful ... <br /> <br /> Was the sacrifice quality? Well, on a scale of Joe Bob Briggs, there six chest part, but it's hardly worth my long lost three dollars. Without them, it coulda been on Sci-Fi, for example, in two or three o'clock in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
