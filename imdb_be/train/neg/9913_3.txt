This is one of those cheaply made TV films were characters seem to lose all meaning. The premise of the history, abduction of her son from the boy's father, very good. But the story just seems to be a poor faith. Every time the mother is advised not to do anything, you know perfectly well it's going to do it. It's a bit far-fetched and not worthy of viewing.
