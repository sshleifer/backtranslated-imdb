This film is a massive Yawn proves that the Americans did not get to hang a farce. Even when she was already written for them! The original film «Hodet For Vannet» witty comedy of errors, which I would rate 8/10. It is not just about language translation, but some absurd chain of events are skipped entirely, robbing the film of its original comedy reasonable nature and turn it into a cheap "upse there goes my pants" style farce.
