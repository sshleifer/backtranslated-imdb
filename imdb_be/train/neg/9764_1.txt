In a word ... sad. I give it one star for hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Corman's worst effort, bar none. Ben Verina had his name erased from all the actors. I can not believe that now it will be on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with a «Wild In The Streets" -. Another retro bitch I woke up sick in bed with a cold in the morning, I decided to watch a movie to cheer I have some scanned digital channels ... room looked quite interesting, because I love watching B-movie science fiction, hippy culture and rebellious teenagers clicks. it seemed familiar somehow, and with Ben Verina in a cast, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a terrible start to my day. <br /> <br /> it was only after watching, I'm in Jedaiah why familiarity crept into the recesses of my back awakened mind. I remembered seeing the coming attractions for this film, as the 14-year-old (I'm 45), back in the early / mid-seventies at Sombrero, local art theater that no longer exists. .. the whole theater was laughing hysterically groaned aloud how bad this film looked Acting:. terrible history: terrible cinema: almost-eerie music: horrible sound: terrible, direction: a joke. If you decide to watch it after my warning, remember ... "I told you so.» <br /> <br /> «Gass-SSS» is the perfect title for this film ... you feel "gassed" after viewing the film rotten - or maybe that you have to be taken in the "gas" chamber for wasting your brain away I saw a homemade Super 8 films that put to shame the film to define a new addition to my time.. ten worst films ... there is (er, there is) with "tentacles». <br /> <br /> Ted Gilbert, Arizona
