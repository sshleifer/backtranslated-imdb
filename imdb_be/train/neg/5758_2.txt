We can say that the actors will make a movie, but it clearly proves that statement is not true. Most of the characters in this film is missing something to hold. They play a piece of cardboard cut, move on predictable and uninteresting ways. The story is very simple. It can be expressed in a few words, but I held back in case anyone reads really want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to fast-forward the part where Jack showed us how to be nasty ogre. I have to say that 70% of the film revolves around cooking, eating, or getting ready to eat. Frankly, I would prefer not to spend their time watching Jack roar chew with your mouth open. Personally, I could do without the references shoes and jokes pepper the first half of the film, too. <br /> <br /> Beyond my own personal dementia, the film does not lack anything worth while. There were countless scenes and camera shots, who believe that it lasted. If something happens, the characters are vague response and dry. <br /> <br /> It is better not to watch this one.
