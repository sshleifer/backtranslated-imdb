Sugar and Spice is one of the worst films of 2001 Film is trying to cross the heath and Bring and fails. When I saw in January last year, I was so disgusting movie I walked and talked on his cell phone with my girlfriend for the last half hour of the film. I heard that the DVD has a director cut, maybe I'll check it out, but it's a PG-13 movie thrash S ***, and the worst kind of s ***. Perhaps if the film was a T & A, we would have done it well. But the lame jokes and action anyhow. Worse than the film three.
