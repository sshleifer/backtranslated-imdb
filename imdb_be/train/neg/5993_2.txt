I grew (b. 1965), watching and loving Thunderbirds. All my friends at school watching. We played «Thunderbirds» to the school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be or Virgil Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. Countdown from 5 became an art form. I took my children to see the movie in the hope that they will get an idea of ​​what I loved as a child. As a bitter disappointment. Only high point was an instant theme tune. Not that he could compare with the original account to the Thunderbirds. Fortunately, early on Saturday morning, one television channel still plays a repeating series Gerry Anderson and his wife created. Jonatha Frakes must pass in his director's chair, his version was completely hopeless. film waste. Utter nonsense. Those CGI remake may be acceptable, but replacing puppets with Homo Sapiens subspecies. sapiens was a huge mistake discretion.
