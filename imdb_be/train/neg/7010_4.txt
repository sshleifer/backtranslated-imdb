I know that no one cares, but I do. This film is a historical one reason. This unity of the two heroes of the two large seventies sci-fi movies. Well, one large and one very bad. A large one is really big, in fact it is the best. Bad really bad, in fact it is the worst. Of course, I refer to a large "Star Wars" and this star Mark Hamill, aka "Luke Skywalker", which is the hero of this film is about a boy who gets his Corvette backhand, and then goes to Las Vegas (on a leash) and after a whole lot of adventure, ultimately restores it. (Since he is fixing cars, I guess you can call it Â«Lube Skywalker"). On the way he meets a prostitute with a heart of gold, and in the end, facing off with the character played by Kim Milford, the hero from the seventies sci-fi cult movie "The laser blast", which, as I hinted at earlier, the worst scientific fiction film ever made. Milford plays a leading villain, which Hamill has to steal his car back to. I understand that no one cares about the meeting of two great heroes of science fiction, but I do. And I must say that this is one of the best / worst films of all time. incumbent Mark Hamill needs the power, the plot needs a broad Jedi training, and the nature of the prostitute played by Annie Potts just might be the most annoying character of all time, ever, in any movie I've ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch at the weekend or a week in the evening, late at night, very late. This is one of those movies that meanders, looking for something, but not quite find it, and yet, at the same time, it is the whole purpose is as a free-form jazz to simply exist as they are. And it does. What is not so great, but you can not say that this is not entertainment, because for one and a half hours, you might feel ripped off, but you will not feel cheated. So turn off your mind, relax and enjoy this intricate stone without any expectations and let the force be with you always.
