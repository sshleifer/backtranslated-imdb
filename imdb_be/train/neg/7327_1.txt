Heavy moralism. Authors who use characters as mouthpieces speak for themselves. Predictability, plodding plot (say that five times fast). imitation child Britney Spears. This film has all the features Lifetime Special rejection. <br /> <br /> I truly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo decided to create a thought-provoking, emotional film on the tough subject, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, that the one who is a criminal, by definition, is not necessarily a bad person, and that there may be extenuating circumstances, especially when one puts the welfare of the child first. However, their severity eventually sent to an instructive dialogue and banal situations, planted to move the plot along. Decent production values ​​and interesting use of documentary footage camera style is not enough to achieve your goal, if the script and acting autumn flat <br /> <br /> The logic is often compromised for the sake of creating a voltage :. Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo to participate in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape, and then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her, because she does not help them with altruism. Well, the spirit. And for the person on the go, Pablo too swayed on hysteria. Cristina welfare so important to him that he had escaped from prison and the capture or deportation for her, but he is willing to risk everything to calm her if she wants to go to Mexico. Exactly. I mentioned above on allowing paternity. Third, if the employer gives Pablo Charlie Bright phone detective, it is surprisingly unprofessional, especially considering its presidency - she really think she was convincing? Oh, yes, I would have turned myself in. Detective CCH pound in Wims could wipe the floor with it. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I would like to list the things that I liked. Um, I liked it a dwarf. And I liked the fact that the dwarf was called Sexy. There's a dressing up, always a plus; Juvenile dressing up, no less! Harry infinitely more attractive than Christina. But my favorite moment in the film should be, if Christine starts Detective Not-So-Bright. I also find it interesting that, in largely minority actors (which I appreciate, by the way), a black racist character alone. It is a pity that it is just thrown in there and not further investigated. <br /> <br /> There is a special, non-traditional account, but it is nevertheless usually non-specific context, does not increase the mood or stress at any stage but miserable, agonizing groans every time the protagonist in despair as if they think that its action does not show enough: "Just in case you were not sure that he was upset, and we have the music signals to prove it <br /> <br /> stilted, clichéd. results of the dialogue in a depressing lack of subtext, it should be spelled out in the dialog, even if the body language was to Til then hand it's great .. For example, each passionate speech Pablo makes and weep Mrs Knight, her child will not crawl in bed with them in the morning <br /> <br /> «Papi, tell me about my mother again" - that shameless, blatant exhibition features a total dead wife! (it is always the most beautiful woman widow had ever seen, he is a respected ever met Why do not we see a man crying over a woman, like Shakespeare. - it can be thick, ugly, unpleasant, but his love for her has deep oceans? Now _there's_ story that would move with me.) <br /> <br /> Police always be just one step behind them gives many scenes is the place the feeling of a French farce. The most unfortunate foot chases ever - Bright and lightning is so out of shape, and easily deceived (he, of course, is not fast, like lightning, and she, well, I do not feel the need to spell things). A guy pulls a small child advanced bicycle policeman, complete with MIM biker collection of battle, but then cut down a child? According to Margaret Cho, it's so boring. we ever would have seen it on "Cops» <br /> <br /> hackneyed and over-the-top Deus Ex Machina: as an employer, would you really refuse to check his green card because he can quote the author of inspirational words on a poster at his desk <br /> <br /> Plus several scenes, including the above, threatening to turn into a porno, "Well, I will do this service for you, while you do something for me ... I'm almost I hear bowm-Chicka-bowm-bowm. <br /> <br /> If the parents view the footage remorse Pablo, freak-out grieving mother is the real movie feels Unfortunately, this is mitigated by the fact that it looks quite rocked his emotional speech up until she goes ballistic. More ambivalent view is more convincing here <br /> <br /> I am in constant fear of stupidity of the protagonist doing things for the sake of the plot:., Picking store without a mask, a visit to the grave of the dead girl. And why did not recognize its mother's face from when she saw him before he left? "You seem awfully familiar ... <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this totally unnecessary, gratuitous scene with several Soid artificially enhanced bartender? Character development? PM. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> speaking of unnecessary features that never went anywhere, detective Lightning speaking skeptical detective Bright should Scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult. And I do not think that belief in fate it is possible to qualify as a bait fetish < br /> <br /> In the end, if the bright Pablo keeps him die -. wait, why is it still tyap ? Er Her character is as inconsistent as Soid years What she should shoot him just because she said. "Stop, or I'll shoot? (_So_much_ She cared about her integrity until now.) He was unarmed. There was no need for lethal force. What's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize it <br /> <br /> Finally, a child's recognition of the death of her mother Christina, giving doctors find peace over his daughter's death - so forced. And the idea of ​​the family whose child was killed by becoming a new family of Christina ... It angers me that it could be a "replacement" for their little girl. It is also impossible that the white couple will host Latino man's daughter, who killed his own daughter. I'm not saying that it is not generous, loving people who will do it. I'm just saying that the characters are never developed far enough for me to believe that would _they_ do it. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that, of course, as a woman, she was moved by school scenes. I am a woman who leaves for his emotional movements for the moments that do not wax sentimental in the produced way. <br /> <br /> co-author, co-director roles Nebot said to himself that he was wearing too many hats during this production. Too many cooks can spoil the broth, but one cook alone simply can eventually make after school special. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the name of this movie is not so much about the history and more to do with a feeling of regret, helplessness and loss accompanying revelation that you'll never see your money again.
