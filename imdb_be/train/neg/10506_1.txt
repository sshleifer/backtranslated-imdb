When teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow. <br /> <br /> 1) Teenagers will be warned not to go where they go on crazy local. Dan Van Husen handle that with absurd exposition of deadly sirens. What, who, how and why are handled in one almost incomprehensible rush. 2) van break. 3) While looking for help group will be one after the other and separated by any monster they be selected warned about.4) They find a house inhabited by a madman, he would grab them. 5) The house is a phone, but it will not work, it will be exciting feature will be flickering neon lights, spiders and larvae. 6) Crazy will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that will not start (here high speed of separation had to be done on the tractor). 7) Crazy is apparently killed just got back from the dead for a cheap, weak fear and then be killed properly. 8) Only Girl survives from the group. 9) It is unnecessary twist in the end. <br /> <br /> Add these elements exposed Sirens (who, it seems that the characters react in surprising in many ways, despite the fact that everything he sees them, presumably, to fall into lust with them immediately) who seduce and kill teen, throat and pulled the body sucked in half and you have something like a twelve year old boys dream movie. <br /> <br /> I think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work as low as possible to be, but I am pleased to note that there are several elements that are resident to meet and are a big step in his previous film, Darkhunters, which is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Sometimes very good cinematography, music and editing a head taller than his previous films and some other low-budget horror films. I was amazed to learn that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on preliminary ugliness. However, the worst thing about this film is not to be found in the body of the film, it is ultimately the least distraction meaningless when the film has been done over and over again, but among the DVD-extras. <br /> <br /> If you remove this movie, I beg you to listen to the director's commentary, he is beyond belief. There is more to say about it than the film itself. One staggering part of the commentary is a requirement of the director, the film is a cliché of lead, because it was a preconceived idea. He says that it is a deliberate attempt to use all the clichés and openly he wonders, when "people will get it.» <br /> <br /> I fear that, when it should be reasonable with a nod and a wink of the past and genre films clichés in them, it is not witty script enough to act in accordance tone and are not directed enough style to work. If this film was made to order it makes me ask one question, "what's the point?" it s afilm just slips right in the canon of bad horror films, any attempt to do something to mind th or different did not work. <br /> <br /> The next nugget of brilliance is the talk of snobbery in relation to digital film formats. They rightly point out that digital is often associated with cheapness and ease of use. However, best call time comes when they regret that if Michael Mann makes a movie in the format it is designated as a visionary There is a simple distinction to be made here;. Mann talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style, Roberts hack horror ICs tovvae it to get the bottom shelf of genre paintings. I think the differences are obvious and a comparison is not only arrogant, but unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> The best moment is reserved for comments Robert about the people who took the time to consider his previous film. Those who do not like to generalize as "geeks", and he even goes so far as to identify specific individuals because the audacity to express their opinion on forums that encourage them to do so. I must admit I was a little disappointed that my review of his latest film was not selected for ridicule. Tirade goes on as a group jokes about Norwegian referees, complete with a "funny" accent implies that people of Norway would not know a good movie, simply because where they were born. As always, these sorts of comments say more about those who tell them what they are intended, they just make the director and his friends look ignorant. <br /> <br /> In the package in the round with an elegant short film about how the Sirens cast. Robert swears blind in scoring, "I do not want to make a film that was like the Malibu," as we have seen, listening to a tape topless and naked girls writhing on the ground. There is also a simpering, one indulgent documentary about the creation Darkhunters, during which Robert said that the reviewer states that the forest is the "best British film of the year." I do not know who he was trying to convince. At some point in the commentary track by Robert says jokingly: "I can see how people are sitting at home saying" This is not surprising, it sh $ t "he was not mistaken.
