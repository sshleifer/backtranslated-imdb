The main reason for writing this review, I found it «revisioning» big game and a decent film in 1972, a terrible movie experience. If I can save someone from his viewing, I did a good deed. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is loaded with talent and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OKs ugly, sterile, one set of note. He continues to make films from all artistic, distracting, self-centered angle possible. We see, on the security monitors reflection stainless steel cast, shots of their heads from 200 feet above, large eyes plans, chin, and so on. The script, by Nobel Prize winner, to enter a long stretchs nasty gay banter that now both sides fake .... I think ?? Given the nature of "twist" How would I know? Characters themselves, so abundantly illustrated in the original, are rough and callous. Working time has been reduced to one hour, or a real problem or the venerable, the director has done for us. Actors effectively carry out its line, but nothing they say or do not remotely believable. Jude Law is over the top of a Kane, but as Producer credited, should be a blessing. <br /> <br /> Branagh In general, I found it an ugly look flimsy shell of the former classics, Why does he even made ??? Payer community spent less than $ 4M over the world to see! Boastful of the work, which is not at every turn.
