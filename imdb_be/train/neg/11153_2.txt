Another in a long line of clicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate the camera as well as tell the story. Within 15 minutes, the entire room is set out in a few lines, so there is absolutely no secret that eliminates the entire face of the unknown. Only half a competent actor killed 10 minutes into the movie, so we stayed with blunt characters running around doing stupid things. Low budget movies can not afford the expensive special effects, so part of the CGI are surprisingly unimpressive, but at least this attempt. Being terrible suit, as seen when he falls to the pavement, and the director continues to emphasize the eyes, which are not even shown in red on mirrored frames. Dialogue awkward and uninspired, with some lines that resemble alien or the Terminator. The latter sequence takes place in a police station, as well as rip-off from the Terminator, with all hid in the same glass substrate office that DarkWolf not crash. In the end, she calls the hero of "good tread," but he gets both of its partners, the original tread, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen policemen are killed without getting a decent shot off, in spite of the arsenal silver bullets and submachine gun. But here's the real reason for poor written form: they could kill the animal immediately after the loan if he holds a stripper, while flashing his red eyes. Instead, they took him into custody?!?
