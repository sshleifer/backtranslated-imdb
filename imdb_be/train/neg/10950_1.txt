If I knew that the film was shot in an irritating and quease induce Dogme 95 style, I would have never rented it. Nevertheless, I took Dramamine for motion sickness, and gave him a chance. I lasted a very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just boring, pretentious twaddle. <br /> <br /> In the last French film that I saw I was «Romance», and it was also pretty grim, but at least the camera is steady and does not breathe in the back of the characters all the time. I am baffled at the continued popularity of Dogme 95 foreign - it will catch on in America around the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy. (This is called Dogme 95, because it is the average number of times the actors poked in the eye with the camera.) <br /> <br />
