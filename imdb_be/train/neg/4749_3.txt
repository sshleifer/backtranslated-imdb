This movie was so bad, screenwriter and director, I fell asleep for 30 minutes through the movie. Jokes in the film banal and even if the plot is interesting in some corners, it's too far-fetched and in some ridiculous percentage points. If you are 11 years or older you ignore written to the cinema and to be disappointed, but if you're 10 or younger, this is a movie that will grab your attention and be amazed with all the tricks (which I might add badly done) and if you was some warrior. The casting in this film is not very good, and the music was very disappointing because it looked like they were trying to create tension, but it is not suitable at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, 1 next awful) acting in this film is 4. Brenda Song talented in comedy, but with this kind of film, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable. When she made some of their "combat" positions, I began to laugh loudly. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely a direction, for example, the part where her opponent is a person evil villain possesing, her voice becomes dark and evil, I think it was incredibly stupid, and how (Brenda Song) teacher Wendy had her teacher at school obsession with the monks, it was pretty funny. So sumamrize all, disappointing movie, but good if you are 10 or under.
