How Heist movies go, this one is rather weak. Continuity pretty lousy, lacking continuity characters to really feel like you know any of the characters. Peter Falk large, and it is one of the reasons why it is worth watching. Falk has some great lines like "he is back, he's going to buy a saugagesÂ» or something similar ... there are a few good scenes, but they are completely thanks to the efforts of the actors. Direction, script and editing is pretty bad.
