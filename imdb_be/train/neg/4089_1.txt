Warning :. This review contains spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Notice I said "almost." This is nothing like a lot of random scenes strung together in an attempt to free stories. The protagonists (you can not call them "heroes") to shoot innocent bystanders for food, as well as robbing the same for the same reasons. There's also a ton of homoeroticism, which for me was an exception. (Spoiler: It seems as if the thief (who only topless, but not naked, others argue reviews) kills early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes, the audience of torture.) I can not help feeling that the animal abuse happened many times in this cinematic abomination. If you are in the mood MST3K, you might find it watchable, but for the most part, you can forget about it. Go rent the original DVD Conan instead.
