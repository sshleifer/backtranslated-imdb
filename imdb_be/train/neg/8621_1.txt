Previous poster clearly worked on the film. It's a joke how bad it is, and no one will consider this type of cinema as he did.Mentioning all the actors, and the names that they were in before a sure sign that it is associated with it in some way. <, Br /> <br /> it on Cinemax right now, and I was sure it was some kind of movie where a porn star (one called Ava gorgeous and well supplied) have been forced to do something else for some insane tax reasons. <br /> <br /> In addition, when I first saw it, I was sure that it was done in about 1986, and I was born in 73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about. .. but no ... it was done in 1993 !! Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Although I would say this is one of those who are so bad it's good movies. Like watching a train wreck.
