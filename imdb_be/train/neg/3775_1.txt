Like other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in the field of photography. Color comic bold. I think that the director became interested in his "artistic vision" over the look of the film, not the much-needed attention to the content. Despite a stellar cast, plays the dim and history almost incoherent. Madonna is likely to drop only as a stunt to get the pre-release press. Good thing, as her appearance here lent some credence to her album "I'm Breathless (music inspired by the film Dick Tracy)," which was a blow to the stratosphere (in large part to the inclusion of «Vogue» hit the dance - which is not, nor is irrelevant for this film). I believe that the bulk of the money from this film came from the tie-in album Madonna "I'm Breathless". <br /> <br /> If you watch it at home, with the help of end credits, you will be thinking, "have two hours of my life, I would like to go back." Save wasted time - do not bother with this .
