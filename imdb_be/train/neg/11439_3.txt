It was obvious that this film is designed to appeal to an audience Chick Flick, which I sat through a lot and enjoyed by most. However, it is very annoying attempt Heather Graham, to become the next Meg Ryan (who started annoying as hell in its own right). Its action has been exaggerated, and it turned out that she was very thorough when compared with its peers, which have been softened in their roles. This film could be more, as there was a suitable budget for the setting, actors and a decent storyline. My wife and I both agreed that it was "suffering" at the end, as the film ended a painful severe high! Better luck next time, I hope, Miss Graham sticks to the film type, that it belongs to, like hell.
