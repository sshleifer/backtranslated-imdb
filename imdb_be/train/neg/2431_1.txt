As Turkish people now living in Sweden, I have to admit, I often watch Scandinavian films. Most if them I will never understand. I think that the actors from Scandinavia it is best to work in Hollywood. I looked at the film, entitled "Polish Wedding" together with a Polish friend of mine last week and we both said it was the worst movie we've ever seen. Unfortunately, I was wrong, this film "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the parties has failed to act, it is absolutely not a woman, so-called star Bergstr√∂m. The plot is not stupid, no one can believe, it.I think it's all about the mess from the beginning. many bad things but acting on Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
