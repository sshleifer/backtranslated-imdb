We went into this film because my husband enjoyed the original version of 'My Favorite Martian. " We had a 6-year old daughter with us. She wanted to leave halfway through the film, which was fine with both of his parents! Parts we saw were only occasionally humorous, mostly either too stupid or rude. I would expect that this film may appeal to children 9-12, if that. This is definitely not suitable for young children. From what I've heard that the original series was much higher, and if you are going to "relive the past," you'll probably be disappointed.
