Let me be very clear about this movie. I have not watched this film because of the story, I look at him for daring sex scenes. That being said, this film is so god damn awful I switch between pure joy to see the Divine body Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and the adulation of my eyeballs for disaster story. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning the first scene of the film has me cringing .. you see a woman painting something on the shore of the lake, in the pure and tranquil happiness, the beautiful girl approach and ask if she could draw her side. When they both finished, they show each other what they have done ... and a woman painted vineyard, IF InFront facing the lake. Which eccentric director would have made such a mistake ?? And elsewhere, Tracy gets to kill the lover of his teacher for his break with the sail pole and then it slips away, and no one from the city police did not suspect her once. I mean Hellooooo? MANDY not wear gloves she? Finger prints ALL DAMN bot GOD !! After that, it gets worse when Mandy around, have the effect of "cooling" the sound played, which sounds like a cat in a hissy fit. It is also very sorry Ryazanov Arquette in the film. I feel real sorry that she did not act in this super low-budget soft porn is a no brainer. The same applies to Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to play in this film. Overall, 2/10.
