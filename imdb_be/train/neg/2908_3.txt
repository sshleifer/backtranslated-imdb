On the basis of one of the books of Gabriel Marquez, and it can be a brilliant literature, this film adaptation really sucks, as it is more like a struggle with sleep, not to enjoy some cinematic DÃ©lices. The story of an old couple whose son had died, and live a life that is largely dominated by poverty, and where the protagonist is a cock, which, we hope, one day, bring some money for the coming cockfighting. I'm not in the mood to shed more words on this useless piece of pretentious, just maybe, you can see Salma Hayek is here, but sits 90 minutes before the screen just for that? Gracias a lot .....
