Well where do I start my story ?? I went to this movie with a few friends today, not knowing more than the actors who were in it, and that he was supposed to be a horror film. <br /> <br /> Well, I realized for the first 20 minutes, which is a bad decision I made coming to see this film. The land was crap and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the fact that people in the audience were laughing hysterically. <br /> <br /> The roles could not be more plastic look. Even some of the scenes, it seemed like they should have done a lot faster ... they are delayed for no apparent reason. Very poor editing. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
