This film reflects how Ruth debauchery, drunkenness, gambling, overeating athletic figure with a bit of baseball as one. Babe Ruths early life was quite interesting, and it was for all intents and purposes have been omitted in this film. In addition, Lou Gehrig was a little closed, and it was well known, relationships, good bad or indifferent, it had to be covered better than it was. His life was more than bad. He was an American hero, an icon that many baseball greats model your life after. I feel that I am being unfair to the memory of the great baseball player, that this film is completely ignored. Shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults, not his greatness.
