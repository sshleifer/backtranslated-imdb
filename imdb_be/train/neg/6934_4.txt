Okay, so, obviously, PPL thought it was a good movie in 1955. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry fools who still think that way ... His absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. .. funny. Symbols ridiculous caricatures - but this film is not intended to make fun, I'm sure it meant to be a serious drama is not so <br /> <br /> Dean and others are too old for their parts ?. People say that Dean was great in this movie, and maybe he did play a role as he possibly could. His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was 24-year-old, when he made this film. Seeing him suffer a little and throw tantrums like a 4 year old boy ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is great, but the early scene in the police station, where she was crying and whining very unconvincing. It sets a bad precedent for the movie ... and for the rest of it, you feel like cringing every time one of them badly acted emotional scenes come together. <br /> <br /> This may've was good for its time, but, in fact, his talk. <br /> <br /> It must have just been hype about Dean's death, which is overly exaggerated reputation of this film.
