Guy loser. Unable to get the girls needed to create defined on stronger more successful guys, etc. Seen it, saw it, he moved on. I have to say that Rob must move past the Adam Sandler of his life. And get out of the land of Adam Sandler. There are two funny parts in the whole movie. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I'm getting bored. "Animal" is a good movie. I usually use Adam Sandler movies that have the same story. But it was trying too hard to impress. The jokes are very old. Yes, believe me. This is not a film that most people can really get into. But some do, so I'll be fine. <br /> <br /> 3/10
