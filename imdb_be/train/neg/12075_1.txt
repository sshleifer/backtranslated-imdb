This Hamlet is made for one of boringest MST3000 episodes ever. I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, but I do not believe that he never appointed his work to be a slow pace and consistency. It is also one of the most difficult films to find because there are so many Hamlets listed. As I have said, although this one is quite boring. This black-and-white, Shagan slowly, and there is minimal decoration. Actors all duplicate as well so that does not help. This is one MST 3000 I can not look at a stretch to call it, as a guy who plays Hamlet says his line can put any sleep.
