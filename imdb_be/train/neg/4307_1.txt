It would seem, it is to become a thriller film winds being almost ridiculous. It made me exclaim: "Oh, my God" more than once in a convoluted plot contrivances that were just silly. <br /> <br /> The bizarre or absurd places only for pure novelty or a dramatic situation, and it is unlikely, almost impossible, human reactions and circumstances too numerous to be comprehended why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have the time and desire to learn how bad the picture may be, you'll want to see it. Otherwise, spend some time watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of time! <br /> <br /> (That film, released in 2003, has already been shown on TV in July 2003, can give an idea about the quality of the film)
