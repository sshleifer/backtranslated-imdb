Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett most incredible display of steam, as John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. The direction of Larry Peerce in trembling uncontrollably between black farce and Roman tragedy. Robert Klein, of course, think that it is the former, and his self-serving performance in a minor role underlines the complete lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film. As a rule, I do not like to let myself get so ascerbic, but Bell Jar is one of my favorite books, and look what they did with it literally makes me mad.
