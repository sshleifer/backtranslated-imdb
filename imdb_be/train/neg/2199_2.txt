I caught the "sorrow" Lost in the Film and Video Festival in New York, and I believe that I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, this is just another visual map FX vocation. The story is quite inaccurate. Poor lighting and camera work, along with the less than great music editing and all this makes the film seem to be of poor quality. <br /> <br /> This is really too much to ask that the FX shorts have the best stories, and there are other technical products will be on par with the FX! You can not just walk away with a cool FX shorts more, as "405" made a big splash this was 5 years old. At the very least, a short fast, cold and even a little funny! None of this can not be said about the "Tribulation Lost.Â»
