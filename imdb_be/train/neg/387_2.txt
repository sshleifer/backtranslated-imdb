One has to wonder if at some point in the production of this film <br /> <br /> script existed, it made sense. Was uneven cut 3:00 <br /> <br /> long and it is cut into an incoherent mess that survives? <br /> <br /> Why would someone to finance this mess? I will say that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha a good young man, and he does what he can <br /> <br /> with dialogue and dramatic (?) The situation he is given. But <br /> <br /> characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity <br /> <br /> does not exist, and the action, cinematography and direction are (in <br /> <br /> put it politely) amateurish. Not a bad sleep <br /> <br /> choice of the name, as it is likely to prove unreliable if someone <br /> <br /> actually try to actually watch the movie.
