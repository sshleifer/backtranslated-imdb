As we all know, Hollywood loves changing historical events around our pleasure, but on the 44th is one of those films hollywoodized. For example, the bank robbers never go back to the bank when they started to shoot at the LAPD is still in the film we see them back in twice! Another example is the number of police officers in Los Angeles, who were shot at the end of the film, it is far from the truth! But, of course, Hollywood has to have a good bloody end that they * * add a little more blood and guts. Some events have been combined, and many of the leading actors played a few different people, but it is something that Hollywood has always done so, why complain? I think the only sad thing is that I have seen several times an hour documentaries about North Hollywood shootout on TLC, which were much better than this!
