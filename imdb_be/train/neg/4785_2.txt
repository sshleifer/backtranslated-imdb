So much wrong with this horrible little wet fart of the film, it is difficult to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a very non-scary scary movie, even Amercian standards. Dialogue clich√©s, the characters are two-dimensional, writing ho-hum, and what little history there is neither consistent nor remotely interesting <br /> <br /> We meet these stereotypes in order :. balding loser Guy (probably divorced, but who knows? This film does not tell us) with a brave heart, young hero (which is nothing heroic does not do), Brave Kid (with a murderous streak a mile wide) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch ( with more muscle than brain). These guys take a constant struggle with the Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil EWOKS. <br /> <br /> Oh, and evil film full of small metal balls whoosing around threatening people. Given the chance, they perform impromptu surgery on the brain of those who doen't have mental to duck when they come to them. Booh! In fact, one of them is haunted by the ghost of a good (but then again, it may be a false ghost), who seems determined to help our gallant Contagonists get their young kidnapped friend. <br /> <br /> There's no background characters or even the introduction of any of the characters. It starts with some summarized the final of the previous film, but it does not explain much. If you have seen the first two films, is excellent. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they relate to each other why they are not in school or at work, or why you should care, they live or die. Thus, you do not know. The only attraction becomes any splashing effects. And not enough of those to keep you awaken. <br /> <br /> With potenial interest / entertainment are three Raider Punks, as stupid as they are evil, which Menace our heroes. But they do not get a lot of screen time. They are cleaning almost immediately. Then they are buried (why someone has to take the time out of me), they appear again as evil Raider Punk Zombies. Just offed again a minute later. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film mostly seems to consist of Caspar the friendly Ghost appears and disappears, driving around looking for a place, and Balding Loser trying to kill catfish Bad Black Bitch Booty, using pick-up lines that will confused mentally retarded teenager. No dice there; . Nha even some gratuitous sex could save this movie so well, that there is never any <br /> <br /> At the head villain, called the Tall Man, you can not scare anyone older than 3 years; howl "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough. Why did he, with his amazing telekinetic powers and supernatural power of the upper body, not just crush our heroes, such as errors can not be explained. Instead, it delegates the work to his inept henchmen little late, that never fails to kill someone before being shot to hell <br /> <br /> filmgoers who like masterpieces like. "Friday the 13th Part XXXXVIII: Jason Goes to College" may find entertainment. Others, who have developed pubic hair will be bored out of our skulls.
