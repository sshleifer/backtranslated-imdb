The only reason that this film a score of 1, that zero is not one of the choices. With plot is thinner than the depression era cabbage, hardcore action, and special effects that look like they came out of the «Thunderbirds» series, it is surprising that Widmark killed the director put the black mark on his resume. Even by the standards of the 1950s, special effects disgusting, a couple of underwater sequences in addition to underwater. I can only assume that he was nominated for the best special effects, because, at 20,000 leagues under the sea, and other than them!, There was someone else makes the effects. It was certainly not a competition to Disney this year, when it was their only competition. I would not recommend this movie, even for hard core fans of underwater films, the most realistic scene of a submarine one shot was limited, where sea water can be seen dribbling down the up-raised periscope. There are other, much better sub movies you can enjoy this era, like the aforementioned 20,000 Leagues or Torpedo Run.
