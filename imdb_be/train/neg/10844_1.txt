Unfortunately, this is not the "best British film gusset as Hellraiser», although the DVD cover says it, that's what I was deceived in the purchase. This, however, is a tribute to the great horror of many old movies of the Amicus particularly stable. <br /> <br /> The Cradle ... shot on mini-DV, that although we all know, has a TV feel, than a film, you can do much better. Each scene is set and the shot looks like it was consecrated in the same way (standard key, fill, rear installation), which only reinforces the cheap look of the finished product. Gusset content, frankly, ridiculous. From the first frames, where we see a man, obviously, foam head torn apart, until the sticky cheap propeller hammers effects creatures and terrible the CG, there was nothing out there that impressed me. <br /> <br /> disgusting acts, with nearly comatose dwarf detective to Brummie through Dani Filth, the least convincing horror movie bad guy I've ever seen. Each of substories more formulaic than the last, and sets progressively worse as the film works. Look out for «Mental Asylum» - Georgian semi detached house with a bad HGOM sign outside, and most of the country (and not in a good way) laid cells I saw <br /> <br /> He took me. four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering (not running) on ​​any available opportunities. I actually found himself dusting at one point, while the film was launched. <br /> <br /> It is, however, to mention one of the last known appearances chest Emily Booth, which I guess is one (ahem, two) things it has going for it. Once it is out of the way, though, it all down. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I would like to believe them, but on this evidence, I will probably not to .. If you want a worthy tribute to Amicus, avoid it and go for the League of Gentlemen Christmas Special instead <br /> <br /> At the present time to deal with Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of worst movie I have ever seen.
