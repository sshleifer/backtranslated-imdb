* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I'm sure back when it was released in 1958, he was much suitable for its time. Then the films were slower tempo to allow viewers to track and analyze the story. Here a person moves to a house belonging to his last wife, who died mysteriously with his new wife. Mickey the gardener (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed the film it) is really underrated character. He gets the skull indirectly warn Jenni that she is in trouble, because he knew that there was foul play in the death of his first wife. He can not tell Jenni just what happened, so he was trying to scare her skull. Jenni, we also find out seeing her parents die, thus causing the life of mental suffering, which lead to institutionalization. Like many other audience today, I found Shagan be a bit too slow for my taste. But if you like a slow horror without much gore, this film is for you. <br /> <br />
