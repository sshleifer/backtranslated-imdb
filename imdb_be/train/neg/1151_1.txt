This film was very depressing. <br /> <br /> characters were so cold. The mother, who is his main character, is there anything other than "mother." Well, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put the husband and the child first. Her husband dies. Then she goes to visit her son and meets this hunk who sleeps with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him. This part of the movie is not all right. Nha perfect, but it can be observed. And charming guy who can blame her? Well, it's not very maternal sleep with the lover of his daughter, but let's blame, that the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> It becomes completely obsessed with the guy. I think this is the part where I began to love the movie. She always wants to please him in the "old" with starters, while it works on the house of his son (I guess that's the only thing she ever learned to do) as if it was the only way she could get his attention. The guy obviously is not very interesting (actually, it's more like he felt asleep in charity work with her), and instead of being wounded, she continues to plead with him to go to sleep with her and be nice it when it becomes It is tough. "I want to please you," she tells him in a desperate way while he insults her very much. <br /> <br /> What offended me in this film is a complete lack of self-esteem of the mother for himself. She says Craig something like "I'm just a shapeless lump" for the first time, they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This film is a kind of insult to women. If it were me, I would have bought a small object, which would have brought me much pleasure and much less emotional pain ... :)
