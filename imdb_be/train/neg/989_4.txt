Okay, so I found out about this film, and I watched the preview read almost all the reviews and had difficulty discussing whether I should watch it or not. Before I even watched the movie, I was emotionally at him strangely. I was so sure I was going to watch it, and disturbed, like a long time. So I decided to risk it and watched it, and that's what I thought: Getting started fine for me. It seems to be moving in a decent direction. There are past the scene of rape, and I could not understand why people are so worried or bored movie. Do not get me wrong, rape scene was just as sad and scary, but it did not really bother me a dramatic point. Whereas the average came to I realized the boring stuff that happens. It was 5 minutes shots is nothing but people walking around saying or showing anything! it is one thing to have a snapshot of where a person showing any emotion, but the film did not have it. It was about 3 of these senseless scenes where you can see the protagonist of the Mayan view to get out of control, but he did not show correctly makes me want to fast forward. Then, when it is engaged in hardcore partying that was not so boring, but still a little sad. Well, as a note Rosario Dawson has done a great job. Good move on, so finally, after an hour of meaninglessness by the middle of May, revenge comes attention. Where he received the alarm. I do not feel bad for him, he did not get what you deserve, but the whole scene was very disturbing and I just felt all Eck after him. I can not tell you whether or not to watch this movie, because it's so ... I do not know, I can not find the words to sum it up. But if you want to watch it just will not unsuprised.
