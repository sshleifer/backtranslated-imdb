I've seen some very scary horror movies at the time, and although it's not the worst of the bunch, it is, of course, in the bottom half. The script starts OK. Young doctor goes to the hospital as an intern in the hope that it will jump his best work for him and his future wife. Cute huh? The film is then sent directly to the toilet, if you know that something is killing patients. It turns out that there is a demon on the foundation, which is harvesting the souls of men. It is the job of 1 doctor, 1 nurse and 1 guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient down, do a ritual that pretty much only involves cutting language, and then letting the ghosts demon support at home to go out and steal it soul through the magic of cheesy special effects. At this point the film gets ridiculously stupid, I asked for it to be over. There was still an hour to go. It was like a half an hour, "Tales from the Crypt" episode that somehow stretched to one and a half hours of shit Festival. From tiny Lister doing his best John Coffey (The Green Mile) incarnation to Scoggins plays the stereotypical frigid nurse Ratchet, this movie can not be at every possible level. I gave it 2 stars only two reasons. 1) His bride pretty hot, it eased the pain a little bit before the end, and 2) The film actually looks good, much better than the current trend of horror films to be made to the quality of Wal-showcase home cameras. <br /> <br /> In the end, avoid this excrement, even if you have a movie pass Blockbuster (which I do, and I still felt cheated). As a bonus, a drinking game, you and your friends take a shot every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. You drink for 15 minutes in the movie.
