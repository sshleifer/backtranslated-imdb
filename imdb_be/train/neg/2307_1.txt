I was true to his relation to Ms. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. I watched the whole movie with my family and friends. I have no idea what the film was about. After long discussions, we all agreed that this is not one of their best efforts. <br /> <br /> He does not hang together very well. It's too choppy, and there is a bit of comedy. I'm disappointed. It could be much better. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting months to see this film is based on the booklet. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money if you are not a Completist and just want to see all of Mr. Glover and movies Ms. Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend an evening.
