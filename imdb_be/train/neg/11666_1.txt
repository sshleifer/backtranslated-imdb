As gently as I can, I sincerely believe that this film is a waste of time. I do not believe that "warm, emotionally satisfy" the film did others. I found it sad, the music which distracted from the film. The story was thin, the characters are exaggerated, and the direction of pedestrians. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to write a bit about this film, so I make a line at least 10. There's really no more to say, and brevity is important, but IMDb has its lows, so here goes. <br /> <br /> The young want a child is a human talent, looking for time with aging, embittered teachers, despite the father cartoon homophobia. Aging, embittered teacher turns out to drink a lot and teach very little. there is a conflict. Although I do not think it's a spoiler, I added a warning if someone thinks that it is a lot of information, too. <br /> <br /> Basically, I just found the movie boring and pretentious. Waste of my time. I honestly do not understand that there is little fuss there seems to be mainly on this web site, the transcendental quality of the film. I think it really should be avoided. But, as Dennis Miller said: "Maybe I'm wrong."
