Good grief, I can not even describe how poor this film. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect much to begin with. Let's face it, the PG-13 slasher flick pre-destined missing mmmm ... slaughter, so that no one should be surprised at the lack of gore. But it was a level of incompetence and clichés on the display in all other aspects of this film is that really blew me away. <br /> <br /> We have a hero who is quite simple so totally useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. But the bent for books ... she never changed - thus breaking the fundamental rule of the main screen the letter - the character development. If you think the end of the film the poor girl is going to turn around and, finally, kick ass, then think again. <br /> <br /> In addition, we gave probably the least intriguing (and certainly the least scary) killer ever to decorate the genre. I'm not kidding when I say that Dora the Explorer has a worse villain than this film. <br /> <br /> And finally, because the full potential for tension or free of charge removed inept (and, apparently, the thirteen-year-old) director, which could be left to fill the screen time is 2:00? <br /> <br /> wardrobe, that's what. <br /> <br /> Lots and lots of cabinets: large cabinets, small cabinets, mirrored cabinets, closets in Narnia, so much fucking cabinet, you will not want to put yourself in another year. In fact, this film is to be simply referred to as "the closet", and had the idea of ​​a big scary Coathanger on the DVD case. On the back he could have a photo of the audience falling asleep and quotation and Roger Ebert - something to the extent of: "What * @ we just take the time to watch!"
