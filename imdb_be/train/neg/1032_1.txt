Although I was never a fan of the original Scooby-D (because of its unpleasant production values) seems like Shakespeare compared to this bunch of crap brought us Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo about the most annoying and terrible characters created for children (and this includes the Teletubbies, as well as the Tommy tapeworm). Whose bright idea was it to create some short-mutant dog and give him the opportunity to speak, and then ride the characters Scooby-Doo with him? Whoever deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is better). The bottom line is that little dog just unfunny, annoying and cuts on the nerves - and that's just in the best episodes !! After many years, it would be better just to finish the franchise than to create this mess! I can understand why the live action Scooby-D movie they made a villain Scrappy-Doo - because almost all hated him!
