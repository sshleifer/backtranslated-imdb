Europe is the beginning of all time is not fighting the Second World War to the end of the war, Hollywood (with a significant boost from the government) made a ton of movies that have been developed to try to get young people to serve in the army, making the life of the military are "cool ". This is certainly, sloppiest, bearing in mind that the life of a soldier is deprived of work, you will get the best food, and you get to lie all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I'm too young to have participated in the Second World War, but I think there was more than that. There is an urgent feline whiskers plot, and a lot of musical numbers with some of the leading acts of the day. <br /> <br /> I think that in 1943 even the most naive of civil knew there was more going on abroad than silly jokes, depicted in the film. Although I'm sure it had to be regarded as escapist entertainment, I can not help but wonder, when the family and friends of people fighting in the war, were surprised and repulsed this banalization sacrifice their loved ones.
