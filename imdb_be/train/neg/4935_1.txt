"Cave" has surpassed all my expectations, and not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. In principle, this shows: Cavemen are alternative dew, they are confronted with prejudices, etc. Quite possibly, stupid idea ever created; almost be worthy of imprisonment for the authors. One cave shows signs of going to the club, trying to pick up a girl, and then nothing happened. It was like listening to 22 minutes of dialogue Andy Rooney, and then the death of steak knives with the help of ultra-low cannibals. For those who have not seen the show, here is a sample dialogue: "Are you sure that everything is in order with the output from the cave." "Yes, it's good I was 10 -.! Thousands of "fun ... Perhaps the best writing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes cave with an awful makeup, to solve complex social problems ... it sounds like an entertaining night. I also love how bad the recent idea that they turn to make a comedy out of the car insurance advertising. I wonder if they will do Gecko on, so that I can have a new name for the worst show I have ever seen. I would even say that it is worse than the «Viva Laughlin.» At least, «Viva Laughlin» was cut off from something that was more inspired. <br /> <br /> Shows how to do it, I hope there is a comet there somewhere aimed at Earth. <br /> <br /> (Unratable honestly ...)
