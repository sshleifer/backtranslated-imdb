I've seen this movie a while back on the Video CD. <br /> <br /> I'll be the first to mention the good points. <br /> <br /> In the film, the first, at least, trying to seem that it does not discriminate, it does not show a single character as black, and the other as white. Both main characters friends and co-exist very well in the country and the economy, not on the rise, at the same time is not possible. Their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport, sport rifle shooting, as the comrades were not as competitors. <br /> <br /> But, after the 1st of the 15th section runs in the fork. The audience must believe that for some unknown reason, these members must hate each other. This, for some unknown reason, Bosnia is now on the way to conflict. Of course, the script adds to the TV footage, which are the symbols that will be watching live news programs in English, but clips from 1993 entirely in 1992, when the war began. <br /> <br /> History, 1990 elections, the people who caused the war, are not mentioned. The film tries to shift the blame from Karadzic, who was a presidential candidate and leader of the Bosnian Parliament 2nd largest party (SDP). According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP was to have the presidency in 1992, but has been a revolution in January. Bosnian Islamic Democratic Party seized total control of the action and held secluded referendum in March, in which he declared himself the law in Bosnia and declared secession. <br /> <br /> The story begins with IDAP Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, the man suspiciously absent «STtH». He was a pupil of Nazism in the WW2. He even wrote his own «Mein Kampf», in which he stated: "It is not really possible there be any peace or coexistence between the 'Islamic religion' and non-Islamic social and political institutions» <br /> <br /> In 1990, IDAP year he lost the election to "pro-Yugoslavia Moderate" Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim who worked with Christian Serbs during the civil war, and who belonged to his supporters, like brothers. Abdic prevented to take power on Izetbegovic, who lost the election, but the government took place. <br /> <br /> no events on top of the movie, but they are actual events that lead to war. <br /> <br /> had problems with props too. Serbian soldiers wore in the film Soviet WW2 helmets that they do not use. Also, one soldier was holding M-1944 WW2 rifle USSR not only of Yugoslavia used. <br /> <br /> The director and writers had a chance, but they decided to rewrite history.
