Hey, <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen's try to make this about Leonard Cohen! It is filled with just enough Leonardo annoy the viewer to be left wondering why they listen to all these other singer (some dubious) to talk about themselves. Puleeze .... sounds like they are going through their diary entries in junior - who cares about you, what about Leonardo? Guess what people, if you "do something" worth it, maybe someone will make a movie about you. I found particularly insulting parade U2 members, as if this will increase confidence in this film - NO. Leonard is not necessary, or Bono, Edge talk about his spirituality. What would a good idea to bring some of their spirituality through the film for film-makers. Gee, what a concept! I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their covers of Cohen tunes - all other performances were melancholy, and some of them were unbearable <br /> <br /> Cohen fans, do not say I did not warn you. thank you!
