This is supposedly a film about plural grief. As such, he should move the audience and make them cautious with distressed protagonists. Nevertheless, his annoyingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera constantly switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to another, creating choppy unintelligible effect. Most of the characters are living aimless, unstructured life, fastened their professional duties. (It also extends the trust that the person who has just received what is likely a death sentence would be fun to indulge in sex messing with a woman he just met). The storyline (if there is a storyline) difficult to follow. In general, the overall effect is quite disappointing. Despite all this, the acting is generally good, and some scenes are quite powerful.
