I would rate this film minus 10, but, unfortunately, it is not offered. <br /> <br /> Why do not I go to, I can not for the first five minutes of the film said. I had to go with my instincts and left immediately !! Several people in our theater made and unfortunately, I did not follow them. <br /> <br /> The story did not have all of the criteria for the film. Lack of plot. Terrible action! Even Robin Williams was so frustrating that I never see another movie it is. No relationship in the history of the conversation went beyond the living room. I did like Tazer scene. It is a pity that it did not shock the meat in the story of meaninglessness. Someone should Tazer writer and director of this film!
