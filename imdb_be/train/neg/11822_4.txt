I thought that Harvey Keitel, a young, fresh out of the Sex Pistols, John Lydon, then as a bonus, the music of Ennio Morricone. I expected the old school, sharp, Italian police thriller, which was made in America. Istead, I got a mess of a story that never made sense and the movie that left me saying: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions, and not enough action. The result: a potential cult classic has been flushed down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so perhaps, Quentin Tarantino can combine the guys with the best scenario. Oh, and by Morricone :. OK, so not memorable <br /> <br /> In general, not a waste of time, but not a "must see" if you are not a hardcore fan Keitel.
