What the heck is. Someone, apparently, read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We get existential angst mixed with a cheap horror. There were moments that were alarming, but every one of them were balanced terrible music, CGI, or acts. <br /> <br /> The problem with the fantastic story as this is what it feels lazy. Even the work of David Lynch feels that from time to time, and as well as its interesting shows and movies he works far too long. And, unfortunately, it is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> Cast was attractive, and it is almost the limit for this. I believe that it affects the feelings of teenagers, and the fear of loneliness we all have, but do not make the characters are cute enough for us to take care of their destiny ... whatever they may be. The final scene leaves the whole matter is ambiguous.
