I was present at one of the premiere last night, and have the following observations: <br /> <br /> 1. Just because you sent a ton of music videos do not make you qualified to do movies. The film was a surplus of long shots, it does not make sense, terrible angles, and terrible lighting. Editing Sun helped this mess at all. If "Dixie" is a memorial service later her mother says of her hand, but it was never clear what the hell she says. <br /> <br /> 2. The site has promise, but the script was thin and leaky dimension Ford trucks. We will never understand what motivates the characters that actually conflicts they have with each other and how they solve them. Sixteen years is wiped away after 4 days, seemingly by magic. Deep conversations were marred by stupid clichés. (In fact, the whole city was one big cliché of southern life.) Half the audience groaned when Toby drawl, "I got my blood Runnin through a vein GURL» ... and we treated this tasteless line not once, but twice! Autopsies were to yawn inducing and dramatic confession reduced to "I was stupid and stubborn." <br /> <br /> 3. The action was good, considering the skeleton script they had to work. Toby was dark and brooding big part of the film, but when he smiled and discharged, he was charming. It's a shame he did not have more time on the screen as it is. acting chops Kelly Preston are pretty rusty, and it shows. Lindsay Hong talented, and it certainly was not her fault, the authors have made her character so unsympathetic in the beginning that you are not to blame for her father not to come looking for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper was able to do more of this movie, but still looked more or less lost. (And indeed, their characters get lost in the movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you are a fan of Toby, you'll love the song. But often the movie felt like a scene was forced to just so they could have one of his songs - five artists on his label. For example, the official song of the movie of love is "Break here today." You would think that would play around the tender love scene, but did not we hear about ... 45 seconds, it's like he's going to a memorial service. It was as if they said, "Well, we have to use this song somewhere." The song «Broken» is intrusive and best to come out of this movie. <br /> <br /> At the end of the story ... hopefully never fully developed, and the film is terribly uneven, as it tries to forcibly be a vehicle for music and Toby Keith product placement for Ford Trucks. He comes from the people about rebuilding broken bridges, trying to be the power of music, but the story is told so bad that the two points lost in this overgrown clip. I love Toby and really wanted to like «Broken Bridges», but the man whom he had hoped to make this film and let it earned one of his famous shoes you know where.
