This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It says quite a bit, considering some of the options that I did in the movie rental. <br /> <br /> I got this on Netflix is ​​entirely based on the fact that someone I went to high school with a topless in it, topless scene only lasted about 5 seconds, and the rest of the film was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven under my toenails until forced to listen Ryazanov sing spender. <br /> <br /> «skits" stupid and consists of the worst juvenile bathroom humor jokes and locker rooms, and it's such a brazen (and poor) rip-off of The Kentucky Fried Movie, you'll be begging for Big Jim Slade to crash through walls and save us from stupid «Vince Offer" (who, what have). <br /> <br /> If you are a masochist, avoid this rubbish heap.
