I, like many people, I saw this movie at the cinema when it first came out in '97. It was below the average of the film in the best case, defiantly not a "masterpiece", that all these fans of "Titanic", how to do it, how. Firstly, DiCaprio terrible actor no matter which way you look at it. People just like him because of his appearance. His acting "skills" are composed mainly speak a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. Secondly, the film itself was rather boring and simple story: a girl falls in love with a guy, ships them to sink a lot of bad love scenes afterwards. Anyone with an IQ over 50 will understand that this is not a genius by any means. And it's not original. Plus, the director felt the need to drag it on 3+ hours. I could squeeze it in the 1:00 block without losing any of the story. In conclusion, the "Titanic" is the most overestimated film to date. Why he received so much attention and money than I do.
