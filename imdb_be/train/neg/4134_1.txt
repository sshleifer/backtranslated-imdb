I honestly have to say that I could not stop watching this film from the second that he started. Just for how bad it was !!! It's kind of like watching paint dry but much more confusing. I mean, you sit there and just wait for something to happen, something really mostly what makes the whole movie makes sense! At the end of the movie I actually sat there wondering if there was any chance at all, that I may have missed the first hour due to all, or I may have inadvertently switched off during the film and missed the parts that are glued story ( when it was actually once)! The main thing that really confused me about this film, almost at the end of the main girl (if it really is the main man) was in some kind of alternate reality, I mean what the hell is going on at this moment? Suddenly she woke up and was in a mental institution, bedridden as doctors narcotic or something, then faster than it would take me to cut my veins, it flips back and she was getting eaten by some random vampire! it makes no sense to hell! I feel like the creator of the e-mail and require time ago, I mean, I spent 2:00 of my life, watching this stuff! I'm kinda curious to know when the filmmakers really do actually know what that was all! just thought that someone cut all the bits that could do that makes sense, although I think the film would have to be 4hrs long time to make it happen! I am fully on the side of the other person who wrote the other review, I was cheated royally with this film by its name, and alone. I'm just so fucking grateful I did not actually buy the film, no matter how many times IV saw at a local store pound. You'd think that would have given me a clue that the film was a complete pile of steaming trash film, but honestly, I think that Â£ 1 was too much money to spend on this film !!!! what a fucking huge waste of time and a good razor blade, I mean I wish I OD'ed, it less painful than watching this film !!!!
