This is not a movie. This is a collection of loose, ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like unpublished results lackluster 10-year-old with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that it is extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - one of the greasy hair, dead pan look, bet and a nervous tic. - probably shot himself in the creative phase <br /> <br /> If you have made it further than the ten minutes I did not try to fit what you saw Artiste praised above in the context of the European mentality. This is an exact and a waste of time, money, and the film, which would have made William One-Shot Beaudine perverts. <br /> <br /> unfortunate part is that the infinite number of vacuum packing symbols representative of that now passes for most of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors shooting of social communication at the snack counter Wal-Mart?
