I've never heard of this one before my local rental outlet DVD owners mentioned to me; being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction has been banned in the UK, I decided to check it out. The film turned out to boring, amateurish and ugly kind of ride; Sound recording is so poor that the dialogue unintelligible half-time, while the incumbent gives new meaning to the word inept! <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the film is worth a very tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and sheltered ourselves unhappy family living in remote surroundings.

The heroine is the one to interact more with the three residents of the house: a hag from the Bible thumping mother (monstrous ki replay), it repressed (and suffering) daughter and eccentric brother of the latter, who sometimes appears on the scene drooling over sleeping female guests floor. <br /> <br /> Often refers to the dinner has become reminiscences of man-hating mother (as a means of filling in a sad, not to mention non-original, pre-history) and invariably develop in the mother-daughter sparring contests, the film has one ace up its sleeve - twist ending as abruptly as it is brilliant, but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth of the film (as much limp through it all as intermittent parched) and the inevitable feeling of having spent 80 minutes of my time ...
