Warning: Spoilers following. A wonderful holiday at a base in Antarctica, where the real events of the film took place. In addition, libelous!, Scandalous! The film was shot in Canada; presumably mostly Canadian team and actors. I caught the last half of the film recently on Global TV here in Canada. Nothing much to say, except I was quite shocked that the open part of the American historical revisionist propaganda is; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that the Canadian born director Spottiswoode forced to do USAF characters in the film, when in fact the real rescuers, where a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
