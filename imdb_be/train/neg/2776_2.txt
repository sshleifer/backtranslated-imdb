King Maker movie on a series of real (edit) events that took place during the Portuguese occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and art direction flattering, the film has not yet been able to impress the audience, actions, in particular, were extremely scarce. Some actors are struggling to tear down and accents, both real and fake, very annoying. The storyline was also too dull and too stupid to be true, and it was more like a history lesson. The film could not even grab something royal and century-air, and it looked more like an unsuccessful attempt to make the Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> the last word? Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was very poor and the actors could not even give a natural surge of emotion. In short, the film sounded more like hype than the script.
