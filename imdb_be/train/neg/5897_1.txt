Recognized by Japanese director Takashi Miike I can not seem to get the wheels moving with this torpid thriller adaptation of the book Yasushi Akimoto REGARDING evil old woman (and child abuser!), Which is part of a new urban legend: If your cell phone rings with an amazing voice - and you see the message "one missed call" - you will repeat the message just to hear your own final words before your death. The most successful part of the film is a hit satire of reality TV cameras invade the future victims, but not as difficult cases of death (including hidden piece of red candy!) Disappointing and depressing. Frequent gunfire ravaged corpses actually appear quite secretive, and this common courtesy may be the reason that the film, in the end, so balanced. Hollywood predictably jumped on trumped-up story in 2008, but the US version of things are no better. star is not from ****
