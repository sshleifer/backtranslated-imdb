When we were in junior high school, some of us boys sometimes goes stinkbombs. It was thought funny then. But the producers, directors and cast of «Semana Santa» ( «The Angel of Death" in the section of your local DVD video) adults and they still install them. <br /> <br /> As with the previous reviewer who wondered when the actors tried to get out of the set and at home, I doubt that more than one take has been made for any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, hot "Mighty Aphrodite" and other top-rated movies, it seems, undersold themselves this project. Its action does not exist, it is limited mainly to a thoughtful look, which should show how "sensitive" it to the fate of victims of the various film <br /> <br /> But let me warn you. - not be the next victim! Step away from the DVD, if you find it on the shelf. Tbere not so many good shots World feet (only star I could find in the film), and the supporting cast is of lower quality, providing a jumble of poorly made dialogue with the uncomfortable "Spanish" accent worthy of the best high school theater productions.
