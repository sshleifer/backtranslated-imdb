Failure. The film was just not good. It has humor, that 5-year-old, who will not even laugh. I mean, of course, some parts were funny, but most of them are not. Lindsay Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer), and it should work in the best films. The film had to be listed as the original movie Disney Channel, that is, free of charge. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was well done on this film was the music. Nothing like this revamped rock soundtrack does not improve your day. These songs are so good. Especially ALYSON and Amanda are playing in the sunshine and Caleigh Peter Beach Boy lyrics, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If I gave him ten, 9 and this will be music to the film 1. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack.
