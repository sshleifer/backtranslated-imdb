This film is Richard Pryor, Rosie Greer and others. It is interesting WW2 film, and serves as a statement about racism. It is worth seeing to understand the fact that the films reflect how we think about the problems, if they are produced or the time period they portray. The significance of this is the 70-film 40 is not film (WW2). However, there are a few nice scenes with 7 seven black men at the head of the white captain is trying to capture the dam. The story focuses on the captain, knowing that these people are soldiers, not just a company, service. There is a scene, which can be from the movie of the Civil War and WW2 movie, which reflects the fact that the film is all about. Black Lt. It gives the innocent German women on the cheek, and white captain's worried. I enjoyed the movie with the stand-point of curiosity, since stars and Genre were interesting to me.
