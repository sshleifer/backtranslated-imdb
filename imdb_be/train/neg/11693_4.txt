Fun concept, but poorly executed. not bad for the makeup effects In addition, there is really not much to it. There are obvious problems; for example, after what seems to be a week and a week to get the fat to normal size, the protagonist seems to be going from the normal size to the deathly thin in days ... and when he was deathly thin, it remains largely the same deathly thin for what seems a long time <br /> <br /> in any case, the film has a much more serious problem than that -. Film decidedly low-budget TV show quality and most of all the action is pretty awful all around. Robert John Burke seems to always tries some strange growls Charlton Heston embodiment and literally painful to watch ... just terrible what Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both worse. <br /> <br /> the only reason why I give this film is as high as I that once the film enters its final third or so, and the nature of Joe Mantegna takes over the film develops fun, campy «cheesefest massacre" feel, and a crazy gangster scheme for torture completely disgusting Gypsies few fun to watch. The ending, when predictable, also good to eat. Avoid if you're not the king-of-Phile or indeed psychologically up the idea of ​​the voice of Fat Tony Simpson terrorizes the gypsy camp.
