Star Envy some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, you can only expect the best. However, with the "Envy", no one could save this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and colleagues on the sand plant. Both do a decent life, but because Tim has a better performance at work, he is able to afford more than his buddy Nick. Nick dreamer, always coming up with new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with the idea for the spray that makes dog poop disappear (Yes, I'm serious). Love the idea, Nick decides to really invented this product. He does Tim proposal to invest in his ideas and to share profits 50/50. Tim refuses to think the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick invention, called "all-pu-robe" (again, I'm not kidding) ends up making millions. He likes to spend their money on such things as a much bigger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and fancy deserts. Tim starts to feel jealous of Nick. Hence the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it still turns out to be awful. This movie has some of the worst dialogue and the very poor performances of all the actors. Again, as I said before, none of them could not save this mess. Not even big Walken plays a homeless character named Â«J-Man", made this film funny. The film is bad from the beginning, and only continues to worsen <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie if :. * Do you like crap (no pun intended) * Do you want to see Jack Black in a white dinner jacket <br /> <br /> I say, avoid this film at all costs but avoid especially if: * you are outraged bathroom humor you * love animals
