Miscasting happen. Susannah York is a luminous young Jane Eyre, and her performance perfectly. However, Edward Rochester should be 35. White-haired George C. Scott looks and behaves like the late uncle of arthritis 80. Jane is in better shape! He creaks and growls, annoying and gloomy. It is similar to an ax-murderer, who sent his ax to be imprisoned; we are not surprised that he keeps his wife clip in the attic! Great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. There is enough darkness in the novel, but Rochester Bronte is relatively young, athletic, powerful and magical, if he wants to be. He has an excellent voice and singing voice, a good mind, and conscience, he tries unsuccessfully to stifle.
