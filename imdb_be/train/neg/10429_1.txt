The first half was okay, but the last half really, really disappointed. It's funny that even the producers admitted that they have no idea for the ending, and it really showed. What is really sad, I have to write ten lines of commentary at least, to be able to post it. I really did not want to include spoilers to qualify his remarks, as the show is not really worth the effort. If Battlestar galatica first came out I was really excited about the prospect of a better remake, it does not happen that the first season of the border at the time of the space porn. In the end they have cleaned a bit, and actually had some pretty fair drama, so I began to look again. But to finish the series with Kara to be a god angel Cyclone, the same with Baltar and Six was pretty stupid.
