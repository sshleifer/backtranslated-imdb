This kind of "inspiring" saccharine enough to make you sick. He telegraphs his feelings, as the largest semaphore on the ground. It removes from the audience his own interpretation and sense, making the choice for him. Most finishing floats in crying orchestration that has to act as the connecting cables on a dead car; I think you should have these tips to feel if you are foolish enough to watch a movie as unsophisticated and juicy as it is. Strip glows and you wonder if she really has a sense of depth on the screen, or if it's just that --- the display is switched on and off like a light. Because I can not for the life of me figure out how she could find life in such a hopeless film. Despite the fact that it is based on a true story and inspire others that I'm set up, run, and play performances as a third-rate TV movie or moronic high school drama.
