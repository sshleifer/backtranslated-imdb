I tried to watch this movie twice, and even fast forwarding annoying parts, but still could not make it to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this film * really * got any good reviews. I think that these people who give such good reviews are simply trying to inflate the film for marketing purposes. Their responses seem very unrealistic, and it looks like an inside job, which makes things more pathetic. Films have to get true positive comments on their own steam and not flimsy ones !! <br /> <br /> action reminiscent of cheesy porn, not funny. I do not mind low budget films with bad acting, if they know how to work with him. <br /> <br /> I found the main character to cause irritation. His facial expressions and humor was unbearably childish. I thought that this was done intentionally to make the women's plot seems more pleasant and reasonable, but they were even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very uncomfortable (his bosses exaggerated business language) and not funny sarcastic remarks. <br /> <br /> I do not find anything about this sacrificial film but some of the attractive women. <br /> <br /> I have never felt that this rating was misleading. I was interested in his background, but discourages the rest. Of course, to see if you want to, but I just do not want anyone to get their hopes / waste your time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
