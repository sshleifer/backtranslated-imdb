Sun is a typical story of a vamp, Sun Bram Stoker or Anne Rice here. truly original vampire story. these vampires are genetic mutants that sunlight does not bother. they are pure evil. <br /> <br /> film is not perfect. Many actors are clearly amateurs. two wires that play Van Helsing and rally vampire chick is pretty good, though. Film strong violent, which may discourage some people. Also it is loaded with detailed research that many find difficult to understand and may get bored. I was sold on the clever plot and a couple of good performances. NO to tell how well this film could have been if they had a bigger budget and received the mass distribution
