The real irony is this: Joe Besser was at the highest level comedian, and in other situations away from the puppets. He had some experience to be very funny and clever. Maybe Larry and Shemp actually knew him or at least from him for many years and loved his job. So what on earth is happening, when he joined the squad as "the third puppet"? Obviously, there is nothing. Most of these "late puppetÂ» Era shorts, most of the boys against each other or against the other two, Joe, and this is not an accurate Stooge etiquette. "One for all, all for one, every man for himself", to quote Curly with "Restless Knights". One thing about a good team, comedy, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how much they try to take advantage of each other and slap each other around when the chips are really down, they do not stick together and come to help each other. In this particular one, none of this happens. It's almost like watching a dog fight, as one tries to deceive others or to be mean and nasty, and not for comic effect either. One would assume that there is something going on behind the scenes here, art imitates life. Maybe there really was, so why Besser did not stay very long with Moe and Larry. Just look at the history of other teams and say that I'm wrong.
