After reading the book, I loved the story. Watching the film, I was disappointed that so many changes have been made. It is quite clear that the books and films are different, but it was two different stories, but names and some of the history books left. Read the book and you'll have a better idea about the film. The book gives you the best character development. These characters are very interesting and make you take care of them. The seats were exactly in line with the description of the book. Some characters are not included. TV microwave so many wonderful books and stories, it is a perfect example. author's contribution is not always insure a good movie, but it can help sometimes.
