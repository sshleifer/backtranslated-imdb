The show turned out to be a waste of 30 minutes of valuable DVR hard drive. I was not expecting much, and I actually got smaller. Not only do I expect the show to be canceled by the second episode, I can not believe that Geico will ever try to use Cavemen campaign EVER again. I would like to spend the night checking hair for my daughter's lice than watching this piece of garbage. It is interesting that ABC passed to make it fit the show in the fall of '07 unplanned may Hospital / Crime / mocumentary reality show featuring duck Aflac? As if I was not able to express their opinions about this show, let me be clear and say that it is not very good.
