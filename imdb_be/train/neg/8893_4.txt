Celia Johnson well as a nurse. Michael Hordern good as Capulet, though this is his usual whinnying and neighing, but not a patch on his King Lear. John OKonor reads a poem well as Friar Lawrence, though he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman well as Tybalt, in the first of his "JC" role that would make him famous. Benvolio Christopher Strauli is sympathetic. <br /> <br /> A lot of pretty, if not terrible, as in some. <br /> <br /> other BBC Shakespeare And that's all. The rest is weak to terrible. Rebecca Saire was 15 years old at the time of manufacture and do not have a clue about how to act Juliet - she opens her eyes real wide and whine every line in the same way. Patrick Rayekart bad agreed with her, and his self-esteem is inexplicable. Balcony scene flows smoothly and uneventfully with zero emotional or erotic effect. Their deaths come as a relief. If I were a dagger, I would suggest to them a few hours ago. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews ineffable as Mercutio, a big shock if you remember his excellent work in "Brideshead Revisited." He breaks the mirror of poetry of Shakespeare into a thousand pieces of two or three words each, and then screams fragments as disabled and indiscriminate manner as possible. In this production, Queen Mab denies. Awful. <br /> <br /> Directed by Alvin Rakoff, shows only intermittent gift to put the camera where it will show us what we want to see. Opening fight noticeably incoherent. However, there is humor, when in a later battle, perhaps Romeo Tybalt knees right in the cobblers. Tybalt then captures wronged area. Yet it go? <br /> <br /> R & J longest game. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom, or more.
