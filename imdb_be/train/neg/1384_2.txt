Jet Li is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world. He was more than 20 years, and he puts others in the genre of shame. While it is big in Asia, it is almost unknown in the United States. <br /> <br /> The black mask should be a breakthrough film for him, but he's not terrible. First of all, it is duplicated. While this may be the camp value (overwriting not even close, and it's flat in tone), it seems, is not suitable for normal movie watching. Second, the director in this film, Daniel Lee does a terrible job. He cuts the scene so quickly, from time to time, you do not know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and meanders. Supporters watch films Jet Li martial arts to science fiction. Nevertheless, the director edits the scene so quickly that you do not even know who's who half the time! Other times, the scene is still hanging (ie Li starts to cut a hole in the floor of the jeep, while badguys hand guns, two seconds later, Lee and love interest already under the car!) Other scenes so they are unlikely to intersect the point of being quite funny (CD Roma hitman? Just let him throwing stars !!!!). Or need a director who is less prone to cutting machine gun and more to create a cinematic Mise-a-scene. Added rap / techno music goes from normal intrusive. The plot has possibilities, but squandered by cartoon characters that are weaned from any authority, that the film tends to. And we really believe that the love interest does not recognize Simon, because he has a half-mask on? Would not it be hair, the lower jaw, or to give it a voice? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie, Jet Li, try Iron Monkey or classic Shaolin Temple. This ungainly mess a waste of time ..... 2/10
