This time, the hero of the first film became a man, and this one uses a combo fist and feet against a super soldier and universal computer that went awry, and ready to take on the world. I'm sure it was a double team that convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was not no more credible in providing watchable click action. However, it is tainted his trust forever. While Universal Soldier: The Return is not as boring as Double Team or The Quest, it's still pretty awful really, with any style and flair of the original and not the star pairing. This sequel made just for children who are wrestling. When I look back, not even action sequences were all exciting and so this film void cotton rags. In other words, in another banger assembly line Van Damme. <br /> <br /> * 4 (Bad)
