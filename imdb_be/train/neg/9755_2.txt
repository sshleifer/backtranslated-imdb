This 1974 outing Naschy director Leon Klimovskii, and a quick look at the photos and advertising packages can lead you to believe that this medieval romp lies somewhere between the "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately, no. <br /> <br /> This is strictly PG affair with manual sequences of torture, nudity and a little sun on the edge of all. Naschy (of which I'm a fan) struts his stuff as Gilles de Lancre, Â«Antigua Mariscal de la Nation." Unfortunately, it is more a pantomime villain than anything else. It seems with this film, we see him (and) did everything before. Actually therefore Naschy just completed.
