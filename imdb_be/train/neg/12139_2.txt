I remember when it came out a lot of kids were nuts about him. I believe that I was too old to get all excited, and I've been a supporter of real martial arts movie and have always found it a bit cheesy. <br /> <br /> In the early '90s, we were inundated with programs such as this that makes the children feel that they could fight and be a power ranger or equal to these children for 3 Ninjas. I think in the end, parents and filmmakers, so sick, because all that we had in fact been abunch children going around punching and striking all. <br /> <br /> A lot of kids movies have some great point and they try to make it a pleasure for your children to observe and to get the message, this one does not have any messages at all ... he just exploits million less than the difference of things 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> film has no big visual qualities, but it would be waiting for him? Action is very bad. Victor Wong cool actor, but it was inconvenient to have him here .. Short, thick, gimped eyes old fart as a powerful ninja who was just rowing. Children no longer have acted too much, and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was perhaps the worst child actor I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There's a story that people know before they even read the review. -Nindya ... yes you know that they are going to fight a bunch of bad guys and win, obviously ... Need I say more. Sorry if I spoiled it for anyone. <br /> <br /> With all that said kids will love it. This film is intended for children and only children can enjoy. If you do not mind your kid to see movies about children fighting is a good film, to allow them to see. If you do not mind, that allow your children to see all the garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts, the real action or period of reality, then you have found the film for their children ... I say kids because I think, that even a girl like this ... I remember all the girls who have a crush on Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for children and still make it enjoyable for adults..this movie failed big time on it .. kind of cheesy and nothing original or unique, and I would not allow my child to watch it ... kung Fu TV series on DVD and there are tons of great Shaw Brothers films there. Sun ..Why show their children that will really make them happy and do not make them stupid on the road, maybe even teach them some steps and not just as a man pushed between my legs, my grandfather did for 3 Ninjas ... no no no ... never push a man between her legs ... ever .. so like unninja.
