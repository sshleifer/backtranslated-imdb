This film was a critical and box office failure in 1957 he was based on a novel, which later developed into the game - which is a flop on Broadway. The history of some naval officers who are on vacation in San Francisco during World War II. They have a 4 day vacation, which they spend at the Mark Hopkins. The film meanders a lot and none of the characters does not give very real. Cary Grant, as a rule, in a brilliant comedy and drama - but here he plays a kind of auto dealers, and he does not really pull it off. Tony Curtis and James Garner would have been a better choice. Audrey Hepburn was originally set to play against Grant, but there were other commitments - so Suzy Parker intervened She had never acted before, but it was the top-photographic model of America at the time .. I think she did a good job, taking into account all pressure she was under. Grant pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few short scenes - in fact, does not work. The studio is trying to give it some class, working with Grant - but the character had no substance at all.
