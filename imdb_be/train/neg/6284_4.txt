I liked the original premise for the film, which is what led me to hunt it, but the problem is, I quickly discovered that one pretty much knows what will happen within the first 20-30 minutes (twins come from behind the mirrors and take at all). <br /> <br /> There's no real twist (that's good), but the final detected does not make much sense either (as it may be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film, when she evil ID because the mirror?). <br /> <br /> The truth is the scene "outside mirrors" were resting, when they first appeared, and the murder of the blonde effectively horrible, but eventually, unfortunately, this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more interesting scenario , pile on the atmosphere and the atmosphere above the upper scary sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets pretty boring.
