After watching this, I thought to myself, if there is too little good writers and directors of many manufacturers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a terrible movie. Terrible, so that it is not fun, and makes you clench your teeth and quiver. Makes you scream "it's wrong" in the film. Immersion exactly zero. At this time, most of you are probably accustomed to terrible errors / quirks th in films that have computers, hackers, etc. in them. This film is like that in every aspect. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film a little girl, Emily, brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope that it becomes a big and do it ..thing at least worth something. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Not even see. There is not even the correct action in it. Total waste of time.
