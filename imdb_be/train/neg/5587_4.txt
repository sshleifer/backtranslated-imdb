In addition to its series of "Tarzan", a prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs actually wrote many other books, though, aside from the popular "at the core of the Earth," some of them have been removed. One exception is a novel titled "The image of the lion", brought to the screen as a «The Lion Man» (1936), overly talkative, static, old hat, clumsy and rather vague movie, despite the fact removed in the real locations of the desert. In fact, "film" is the wrong word. The narrative does not move, but it is a snail's pace in a series of sharp jerks. For example, at least five symbols give complicated the opening scene, and then simply disappear. More care for enthusiastic movie fan, they are characters that give the impression of sorts (like a lasso, which runs the hall with drug fault), but came into force the players who were not enrolled! Credited thespians usually come off worse than the unknown. The only exception is the Australian actress Finis Barton, which gives a good value of the stolen harem girl who rescues a young wizard fairy. However, most of the cast burdened with atrocious dialogue King James, who must be heard to be believed! But the way to play this garbage is disingenuous trick that does not seem to place no-talent players in one of the film's registry. Maybe the director J.P. McCarthy scotched the idea. Anyway, it's sad to see a great Kathleen Burke is forced to trade lines with the likes of Richard Carlisle (her father) and John Hall (her fiancé). However, Mr. Hall delivers his lines with a bit more conviction than Mr. Carlisle, but this is not recommended.
