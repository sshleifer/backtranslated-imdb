I am shocked that there are people who loved this movie..I saw him at the Tribeca and the majority of the audience laughed through scenes that were not meant to be funny. I felt bad because the leading actress was in the audience, but to tell the story in this film, you need a major revision..it not even make sense, one second characters question what exactly it is that they snorting..the next scene they are hopelessly addicted and find out how to do it ?? In addition, the ending just took cake..I'm not going to spoil the beautiful conclusion..but is largely blended right in with the rest of the horrible story / script ... watch this movie for comedy when you need ..
