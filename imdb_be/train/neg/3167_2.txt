Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his domineering fiance Kate (Eva Longoria) smotryut in the last minute arrangements for their reception. This morning their marriage and Kate in a frenzy, giving Caterers scolding their demands for food presentation. But, horror of horrors, "angel" ice sculpture, he ordered Kate comes without wings. In the ensuing struggle with the sculptor, heavy "ice" the girl falls on Kate and sends it into the future. Now, a year later, Henry's sister organizes psychic said the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to start dating others will, and move forward. Nevertheless, a great environment, Ashley (Lake Bell) to motivate Henry himself, much to the chagrin of her partner food (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate is back with the other hand to create chaos Ashley, because she does not intend to allow another woman to get her hands on Henry. What can we do to get Kate to heaven forever? This bottomless romantic comedy, one of the worst is a special fan has ever seen. Nope, it is not cast as they try to do the job safely. Longoria beautiful and funny as overbearing bride and Bell has a unique style and sense of humor, which is also contagious. Biggs, funny tragedians also completely wasted. As for the Rudd, a very talented performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, and Clueless, please) he tries hardest, and, in truth, is the main reason to see this clunker. His charm, looks, wit and easy to go a long way in making the movie bearable. But nothing can turn meaningless script and terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. Thus, if you are an inveterate fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork over the money for it. There were even free tickets to fall into your lap, keep in mind that this film is a near-death experience for those who love to laugh, love and movies.
