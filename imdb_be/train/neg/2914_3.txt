The above are used for the introduction of «Gen» film to its audience. Gen is about a young doctor (Dog Ratko) with a sick mother. The film begins with her leaving her mother behind to start a new job. While she goes, we understand that it is not so close to home, as the hospital is located in a remote area. As soon as she walks in the hospital garden, she sees the death of the patient's body. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two police officers come to the hospital to investigate a suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in hospital because all the roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with the outside world cut off too. There is no way out !! In those few days will be more unpleasant murder. Now all suspect each other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. This could be very scary indeed. There are positive aspects of the film, of course. I really like the beginning of the film. Especially if she goes to the hospital, and her first moments in the hospital. Actings okay. Some of them are trying too hard to be a mysterious and scary, though. I think that the final shock was distributed through-out the film. What I want to say that it was a good turn, but instead of showing it as a parody, in the end, we had to understand what will come when we will see what happens. The director had to explain that in general, I do not think it works well. In addition, the most dangerous patient in the film must be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and are suitable for those who spend most of their lives at the hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the director. I'm sure he will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently learned that he is only 21 years old. It made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I'm not going to appreciate this film * to ***** though.
