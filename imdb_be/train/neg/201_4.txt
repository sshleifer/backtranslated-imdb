Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see it in the silver screen? Lots of dancing and music. If you love classical music or modern dance, this may be your date movie. But otherwise one and a half hours is just too long. If you would like to see a skilful dance silver screen, it is best to see a Bollywood movie. They know how to combine the breath taking dancing on a long movie. Director Carlos Saura is able to shoot dances from the old experience. And at times it looks really good. but when the film is one hour and it should be at least most of the time is interesting. There are many kinds of art is not more and more, life, and the film is not too big.
