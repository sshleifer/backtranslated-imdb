In the opening scene, and the dialog box, I knew that I knew I was in for a train wreck. I did not want to look, but could not turn away. If it were not for Meer eye candy with this movie, I would give one star. The fact that the interaction between the characters and the behavior of the relationship was so far-fetched, complemented by poor management and terrible story does not make the film any more than low-budget disaster in. Money, of course, is not necessary to make a good film. But this film is not so bad there was no chance to rebound. <br /> <br /> If you're stuck in the woods, your best childhood friend died of an unknown illness, the other members are dying around you, stranded in a strange place, what would you do? <br /> <br /> A.) Run away from everyone, and try their luck on their own. B.) sex with friends girlfriend. C.) for a hot bath to relax their troubles include shaving my legs. D.) Bash in the head childhood best friend and life-long crush with a shovel. E) All of the above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers is not so far-fetched. In fact, all true and well represented in Cabin Fever. The complete absence of reality and illogical attempts to explain what people will do in traumatic situations, this film throws in BONEHEAD bucket at your local rental store. Stay away. Stay away.
