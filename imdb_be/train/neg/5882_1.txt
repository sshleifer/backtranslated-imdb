I do not know why this film was advertised as wild, quirky, laugh filled comedy. There is not much in this film that will entertain and delight of moviegoers. Annette Bening (whose actions are touted as Oscar worthy) comes off here as educated, with its apparent performance routine. Brian Cox character is confusing and annoying, and play a leading Augusten ?? Joseph Cross ?? apparently, just not a person to carry a role. The best thing about the movie Evan Rachel Wood, but it is not enough to support this sad unsightly film. <br /> <br /> The film quickly disappeared, and it seems to be good reason. I found some of the scenes of unpleasant (the scene with Brian Cox and it's just to use the toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in the "You and I and everyone we know" and "The Squid and the Whale"), some awkward, and most of them worried. I found the whole experience a waste of time. You will not waste your time ??
