After only look Eyes fear, I have to be honest ... I just do not like. I read so many good reviews about this film, but I just did'nt get where these reviews come, <br /> <br /> I have a lot of time for beginners in film-making, and I am sure that the director will do well for themselves, but the budget they have been the main problem was, there were two chambers, which is used throughout the film (which was fine), but they seemed very cheap cameras. Another problem is in the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, everyone is talking one on one - it is simply impossible to hear what they say <br /> <br /> He had. a good idea would be for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car, then drive off, they get chased by a car they have got some time, driven by an insane woman who wants to kill them, and has a lot of chances to do so ! ... and on the other hand, the girls have much of a chance to escape, but no! <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ... I just scraped through it!
