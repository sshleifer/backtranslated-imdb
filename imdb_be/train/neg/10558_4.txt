I do not know why it has supporters that, and I do not know why I even gave him a bill I have. This is ridiculous. There are numerous Giallo, where one has to suspend disbelief, even if the image roll and catch up with it somewhere, before he becomes delirious and some poor police officer must eventually explain what I saw. But it is very little going for it and has a very long sequence where nothing is happening, and has nothing to do with anything, as long as we have to listen to the most repetitive soundtrack, even by Italian standards. Nha Giallo, Mish is a complete mishmash of horror ideas with Klaus Kinski in one of its most egregious "phoned in" performances. I believe that he was made to work one day and paid leave Mr. DAmato to force others to fill. Ewa, of course, beautiful, but no, it is not enough, and in the end, we have already seen too much of her outbursts to around long after we have completely lost interest in this pretentious and meaningless conversation. Maybe I just was not in the right mood!
