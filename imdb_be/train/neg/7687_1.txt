I started watching this film with high expectations. However, an hour later, I was disappointed in this film, as it is only instilled a lot of unanswered questions at me. It has already started in the opening sequence, and only worse. <br /> <br /> Why do they hide Hollander under the statue? Why Italian Comediant present? Why is the farmer's wife to save Hollander? Why did he, to save and not to run for their lives rather than to start to make love to the wife of the farmers? Why not save the farmers wife Hollander at a time when the farmer is not around? Why are these supposedly illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why Italian Comediant Hollanders know about gold? Why did he hide it in a cesspool in the middle of the property evil farmers? These and many other questions popped up, and none of them did not seem to get an answer acceptable way. So I guess I'm completely missing the point of this film, and I'm not connected to the history anyway ....
