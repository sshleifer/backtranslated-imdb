Most of the scenes should be cut. There are many scenes that have been cut off. For example, the scene where hunters mentions "I got a spider on my dick", "I love Dick", playing on the stage of the mud, or the bar scene where professional hunters Dinocroc main job is snake charmer. <br /> <br /> What about the other terrible incoherent scenes involving women, Diane, who wants to lose her virginity to a guy who walks around like he's wearing panties three sizes too small. While they make love, they do not realize they are doing it next to a little boy, who soon escaped and lose your head? Why do they do it in the living room? I mean really, his head is turned. How about the beach scene is very reminiscent of the scene Jaws Steven Spielberg on Lake Grant. All these strange scenes can be easily duplicated and re-billed as a comedy. <br /> <br /> Here in my local town, Cineplex theaters were advertising for several months about Dinocroc, and I'm glad that I did not watch it because I later found out that it has been shown in only 1 or 2 days before was canceled. The film is so bad. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie to watch on the preview. He has a leg Dinocroc, which looks like a child wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down as a 2-year-olds. It can be easily moved to the baby geniuses. <br /> <br /> If any student film wants to find out what to do is not a true classic thrash. Such as Diana's boyfriend, who walks around like he was an advanced case of syphilis it makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk, even before he gets to drink beer. When this happens, those who care about Dinokrkah? Pants man looked more interesting than the whole movie in Dinokrkah. His acting was so bad that it does a much better substitute Mr. Bean. Move Rowan Atkinson, this man with the best comedic talent in horror sci-fi movie. Perhaps worse than casting in Hollywood history.
