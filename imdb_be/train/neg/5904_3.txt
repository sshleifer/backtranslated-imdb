With the "Army of God" a runaway success, every Mormon with the camera seems to be trying to make a movie right now. In the case of the recent "The Other Side of Heaven", it is not bad. This film, though not large, was quite good. «The Singles Ward», however, is not. <br /> <br /> In telling the story of a young, divorced Mormon guy shoved back into a life of writing and shooting style «The Singles Ward," is largely a way very similar to the '80s comedy "Ferris Buellera Day." However, the similarity ends. While "Ferris Buehler" was funny, original, and well acted (how stupid comedy as ever), «The Singles Ward» quite the opposite. He tries very hard to be funny. Nevertheless, 90% of the gags fall flat, or any clichés and jokes, you've probably heard a million times. The remaining 10% seems to be cast to fill the time. And action, while not terrible, it amaturish at best. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you are not a Mormon himself, very, very familiar with the Mormon culture, you get almost nothing at all. While "God's Army" and «The Other Side Heaven" were attractive to a wide range of audiences, both inside and outside of the Mormon Church, this film is definitely one big inside joke, and even if you get it, it's just not funny.
