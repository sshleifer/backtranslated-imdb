I'm sure for people watching this movement outside the UK, this film will be interesting hour, but for someone from the UK is hurt in this error. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the movie gets by Elijah Wood tube station on the bank, which has been moved to the Trash. He says his sister, whom he meeting, "What happened here," and she replied: "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham in already .. they are part of the city, they do not need to go there and if! Tottenham fans will want to fight with other fans last place on earth, they do this the bank station, where, probably, more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> There are several other similar errors, but most a big drawback for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligans. He has clearly decided that we should not try to talk to the East End accent and instead g Ralea chose Van Dyke Nei style layout that made my ears bleed. This was underlined by the fact the rest of his gang all said so, as you would expect West Ham fans talking. This error has made it incredibly in the role and really spoiled the film.
