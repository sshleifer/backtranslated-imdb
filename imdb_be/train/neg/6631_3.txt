Ram Gopal Verma has established itself as a very innovative and competent leader. He made a remake / shlifovanivom Godfather with Sarkar and succeeded tremendously. The same applies to Lolita, which he did as Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay it was a movie, he has repeatedly said that inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he was able to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake. <br /> <br /> Act ranged from decent very good, with Amitabh Bachchan be appropriately menacing as the villain Babban. <br /> <br /> songs were terrible and forgettable. Mehbooba Mehbooba song came out as the second year of the clip <br /> <br /> The worst was pacing and dialogue -. That was forgotten <br /> <br /> Watching a movie at the cinema. I found that expects the intermission and then the final. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving throughout the film. In the end, one of the worst films made by Ram Gopal Verma.
