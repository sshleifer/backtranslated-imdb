Wow, this is, finally, there is; action "film" without action. The position of the real low-budget (do not miss the fun of flying saucers flying several times) we find the future of Seattle Hardbody Sun-brain seeks to avenge his childhood. <br /> <br /> There's nothing even remotely original or interesting about the story and the performance of the actors compete only in stupidity attempts to steal from other films, mostly, "The Matrix", not having the money to do it right. Yes, we get to see some work on the walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 seconds approx.) But these scenes are as cool as a silly attempt Hardbody in jokes about male incompetence now and then. <br /> <br /> And, yes, we also serve a number of conclusions that do not lead absolutely nowhere, as if the scenario laid out by unseen actors during the filming of the scene. <br /> <br /> Believe me, this is as bad as it can possibly get. In fact, he does not deserve to be taken seriously, but maybe I can make some of you do not rent it and save your money.
