I was gifted with this film, as it was a large room, the friendship of three women bespoiled one fall in love with a young man. <br /> <br /> An intriguing. <br /> <br /> NO! I hasten to add. These women are drawn in at a caricature, not very supportive of each other and in the conspiracy and managing to bring each other. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton can do no wrong in my book before seeing it, but here they gave a dull script and said to balance between action and madcap farce, which does not work too well when all women are well-known experts in a very small town. <br /> <br /> for smart women they spend a whole lot of time lamenting the absence of men / sex / lust in his life. I felt so much more could be made of it was given a decent script and more stress, lesbian podagovor went nowhere, and those of smoking / drinking women (all in their forties 3 ???) were very unrealistic - even in the nursery stage - screw child , give me a cigarette! That's right. <br /> <br /> As I said, the waste shame. 4 10.
