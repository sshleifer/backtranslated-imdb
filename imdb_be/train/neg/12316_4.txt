Directed by Jonathan Lynn made several underrated comedies in the past as "greedy" and "Clue". This is not one of them. More like the movie "Police Academy" than its inspiration, is played by Steve Martin in the old role of Phil Silvers as an army sergeant ever pulls a scam under the noses of the authorities. But the idyllic life Bilko and his platoon lazy look shaky when visiting the old enemy base is determined to catch Bilko in the act. Nothing much happens in reality. It's all pretty boring. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a couple of laughs through sheer force, but they are better than this, and it's quite painful to see how they work with the delicate material.
