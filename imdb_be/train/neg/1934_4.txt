Follows the usual formula to put a rookie - this time, the first African-American (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman desegregates Armed Forces - through the program of deep-sea diver training US Navy, which operates a racist bigot (Robert DeNiro). If the program is not bad enough, it must be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and shouting gibberish effectively. Cuba Gooding, raised by a strict father as a poor black farm boy in the south, is the expected model of sincerity. Girls - one could hardly call them women - it Charleze Theron and Lonett McKee. They have a small role, and basically there claim that their men should exercise common sense. Other notable performers - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have a more formal role <br /> <br /> That's about it .. Almost everything else can be collected using a computer. The ship is called the boat. Robert De Niro salutes indoors, uncovered. After the brutal attack on the hospital staff, he moved with his outfit, instead of being destroyed. Someone shouts: "I'm here" in the early 1950s. (Maybe it was a common expression at the time If so, "My bad.".) People turn to each other by rank - "lieutenant», «Mate boatswain», «Commander», as they do in the Army, while in the Navy, they simply "master" (if an officer) or by their name name (if enrolled). I did not bother to check if there is a rank called "Senior Master Chief» in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a tough row hoes. All in the Navy, it seems, hates blacks for a guy from Wisconsin, with the exception of. He stutters and despises others in its class. It's like the scene in "Animal House", in which the applicant luxury brethren asked to wait in a room with the Sikhs, a black man and a blind child. <br /> <br /> Gooding is an ordinary man, the foreman of the second class. He managed to marry a beautiful woman, who just graduated from medical school. In one of his arguments she pleads with him. She just wants to be a doctor, and he should join her, throw fleet, and lead a quiet life. "And just let life pass you by?" He replied ,. Yes. Yes, a doctor's wife, and let life pass you by. You can wave to him from the golf courses in Boca Raton. <br /> <br /> These kinds of clicks were fairly common during the Second World War. «Bombardier», «Airial Gunner," this kind of thing. Cheap as they often have had some educational functions. You learned something about getting scorer or gunner. Here, the technical details are omitted, perhaps because the author did not know anything about them (except for Boyle's law, which we learned in high school chemistry). <br /> <br /> I could not follow what happens during certain emergency situations, without which the film as it will not exist. If I got a mechanical problem correctly, it was because I correctly guessed. Direction does not help either. The film is replete with windows closed, so much that they lose any dramatic impact that they might have. And emergencies confused because they do not focus. <br /> <br /> Why go on? Want to see the best example of this kind of film? Almost any will do - except, maybe, "Mr. I. Jane, "in which the hero is abusing heroin. Try training camp scene in the "Young Lions". There the victim Jew. Or try the "From Here to Eternity," in which there are no simple sympathy buttons entirely pressure, and an adult victim who refuses to bend and who is active as a result of the conflict, just as "Cool Hand Luke." A lot of light justification is not offered because it is easy excuses too easily. <br /> <br /> Carefully template, and not very well done.
