The beautiful thing is withdrawn, gay films usually end with broken relationships or premature death. And some, like loosened, only the end ... period. <br /> <br /> The creators of this monstrous nonsense to have a thing or two to learn about the story, direction and time. During the first ten minutes of the film, I found that a little confused, and even more so after the first glimpse of the character in the upcoming Elkayma small psychological session. It seems that this film was random pieces without the slightest attempt to continuity and consistency. There's no real way to know if you are viewing a gift, or some unearthly retrospection. I could only take so much before he became really unattractive. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden of The New York Times called the film Â«... shimmeringly beautiful and very real." Well, it seems that Stephen invested in beer glasses before watching, since it is really far from the beautiful . Because of all the praise this film received, I expected something worth watching. Unfortunately, the movie lived up to its name. And by the end of the film (which is not provided for any permission at all, I might add), then it is clear that the authors, the director and the film has everything Come Undone.
