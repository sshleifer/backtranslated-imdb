This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not exaggerating, I told the guy at Blockbuster, they must take off the shelves. The only thing that is interesting about this film box. On the box is written "from the director of The Boogeyman", so I figured ... you name it, if it has been done in recent years, I am sure that direction, at least, will not be too bad: - \ but after I I saw the movie and looked at the fact that "the Boogeyman" they said it was some nonsense from the beginning of the 1980s, he did. A great way to rush to unsuspecting viewers. <br /> <br /> In any case, I think they just liked the name "Zodiac", and did not bother to investigate any of the actual Zodiac crimes or MO, or even years, he was active. All the crimes that they are talking about has nothing to do with the Zodiac and the "history" of the original Zodiac takes place several years after the actual Zodiac crimes done. They also compare the Zodiac "Vampire Dusseldorf" Haarmann throughout the film and talk to the "son" Fritz often. Zodiac and Haarman were not similar and it makes more sense to compare it to BTK, who also shot people, and not the man who killed people by chewing through the neck. None of the facts are unfounded Haarman either, just a bunch of jumbled nonsense. His son even says: "Do not forget that his name was Haarmann from the 2nd t" ... his real name only has one! I think the writer / director just typed in the Google search for the serial killer and the fastest of them who came was in the zodiac and Haarmann. «Ooh those sounds like a cool name, let's make a movie about them, without making any external research! Great idea! »<br /> <br /> Maybe my favorite inconsistency in the film so that the experts, as well as the young assassin describe suffer from the DSM-IV and getting cured from it. "I was also diagnosed with DSM-IV and has since recovered," etc. For those of you who do not know, DSM-IV is a psychological tool for mental disorders. If someone is suffering from the book itself, then they must have some serious problems! Haha. <br /> <br /> In any case, my point of view, it is at the bottom of my top 5 worst films of all time list, and it is rare that the film never reaches this point. But, if you are interested in viewing absolutely no fact-based story about serial killers, what's going on, there was nothing sad, full of inexperienced actors, and not quite rational, I would say check out this movie. <br /> <br /> ... Yes, and I liked how the killer "tear gassed 'some of his victims with dry ice. Good touch ...
