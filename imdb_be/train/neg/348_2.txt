This movie is crap and forgotten Sean Connery car. Presentation, usually bad especially Kepy, Fishburne, and usually solid Ed Harris. Connery seems like a miscast Academic Harvard. The film is absolutely gets worse as it goes along. This is the secret of the third course, which becomes extremely far-fetched at the time, he unravels. The film spends a great supporting cast. George Plimpton also appears in a minor role, to add ambiguity Connery, as they discuss the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere peppers third year mystery / thriller that manipulation of the highest degree. Scripts and direction are extremely poor. charisma and screen presence Connery only virtue of the film. Manipulative, Violent, and funny. 2/10 avoided.
