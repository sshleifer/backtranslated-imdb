I do not usually take the time to make the observation that few people will read about films, few will see. However, in this case, I feel that I must warn all those who might consider spending time on it. I just finished watching it five minutes ago. It is, quite simply, one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Actions are terrible, there is no plot, and the value of production is the level of poverty in the best case. I know that even a low budget film can be great, but not this one. There is one thing that could save the film for the purposes of any fan of horror in - more blood on the screen and fray! A grand total of three times, that it takes place outside of the screen. Despite the fact that an effective and quite disturbing when it happens - especially the end of the scene - there's just not enough. The film is too long, this minimum content is also heavy dialogue, and thus, it is practically impossible to observe. What happened? To put it all in a nutshell with a margin of three teenage girls recklessly and deliberately go out driving through an isolated area, where more than 20 women were previously kidnapped and killed. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to close old home inhabited by three crazy people - one of whom is a psychotic killer. All three eventually killed, one after the other, behind the scenes, after what seems like an eternity boring, slowly changing nonsense. As I have said, the only thing worth seeing at least once, is murder. Please do not buy it or rent it for just that, and do not be fooled like I was misled box art and film description. Save your money and time.
