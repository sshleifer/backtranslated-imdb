This is the only the worst movie I have ever seen. Let me say that again: this is one WORST MOVIE I've never seen <br /> <br /> He had all the ear marks bad movie :. continuity error, the written form of bad, bad acting, bad production costs, bad music. I thought that there were a couple of points to horror movies. Firstly, it should be quite disturbing to scare you. This movie gets and F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies, or something bad happens to them, we have to take care of. This movie gets an F in this regard as well. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman gets mauled by wolves after being afraid that this might happen to her. The following story, OCD guy dies from not being careful about talking to his dead friend. Oh, and then there is a terrible, nail-biting story wrong roommate. Well, you could choose a theme a little more interesting and a little less than alone in the house, being anal-retentive, and which has a roommate? It turns out that all of these stories, where hallucinations, virtual reality, induced by doctors who in turn uses it himself. Wow, it's silly. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something, I love watching bad horror movies and laugh, how bad they are. I could not do it. It was a complete pain to sit and watch. Nha under any circumstances watch this movie. You'll regret it.
