Fine story concerns two small town brothers and their struggle for the honor of the family. David Morse is responsible, puritanical policeman and "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, "bad" boy, former soldiers and ex-convict. As an actor (especially in his early years), Sean Penn seems to be modulated by its performance in the framework of the method. As for the first-time author and director for this artistic, stupid dramas, he works his script and character through the same methodical process, slowing his pace down to a crawl (supposedly so that we can catch every nuance and intonation). This approach can be fun when they were three-dimensional characters indifferent but photogenic Morse and Mortensen not very convincing as siblings. Worse, we expect much more from the beak of veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who hardly get a chance to come through with something interesting. Picture stubborn with swollen sequences, descriptive fragile and confusing editing (always sideways to indicate the artistic excesses). Foam tricks with the camera to show a talented eye, but they are mostly boring. * 1/2 ****
