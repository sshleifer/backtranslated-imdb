Well, I've seen a preview of this stupid movie. In the first film so staged and not real, they all come. They can not sing. They are too full of themselves. Its awful. So children are 8 to 10 might enjoy, but it is really stupid. I mean, they are told that their child is the manager. And there faking label. His stupid. If you do not see it. <br /> <br /> As for recruiting and directing, it is not so bad. This documentary cute but stupid documents. <br /> <br /> see it, if you do not like good music. In addition, it is very banal. It's not even tasteful. I hate to be so cruel ... but it's actually a piece of junk.
