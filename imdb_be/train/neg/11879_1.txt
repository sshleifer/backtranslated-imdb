My wife and I rented this film, because some people have drawn parallels between him and "Office Space." Blockbuster IMDB and even had him as a "well recommended" choice if you like "Office Space". <br /> <br /> At the present time, I've seen office space, probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. This is probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people I've worked with for many years. «Haiku Tunnel» similar to "office space" in that they both films. That's where the similarity ends. We sat for probably the first 50 minutes, the HT, giving him the benefit of the doubt in the hope gone, * praying * that would be better. He did not. We could not take it anymore, and stopped the tape. Thank God, it was a free rental. I would p *** ed if we actually paid for it. We need to be covered for, to sit through it. Now, since we have not seen the end, perhaps, by some miracle he comes along and redeems himself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Haiku Tunnel is so bad that it is hard to believe that ever got production. Film SO unfunny it hurts. Just send mail damn letters already !!! The premise of an ass. Jokes are terrible. We got as far as "the printer does not work" scene and had to stop. We could not take it anymore. This film is for Josh EMBARRASMENT Kornbluta. <br /> <br /> If you are a supporter of the Office Space ...... do not waste your time with this excrement. 0/10
