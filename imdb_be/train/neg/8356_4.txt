Peter Fonda as deliberately dismissed as an actor, that his line-reading Lacrimosa cancel any irony or humor in the dialogue. It trades arrogant pricks without witty witty with Brooke Shields, as if it was a wooden block from off the hair; even his small touches (eg, touching nonexistent mustache on his face grizzled) did not disclose the nature of so much as a hesitant actor being directed by he himself, unsure filmmaker. In the south-western part of CIRCA 1950 a poor gambler (not above a little cheating) wins orphan as a teenager Lolita in an unsuccessful game of poker; after getting to get a treasure map of a promising gold in the Grand Canyon, a couple of profanities became miners. Some excellent prospects, and the odd but interesting cameo Henry Fonda as a grizzled man canyon, are the only compensation in the tired comedy drama, with two wires that trailed cartoon killer who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on, the card. Shields is very beautiful, but - although the camera loved her pouty, glossy beauty - it has no presence on the screen (and its tinny voice has a range of all); every time she opens her mouth, one is inclined to either cringe or ducks. * 1/2 ****
