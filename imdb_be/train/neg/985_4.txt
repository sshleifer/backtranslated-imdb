"Dead leaf Office" is a low-budget film about several Australian postal service employees are struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the poor current and past communication between these characters and fatalities are of mentality awkwardly and excessively schematically. What is most disappointing of all, however, this image is a life in the name of the office of the film: no mechanization whatsoever, and it is absolutely impossible to find out that any of the staff really do for a living. Of course, part of the story is that the office is under threat of closure, but this kind of office, of course, closed in 1930, if it ever really existed. It's a shame, because the overall tone of the film and a sharp curve, and there is some promise in the script: but some of the details convinces. Overall, he feels the work of someone who really did not feel much of real life; student film, the concept and outline, but, unfortunately, little else.
