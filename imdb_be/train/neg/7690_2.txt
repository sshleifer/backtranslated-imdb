Anyone giving this film a good review, obviously, there must be something to do with its creation. This film is a painful suckfest. Acting tough, the stock of the overall soundtrack ridiculous, insipid direction and strangest of all, the teacher is not really all that attractive (making outrageous success of the student all the more embarrassing). The creative minds behind this garbage should be disbanded and laid out to prevent further manifestations of this concentrated craptitude. I'm sure that some of the starving children in Africa could use the money wasted on this project. Damn, these funds will be seen as more enlightened goal refueling crack addict; at least someone will get some fun out of it. For the reason that he did not give me an incurable disease, I give this movie two.
