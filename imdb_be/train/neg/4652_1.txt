It was a painful example of cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced Australian television stations to run local content quotas. The letter was really scared, and I'm not surprised that the authors are responsible for the worst Australian film in recent memory Honerable Wall Norman <br /> <br /> Currently, about this show was not funny. - never - not even a little funny. He was just tired and BAD, and, worst of all, he really thought it was interesting. It was just embarrassing to watch. <br /> <br /> There is something very Suess about this show is on 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) review of the (real) Australian audience the show (there was not much), and it is impossible. Or crazy. There is a loaf of bread, which is funnier than this show. <br /> <br /> Do not show any cost, and when it comes out on DVD, remember that laughter, which deserves been unintentional.
