He's not even worth considering, except as a warning to potential viewers. This is a somewhat generic ghost story about the actress has in the studio during the filming of the drama of the Second World War. There is no fear involved, entirely unknown Whatever it was, nor any surprises. One shocking thing that looks a little too silly to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, although there are some really good editing once in a while. History never comes together, and the film is really just a general search. 4/10.
