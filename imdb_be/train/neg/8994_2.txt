This film is a prime example of squandering more resources in the film. Do you have future SNL and SCTV stars in their prime, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Frank, Tom Davis, and Joe Flaherty in fact doing 70 minutes of rough, uninspired fart jokes and racist. Network concept of future discord society would really was adopted some interesting extremes, but instead just a gate, making unsuccessful, juvenile proctology joke and remains in the same spirit all way.Seek humor with earlier and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or later, cheerful Kentucky Fried Movie. This film is only for those who want to see a capsule from a bad 70's sketch comedy movies.
