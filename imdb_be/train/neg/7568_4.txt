Chan-wook Park is nothing if not resourceful. I'm A Cyborg, but that's normal full of funny little technical pretzels with some brilliant ideas sprinkled in between. Trying to follow in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (The City of Lost Children, Delicatessen), Park embarks fanciful, light-hearted tale, which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be a violation of his ambition or his vision, it is really surprising, then, to see the best Park are such very small. <br /> <br /> I'm A Cyborg, but that's OK, it seems strange to deduct from themselves, as it goes forward, with the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, jokes are rich and unusual sense of humor is a lot, but it is not a pity to create any significant connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played enthusiastically throw, but try as I might, I could not bring myself to care for some. <br /> <br /> Sympathy for Lady Vengeance was a wrong step, showing that, perhaps, the park was a little self-indulgence, but still failed to demonstrate some of the unique flash and director behind large filmography, was easily forgiven. None of the guaranteed assurance that commanded AREA or sympathy for MR joint security. Revenge can be seen here. I'm A Cyborg, but that's okay because I left a full-time, I found myself instinctively forward, from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave the lady 5/10, and by this measure, it probably deserves no more than 3. In the good old days, I'll be generous: 4/10
