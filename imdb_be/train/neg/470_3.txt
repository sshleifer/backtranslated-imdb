I used to love this movie as a kid, but when he saw him again 20+ years later, it really sucks. To the Academy may be ahead of his time in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack, and Stripes holding a lot better today than this steaming Dogpile. A lot of T & A. No more jokes for jokes, except we've all heard a million times is now. <br /> <br /> I recently bought a DVD in the hope that it would be a stone I remember this time. Well, I was away! The soundtrack was only 2-3 well-known hits (not broken compilation others have mentioned) and frequent announcer were terrible. The only thing that was interesting to me, predicted that the line of the character have been before they said it. Yes, I watched this movie, which is a lot of time! <br /> <br /> The only reason why I am writing this review to give my two cents about why this movie should be forgotten, unfortunately. :(
