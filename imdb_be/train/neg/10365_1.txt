Awful. This thriller was buried. That piece of shit. Threatening letters, characters less truthfully. Terrible Schlock !! Shelf B- some stars in the terrible work of POS, to try to give him a little credit, but fails miserably. If I do not write ten lines about this movie, I would give him an overview of the words of the word, it begins with a "w" and ends with "it." <br /> <br /> Horrible ending, backward. Who writes this crap. The ending of this film is so far-fetched, is poor as if they had no idea what to do with the story line, or they simply run out of money. Most likely due to the number of cameo in this film. It is good that these actors at the output, because it would be a career killer. Well, for them, it is unlikely that anyone will see. At least, not of principle, as well as future investors. This could result in thousands of different ways, but as it is, I feel cheated out of my precious time. <br /> <br /> Do not mess with it, you will feel like you are taking the time you can not get back.
