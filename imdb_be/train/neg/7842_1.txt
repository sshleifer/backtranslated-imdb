Once it randomly on TV showing - and could hardly believe how completely awful the whole experience was. For comparison, the original "A man called Horse" was spell-binding, since he had an interest in all things. But this is nonsense - words fail me. It was bad enough to have some kind of "history", presented with all the influence of moist loaf of bread, but this error is compounded by the apparent lack of subtitles in all, if the so-called "Sioux" said. For God's sake, we could not find enough filmmakers of the North American Indians, who were also actors and actor almost act as "Indians" in the hash instead of the impostors they are actually used? I also found it quite uncomfortable to watch Richard Harris hopping around the countryside in an explicit order of the director, who was standing behind the camera, let him run and jump with useless point A to point B is pointless simply to fill up the frames of the film and minutes. Absolutely awful in every way!
