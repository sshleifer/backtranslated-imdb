I never would have started this film, and stopped watching after a 3/4-x. I missed a really unfortunate ending. This film was a disappointment, because it could have been much better. It had a good atmosphere, highly professional actor and director, good seats. But baaaaaad plot, bad script. I drew attention to the southern accent Kenneth Branagh - it was better than the script. The plot was silly - moving characters acting in an unrealistic and improbable ways. Nobody behaves as it is Hollywood scripts.
