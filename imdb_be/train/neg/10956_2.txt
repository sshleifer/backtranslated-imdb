I bought this film from GameStop discount used film hopper and cover made me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99cents. The film itself is slowing down, and they use ten different monkeys throughout the film, which is hardly look the same. Not to mention they use doubler, which is just a short guy in a suit making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director is more than likely committed the murder-suicide with chimpanzees after the film debuted in the preview for some other low-rent Warner Bros. film and he ended the result of money in the studio. It also does not help that he was not even shameful for the terrible work which he had done, he was not even known for the production of feed-chute film. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie ever made?
