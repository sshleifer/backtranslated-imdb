Choke may have strong elements of truth porn industry - but it does not for the fact that it is pretty pathetic directed and acted. - and with a very mediocre script <br /> <br /> B-class from start to finish are extremely stretched. <br /> <br /> It would be a shame to think of the public offered by this piece as an example of the state of art of gay cinema. <br /> <br /> I hope it has a limited life in the gay film festivals and allowed to die a natural death in the video. <br /> <br /> This film will open Queer Weekend movie in Brisbane on April 10, 2002. I think his success there will depend heavily on the amount of consumed alcohol in the previous cocktails - they're going to need it.
