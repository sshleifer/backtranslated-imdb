When I saw this film, I could not believe my eyes. Where these funny creatures basket Muppets debris with big pointy teeth, is actually meant to be scary? Or where they are designed to have a good laugh (I sincerely hope). If you look closely, you can even see their operating line (better, moving them around the screen). It was pretty funny than scary, and I had a good time watching the film, because I was struck by his total inability to have only one good part. This is one big joke from start to finish, and I think that this film belongs to a new category: Yes, incredibly dirty, you'll be laughing from beginning to end. (I will not even try to comment on the actions and all the other things)
