Well, to answer the question of one person about the "why did not anybody remember this movie?" This is because in fact, not many people have seen this in 1978, and it was not shown on television with a lot. (If it's on video, that would be news to me!) Even in an era of sometimes mindless comedies, which was the 70th, moviegoers were mind to avoid this movie. If they do not like Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde and Joan Rivers 'what' a lot! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was funnier to "Witch" or «Hollywood Squares», than here. Joan Rivers at this time in her career got a laugh making cruel jokes about the absence of singer Karen Carpenter weight! Har har Joan! In addition, it seems that every "somewhat" well-known name from that era is in a cast. (The most amazing Doris Roberts later "Everybody Loves Raymond"). <br /> <br /> Anyway, some good idea for the story line, people rather than pregnant woman goes to waste here. With help from a male friend Crystal gets set with a prostitute, to finally lose his virginity, but because she was "on top" in his place, he become pregnant! (Comment on women taking positions of power by men). <br /> <br /> Crystal stomach grows, it passes through all the women's emotions and feelings associated with them. Unfortunately, it is now socially outcast wrong! He attacked the crowd, who wants it wiped (I think). <br /> <br /> he is forced to retire to his child ... in the barn. Or if you prefer, a feeding trough (God knows where he is, perhaps, came from! Ewwww!) It does not work (no shock there) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> Everything else in the movie is worth nothing, and forgets, humor level of high school or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars, good idea, and a few nice touches and the corresponding moments w / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest Rabitt test, it fails big time! <br /> <br /> I can not believe, Roddy McDowall, signed either! (END)
