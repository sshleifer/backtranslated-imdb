First of all, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that the film was made for one of my favorite books, fold in time. This film, however, has destroyed this excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having the carbonated curls and glasses and is considered very cool. In the film, she has straight hair and no glasses and a "sporty" with a deep voice. It's not like Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on the character of Madeleine and depicted how she felt when she was young. This is just one example of how the general ledger and the film is different. So I would say if you want to watch it for entertainment, watch it, but if you are an ardent fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her wrinkles in the time series, I would suggest to skip this movie.
