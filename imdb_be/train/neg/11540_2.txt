It reminded me a lot of COO Michael Winner crappy "Dirty Weekend" with him terribly British low budget feel. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that I am a fan of both exploitation and serious film. I appreciate, say, "Demented" for this inability and "The Last House on the Left," because this is a clear shameless brutality. And any number of inventive and more brutal Italian spin-offs. <br /> <br /> It was just pointless, though. Kind of like the British director of the budget idea "let's remake" I Spit on Your Grave ", without making it too harrowing now, the horror is back in vogue with the hostel. <br /> <br /> All of this just does not hang together, or have a point. What with her daughter's rapists? Why people having to be an expert in security cameras? Crappy.
