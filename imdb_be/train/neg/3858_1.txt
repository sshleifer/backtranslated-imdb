What a terrible, terrible movie! One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Usually I love movies like this, all the "boy meets an eccentric woman he loves, but he happens to be already associated with someone who is not suitable for him ....". I'm expecting something predictable and I did not mind. Movies are always entertaining mix the right amount of romance to comedy, but not this! Every joke falls flat and "Romance" makes me sick. The title character is one of the most "please kill me," the characters that I've ever seen on my television, "an eccentric woman" is not a very eccentric, more nimble and annoying. "The other one" is the most intelligent, mature man in this movie, but there is also just as annoying. This movie flat-out sucks, there's no way around it, do not waste your time.
