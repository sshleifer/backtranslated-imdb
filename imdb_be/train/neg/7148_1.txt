Before watching this movie, I had very low expectations, and just went to see the cars. In the end I even wished occur for this reason. The plot is almost nonexistent. Character development does not exist. So many cliches and many stunning cheesiness existed in the film, which I could only watch and wonder how it was even released. If not for the exotic, I would not have appreciated the film 1. Attempt coherent storyline destroyed sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and ridiculous characters that make up its membership. In fact, the film's plot is so predictable and silly, that the average child is able to predict most of the storyline. Bad action, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it. Play Gran Turismo HD, as well, and this will satisfy your thirst for sex fast cars, entirely leaving a bad taste.
