I expected that the film, like Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. Nevertheless, the hopeless, it seemed, forever. This is one of those clicks polzuyuschehsya sad location PG-13, rather than being a child needed. Jokes are not only low-grade or F ** t a joke, they are rude, rude, and many acts not only cross the boundaries of bad taste, but apart from the legal and moral decency. Many scenes seem to have been chopped to get a PG-13 rating ... really bad ... it could make a big splash as an R-rated movie, when funny was abandoned. (Exaggerated? Perhaps.) I do not recommend this movie. This is a complete waste of time on ... and I'm a movie buff and is willing to give just about anything a shot. On 45 minutes, the film felt like it should be minimized ... and boy we were ready for it. The ending is bizarre, but does not save the rest of this quagmire / tourist rental trap. 1/2 stars (glad I saw it as a freebie ... would have been abhorrent to pay hard-earned dollars for this tripe)
