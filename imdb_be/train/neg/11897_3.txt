Followup William Lustig to «Maniac» proves that without spectacular effects in Savinte and convincing performance SPINELL, in «Maniac» would never have become a cult, what he did. «Vigilante» badly directed, with simple-script, explaining everything to you and predictable at every turn, as well as the mediocre performance of all participants. According to the sense of "deja vu", this film gave me Lustig watched "Death Wish" a few times too many, before you do this! (* 1/2)
