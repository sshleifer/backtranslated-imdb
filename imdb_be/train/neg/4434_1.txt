I rented this film, thinking it looked like a surprisingly beautiful and historic piece. What I got was a piece of pure garbage. This film was confusing to most places, choppy in almost every place and amazing at all points. portrayal of the Queen Mira Sorvino plays a young male scientist was depressing at best. Ben Kingsley was to be deprived of chivalry for even considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw must follow the play Petunia Dursley; at least in the movie Harry Potter more interesting than this thing they call the play within the film. <br /> <br /> The cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in film 101, and failed miserably. Almost every scene in the film cut into a certain effect; the end result, of course, being Cheesiest little editing I've ever seen. Jay kind was almost good as Agis; It is a pity that he was such a bad scenario for the job. Rachael Stirling gives her best as almost trusting lady in waiting. In the end, I really want to give Blockbuster Video treatment. I'm so glad I did not spend $ 10, watching this fiasco in the theater. If they fulfill the Marivaux play from the 18th century, it makes me wonder how many people over the centuries have had their best to take a nap during the work. If I had been there, they would not have to listen to the game for snoring. Thank God for modern amenities DVD players; you can skip past sad or terrible scenes. Guess that means I watched only the beginning and the end!
