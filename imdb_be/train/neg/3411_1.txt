Mix exotic tropical places infants in skimpy attire, explosions, nice Dudley Do-Right clones, movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), a little martial arts and sexy thief (Tracy Lor .... .ER, sorry .. . Traci Elizabeth Lords) and you think that you would be in for some escapist fun. It is not so! It's a chore a TV movie, and even if it likes to advertise itself as a transaction "Charlie's Angels", this is not as good as the original series or even gawdawful, irreversibly stupid, recently C.A. movies. And it is not good is best described as the third course Andy Sidaris film. Nowhere near as much fun as Andy "hard ticket to Hawaii," although some of the action scenes are decent enough. Girls spend too much time creating and trying to look too stiff and it gets annoying after a while. There are better things genre, it's there. Oh, and "small" is not as hot as they like to think they are. Terrible soundtrack ... if he is there.
