I loved Dever in the Noir series. His talent in trivial «Waltzers» aka "Going Places." Well, it's a couple of guys flaunting convention in the most ridiculous ways and irredeemable; Many people find this behavior amusing. It was boring, pointless exercises designed to shock. I believe a smirk on his face in Blier, the person behind the camera, annoying. Noir series is a full expression of personal freedom and licentious behavior. From the first moment, when we see, by Patric Dever gallop in a vacant lot, we get an idea of ​​the excellent anti-hero, we will spend time with for the next few hours. When we see him in the pursuit of the unfortunate average age of a woman with her boyfriend Depardieu in "Going Places" we have a fair warning that two hours spent with these guys is the soul-draining. I even "3" are a problem for this annoying distraction.
