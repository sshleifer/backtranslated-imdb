If you liked Â«Blair with" you like this. It has the same lousy camera-work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent and the plot points. Alarm <br /> <br /> He also has Tom Savini, so if you like Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" and Tarantino and Rodriguez's "From Dusk Till Dawn" you for treatment. He is an icon and a very good actor as well. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This film is certainly the most lousy movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen a lot of movies - bad as well. I can tell you that I find most horror movies entertainment in one sense, but it's just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this film 2 instead of 1, were naked chicks and hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding. I must have missed before I hit "send" in the form of a vote. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if he has a sexy girl with teeth on the cover!
