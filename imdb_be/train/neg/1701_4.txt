David Lynch raw and rough turning take on South Park presents us with a disturbing nightmare cliche of suburban middle-class families. Father hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth opening, from which uttered the most horrible guttural sounds, the son and the mother is constantly frightened, incoherent creature for whom terror is a way of life. A number of the same ridiculous characters are introduced throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not known for his comedies (ie air, untamed aspects), and I'm not particularly fond of comedy in general, however, there were a few scenes that make the country a blunt me laugh out loud. There are some clever bits of animated films. - where Lynch sends a wide range of reactions to their characters through the syntactical arrangement of frames as opposed to facial expressions (that never change in blunt Country) <br /> <br /> I believe that Lynch did try to give his audience straight forward if disturbing animated comedy here. It is interesting that he decided to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low brow humor (ie most Ferrell films), adding elements of social criticism and vicious classic cartoon violence and crude humor out. Despite the fact that the mixture does not work very well here, it's nothing if not Lynchian. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to see the supporters Lynch.
