Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, without the romantic scenes, the changes in the story line is too short, appeared a low budget. Barely enough dialogue to understand the history, if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes it looks like Lorna has a cold sore on her top lip. I'm sure that did make it better to hide it. I believe that they do not want to stop recording until it has healed, sorry. Most of all, why this movie did not have kissing scenes. Only one disappointment kissing scene at the end. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and should be told exactly. Version Lorna Doone 2000 twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable, and more precisely in the book.
