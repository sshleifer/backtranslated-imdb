Spoiler: The young lover, Jed, drove for a girl, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she mistakenly believes that Jed has to deal with one of its two vicious friends. Kate thought that she found their own act. Kate throws shoes Jedi out of the door. Jed reluctant to leave, and then sits in the middle of the road, to put their shoes. Then he gets runs ( "crushed", one of the meanings of the names) truck. And dies. <br /> <br /> "And then he gets a truck will move." Can you imagine a writer to actually guide a script element to this site? Prior to this, his comedy, which is going to be a frothy, but has no real sizzle. All but Jed just annoying. And then they kill Jed and all this boring, until the end, where girls learn to love each other and to support, rather than destructive. I give 2 x ugh.
