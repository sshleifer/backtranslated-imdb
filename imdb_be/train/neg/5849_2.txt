As an advocate of silent film, I looked forward to see this picture the first time. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the film seems to be one long, long commercial for Maxwell car. <br /> <br /> It is possible, if the chase scene was about half as long as it is, perhaps I would have liked the film more. But he had aged very quickly. And while I admit that the reality is stretched many times in films, without diminishing the pleasure of the audience that was with Mexican bandits? I mean, they are chasing the car through the mountains, a car that is moving most of the time about one mile per hour, but they can not catch up with him?
