In general, I love the dinosaur movies, but this one is pure crap. No script, no dialogue, no action. And the brave Colonel Rance tries to show that it is cruel and so arching his mouth resembles as the twin brother of blunt Proctor Police Academy. So it's a waste of time (fortunately, not to spend money, I saw a movie on TV). And I really can not understand, 7 people who graduated this shit 10. They must be joking. My advice, if you see the name, run away!
