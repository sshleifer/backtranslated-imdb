Actually, I like horror movies, but, unfortunately, it fell out of the bargain bin one pound in my friends hand. We sat down to watch, ready to be scared and eventually spraying food wherever we laughed so much. This concept is not so bad, but for some reason they decided to number ten in the series would be lucky that I do not know. Worst of all the actors of the film. The camera work was poor, in special effects actually not bad if I'm being generous, but on the whole the story failed to connect on any level, because the actors were as effective as a small piece of badly charred elm. They were made of wood beyond measure, especially dapper young actor, who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously, as any kind of government agent. He was more like a public school student actually. It was really funny sex scene where it looked like he was bobbing for apples, as a busty woman riding on top of him, and then his diaper pant size was hysterical, but then I remembered that I was not supposed to be a comedy. I desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie, other than random breast flash, but there is simply no. Let's hope that ten was a lucky number, and they do not make another one, I'm not sure that my ribs can take it.
