I'm not a dunce, as far as quality films go, and I agree that from a technical point of view filming, as well as several characters painted film in remuneration decent class. But there is no point (for me) this movie is really going anywhere; I mean, taking the viewer anywhere. This series of scenes the mood, perhaps, fair as such, but I want more from the film. I look at the history and the movement and the execution of arrival, none of which I found in this film. Yes, it could be considered poetry on film. ,, But there are many verses that I can not live with the same reason: he paints a picture, does not go away <br /> <br /> One thing, then it must be said that the documents in the middle of the century English childhood that. necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally impressed by the fact that a young British boy had to endure at the time and place. Growing up in America, only ten years ago, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is huge. I can not help wondering if this contrast had some influence on those who are considering this film is so profitable. In other words, there can be a tendency to judge a film entirely on his "cinematic magic" (which I admit is) and completely ignore his lack of relation to the nature of his actual experience revoked?
