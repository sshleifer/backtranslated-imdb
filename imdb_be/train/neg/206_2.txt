I gave this film only two stars because Dominic Monaghan is actually making an effort through his action. Everything else in the movie is very amateur. Everything is connected with the direction of the film was very poorly done. Moreover, when the director to rethink what she does for a living career, but perhaps it should watch a few movies. Dominic Monaghan is a very reliable actor, putting it in a film of this caliber makes him look awful. Whoever "actor" that played the best friend of Jack should never have stepped in front of the camera. I did not expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their environment. Do not waste your time and money on this film (like me), you'll be sorely disappointed.
