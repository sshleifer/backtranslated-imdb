I hated this movie. Original phantom had a beautiful atmosphere and mystery. Like many horror movies 70s, it looked and felt like a horrible, unfinished documentary. Phantom II, as the end of the 80s, pumped up the action, but it's nice to keep the attention to the mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III just awful. It is tedious to explain all the strange events in the previous films, which reduces rather than increases their strength. He shamelessly degrades down to the first fantasy as cheap reconstruction of the original. There are so many balls flying in this film, they are more like a home wrecker than threatening balls death. Hundreds hang from the ceiling, as Christmas balls swinging in the project. Nha anyone-- prop master, DP, editor, director-- notice or do not care what they look so disgusted? Even worse, Phantasm III is a banal, by a serious joke after another. What is different from the intensity of the first film. The original Phantom used humor to ease his relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to establish countless cheap jokes about Reggie horniness: a few cm "flying balls" of the film, ha, ha, oh, I get it, the balls. Maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes, but they're on us.
