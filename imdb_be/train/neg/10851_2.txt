This film was made for fans of Dan (and Carriages Dirt). I'm not one of them. I think he was just a wannabe black metal top of the steps (so far, I'm generally not a fan of black metal). But as I drove the DVD case, to pay for it, I convinced myself that the less authentic is something the more it tries to be convincing. So I guess what I'm in for a roller coaster ride of rubber parched and make itself splash of sinister background. Now, this is what I really like. <br /> <br /> I got home and opened it. My patience lasted 15 minutes. HORRIBLE camera work and disgusting quality. And it was then (2002) that it looked like it was filmed by a Hi8 camcorder. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a nice evening with beer and Bmovies to create a good environment for this picture .... <br /> <br /> A few months later I went back to it (referred to in the neighborhood) and saw a half. Then not only these aspects irritated me. May antipathy evolved. I noticed how funny Dani (1,65m; 5'5 "height) looked into his shoes on the platform of the head robber breaking apart (well, ripping his head, apparently, did not have a skull.) I also found this. the film may have .. there is no point, however, I never finished, so I was not sure, <br /> <br /> In a few attempts, I finally managed to finish the film -. a couple of months ago ... (yes, it took me 5.5 years) so that - .. Dani was really funny how Satan HELPER / Manson / super-human evil and the film does not make sense See our bad chela EC uses Danny to do bad things, it delivers .. Why? Well, I think he's just a very, very bad. in fact both of them, and that's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> We have several short stories, united by Dani nature. May favorite was about a guy who steals someone's foot, because he wants to use it as their own. yes, that's right. <br /> <br /> Rock Bottom acting in . OIG is the worst. I mean Stinger beats him (and, boy, CGI baaaaad Stinger in). the story does not make sense, but the quality ... Let's just say it's not good enough. The only thing that can keep you playing this unmotivated violence and gore. Blood and guts made very well. Why, you can see that the film originated there, and then moved on. (Example - Dani Filth Â«Man" takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be -.?. And the gut is ... and then eat what fell Why we will never know, we know, however, that the cat should be illegal substance, his heart almost half its size.) <br /> <br /> you might think after my comment that the movie is so bad it's good, but it's just bad. Filth supporters stroller can add 3 points. I added one for the gore.
