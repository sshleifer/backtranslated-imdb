the only value in this film is mainly to laugh, how bad it really is. with a plot that makes your average high school writer look good, and the actions that are almost as good, he gets my lowest score. Tom Hanks is one of the very early films, where he obviously did not have the pleasure of being real picky. best special effects of the film consists of a guy dressed in an incredibly fake rubber monsters consumes.
