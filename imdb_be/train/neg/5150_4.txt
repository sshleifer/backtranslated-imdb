I got a DVD from the library, hoping to get a good idea of ​​how things work in the background on a large-scale production of the opera. I must say I was very disappointed. The subject had so much potential. Wagner sets in production must, of necessity, be a complex and impressive, and the story behind their creation and use can be a great educational experience. Instead, what we get is a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around large items of scenery, it is unclear to help along with the comments that have failed to hold my attention. I found myself listening to the first background music clips of the operas. I was struck by the sheer enormity of the effort required to put on such products - which also come across quite well and the next time I'm at the opera, I'm sure I'll remember that part, if it's a video - but feeling somewhat cheated left the absence of detailed comments and explanations.
