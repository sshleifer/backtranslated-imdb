In all the history of a low budget. this movie should be one of the worst. True Ther some humorous side to the film, but overall it was just awful. I just can not understand that a person can not run a bunch of snails. I mean, they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part of the costs in this film is a close-up snail trying to bite a human finger. It was pretty funny.
