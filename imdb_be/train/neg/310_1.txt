I've never heard of this movie, Adam Sandler, until I saw it on the wall at Blockbuster. Being an Adam Sandler fan at the time, I take it. I could honestly observed only about 30 minutes. from it. It was awful. Do whatever it takes to keep it from the hands of the public. I sincerely hope that this film is the PLO in the near future, and I hope it stays that way!
