The first thing I noticed in this film is certainly not worth the amount of nudity. It is not oozing nudity or anything, but a lot of that is not necessary. Annika plays Barrel disturbed woman believing her family's stories about ghosts that her ancestor who uncannily resembles it was a werewolf, and believed that their fate is destined to be the same. That in fact I found very interesting. The original The Wolf Man was supposed to be completely psychological, but a universal cast in this man Wolff, you never have to see in n extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone not actually be interesting werewolf. Unfortunately, this is not a movie that I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we do not know that it is a werewolf from the very beginning, so there is no thrill or turn, and they are trying to make the movie seem that this actually happened script. They are not there, add one or two parts of the film, referring to this is a reality. At first I was worried after reading the description of the film. But I slowly realized that this coverage only that they can put the main heroes of the breast as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Annik Barrel a decent actor who plays a major role psychotic or very bad actor, playing the role of the psychotic. Since the nature of Danniele not have a brain and a madman who runs wisely and snarling and snapping like a wolf, it takes a bit of skill to play. She had moments of her performance breaks terrible at the moment, but quickly destroyed by the poor performance of the camera and light. The idea is great, but ugly runs throughout the film. 3/10
