Ah, dear sir .... They turned what was quite thoughtful Film Fest smug testosterone. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of the film was pretty vague about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Francisco, to win a bet. Why he was willing to risk his life for the price of a handful headwaters? We're not quite sure. <br /> <br /> We had a few memories that give us a picture of what it was adrenaline junkie, and probably he led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point. This time you can see in the distance where the left and right shoulders of roads converge, and the road goes away. He lives just to be free, and so is not bad to anyone. We have seen several times when there were accidents, he stopped to make sure that the other driver was OK, before we move on, even the police, who pursued him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his quest, he took his life rather than be arrested and to live in captivity. He died as he lived, running wide open. <br /> <br /> In the remake Kowalski has a story (including name, even.) He tries to get to the hospital, where his wife is suffering from complications of her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband and excited expectant father. He concludes to take his life after hearing his wife died in the package, but even leave it in question, if they believe that he may have jumped out of the car before it crashed into a bulldozer. They even gave part of the "Super Soul" blind DJ (brilliantly portrayed Cleavon Little in the original) in Jason Priestley?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break.
