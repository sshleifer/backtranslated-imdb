This film does have some great noirish / neorealist visual effects, and tells a story that is refreshingly free of the sugar coating of Hollywood, which was made possible only because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes go on far too long (wedding, especially), and I found that exaggerated actions and unrealistic dialogue, to be more suited to the stage than for the silver screen. <br /> <br /> dialogue especially distracting, and it seemed to get worse as the film went on. Most of the characters were either Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialogue sounded like they were practicing lines for Shakespeare while they mix the cement and laid a brick. Towards the end I was laughing, not because the filmmakers wanted me to. I believe that pompous poetry can be defended by saying that the characters have to speak Italian, and dialogue is the literal translation, they actually speak. . But it absolutely does not work for me <br /> <br /> Another line of dialogue made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, was born and raised in New York City in the 1920s, suddenly raises different rhythmic British accent. I just guess it had something to do with the fact that the film was made in England. <br /> <br /> I give this film «A» for the efforts and intentions, but a much lower estimate to perform.
