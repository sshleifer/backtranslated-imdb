Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master car thief who is forced to return to the "game" when his younger brother is facing death for the sun filling the order for the British crime boss Raymond Calitri. Work includes a "step-up" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will enact his sentence. So Raines quickly assembles a team he can trust, and sets about the task in hand. But the police on him, and some of the cars in the list does not just accept. It would seem almost impossible job to finish. <br /> <br /> He's got quite a cast of Gone in 60 Seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Eccleston, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. All of them deserve better. Enough action horsepower there to promote the Porsche 998 Turbo. The trouble is that it's very much the case too much glut of parking cars, Mucho characters lacks zest. From the off, we have no doubt that this production Bruckheimer / Simpson, bonkers script laced with loud noises and lashings of cheese, just enough editing and directed with a sledgehammer subtle Dominic Sena. This is essentially a big-budget remake H.B. 1974 indie film Halicki by the same name, with the premise offered up the potential for adrenaline fueled movie based car. Potential which, unfortunately, never realized. There's one or two high-impact moments, Daft sure, but pleasant nonetheless. But if you pardon the pun, the film never gets out of first gear, it is more content with his foot characters despond about trying to make the boorish script Scott Rosenberg {} work. <br /> <br /> The car supporters will get something from him {cars} ace on the eye, as well as fans of unintentional comedy films carpenter {check} Ecclestone mount point. But no, it's really quite poor all said. 4/10
