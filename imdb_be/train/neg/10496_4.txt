Gday Mates! Croc Hunter just watched a movie. it was alright, but the show seems more real. it just seemed more AnimalPlanet episode with the funniest lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described the snake fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for reals you know that hurts. and tips they bounce high? GES all grabbin them by the tail, and so on. The two main cleavage was shot in this film. when Terry find that the child she is Joey as "We need to educate them, just like a child." Wow! I thought she was going up and breastfeed the child. that we would have made it a PG-13, although . while Terry, does anyone notice on the movie and a lot of knowledge to show Terry on the ritual mating. she knows that her sexual power. the film takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingoes, and the cub! < br /> <br /> dog Steve Sui actually has a purpose in this film. though small, which is useless against dynamite has Hottie. <br /> <br /> Yes, and if someone is watching this, try and you will agree with me in saying that the villagers fat woman with a herd of dogs was Shotgunning crocodile right. He ate her sheep !! I would be crazy too!
