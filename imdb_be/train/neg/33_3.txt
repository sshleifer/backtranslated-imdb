This is the worst thing that TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when it came out, and I still thought it was two, although I liked the original cartoon. <br /> <br /> There's this one scene, I remember when the monkey mafia guy explains his minions are rhetorical questions there. It's terrible. Many fans hate on the series to include the female turtles, but it does not bother me. So much so that I do not even remember it until I read about the show recently. In general, it is miserably forgotten. <br /> <br /> The only thing, the song was good. Guilty pleasure, they call it ... Nananana Ninja ...
