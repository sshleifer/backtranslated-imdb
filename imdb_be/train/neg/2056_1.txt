Anyone who loved two classic novels Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film. All the magic and romance have been upgraded from its original story about a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old woman, and gave "three" in the response. Three what? NOT three wishes, but three visits in the 1800s on a gentle lift ... <br /> <br /> The first time a novel on top. Secondly, all at one time.
