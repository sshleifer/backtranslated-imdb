<br /> <br /> The film "Slugs" is unique in that the titular evil is actually good guys in this macabre tale of nature gone awry. You see these poor snails were mutated by pollution and evil people do not mean to do anything evil, they just slugs- snails with sharp teeth who eat meat and releasing the poison, but no less than slugs. The real bad guys are people who are either actively trying to destroy our favorite slug, or overreact when they encounter them. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the guy puts on a glove full of snails. They were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove, when out of nowhere this giant hand came upon them, and they respond instinctively to protect himself and bite guy. Now, instead of having to seek medical help for his cork bite, this guy runs his greenhouse screaming like an idiot, spill some very volatile chemicals, starts a fire, knocks the bookcase over on itself and cuts off its frame and then heat and volatile chemicals substances mix and its home explodes. How can you blame that on snails? <br /> <br /> This film paints a portrait of a man, which is less than favorable. The characters in this film include mute sheriff who hates all drunk hick who basely with your dog, and lump sidekick, whose wife, at least forty-five years his senior. There's also a lot of drunken teenagers <br /> <br /> that attacked during copulation, and we need to see the genitals skinny long-haired freaks. At the same time, there is a guy that looks like a demonic Leslie Nielsen, who shouts, "You do not have the authority to declare a birthday!" For some reason. Finally, the parade of abomination rounded guy from the classic MST3K «Pod People», whose faces explode after eating salad cork Shoelaces (still easy to escape the fate blamed on useful, harmless snails). <br /> <br /> People are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, drunk, and in one place mindless as potential rapists. In the climactic scene of the film, criminal people try to burn slug that cowering helplessly in the sewers, well, because they are idiots, people successfully undermined the entire city. they only do more harm than ever did the snail! <br /> <br /> If you hate a person, and I know what to do, you'll appreciate the "snail". If you're a fan of bad movies, you'll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of "Pieces" and "By the People". There's enough bad game, silly dialogue, illogical plot twists, lame special effects, meaningless scenes and bad dubbing to keep your attention.
