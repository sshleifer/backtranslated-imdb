The film began with some semblance of a plot, and then renounced his infinite series of random characters and the meetings that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to continue to engage with this film. This film is a very cynical bunch of garbage, do some people with animation skills, but it lacks the creativity and ability of speaking. It's surprisingly bad effort comes from a major studio. It is obvious that there are morale and motivation problems at Disney, not to mention the complete lack of control and quality assurance. This control has allowed the film to see the light of day talks about his incompetence and despair. This film combines a very short "the worst movie of all time" list.
