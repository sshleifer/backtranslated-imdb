Well, I like a bad horror. I especially love the horror bad enough to make fun of. Demonicus or House of the Dead - it was bad enough to make fun of. Severed Sun <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoilers - who cares?) .. <br /> <br /> My friend and I sat through the whole movie, and I have a number of remarks, as in "this sucks" style and in real critical <br /> <br /> The story (sort of). - There's a guy in this city (which, perhaps, Seattle, see comment below), which runs and beheading. He's been doing it for years (I will not go back to get the exact numbers - thank you very much), perhaps two or three years. One head for a week. And the police just now calling the "experts" (who once called himself a psychic, but it never comes again). <br /> <br /> it correctly! The feds take over after that, three related murders? After nearly a hundred similar murder, we have uncontrolled under martial law !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this "expert" advice beats chick who the police ignored all the time, and two of them came to the conclusion that this is Baron Samedi, the spirit of a fishing rod, cut off the head to get enough energy to make himself a body (and then presumably take over the world - or maybe just go to Disneyland). <br />. <br /> <br /> Um <br /> Setting - where this is going? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you might not realize that the bar / rave (takes about ten movies of employees and their families) have a poster for a local radio station, and that, moreover, very entertaining, "Pulp Fiction" esqe dialogue (as iF) between the two cops (yes, those who get their heads cut off for about 15 minutes in the film), they discuss "new stadium", which is probably still been a problem if the film was made <br /> <br /> being from Seattle, I apologize on behalf of the film and hang his head in shame <br /> <br /> Well, that's where he got grinding very critical - .. to be a horror movie writer (not published, do not look for my name on IMDb), I study. A lot of research. And unlike the authors of the film, I know that Baron Samedi - while Voudon Loa (spirit), which guards graveyards and traditionally associated (at different Christian oppressors) with "Satan" - is actually a "Loki "-like a trickster god. <br /> <br /> In other words, he did not cut off his head. <br /> <br /> In addition, most of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi may have the body whenever he wants. Their religious rituals center around the ownership of various members of the congregation Loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention, when he already had one, why a new body? <br /> <br /> In addition ,, when Baron Samedi body the GOT, it will not go cutting off his head, he would like to get a good rum and cigars and Par-tie !!! <br /> <br /> In general, the only thing they did get the (odd) right in the fact that in a totally unnecessary card tarot reading (only used to show that the chicken bait "ghost") are not spinning explanations cards as most films do. Again, I did the research. (Does anyone remember the old ads for night phone-in tarot reading - "Lovers - you'll soon fall madly in love ..." and all that nonsense) <br /> <br /> If you have done this far through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me, so please do not.
