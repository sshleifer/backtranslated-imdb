Firstly - there is absolutely no courtship going on in this film - with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Your first test of stamina to wade through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. It would not be so bad - hell, I like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but no context to put it, it repels. Thus, you make it through torture and lawlessness. Then we meet with the bottom and the film turns into something all together different - not better - just different: a picture of a road without a heart. There unsuccessful attempts to comedy thanks to Kame - well written and well played on beans, Judy Tenuta, and mink stole (and a few whores and transvestites, too). They all deserve better. Photos intentionally disorienting, so if you get motion sickness (or in fact any kind of disease) - This film is not for you. Come to think of it, I do not know who is this movie for -except maybe gay and bisexual S & M supporters who love bad scripts, bad shot indie film about himself.
