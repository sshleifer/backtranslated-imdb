Franco Zeffirelli was thinking? Hollywood was responsible for this travesty, or I can take comfort in the thought that someone who does not speak in English as a first language is just completely missed the point of Charlotte Bronte's classic? I do not think that I can improve on a comment I read below, so I'll just paraphrase: "Jane Eyre is a great big book, the writer should read it sometime." It is true that the two wires of the film were, in Unfortunately, miscast. But pity the actors, because the writer had left out all the best scenes. Dialogue that makes you understand Jane and Rochester is a meeting of minds and a general feeling of satisfaction ... deleted from the script. Marriage proposal, a fortune teller ... gone. Allusions, half-jokingly, half sincerely felt Jane's like a fairy sprite Old England came to save Rochester in his despair ... eliminated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the ending of the novel, and the interaction with Jane Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he surgically removed love with one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 (?) Mini-Series with Timothy Dalton.
