I picked up the film with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was getting myself into. <br /> <br /> I started the film, and soon I was drawn into the world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, I know what hell is like. That this film. For eternity. This film does not really matter. He did not even really have a story. It was stuff going on in each scene, but not a general explanation of why something is happening. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this film, I think that you align the near blender with oil and try things out, how many bullets in it as you can. You will see that the result will be much more enjoyable than this film. <br /> <br /> Do not even look at. He does not even see how bad it is. I beg you. If you look, it means that they win.
