Why see this film if you have a great movie to see. It's a waste of time and money. The film is so bad that I feel bad for those who want to watch. Everything in it is BAD. The actors were bad. The script was really bad. History stupid. Worst CGI EVER. Only good points were the first 60 seconds of the film in a strip club. One interesting thing that has characther, we want him to die, because he is so stupid that we get it enough. (I do not remember the name, but it was another to "My Favorites".) <, Br /> <br /> Note: If you want to see a good film, this film is not the right choice. 0-Stars 10
