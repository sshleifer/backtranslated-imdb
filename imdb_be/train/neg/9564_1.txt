Some people think that this is the worst movie they've ever seen, and I understand where they come from, but I've actually seen worse. <br /> <br /> That being said, the movies that I can think of (that is, those that I have not blocked), which was worse than it had been so bad that they are physically hurt every sense, which was associated with watching movies. Films that are less than 2 War Games are the ones that make you want to gouge your eyes or stab sharp objects in their ears to keep yourself on another part of your soul broke away from you in horror. <, Br /> <br /> War Games: The Dead Code is not so bad, but it comes pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but no I did not expect miracles from it. Let's face it, the original was not really big from the film in the first place, it was basically just a campy 80s teenage romance movie with some geek-appeal to him. <br /> <br /> That's all I had hoped, so something bad, but it might freak pulled a string. It was too much to ask? Is it really not possible to do better than the original war game, even for straight to video release? Well, perhaps it was too much to ask. Stay away from this film. At first it's just a bad as "Oh, yes, it's bad, but I kind of enjoy it, perhaps, the end will be good as the original." And then it gets worse and worse, and in the end, believe me, you wish you had not seen this film.
