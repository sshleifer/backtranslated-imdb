My teacher taped it and showed us in the care of children, to show how teen pregnancy affects people. He just showed how teen pregnancy affects the baby athlete entirely properly educated on how sex work and a crybaby, unloved girl who throws the fruit when they are angry and could not tell that she was with the wrong person, even if he wore a sign on what he was like that. I would not be surprised if the child's father was about eight bridesmaids in the first edition of the script. Stacy (child support) mother of rebellion. She pays no attention to the fact that her daughter is past the age of four and seemingly immutable when people spying on her through her dining room window. Bobby (father) the name of his best friend, Dewey, and is an obvious rip off the character of Sean Penn in Fast Times, at Ridgemont High. This movie is terrible, simply because none of the characters are not believable. Thank God, this is only done for television, limiting the opportunities for the public to view it.
