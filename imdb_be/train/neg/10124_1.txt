there is no suspense in this series! If one episode ends with the actor so bad, the effects are so poor, and the script is so terrible that the last thing on his mind, like Batman and Robin save the day. No, in fact, the last thing that the next episode is watching on his mind! This show is so sad that I can not see how it's ever been done, let alone released on DVD! Obviously, the effects are not up to par with modern Batman movie, but even the terrible scenario. Incoherent babble pester some evil professor and radiation gun or something like that, I'm not sure, because it is too horrible to follow. See version of 60s, or 90s versions, or even Batman Begins, only something in this version!
