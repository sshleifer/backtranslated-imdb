I am sad that period of history, which is so exciting and so rich in material for the film can be done in the case of ho-hum. Vt.e C Quantrill hardly seen in the film, probably the most intriguing figure period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, the same thing, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who will mourn for his murdered sister every time he went into battle completely missing in the script. Instead, we were forced to watch fictional characters that never resulted in a people we care about. how boring. The costumes were great, however, as it was the site of the shooting in Missouri. I hope that Ang Lee will make another film from the period and try again, or any other producer of the film will look into the enormous wealth of material to write the screen play.
