I will give credit where credit is due and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard drinker actress who does what she wants. She is brash, arrogant, uncompromising, and very sexy; it is much better than the movie deserves. <br /> <br /> But this is IT. This dim suspended film is a fragmentary disorder immediately trying to be stalker action, killing thriller story of loyalty and betrayal, and evaporate erotic thriller. The film, my friends, do not worry in the least degree. <br /> <br /> For example, someone thought of casting C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leading man? He's not a freak, but crying out loud, it looks like tough cookie goddess Fiorentina gets it from a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the existence of a body or the screen to fill the leading role of man. <br /> <br /> The script, by far the worst aspect of the film. There is no tension, as a character Fiorentina receives a terrible phone calls, there is no mystery as to its guilt in the killings, which are in the center of the film, there is no sense of liberation as Fiorentino gets Wimpy Howell lose their inhibitions. <br /> <br /> Look for interesting, but poorly done cameos by Adam Ant and Hayes, and a really, really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. Also, my first impulse is to put this tiny piece of debris down and go to rent something else.
