As a big fan of the movie Gorillas in general, I expect that this one would be great - and as for the effects of gorillas, they were pretty good, however - it's the only thing I can write about this flop. The film purports to be based on a true story, but in reality, it's not even close to what actually happened to the "Buddy" - who in real life was known Gargantua sold to Ringling Bros. on our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known for numerous animal enthusiasts, as women who are unlikely to have the welfare of the animals in the best interests of the HER. As for the friends are drawn, it becomes aggressive, it was a complete fiction and never gorilla, in real life, have resorted to such behavior. buddy did, in fact, avoid the wooden box (not plush cell number, as shown in the film) during a storm, seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz in selling it. No, Buddy was not released to families gorilla surrounded by lush trees in the zoological paradise - it was left in a wooden box, deep in the back of the garage for a while with only one lamp for comfort, and then sold to the circus - where he actually I lived a better life, that have peanuts thrown at him, until he died (historically oldest gorilla living on a record, by the way) before the show in Miami. Note also in the film, like Buddy is getting older, but the chimpanzee never gets old. (Chimpanzees, by the way, were not raised at the same time with other animals, including Buddy, as portrayed in the film)
