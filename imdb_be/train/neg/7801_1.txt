I'll keep it as short as possible as this piece of shit just worth mentioning. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever made - right up there with the other zombies terrible record Schnaas' - Zombie DOOM (aka SH T 3 February!). These movies suck so bad that everyone involved in creating them should be shot. Somehow I turned out (barely ...) to sit through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 so terribly incompetent - even when compared to other Schnaas terrible movie '- I had to fast forward through all after the first 10 minutes. ZERO acting ability, inept gusset, terrible video camera style camera work, funny dub ... it just goes on and on. I really can not find one redeeming thing about this mess - and I usually can find something soothing in almost any movie. This is truly one of the worst movies ever made - you have been warned ... 1/10
