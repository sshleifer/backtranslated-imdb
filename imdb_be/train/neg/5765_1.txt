Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to begin with. The last film was an ordinary effort. Put it next to a load, it is a comedy classic. While the other half was filled with lots of dated humor and cheap shots, at least, it was funny. There's nothing funny about the forced humor. Jokes, gags and omissions should be, of course, ridiculous. Strikes the viewer over the head with a tired joke that's not cool. Humor in this film has been serving juvenile moron who will laugh at anything. If they served high school crowd, any sense of self-esteem has thrown in the window. Ring parody funny. I watched them in the comedies they are so out of date since 1998. Michael Jackson jokes are not cool anything. To make matters worse, ridicule two were broken "performers", whose best days were never. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema was slow. Films like these are the nails that was placed into the coffin. Whatever happens with the real sense of humor? I have not laughed in a movie theater for a long time. Too many bad movies rot the brain. You want proof? Go to your local video rental chain mega store and see what's on the shelves. This film is bad. Do not believe the hype. I prefer to watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous cycle than ever again suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy! <br /> <br /> Of course, it is not recommended (unless you have a few brain cells).
