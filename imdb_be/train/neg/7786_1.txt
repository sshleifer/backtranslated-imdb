I'd never seen this movie. It can be considered a shooting style pretentious to some, but it is considered a migraine induces me. I think it might have been an interesting story, but since I could not look at the long stretches at a time, I missed a lot. Shimmering photography and stop motion filming has branded my brain. I stopped playing in the middle of the way to the end and do not come back for a second try. I believe that if I was at home alone in my own beacon of some dark and stormy night, it may be just the ticket ... PS Not sure if the beacon / film style thing can be seen as a spoiler, but I do not want to be black list on my first examination;)
