The film is quite funny, and with the participation of about four dates, then it becomes a blatant commercials for some guy you (and even its "friends") really can not stand. It's a pretty interesting concept; the date of the film on a quest to find true love in modern-day Los Angeles. The problem is that it feels incredibly (and bad) scenario sometimes openly self-promotion. It is difficult to take care of and be involved in any of the characters, because the author / actor is so selfish, dissolved, not true, and just nasty. You end up regretting his choice.
