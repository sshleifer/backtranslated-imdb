It is difficult to understand what is going through the head of Per Christensen and Morten Lindberg, when they wrote "gay nigga from outer space." - The film is billed as a comedy, but there's no real joke next to the names of the raw character (Captain Dick B., of Sgt. Shaved Balls). The rest of the film is (presumably) unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronised voice-over (with the "actors" in the mostly read their lines without a hint of feeling), "futuristic" computer screens filled with spelling errors, and a plot that does not almost no sense. <br /> <br /> Even if 65% of the audience gave the film a perfect 10 out of 10, it is the exact opposite of what a good movie. It can be fun to watch with your friends, but this film deserves only near the "2" out of ten ... a little higher than the lowest possible rating only because of the fact that the authors have somehow managed to get some black guys to star in it film.
