Another one of my go deep in the bargain bin, this film gave me exactly what I expected. - load of bad horror complete with screaming women <br /> <br /> It all started so well - I liked it a little intro from the "newsreel" about the young being exposed to a nuclear explosion and was completely absorbed until the first person is not caught fire ... < br /> <br /> from this point on the film descended into outright stupidity, and at times became almost embarrassing to watch. When the character was affected with the same condition as that of the main character (the ability to light their own farts without the help of the game), he seemed almost as if someone threw this idea at the last minute ( "what will ! Image "you can almost hear them say ...) As for the almost psychic connection between the protagonist and nuclear power plants, and ... <br /> <br /> in the film come across as cheap tat - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 for that you did.
