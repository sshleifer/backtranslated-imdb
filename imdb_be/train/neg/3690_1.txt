Baba - Razhnikant never forget that name in his life. This is a film that caused his fall. He was released with a lot of hype, but crashed badly and put in serious financial losses for its manufacturers and distributors. Razhnikant had to personally compensate them for the losses. Shortly after his release, he tried going into politics, but failed miserably. Its very bad film with terrible acting, poor-quality cosmetics and miserable scenario. Throughout the film, Razhnikant looks like a person suffering from any disease. I am one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, the first day of the first show in the theater. The audience was so boring that most of them came out of the theater before intermission. Unfortunately, I will not recommend this to anyone.
