It starts badly, that the three women act as simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling of these gin, endless cigarettes and caramel chocolate treatment for the person who says the best "man" story, and then it gets worse - = - spoiler advert = - = what with Andie character in the fall at the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she is the boss of the English school, believe it or not), only to have it destroyed because of its bitch c-hell "girlfriend". ..and then from there, it is basically unwatchable drivel she forgive her "friend" and has a love child organ player and 3 women in the end, they started drinking more gin and smoke more cigarettes blah-blah-blah. Andie character throws caramel candy on the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
