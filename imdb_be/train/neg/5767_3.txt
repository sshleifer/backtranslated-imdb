As said before, the visuals are stunning. They are breathtaking. I personally use Blender and graphics like that is not easy. But that's all this film. Not only is the plot confusing, but the conflict is not clear in general. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emma trying to get away from someone who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when they enter the room of the abyss, Proog explains that "one step up and (you're dead)." There is a more detailed conflict between a careless man and nature. In the course of the film, it becomes clear that there is a conflict between man and nature . suddenly, there is a conflict between man and man, when Proog, out of nowhere, killing Emo. Proog immediately changed from being a caring guardian, looking after the lost child to the "sick man." He betrays us. moreover, it is disappointing, but we do not care, because the conflict pom the thoughts and actions of the character is not developed. It is not a story about someone, through struggle, it becomes stronger. It's depressing and do not show, because there is no more truth about the human soul, or of the world, discovered how big drama does. In my opinion, the film is highly developed in all aspects. However, the schedule staggering, but the film is so much more than just eye candy. There is no truth, there is no struggle and unpleasant surprise ending. In conclusion, the lack of development of the film without a point. ... but a good schedule.
