it may be one of the worst films I have ever seen. I do not understand how it could ever be described as a horror film, or even a thriller? it more logging drama. terrible music is wonderful, but since there were no dire situation the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or take the stairs. the film had so much potential. They had a nice cinematography (SP?) and interesting characters, but it seemed as though the authors assumed that you already know them. they will pass the peculiar events without explanation or even hint at what they had in mind. it's just one of those films that tells about his friend, and it's something completely different.
