I'm from Hungary, I have heard many people say, it is better and better things about Ãœvegtigris so far, but really I do not understand the reasons for all this fuss. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie a lot of points, some of the quotes really welcomed me, but stereotypical characters are present again, as in every Hungarian film, and the story is also pretty boring. I liked the first half, but then I started to get bored, and then I found the whole film is just boring. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Peter is good, as always, Reviczky is brilliant as well, but others are just there ... do nothing. <br /> <br /> How many more years must pass for good Hungarian film ???
