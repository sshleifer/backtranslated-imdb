By the end of the latter-day thriller thin image Ally Sheedy used creatively to make more than one compulsively evil image. It argues that if the role of Bette Davis nasty type have come her way, she could wear it with glitter. Unfortunately, I can not find a lot of other reasons to see it. If you're wondering what Sheedy looks in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why would anyone?) Then here's the answer. Otherwise, the sex starved mad woman Sally Kirkland is a very tedious, and even if you like this sort of thing more than I do you have to admit that the voltage sags badly during these scenes. drunken brute Savage insurance agent equally unpleasant, but at least a small role. With Nicholas Walker is not the leading actors of any sympathy at all on the plight of Paul Keller and his acting is wooden. Gift Tomanovich better during her scenes with Sheedy level rises a bit. meticulous, low Sheedy performance (although it often seems to be on autopilot) is beautiful in itself, but out of context with the rest. Sets of uniformity, the camera-work is invisible.
