It is incomprehensible awful low budget piece of horrible. <br /> <br /> I do not even words to say how pathetic, pompous, boring, confusing, and it's just amazing effort (Hey, what d Â»I know what to do ....) Set in post- apocalyptic America there are some guys on the beach and the slaughter and chaos will come - it was all so incomprehensible, I could not make head or tail of any of it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, as it was picked up by National Lampoon he beats me completely: it's really terrible <br /> <br /> And is not it so bad it's good cult way <br /> <br /> .. it's just awful, awful, awful, awful. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still do not believe me, watch it with every intention of loving then come back here and tell me what you think. Even gerbil on acid, can not hope to understand it. <br /> <br /> avoid or even better to destroy ...
