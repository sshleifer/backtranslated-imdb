This film is so bad, and getting worse in every conceivable fashion. It is not only the poor and the action script and is not crippled and corrupted by the time one wastes to view. What really sets this film in my hall of shame is an obvious struggle that writers and producers do with the film, to try to make it funny. replacing actress descendant of Jean Reno is an old and learned a lesson in the first film, so they add a new girl who should be married. Almost all of the original extras and pinned back, but this time it makes me want to mellow my eyes my sockets, because it is a waste of very good film. Torture chambers and permanent cuts in filming any scene in this film could put the viewer in a bitter scroll. This is the second film takes successful original and pulls him out of the coffin and the corpse of the tips in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its heritage, but our minds as well. This film, in contrast to the spruce goose could not fly he had no plot in the principal that is returned to the "necklace". No script, as it was apparently written and added daily. A lot of attention to the camera or frame in mind. Poor lighting and special effects have made for this. This film is not even famous student film mainly film 101. As this bunch got through, no one can say. It was a big investment losses, and it seems that no one had the strength to put this unnatural tough mistake of our misfortunes. This movie has a good part of it ... END! This film is not my # 1 worst movie of all time, at last, "Howard the Duck" is no longer a goose.
