I give this film a horror movie genre.I did it, because I do not know the genre called horrible. Since the genre of horror come closest to terrible I decided to put it in this category. The action was amateurish. Do you know who the villains would in the first place. The heroine is ugly, like a movie. Students of film production must take this film as an example for the lesson, what not to do in the movie. It's that bad. The man said bad words. Villains steal the ocean liner and want $ 10 million. They want the money to be delivered to the freedom of living rose island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. They will be sitting duck after they had received the money. Is not there an escape plan. How dumb. Female cruise director is a former police officer, print fleet, kung fu, I'm afraid. The fun part is how to neutralize bomb. He says that he knows what he's doing, and he continues to pull all the wires one by one. Then he puts it in his pocket and a movie with all connections on site. Is he crazy? Like mad us who watched this ridiculous. If you have a M-I-L, which you do not like. To annoy her to do this movie and pretend that you enjoy it. I assure you, it will accurately tell your husband that you have such a bad taste, and that her son / daughter to marry a man beneath her family's standard.
