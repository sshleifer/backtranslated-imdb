I just saw this movie twice, and I must say that I enjoyed it both times. This fast-paced and fun, but ultimately deranged. Having said that, it deserves to be denounced because of the tightening, which could be a good follow up to the original seed. It is clear to those who have seen terrible "Zombie Creeping Flesh», the films can be borrowed massive shortcomings Bruno Mattei ~ d, and that little flattering about it may be required to Fulci. This is not idle flattery FULCI Directors styles are in stark contrast around, and you can tell who it is aimed at, in particular, in the case. <br /> <br /> Mattei The film is centered around the virus outbreak (strangely referred to as "top secret" scientists, it is a mystery, it seems to be more characteristic than the potentially apocalyptic influence on mankind) somewhere in Southeast Asia. The virus causes a zombie-like behavior in those who have suffered, and the virus is spreading rapidly across the seemingly arbitrary acreage. Our main characters wander unwittingly into the danger zone, and must fight for his life against hordes of infected Asians. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have stopped halfway between being a zombie gore flick, and, with the Adventure, and this confusion is most clearly captured the zombies themselves. They seem to not have a lot of characteristics that are common to all. Some of them are regular soulless different shuffling, so well reflected in the original, and possibly creating FULCI here. Another main group consists of those who are currently infected with the lost sense of self, but incurred savage aggression and the desire to earn a black belt in Ninjitsu: hesitant jumping around are sure to continue honing their top turning technology or interact with their brethren in the that looks like a massive tickling festival on their hapless victims. Martial arts skills are not only their talents to something, they are well versed in guerrilla tactics, hiding in the rafters and under bales of hay, and sometimes inexplicably fall out of nowhere, but the heavens themselves. All this, of course, the work of Mattei. <br /> <br /> There is a third, more talkative, a variety of zombies. This type appears to maintain a sense of irony, and "I am very thirsty for blood .... A funny twist at the end, where the DJ turns the zombies, but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of humanity, only serves to enhance the WTF factor and destroy . any hope of a serious resolution <br /> <br /> Then there's the notorious zombie head, which slowly propels itself through the air, jokerish forged skeletal smile on his face, as if to say: "yes, we know how bad it looks like ». <br /> <br /> character quite the one volume, as one might expect. But it Sevda comic dialogue and dubbing that actually prevent us take their plight seriously. Having said that, the first soldier to die precisely deliver impressive valiant display against rampant zombie threat. Indeed, this is the first and perhaps only time we got a real zombie ~ d aggro, and one of the few effective scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> guy who played leading scientists have a heart, but no talent, with pauses in his lines completely random, so he It ends up looking like a tangled astmaty us. Scientists are trying to display when searching for an antidote very unconvincing 'now allows you to place the two molecules together! <br /> <br /> There are a few things that stick out as truly effective, however. At the beginning of the scene the woman protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Upon entering the room we were confronted with vague shapes shift vision of the coal and squirming masses on the floor, all shot in the atmospheric ambient light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of fast machete With zombies, smashing everything in its path in his anxious desperation to have her. His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real terror in the film. Before and after the theme that moves through the hotel, which plays host to events of the earliest stage of a flare, and then, as a haven for our protagonists impregnated dense humid atmosphere. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers approaching cautiously boarded up the room, apparently houses a horde of undead, and it is quite stressful. Things are becoming more visible when they sit down to a lack of knowledge of the hotel to what lies at the top. But it is handled carelessly and not as efficient as it could be. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say, this film may just about deserves to be called a royal screw with a potentially effective tropical zombie festival, and not just through a bad movie. If nothing else it has many unintended laughs, what I expect from just about anything Italian and bloody from the eighties.
