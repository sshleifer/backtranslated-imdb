This film is a modest effort by Spike Lee. It is capable of much more than that movie.Get bus while apparenly against racist, does nothing but curses white and black degrade the status quo. The plot of this film about a group of black men, traveling by bus to a million people marching Louis Farrakhan. Bus has every type of person you could imagine: gay, Muslim, gangbanger and Uncle Tom (He threw off the bus, though). It was one the only white person on the bus. He was accused of being a racist minute he got on the bus to go. Despite his Jew, and the fact that he explained this position he ended up leaving bus.I racist and hate to say it, but films such as this need to implement your own hipocracy and rienforcation with steryotypes. It should not be seen as a triumph, but a sad dissapointment. You may think that I am a racist for writing this, but I mean well. Better luck next time Spike.
