This movie was so amateurish, I could hardly believe what I saw. It is shot on video! Do not shoot! I have not seen the likes of this since the beginning of the 70s, when the late night network showed a film shot of the week "horrors" in the video ....... It looks like a bad soap opera, and pay her a compliment. Some actors give their best shot. Michael Des Barres does well with what he is given to do, which will act as a sex addict out of control. I can not say that it is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski, the therapist sits in a chair for almost the entire film, with very little change camera angles. I can not blame her for the bad block someone else, but it's absolutely incredible in her roles. Her little girl's voice works against it here. And I consider myself a fan of Nastassja Kinski. She, of course, ageless and exotic, but it is outside the range of this. <br /> <br /> Alexander Paul pitifully overwhelmed. Every line she delivers this with three exclamation. Someone must have sent her screaming any price. Why Michael Des Barres wants to have sex with such violent shrew? <br /> <br /> Finally, Ryazanov Arquette as sweet, maligned wife comes off well, and probably the most believable of the bunch. But this is not saying much. <br /> <br /> This has to be the worst movie I've seen in years.
