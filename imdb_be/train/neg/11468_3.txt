I do not know who came up with the idea that whales go around killing people and bashing and destroy things for revenge, but my god this is absurd. Swallow most definitely not a cold-blooded killer of the film makes it to be ... it's stupid. Swallow is very smart, do not get me wrong, but I doubt very much that they know and understand such a thing as revenge. So I must say that all I got out of that movie was fun, as it was out of place. So I'm at least somewhat amused by it. Personally, I would recommend to go and see Jaws, if you want to see the type of killing animals-Humans film. But if you're like me and want to laugh at something that is far from realism, then I would say go ahead. : D
