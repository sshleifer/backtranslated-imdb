I just watched this movie, and I have to say that with such a great premise and a lot of talent this turkey just lying there !!! A friend gave me this film, and I watched with an open mind, mostly because he had such a high appreciation for history. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot advisory ... why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He is the character of Anthony Quinn is allegedly hired to be his new pilot ... well, we never see Costner go near the plane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner operates in Texas (James Gammon) sells the horse and the great Mexican businessman Costner tag along for the ride. Not knowing what happened to Mars to beat to a pulp, and Costner pushes him to a meeting, what happens with the partner Quinn! But it does not work ... it is necessary, zilcho! Why do they have the character of ham in? Why do they have to sell a horse associate of Quinn, when there was nothing to get out of this? <br /> <br /> In addition, after they leave Costner dead, they make the character of Madeleine Stowe has become a whore, she attacked one of the men Quinn, who paid for the rotation ... it impales him with his own a knife, and the next thing, she was moved to the convent! No explanation as to why it has been moved, or if it was done! <br /> <br /> Too much talent to spend money on such a weak script and poor editing !! I only watched it because one owns it, and let me see it ... I'm going to throw it to him for 2 hours I've wasted my life, watching the blasted thing!
