I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach film I've seen, "Burning Moon». But while the movie was pretty grim and disgusting, «Premutos», it seems to be mainly played for laughs. While his delight as Ittenbach made this film without money in your spare time (and a DVD documentary is worth a look), I discovered that the Sun is constantly struggling to fast forward to the next scene of gore. Of course, there is blood, and if that's all you want, then go ahead and enjoy. But keep in mind: there are an inordinate number of lame comedy and tedious story exposition. Many compare this movie, Peter Jackson, especially «Braindead». But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in «Bad Taste», it is clear Ittenbach lacks the one thing that Jackson - talent. 3/10 (for very good and rich gore effects, and to maximize the impact of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)
