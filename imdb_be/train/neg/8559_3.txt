"It is difficult to describe love, how, how exciting, how to make a relationship is like a drama, as with all as pornographic scenes thrown in for as good a measure as muddy as contro- how -versy and make us more as the money is and how things are. " -. Helen lost quote <br /> <br /> Â«Kisses, How, on how, mouth, etc.," as best as artistic activity as ever did. Watching hairy arms Helen and Chris was masturbating as the height of my many years of viewing experience and other things. But before I wanted to start like breaking new US-20-somethings fool record with my "love", let me, as soon as the list briefly as high as this -Osveschenie visual as a holiday: <br /> <br /> 1. Chris does business with his genitals, and not only that:. the camera (guided so elegant Ellen and Patrick) awards frail full screenshot fat white trash belly Chris and after he finishes UNA-Catholic thing -. it was really exciting I can sincerely say that I have never seen such grace Chris, you should do more of these scenes. your next film, because that is exactly what we need as a continuation of what began that brilliant, brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his "95 Idiots." Running as *** and then a hairy, fat, white belly what more could any movie-goer ask? Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch Chris ejaculate (despite the fact that I am right) ... This poetry in motion. Such elegance, such a style. Not less than the total, the divine inspiration is not included in the filming that sequence - plus a considerable amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not get more spiritual than that. <br /> <br /> 2. hairy, thick arms Helen. Shaky camera close-up, so artfully photographed by our two directors of photography (I can not stress this enough), Ellen and Patrick, often confusion regarding the correct identification of the floor in question. There were a few scenes where we see part of the body (legs, hands or feet), but it is often a guessing game: in fact, that the body part belongs to a man or a woman? Of course, Chris and his fellow artists, Helen and Patrick whatsername, rush to the goal, because their bodies were ideal for the creation of this on the basis of gender confusion. It was sometimes difficult to guess or see a male or female leg. Patrick is so very delicate and feminine in his movements, so naked and untouched, while Ellen and the other girl so very butch that with their thick arms and legs. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially how neatly ties in with the theme of change of roles between men and women so completely original and stunning. Ellen behaves like a man who wants sex constantly, while her ex, Patrick wants to talk - as a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Search for Helen left the mat. "He must love" The Simpsons ", which is left-wing." I am glad that the makers of this film have decided to break the long-standing tradition of offering our intellectual leftists. Helen so refreshing - and realistic - change. The number of "likes" that she and her liberal friends manage to say in less than 80 minutes really phenomenal (3849 to be exact). They managed to realistically convey their real life mediocrity on the big screen with minimal effort, and I applaud them for it. <br /> <br /> 5. In large fingers. Many things here for foot-fetishists, which I think is very liberal, very flattering way of reaching towards sexual minorities. In the end, shoe- and foot fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema, so it's nice to see that someone out there cared. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or, more precisely, KLOTLMAS, offers more than meets the eye. This is not just a modest film about shallow people involved in the hollow relationships while indulging in meaningless conversations. No, it's much more than that. We are talking about the light that guides all the silly creature; lighthouse which dominates the useless life of the various pseudo-artistic imitators, who just dropped out of film school, and plan to attack our senses with the near chushami, which I hope to play well in the ambitious festivals like Sundance and Cannes, allowing them to obtain the necessary impact, thus some real cash for the changes with which they will later hire the likes of Sean Penn and George Clooney in the promotion of saving the planet and the solution of all political problems facing the world. What is the best way to do this than by porn from the beginning? <br /> <br /> When Chris and Helen made the camera here, as is clearly stated in the end credits, the one holding the camera, but two of them were in front of him? They probably hired a couple of passers-by and stuck a camera in his hands ... <br /> <br /> By http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and check out my "TV and cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism list ".
