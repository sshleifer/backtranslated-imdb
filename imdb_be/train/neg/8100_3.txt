Bonfires of vanity film impregnated with flop sweat. I can not remember, I am not a film that was so eager to be so relentlessly outrageous, provocative and important, but did not work so consistently across the board. This is how to stand up comic who does not get a laugh, but it can not go on stage. The harder the film tries, the louder each attempt results in ringing laughter knock. Despair display film so viciously it almost evokes Unfortunately for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The film reaches a laugh out-loud status only twice. Once in the form of Gerald Rivera playing the reverse, arrogant and immoral TV tabloid journalist - which is funny because he apparently does not understand that he plays himself. Another scene that deserves to be laughed finally "a great moment," a film in which the judge plays Morgan Freeman falls sanctimonious lecture about morality ( "this is what your mother taught me!"). Pomposity time insulting to the point of being absurd. <br /> <br /> However, it should be recognized that this is a noble cause. He has good when bad actors, a group of actors who are trying to make the character of thin cardboard caricatures. The film looks professionally made and little cinematic flourishes that director Brian DePalma just loves obvious, if not particularly effective. But the film, which, apparently, wants to be a commentary on contemporary morality and ethics, never arises above the level of the cartoon. Satire requires style. Fars requires energy. Even sitcom takes time. But the best is the MUSTER Campfires may be unwise. After all, you do not want to laugh, you just want to reach out.
