Here is the version of the horror of Priscilla: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (! They want) starring Melinda / Mindy (Return of the Living Dead 3) Clarke, like candy, desert dweller pulls in a bank robbery with her boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr). He ends up in jail South-of-the-border run by the sadistic head screw (with replays Englund in the crest). She and her darling poodle finally on the run at the gas stations of the monastery, until they transformed after falling meteor. Dogs turn into disgusting transvestite "bitches" and candy evolving for a long time, talking, killing a forked tongue, she can not control. Thugs looking for the stolen loot and other various Numbskulls add additional complications. <br /> <br /> First, Clark is fantastic and does what is there to do in this film. You look at it and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and very sexy in various wigs and disguises, including scary, skin tight latex tights ... and wondering how this actress is not a huge star. It's too bad the rest of this cult attempt does not live up to its promises. <br /> <br /> Blame director / scripter Sciamma, who believe that a strange room in itself enough to withstand the laughter ... but his vulgar jokes, annoying supporting characters and silly dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, lots of bright colors and sets odd muffled muddy pictures and dusty desert locations. Fortunately for Sciamma, Clark in his film, because she alone keeps you watching.
