Although the idea of ​​more original than most Sci-Fi movies, the performance as usual is not enough. While mummy practical effects are not bad, and the symbol «Gun Nut» is above the upper giggle inducing, the only real draw to see Baccarin and Adam Baldwin reunited on the small screen. I suspect that was the idea all along. They do their best they have, but "must see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so, when the character in Morena sported some Tomb Raider-style shorts. Nha high forehead movie I know, but you can not deny the true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin again hams it as the guy you love to hate. If you just want to look at a couple of your favorite characters Firefly good time with some sub-par material, it may be for you. If you want a good action and character development then it is recommended to look elsewhere.
