For those who would like to see this movie? I would say: go! Without a story it can be a very good film / documentary. But the music, the story, and some of the implemented subject lines make it very difficult to observe the human skeptic like me. After a few animals, their life in one gets the feeling for a few seasons, that this animal soap we observe. But the melodramatic view just does not cut it for me, besides, if a predator finally catching up on production (one exception remained there), the camera zooms out, or jump to another scene. I ask myself, why is this happening, when they had to show the reality, why cut scene that melodramatic tale is? I think that morality is important for the crowd of mass, cause in the end: it would be a waste to destroy this wonderful planet.
