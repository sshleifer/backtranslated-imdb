Yeah, right. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour of patiently waiting for the film shoot. It was terribly boring, and consisted mainly of people who go casually around the hills with no apparent direction. Then the hero comes into the picture. Born as Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. Obviously white. He was not even close to the passage to Asia. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was very distracting, and the story did nothing to help the cause. Meaningless sequence battle and lame dialogue. It's an hour and forty-five minutes long, and in the end I was trying to eat your face. I watched it because people in video store where I work, always ask me when this film is any good. Now I have the answer. It goes something like this: um. "NO! NO GOOD GOD! It's awful! Do not do it to myself, I would recommend another movie, perhaps one that is interesting."
