I saw a "bruise" on the DVD. While I was looking at it, I thought. "This is very bad porn movie free porn" I also thought, "Whoever wrote this has some real problems." Then I watched as the director / author Carlson explain his process as a special feature. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> The special attention in the film is made on two alcohol losers who beat each other to get out. They are slightly more attractive. There is a front and full nudity. These factors are likely to make a film to be seen at all. <br /> <br /> The most upsetting part of the movie is gay bashing and subsequent further gay bashing the same sacrifices, clumsily trying to get revenge on the attackers, two drunken losers. Not only is the subject of absurd and poorly handled from a technical point of view, but acting terribly bad. <br /> <br /> Then there is the theme of a boxer-stalker. It's really crazy, not just absurd. This hunky boxer is injured boy's persistent attention fleshy mothers working in the parking lot of their gym. It is in Los Angeles, mind you. Boxer injured so that he appears in the house stalker stripes in front of him and worried about in the process. <br /> <br /> Well, all I can say is, why would a boxer who is at the heart of an exhibitionist to be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It just does not make any sense. And I'm afraid that some of the psycho-dynamics really makes sense if you take the time to read about them. Nevertheless, the bad scenarios rarely make sense at all. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to think that this film is a significant minority within the gay community. Well, he may be right, I suppose. We will never know, because this minority is so dysfunctional they are unlikely to get organized enough to obscure ever gay festival or a DVD shop, only two places that they might find this turkey. Thank God for that.
