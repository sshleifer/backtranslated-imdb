This is what the name should be, anyway. <br /> <br /> This film combines the weapons, explosives, and senseless killing to make a flop with "action" movie. Let me make my point in a series of questions: answer type of transaction <br /> <br /> What is happening in the film.? People are dying. <br /> <br /> So, what? Yes. <br /> <br /> What is the story about? What is the plot? <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the film trying to do? Killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What are the characters like? Extremely flawed and contradictory in relation to their own personality. <br /> <br /> What is good about this movie? Yes. I am sure that they have used some good Panavision camera filming him. <br /> <br /> If you want to DC murder, as a wish to test, and then watch the movie. If you happen to be retaken by such base "entertainment" and then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> In summary, storyline stinks, the characters are not worth their while, plot completely resist, and nothing is combined <br /> <br /> This proves one thing :. actors, directors, and those who helped to make this film, certainly not «Made».
