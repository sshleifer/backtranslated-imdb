In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can make a Western, except for Warner Bros. A few times they try, it's always funny (except, perhaps, they died with their boots on -., Which is cavalery western) I read that Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney Seing this big cowboy hat on his head, said, that he looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart too urban, too XXE century trustworthy in the western movies. The history here has not been a surprise, and it did't care. Every 10 minutes, I guess I can see Bogart and Cagney drop their young guns and put your hands in the machine gun to get away from the set in the 1930s, the black car.
