This subject deserves a much better script, and the end result, what this film serves up. The script full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a chain of nightmare scenarios loosely bound together. Gaps and loose ends in the story line a lot. The scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and looking for her, as it was taken, it's just amazing. It is written in the time of cleaning treatment with the head of a shelter for refugees handing her "missing poster" from the time when she was eight years old. In the real world, when the head of the shelter for the refugees found that he had under his roof, decisive kidnapping, which would have been immediately call the police. This is a law enforcement matter is not a 12-minute segment for Oprah. All that follows from there until the end so short shrift, I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were pure gratuitous exploitation. Funny, that's what this film is to be condemned. In the end, apparently joined.
