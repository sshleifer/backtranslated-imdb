A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad film. There's no escaping it. I love the series, and I think that Freddy is probably the best character ever in a horror movie. But even being a fan, I can not see that this film is mediocre. <br /> <br /> There is not even an attempt to create an interesting story and strong characters. To date, they simply refused. They do not even try. They are the production, of course, hoping for a few dollars more simple. <br /> <br /> The story does not grab your attention. Its so easy it is almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Alice survivor of Part 4 is now pregnant. Freddy back through child dreams. In the beginning we learn that Alice must stop him find his mother. And that's all. <br /> <br /> The history of progress is slow as there is so little of the story is that it turns a pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogue and hardcore action. In fact it is only a terrible thing, acting, since the death of even a little bit cool. <br /> <br /> characters are so uninteresting, we could not care less about them. <br /> <br /> The girls are unattractive as possible. The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I saw the best actor in school plays. It is a shame really. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to it. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material simply did not let her shine. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins work is nowhere close to Reni Harlin's brilliant direction in the Dream Master. He tries some creative shots towards the end, but this tension Harlin and Craven set up so well in the previous films, no where to be found. <br /> <br /> Baby Sleep is just another mundane continuation. This kind of film, which gives a number, horror a bad name. <br /> <br /> end when something scary Freddy. It's too sad to see him now. The clown is not funny. Bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.
