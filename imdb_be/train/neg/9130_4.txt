It is true that some supporters of Peter Sellers work, may be disappointed by this, his latest venture. But, of course, any fan Sellers find pleasure in all his films, just because of the enormous human talent. and the diabolical plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, of course, is no exception. Unfortunately, this would be the last film Sellers, (he even was released after his death), but still nice to see how the people had failed to keep its irreplaceable talent straight to his untimely death. And not only do we get a salesman, but we get to sellers not only plays a major role, but his nemesis, as strange Nayland Smith, a detective on the hunt for an insane 168-year-old Fu. History is as absurd as we go for the outrageous antics Fu to make it age-defying elixir and Nayland and his like-minded group who are trying to stop him. As well as any of the sellers more films, the film comes with a guaranteed flawless performance from him, as well as many of his friends face co-stars - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Meserera, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a few. Also nice to see the Pink Panther tall Bert Kwak (Cato) are cameo with vendors - let them play the same role, but still nice. The story is actually quite funny, like many of the characters involved that it classes as a film strongly influenced by Goon. And, although it never reaches the heights of comedy Goon, there are a lot of funny jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The film did not obtain a commercial on the first edition of the whole world mourns after Sellers' death (the film was released in less than 3 weeks after), and there is always a sad thought hiding in the back of your mind while watching it is Sellers last film. This is far from a great movie - it's often slow, too funny, and sometimes jokes simply does not exist - but still nice - unless a different maximum speed performance of Peter Sellers.
