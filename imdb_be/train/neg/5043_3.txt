I'm a huge fan of Zhang Ziyi and will go to any movie, to see her, which is something that took me a purple butterfly. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I agree with many others that have commented on it. It is very complicated, and very slowly. Because all the film seems to have been removed from the portable camera, significant portions of it are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue, and that it does not tell you much. There are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in the room, looking at each other without speaking. The way the film shifts the time is also very confusing and hard to follow. Even after reading a number of reviews in advance and have a general idea of ​​what the film was about, I still find it hard to understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> I knew in advance that the film was not remotely similar to the previous films starring Zhang Ziyi, but am looking forward to see her in something else, but, unfortunately, I was eventually disappointed. She never smiles in this movie, although admittedly, most of the time it has nothing to smile. I could have done without the sex scenes, they were just as asexual and without any apparent feeling among the participants, as you could hope to find.
