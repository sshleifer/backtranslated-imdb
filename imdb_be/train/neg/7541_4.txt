great mystery, but the film goes down hill from there. Start prospectively from a car accident and a woman and her daughter were burnt alive in front of a police officer, Edward. He was injured on this and seen popping pills. Mysterious letter turns up from an old friend to ask for help in finding her missing daughter. So Ed goes to the commune in the main island of women. They do not like outsiders. Many filler Ed shown around the city looking for a girl. This made the film too long. It's finally getting a little better towards the end, when we learn about the crazy woman performing rituals, and finally, a sinister plan in store for Edward. <br /> <br /> In general, not well-written story and too long. <br /> <br /> The verdict: I would miss it.
