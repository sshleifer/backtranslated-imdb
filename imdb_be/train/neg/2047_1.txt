I do not want to go on the talk here, but this is the worst ..... "film" I've ever seen. Worse Avengers. Incompetent direction, a separate letter, and terrible actions are the only consistent elements throughout. Shot on a very cheap video, it looks like a big school project, but without emotion. Lighting often looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is a little better than one microphone on the camera, but the rest of the case is just awful. The site of the head in strange ways without foundation or higher resolution, items Techie absurd and editing looks worse than a rough cut. It is not even bad enough to be funny. It's just bad. By the way, packing deliberately misleading. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owe me $ 4.00.
