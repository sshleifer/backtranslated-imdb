I watched it today, partly attracted an all-star cast, and partly because I have enjoyed so many other films of this kind. Nevertheless, this is one to avoid. There are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity is not just flowing, billiards call at the beginning, for example. Action scenes with the natives is about as good as you remember, in the old black and white films of Tarzan, you know, where you see the spear flying through the air and the camera cuts to a dead mother lay motionless on the floor with her sticking out of his thigh. It's an instant death? There are also some completely unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, as a little girl, escaping while gathering flowers. Really bad animated clay toys too painful to watch. If you see this movie crabs that are about an inch forward 5kph are a highlight. Once one has managed to sneak up on David McCallum and give him a glass. Its as if there was no time to get out of the way, how and when the obelisk in the city falls, relatives have all the time in the world to make 2 steps to the left, but he screams and falls on it. I give it only 2 Ecklund. And why Mccullums develop stuttering voice as the film progresses?
