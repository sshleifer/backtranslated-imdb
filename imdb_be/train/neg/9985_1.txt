Have I ever seen the movie more shockingly inept? I can think of a lot to catch this one, but none of which can not exceed it. The cast all the horrible stereotypes screen flat dialogue. I am ashamed of all the people involved in making it. Each of them is an expression of fear, does not generate the plot, but the realization that this project can easily Knicks in his career. Even many charms Ms. Diaz not provide adequate cause to subject themselves to this. Avoid, this is obviously a film style that the Americans do not really get a grasp. See the final result, if necessary, and you will see what I say, but do not say I did not warn you ...
