If you like to see what is to be launched as a 2 hour movie in unrelated applause unwatchability, you will love this film. Otherwise, you just wonder how they could make a movie from something so easy to translate to the big screen as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In the preview of the film, it has been shown many scenes that were not in the movie, and in the film, some scenes just do not make sense. Despite the fact that the film is a little less than 1 hour and a half, I can only think of one truly memorable moment, and it's just before or during the credits! <br /> <br />
