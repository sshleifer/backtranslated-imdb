It must be assumed that those who have praised this film ( "The biggest filmed opera ever," I did not read it somewhere?), Or do not care about the opera, not to worry about Wagner, do not care about anything except their desire appear cultured. Either as a representation of Wagner's swan song, or as a film, it strikes me as a real disaster, with the lead in reading scores, consistent with the Trix, the grim realization of the text. <br /> <br /> It is doubtful that people with ideas about what an opera (or, for that matter, the game, especially one of Shakespeare) is the "o" to be at bay theater or studio; Syberberg, very fashionable, but without any justification from the text of Wagner, decided that Parsifal is "on" bisexual integration, so that the title character in the last stage transforms into a kind of beatnik baby, although the one who continues to sing high tenor - few of the actors in the film the singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the leader, seen as the face (but did not hear the voice) Amfortas, and is badly in double exposure as a kind Batonzilla or leader who Ate Monsalvat while playing music in St. Ryasnyi Friday - which, by the way, transcendant beauty of nature is presented in bulk and banal sluggish crocuses stuck in poorly set out peat is suitable, that worries me. In the theater, sometimes you have to piece together such shortcomings with our thoughts, but I can not understand why Syberberg could not glued in, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, the plateau in the lush, as mandated by Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music ... <br /> <br /> sound difficult to endure, high voice and tubes, in particular, have a dormer look that adds a different kind of tired of our impatience with uninspired conducting and paralytic deployment ritual. Someone in another review mentioned recording one thousand nine hundred fifty-one Bayreuth and Knappertsbusch, although the Tempi is often very slow, was that Jordan did not have enough, feeling the pulse, feeling for the ebb and flow of the music - and, half a century later, the orchestral sound in this set in modern taps, still superior to the film.
