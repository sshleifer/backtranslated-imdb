Photos on a DVD so dark I thought that the screen is dead. I think I missed half the movie to see. However, it was not well developed and not interesting. I did not find the story associated with the name "Black Widow." I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller, but did not get enough active participation in care after the first few shots. I rented a movie specifically for Willem Dafoe and was sadly wasted his talent. I do not believe that Giada Colagrande studied film making for a long time to develop the big picture of movement. She is attractive and can turn into an actor, but it has taken on too many tasks in this film. Despite the fact that they were married in real life, they do not have chemistry on screen. Their relationship does not seem plausible. I do not understand why the other characters have even been introduced into the story.
