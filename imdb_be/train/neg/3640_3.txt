I did not have the background knowledge of the film before I bought it, but it sounded cool, and I would like to see a really kick-butt Viking movie for a while now ... unfortunately, this movie was not what I was looking for. I was hoping for the best, but instead was taken Scandinavian sad soap opera that seemed to stretch for too long, despite the 84 minutes running time. The premise of the film is intriguing enough: This is the captain of the Vikings, who defies God, and Odin is so furious that he cursed the son of the leader, called Barek, death and rebirth as a Berserker. This guy Barek then forced to live an angry, mad and violent life after life. The film was made competent enough, with some rich cinema and quasi-good performances of the actors, but then again, I found that he missed and questioning when the stream ends. The filmmakers had a chance to do something very interesting and semi-unique, but they dropped the ball. Maybe it could have been improved with some cheap tactic of operation as one, such as the gratuitous nudity and lots of gore ... I mean, we're talking about "Berserk" here, is not it? The Vikings had to be quite BAD, what with all the thieves and bandits, so do not Berserkers have to be even more extreme? In general, if you are not a fan of Young and the Restless (etc ...) or are themselves, in fact, insane Berserker who likes self torture, I would probably stay away from this piece of uniform celluloid.
