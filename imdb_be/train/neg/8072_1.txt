(Possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> «Soul Survivors», is quite possibly the worst theatrically released film ever. Nothing has no sense at all, there is some story about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. The entire film is just a bunch of random shots of things that do not really associate with each other, at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Tha action does not exist, jerky camera work and the script is so confusing, it just makes the film even more difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for something to tie together the film, but nothing came of it. Definitely the worst film of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
