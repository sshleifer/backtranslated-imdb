I went into this with my hopes up, twenty minutes into the movie, I could not have been more downs. Despite thinking that this is another terribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe ... just maybe, someone will get it right this time. Unfortunately, Prom Night at approximately the same level of quality as the recent remake of the April Fools' Day, bad script, bad directing, cheese overdone action and generally a bad horror. <br /> <br /> From start to finish this is a sad, repetitive and are about a dozen rolls his eyes. We've seen it all before, and we have seen, this has been done a million times better than this. When you go to see Prom Night at the theater (I'd say wait for the DVD or PPV), be prepared for the audience to laugh, because they will laugh. Laugh not at the point in the film, which is supposed to be funny, they are in response to the key "exciting" moments in the film that are so badly made you feel as if your watching the latest batch of Scary Movie. Seriously, would it be a remake or a hoax? The filmmakers missed so bad here that a large number of spectators in the theater I attended came about halfway through the movie. That, in retrospect, if I did. Not me though, I had to torture yourself and stick to it in the hope that it will be better. Needless to say, this is not so. The "horror" scene seriously, not so much because of the action, but because of the direction, the script, the "special effects" and the camera work. The film manages to look as if they have spent a fortune to produce it, but still got out of it with a micro budget film. I half expected to see a dollar store a label on some of the props and kept thinking that I would sully a porn star in the cast somewhere. <br /> <br /> This movie is scary good, if this is the future of big-budget horror genre horror when convicted.
