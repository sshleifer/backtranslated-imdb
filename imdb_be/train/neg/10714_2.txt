For two of the funniest comedians, the film was terrible. Quickly ferried him and never better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought that it would be so great in a comedy. In previous views were so great, but they only showed the best part of the movie. My husband even thought that chick flick, it sucked. What to do about it. The film was very slow ans boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I would like to return the money for it! BOO of us here in Arizona. Thanks, but no thanks. Who does this kind of silly things to make people think that you are pregnant. I thought it was going to be so funny, I had my own children, and I was helping other children. It might be more along the lines of reality.
