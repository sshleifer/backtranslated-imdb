There are two kinds of marks on the cap: the people who are trying to do our best and do the right thing, and people who relentlessly pursue their own self-interest and commit every mortal sin, that they can while telling yourself and everyone else that they are heroes, and only hope each. More than any other exhibition, the shield of hypocrisy and self-deception. Unfortunately, hypocrites and self-portraits show deluders are heroes, and as such have an incredible immunity typical genre fiction heroes to defeat or get caught, and they came out on top again and again, to fool all of their peers. <br /> <br /> show has an excellent camera work. Lead-ins and fade is always great. This is really a work of art to see. Unfortunately, the story is animated, overwrought, wish-fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence, rape and lies. <br /> <br /> hero who carries it all down with him failed after an unsuccessful scheme scheme is Wiley, both bro Warner cartoon character, always escape and make fun of all Elmer fudds (one who does not support it in his lies and crime), will automatically attract a woman looks good supporting character to come on the show, always withstand any attempts to bring him to justice, and always scraping your ears painful self-justification. If another police officer discovers something-something that he does, and someone is injured because of his actions, he always blames the police suspicious, regardless of the fact that his schemes and complicated lie and condemned plans is always a reason. Every time. <br /> <br /> As with 24, the show is based on tricks and countless delays to drag his story for season after season. Sad, incredible long history injected into the plot of each season to ensure that the skeleton on which hang the bloody, twisted pieces of meat that are corrupt actions of the characters and the inevitable hiding. <br /> <br /> the most disappointing, though, it's vanity as they try to change the viewer sympathy writing back and forth to and from the well-known characters on whims. Sometimes, they want to see Shane as an enemy. Sometimes they want to see it as a poor obscure soul. Sometimes they want to see Vick as a dangerous sexual dynamo. Sometimes they want to see it as a poor man with a heart of gold. Sometimes they want to see Maru as a low down nasty Jezebel. Then they think that if they show that it is sitting and talking on her dreams with Sheynomom that we will find her likes and tragically. <br /> <br /> None of these manipulations is not sufficient for obtaining a sympathy they want, after they showed that these characters spoil the lives of others to achieve their goals, that's all. It is nonsense to try to flip back and forth. But then, this is also nonsense to produce seven seasons these clumsy clown drawing every super model in the presence of their bed and running a criminal syndicate straight from the police station, right under the noses of all.
