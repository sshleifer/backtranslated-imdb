Watching the Lion King and Lion King II and enjoyed both thoroughly. I thought that the Lion King 1,5 may be worth a look. What a disappointment! Disney must be desperate for income. <br /> <br /> Especially now, when they have lost a deal with Pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they just picked up some bits of frames that were left on the floor Editor (or garbage), and glue them together to make the <br /> <br /> quick buck. Unlike LK I and II, both of which were strong storylines. <br /> <br /> This film hardly has a history at all. While the characters and animations are always fun to watch, there's just not enough material here for the film. Some of the bits could be good fillers second disk on the original proposals <br /> <br /> Disney -.! Ashamed of this garbage to make a quick buck <br /> <br /> The next time you take the time and effort and put our eternal work.
