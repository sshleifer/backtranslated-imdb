Remember the good old batman animated show from the 90s? One that people praised? One that people of all ages can appreciate all? One that showed the orderly like a real detective, instead of Hulk in a bat suit? Anyone who has been the villains you relevant? Anyone who has been the villains with the real motives? <br /> <br /> Well, clearly, Warner Bros. It does not. Thus, this dreck. <br /> <br /> To be honest, these people know anything about Batman? Do they have even looked at the comic batman before? Do they know Batman means to be a "detective"? Compilation 2 tips does not make you a detective! It makes you a little intelligent monkey <br /> <br /> This is the basic outline for the episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. "Opening Credits". Batman finds a dead giveaway, where it is located. Batman goes there and get years of trouble. Commercial. Batman is a clear / stupid way out of it. Penguin escapes. Penguin does something obviously again. Batman follows. They do kung fu (all the way, and I mean everything's know kung-fu, for some reason). Penguin Batman stocky man of small stature. he gets knocked out. It goes to Arkham. (Note: it is, as a rule, the other villain of each episode) <br /> <br /> Well, as you may have noticed that because Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this piece of cotton wool on the ground, maybe he's in an old amusement park!" So, maybe he was there 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I've already talked about it, but everyone knows Kung Fu! Even penguins! that, where were they thinking? (Probably because it is from people who have done the animated series Jackie Chan) <br /> <br /> What is really upsetting that show only the action. A lot of smarts. Nobody. If you need an orderly think he will use the technology, and then to do some kung fu. <br /> <br /> But wait, let's not forget the villains. Afterall, what would Batman without his gallery of rogues? <br /> <br /> Well first of all I must say kudos for originality. I do not think that other media Batman would imply a joker and fear locked monkey man, as the Riddler emo, poison ivy, and, as a minor (which is kind of confusing when you think about, whether it is sexuality is to be its main strength?) <br /> <br /> what else crap, however, that each character is now 2-Dimensional, stereotypical scammer. <br /> <br /> E. <br /> <br /> Step killer wants to flood Gotham without cause. <br /> <br /> The man-bat is hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some inexplicable reason. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal all. For no reason. <br /> <br /> notice a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most offensive to be Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy Award winning "Heart Ice 'episode of Batman: The Animated Series? The one who gave Mr Fix the motives of his crime? The episode, which was so good that it was used in the comics over his original backstory (a mad scientist)? The one that made him a victim, with a view? Heck, even Batman and Robin recognized that using that as Mr. freezes origin in this P.O.S. film. <br /> <br /> Well, this series tells Â«F # ck it" does Mr. Freeze jewelry robber before his accident, only the abundance of his mind, then freezes and gives him the power to make things cool, then he continues to steal valuables without any reason, and let w! T lines like "The ice day." <br /> <br /> Maybe they're watching Batman & Robin in the end. <br /> <br /> But hey, look on the bright side. This series makes you feels nothing with the wicked, so that means that you are a good man. Well done.
