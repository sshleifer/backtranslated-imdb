To the previous Elli Stefan promises to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. Finally back in Sweden as a whole, the situation is more complex than thought Stefan .. <br /> <br /> This film does not seem to fit into a normal class Swedish films due to the fact that he was much Americanized.
