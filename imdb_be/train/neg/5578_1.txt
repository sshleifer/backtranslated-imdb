Even if you could get past the idea that these sad characters personally watched every important moment in 1960 (ki, so Cathy has not joined the Manson Family, and no one died at Altamont), the film was still incredibly awful. I have the impression that the "writers" just lock themselves in a room and watched "Forrest Gump», «The Wonder Years» and 60th movies Oliver Stone again and again, and called it the study. Canadian television critic called the completion of the first episode of "head spinning." He was right.
