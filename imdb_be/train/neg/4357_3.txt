A group of friends to meet face to face with family hideous cannibals while hiking in the beautiful German countryside. <br /> <br /> The concept of "family mutant cannibal" is almost as old as the hills that inbred freaks often called the house, so that any director is trying to breathe new life into the genre need to come up with something pretty darn special order to impress. On the barricades, Timo Rose tries to give a well-worn routine Teutonic twist, transplant operations in the Black Forest, and giving it the German low-budget treatment spray. The result is a very bloody, but quite unoriginal effort that produced almost unwatchable due to some dreadful directorial decisions ?? in particular, the use of non-stop annoying fancy filters and editing techniques. <br /> <br /> If Timo Rose decided not to use every trick mosey its editing software offered him the barricades might have been interesting enough Gore-festival: his inexperienced cast do well enough; blood effects suitably stomach foaming; and there are one or two scares, and even some well-conceived terrible moments. All this, however, completely destroyed by the dreaded camera-work and editing gusty squall influx of visual tricks used to give the film the type of problem that inexplicably popular among modern filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give Barricade 3 of 10 purely for the countries of gore, which includes an elegant scene where the guy forced to drink acid, loads nasty wounds caused by various sharp objects, as well as some pretty decent shotgun loss.
