What is interesting is that the actions; not bad, just not enough. It was pretty lame., Special effects, no line was solely responsible for this failure. Standing in they were not alone awful bad, but was put together a tragic step. The show seemed to be long winded and slow with special effects, apparently designed to speed up the film together, but it failed totally. <br /> <br /> Much of the blame for the disaster was put on a special effects.Don't believe they were kinda cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this effort. Although she may have all they had to choose from with a small fan recogniton. Experienced actress would bring a part as Appleby never did. SCFI stew some really good original films, it's just too bad that it could not be so harsh.
