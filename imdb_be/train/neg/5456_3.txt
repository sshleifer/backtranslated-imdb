It's just another one of those horrible movies that you find on the entire period of the television service, reflect the disgusting behavior of some obnoxious woman in a sensitive manner. Together with other such unpleasant films as «The Burning Bed», «That's enough," or "Monster", this film takes a hideous criminal and tries to show the audience why it is not such a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here is my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau was a man, and Willy were 12-year-old girl, you would have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with the person? Answer :. Hell, no <br /> <br /> Imagine switching genders in this movie, and then you'll see why I and others here think this is a useless piece of garbage. Gender was switched, then there would be no attempt to empathize with the offender. Instead, we would probably have to be considered dreadful image and disgusting man, preying on the young girl, his lustful behavior of his landing in jail, and his brains victim suffering from Stockholm syndrome. The only reason, LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film because of their gender. <br /> <br /> Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau pedophile. Plain and simple. Many IFs ANDS or mind. It is a criminal who belongs in prison, and deserves ridicule and contempt, but certainly not our regret or sympathy.
