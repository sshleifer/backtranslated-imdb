I do not know why but for some reason, the disease, I think, because I was on a sequel to Disney's booze, I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmatians. The first film, which was a remake of the classic Disney animated film starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, seemed to be a sure hit, but it was a blast. I think that the reason why these movies do not work, because the 101 Dalmations, the original was a cartoon, it just worked better and more attractive to children as well as adults. It was actually not so fun, because it's the adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just real people, I understand that they are trying to make sure that it is attractive to children, but it makes fun to see how these actors behave in the film. And the story of 102 Dalmatians is actually not so good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil is in prison for a while, but everything changes when he proved that she now loves animals and nice people. But its reputation is now damaged as a puppy-Napper, but it buys a male dog shelter and suddenly now everyone loves, and it looks like it has changed. But when she sees Dalmatians her probation, she goes mad and begins to see the spot, and she loses it. She returned to the pups revenge and still determined to get that Dalmation coat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close actress is such a strange, very under-rated, but its adoption by Cruella De Vil, she's good, but let's face it, this film did a funny villain just a stupid crazy. In addition, as cute as puppies are, it just works better for animation, it sounds silly, but it's just not believable cartoon and without their identity being connected. I would not recommend 102 Dalmatians, it's good, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, it is just the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
