Star Rating: ***** The Works **** *** This just misses Little Bit In Between ** * Backlog During the pit <br /> <br /> In this debut effort for a loved one Nick Park and dogs they are forced to fly to the moon, when the good old Wallace runs out of cheese. <br /> <br /> as well as the shortest feature just 22 minutes, this W / G Adventure also the earliest and it kind of shows. Plasticine animation and funny little creaky here like Mork animation reminiscent of the little man in the box. <br /> <br /> Admirable though the skill for it, I've never really been very much in the Wallace and Gromit (maybe a little too friendly and traditional for someone of my generation.), the only one I really enjoyed the wrong trousers ( and it was more when I was younger and less knowledgeable about, we talk, the seedier joy of life.) I was driven to actively seek out this early effort in connection with the surge in popularity as a result of the recent film adaptation of the hugely successful. <br /> <br /> technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!), this one lacks the emotional angle is the successor had to have. That being said, it's pretty fun as the first attempt and, of course, set the standard for more things to come. Two stars, but good two stars. **
