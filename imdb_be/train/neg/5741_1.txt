<br /> <br /> I'm a big time horror movie / Sci-Fi fan, regardless of budget, but after watching countless horror movies late at night on cable and video, it has to be the worst of all the films. With bloody special effects (what looked like roast covered in fake blood or ketchup, which continued to be shown over and over again) and people running around screaming on the left, then right, then back. He had to stay with the beginning of a convenience store scene and stopped there and it was 15 minutes. Instead, it runs for a long time. This is a very, very low budget x5. Many scenes were way too long. The narrator sounded very amateurish as casual man talking to a junior high. This is the only film to assess below, in my opinion, than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla vs. Megalon, despite their higher budgets. 10 lays, try not to sleep through the entire movie in one setting, or better yet, avoid it like you would an undead brain feed the crowd. Why-Do-I-Ever-See-This-Piece-Of-zombie Dung blues. Incarnation nauseatingly bad movies made etc..ad infinity. -infinity / 10
