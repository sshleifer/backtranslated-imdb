I've always been interested in anything about the Yeti, so when I was looking around for a movie rental, this one caught my eye. It was the worst $ 4.50 I ever spent, and I want my money back! Please do not waste your money on this !! It was one of the cheapest films I've ever seen. The entire film was incredibly boring, and I found myself rolling his eyes a lot, and I did not even watch it all the way through. I'm just tired of it. The acting was terrible consequences were terrible, it was just a very bad and tasteless. All this is summed up in order to be really bad, boring movie, and a waste of time and money. I hope that one day they will make a good movie on the Snow, but as long as I sit through countless cheap clothes, like this, to find a real masterpiece.
