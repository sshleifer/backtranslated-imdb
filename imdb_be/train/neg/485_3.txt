When I saw the preview, I thought it would be a great movie. Indeed, it might be. The actress plays the main character was very reliable, and the beauty of shooting is not in doubt. However, dialogues casts a shadow on the whole picture. language level was too familiar and too modern for the actions that are taking place in 1610, and he took a great part of the movie magic. Nevertheless, I must congratulate the translator, because the English subtitles were more sophisticated and the way that the original French replicas, and this probably explains the good rating the film received imbd!
