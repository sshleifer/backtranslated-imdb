Where to start? How about with the erroneous synopsis: <br /> <br /> Â«X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It tells the story epically violent and romantic past of Wolverine, his complex relationship with Victor Creed and the ominous Weapon X program "<br /> <br /> his epically violent past is entirely non-violent. <br /> <br /> his relationship with Credo embellished so it's hard to understand how they have no connection at all. We emit from a single point in the first scene, which shows their child on the run, on the installation of military scenes, they fought throughout their long life expectancy, and, finally, at the moment, when they are part of the government team of hardcore killers . <br /> <br /> There's nothing by showing their relationship as brothers do. Nothing complicated laid believe for us is true or even love. <br /> <br /> romantic element between film and Silverfox Wolverine was forced and abrupt. We threw in a novel so quickly that it's over before you blink an eye. Newly introduced character, Silverfox killed about fifteen minutes. We can only guess why should we care about it. Who is she anyway? <br /> <br /> For the pivotal element of the weaknesses is the story, the novel surprisingly unexplored. He was taken in just because they needed. <br /> <br /> Ironically, when Wolverine discovers that his love was dead, he leaves her to rot in the forest, he goes to find Sabertooth. Being the romantic that it was unusual for it is still necessary to serve the plot in a very predictable pull a surprise for him. <br /> <br /> As for the weapons program X, lets just say that after the painful procedure paralyzes Wolverine and running. In the end, he comes home with a comfortable old still overwhelmingly loving couple. Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent Sun alarmed if found naked sweaty man in the barn. Is it any wonder that fate awaits them? <br /> <br /> In the previous films, and comics, the main reason why the amnesia Wolverines tormented him partly depended on what he said was vicious and cold-blooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing this was the case ... did he really want to remember these horrors, or keep them hidden and continue its current more positive way of life in the struggle with the bad guys of the world along with his teammates? <br /> <br /> How to give in X2: X-Men, when combined Stryker gives some of his secrets say that Wolverine will be broken, if he knew about the evil work they have done together. The film sets up a team just good enough, they do not actually do anything. Nha disturbing violence, entirely ruthless actions, they just do not stick a few natives in foreign countries in the ten or fifteen minutes they are on the screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not a bad man at all Stryker. Instead, he kept trying to put a chain on his brother Sabertooth which was thus forced agent, we all thought it was Wolverine. In the end, he just leaves all together. <br /> <br /> there is no duality of the conflict here at all. <br /> <br /> idiot remotely, that the nature of the conflict between good and evil is very dull story. They may also give him rubber claws. <br /> <br /> It was a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the Lamest Deus Ex Machinas, to ever hit the script. <br /> <br /> Magic Bullet memory erasure. <br /> <br /> In fact? <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only thing to bring down Wolverine. But it seems to have forgotten, when the agent after the agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs, which, of course, did not work on it at all. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film that he tried to focus on Wolverine throwing in the tone of other mutants that did almost nothing at all. Interesting characters were just for show and did nothing to the story. Most of them were in the film for 5-10 minutes at most, and yet you find yourself wishing we had seen them more or less Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (The Blob, but not a comic version) can penetrate launched missile tank with little or no physical damage to him at all, but a simple header from Wolverines metal head enough to blind him? <br /> <br /> Cyclops optical beams (which instead of being terrible forces are now more akin lasers) can burn the building, but when firing directly Sabertooth it just breaks it into the ground and even damaging his clothes. Adamantium Trench who? <br /> <br /> (gravity) defying the mutant Gambit, instead of using the signature cards, made in some crazy acrobat. In a poorly edited stage he loses consciousness ... Wolverine then oddly enough a few minutes later, he is on the roof runs to Wolverine. As he regained consciousness, he ran several blocks, climbed into the building, then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of the match, scratching mystery remains to be explained. <br /> <br /> Some apologized this movie weakness, arguing that it was made from the comics, and therefore should be weak in nature and hard to the flash memory. The idea that this film is a comic film contrived and superficial due to the fact incorrect. <br /> <br /> comic book source material, the real origin of Wolverine story ... worth something on the screen, he was not exaggerating his past and does not apply to the reader how nonsensical CGI addicts. It is a well-crafted story, and although passed and trimmed for a long time, began with the Weapon X by Barry Windsor-Smith. Much more intense and immersive storyline. <br /> <br /> This film LIS seriously forget. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have this magic weapon? <br /> <br /> 4/10
