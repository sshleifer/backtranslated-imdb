Orange tone it was just the opposite. Ah yes, the protagonist lives in the ghetto that all orange-tinted with orange toned people. At the same time, to mentally get rid of the crushing poverty of the body, it plays a video game full immersion (that sucks is that no rules are not clear and there is no logic is not worth the gameplay). She apparently derives income by playing the game, but it appears not to be an employee of a gaming company?. Many non-speaking pause later history stretches slowly. It uses a computer interface Glitchy orange on a working interface, so that visually annoying, and I can only suspect Microsoft in a future release. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I was a spectator, ask why it is mostly spends his precious time some stupid game, when she barely has everything necessary for life? Oh yeah, play the game is fun, but what's the point when you are almost starving? While she was petty of her life, and plays a lousy an even more orange hue lame video game immersive her dog runs away (probably looking for the owner, who pays at least a moment of attention to it and delivers it on a regular basis), or stolen from a woman (while it ignores its rotten orange tinted reality). <br /> <br /> At the same time, she takes possession of any game of its game-playing team lost all uninteresting movie. He. Thus, she wants to be the best, to get them Ash Catchem (got to tire us all). Golly, it sucks the protagonist as a person, and also has no redeeming qualities aside from its physical beauty (she could barter for some way to escape its crushing poverty). <br /> <br /> So, it reaches the "real" level and, at least, does not suck terribly, and she is sent to kill former teammate comatose mind living in the "real" level. Finally Nha Sucky sad soft orange tinted film is no longer a tedious routine of playing, but has the potential to say something along the lines of "the protagonist is locked in an imaginary generated poverty computers, and it is actually in the real world now," Perhaps it will make a murder case and to live in the real world now? Well, it kills the guy, and it disappears in the digital effect. Wow! Thanks idiotic director. You suck, you suck so much, the director. <br /> <br /> It was directed by one iota the chance to redeem himself a little hiding this lousy lame stupid Cruddy film with a philosophical twist . <br /> <br /> the director would say, 'the real world out there, and if you live in it and contribute to it, to make it better, it's not going to be some Cruddy orange hue land of poverty. "a clever way make it sucks tacular movie painfully slow lesson on the basics of civil honor (to 1% of viewers who are not from ayshli something really interesting to watch at this point are the movie masochists). <br /> <br /> No, officer. The director had to screw it all up, throw in some Cruddy digital effect and destroy every chance of redemption for this horrible nasty film that was a waste of money, waste of time and a waste of confidence in the viewer. <br /> <br /> After that, it ends. Good riddance. I hope that the director chokes on it. I put this hack on my "avoid at all costs" list for other films attached his name to.
