While it contains facts that it is not widely reported that this is not entirely true. They took a lot of freedom in moving the events, except for the people, and with the help of sets that do not correspond to the facts of life in the 30s. There were more than just a Bonnie and Clyde W.D. in the band at different times, and these people were as much to do with the facts, like the ones that are included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde go right much earlier than a skirmish, but in fact were drawn back into crime. Some of the events that are depicted in the daytime actually happened during the night. Sooner Bonnie was much more serious, and never healed properly. It was so bad that she had to be carried around someone who has not yet healed, and even then he stiffened so that it was forced. Clyde also limping because, while in prison, he grabbed the big toe. I know I'm being nit picky, and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual errors in this "truth" story, the film moves too quickly from case to case, and comes across more as a few individual photos of their life rather than a cohesive bulk history. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you read the book or seen the documentary, if you want to get closer to the truth.
