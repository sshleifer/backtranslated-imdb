"Demons III: Ogre» is not related to the previous sequel to "Demon" and "Demons cool hip-1980 horror classic." Demons III :. Eater "very stupid, boring, cheap monster I am very confused about the writer" Demons III: Ogre ». (Lambert Bova and Dardan Sacchetti is the poor quality of the writer and stupid, who missed William Shakespeare, a ghost or a demon egg from the web or Huhuhuhuhu make the dream girl) I am sorry ,. very very very very sad movie, I bought a special DVD box entitled "Possessed" by 3 different movie titled "Demons III: Ogre», «Another Hell" and "black demon" is not closed captioned, and subtitles will cost $ 14, 99 of the Best Buy store in the city of Downey. Why Lambert Bova and Dardan Sacchetti is the poor quality of a writer who makes silly movie almost like "Halloween III of" Michael Myers is not a monster, but people wear Halloween. I am I am very puzzled. I love "Demon" and "demons 2 are better boring silly »D Emons III: Ogre» is not part of "Possessed" and "demons 2" are the same demons <br /> <br /> Thanks Juan Antonio De La Torre.
