for those of you who are desperately trying to find out what happened to Twitch in the original film, here's your chance, and then come back to the real world. <br /> <br /> The guy who put the gold in the first movie Twitch said, so that he will be transferred to another prison, where the struggle champs hang around looking thoughtful. Twitch is planning to leave the prison for a month to get the gold to start a new life with his woman. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone gets shot, and the film turns into a Die Hard to another prison. But the fighter's daughter is caught up in all this, so that he and twitch to go to find it, and a woman in a twitch. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, operating below par, then there are plenty of (very annoying) rap, and poorly edited fight scene. On the positive side, he found that Hispanic guy in it, which stars in each prison / action / thriller ever made, and he closes the door on this. <br /> <br /> It is not very eventful, but at least it is harmless. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of the original, it's okay-ish stuff. <br /> <br /> If not, you have been warned.
