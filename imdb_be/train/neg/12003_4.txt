Six different pairs. Six different stories about love. Six different angles of love. Eighty number of viewers to theaters. Looking at eighty different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I'm somewhere in between, looking at the center of the screen to find out what happens in the film. All stories have not received any communication with each other, but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani is trying to show some relationship between them. I was trying to figure out a few lines I could write as a review, but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes did not find anything to write. The film is a bad copy of a Hollywood blockbuster Love Actually. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Nha watching a movie, if you really want to watch a good movie.
