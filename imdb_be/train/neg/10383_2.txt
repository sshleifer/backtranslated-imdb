It may be one of the most enjoyable films ever, if you do not take it seriously. It is a bit dated and lame effects, but it is so nice. There are giant crabs that are attacking the girl. oh, and crabs to sing in Japanese. It is surprisingly bad. And the ending, which was telegraphed throughout the film is ugly strange. Predictable, but seeing the last battle will leave you passing in his place. Do not even give this movie a chance, and you'll love it. Susan George's fun to watch and so, she is naked. Her daughter is not quite worth to put up with, but it is attacked by a giant crab. They are the size of large cats. This is a 2, but I love it. In the film, my God, but for fun, I give it a 7. I have already said, there is a giant crab?
