I created my own reality, leaving the theater, I rope my friend in this dreck will be with her mom. We (my g-friend and I) went out about an hour into it. What a load of pseudo-scientific jargon of the new age. <br /> <br /> Sat atomic particles thoughts? By taping the labels on bottles of water and blessing his Buddhist monk, he grew a little cute crystals? 25% drop in homicides in Washington occurred when a bunch of people meditating. Wow, what a rigorous scientific study. I am sure that someone ate Cheerios for four days in a row during the same period. When we come to the conclusion that consumption of Cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate? <br /> <br /> garbage, rubbish, bull pucky! <br /> <br /> BTW- It was funded by the stump of Ramtha, whose leader was one of the "experts" who were interviewed by the filmmakers. A lot of ulterior motives here, is not it?
