Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night Monday Morning <br /> <br /> The US military has just launched a major new stealth fighter, which can avoid detection unlike any other. Renegade Pilot (Steve Touissant) steals his plots and keep the US government hostage with him. Therefore, they are forced to send their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him, in exchange for his freedom from the temporary detention center where his mind had to be wiped off the entire incriminating information he has learned over the years. <br /> <br /> I missed attack forces, because I could tell from the cover, and all post-production rigging that took place, it would be crap, and if all of the negative reviews and low user rating surged into his newly confirmed I thought. But I decided to give FoF go because Shadow Man (by the same director) was not bad, and what the hell, Segal was my favorite star of action once and maybe, just maybe, he could make a great film even time. Oh, what a fool I am. <br /> <br /> dubbing, monstrous Footage stealth fighter aircraft, a terrible camera work, cheap production values, risible, inconclusive fighting, which became the trade mark in Segal and sad, sleep induces a plot that does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next film, Once in the Hood (which I will jump), apparently means the end of his contract with the Sony, it is no more of those awful films lensed European action and its subsequent Prince of Pistols may mean a return to the theater. Hell, he's done it before, and Stallone will be able to do it in front of him (Rocky Balboa). <br /> <br /> This is not a flight of Fury. It's not even fun flight. This flight, which can not even take off the ground. *
