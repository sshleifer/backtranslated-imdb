I had the opportunity to see this film as a test audience member, and the only thing that kept me in my seat had a chance to complete a questionnaire after the screening. I felt like the biggest challenge of the film was the absence of the main plot. Instead, it consisted of (too) many sub-plots competing for screen time. As a result, there is not one character that is developed enough for the audience to generate any affection. The fact that the director and the producer was not able to do was to show us why we should care what happens to the characters. In fact, any sub-plot and the characters associated with it could be removed altogether without serious damage to the film. (Time received would allow for a much-needed development of other subsidiary plots and characters.) Simply put, a plate full of hungry bachelors club side dishes and snacks, as Entre desirable.
