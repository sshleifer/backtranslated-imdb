The producer / director Stanley Kramer seen in Adam Kennedy's novel and very mysterious scenario Kennedy? There were a few pieces left on purpose? What Gene Hackman, Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What do they see this as a very chaotic history? <br /> <br /> And why Candice Bergen, who gave a terrible job, take this thankless role? <br /> <br /> The Domino Principle wants to be on the same basis as The Parallax View and The Manchurian Candidate and misses a very wide margin. The main misfire Stanley Kramer.
