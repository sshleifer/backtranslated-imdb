Deceptive advertising ... I saw an advertisement for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power, which states, "From the producer of Scarface and Carlito's Way» Lets Get IT STRAIGHT ... Michael Bergman does not make Scarface, in fact it was "room mate editing 'for scarface. Do not take away from the talent Bergman ... but, in my opinion, he should have a little more class. I think that I can talk to the masses when I say ... We hate being obviously lied. As far as the movie goes, he was poor at best. I think that Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Luis Guzmán should be ashamed of the work on this film. Overall, this film does not do a good job of filling in the blanks for Carlito's Way. It is obvious that this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather good film.
