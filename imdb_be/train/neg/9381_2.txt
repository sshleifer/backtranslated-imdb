Mona homeless living on the outskirts of French society, life without meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I watched it because of all the stellar reviews, but I'm afraid that I had missed something. Mona character has little or no personality, and drifting through life being rude to people, getting high and not contributing anything to anybody living. It is not interesting or exciting. She just useless <br /> <br /> I have seen and known a lot of people like that :. A lot of hidden meaning of what they are doing. They are just lazy slackers. I would not like mono anywhere near me, as it seeks to steal everything that is not nailed, and leave his friends in trouble. Of course, it is mysterious - because there's nothing to it. Many drug addicts, drunks and homeless people, I've seen this mysterious; I would not want to see a film about them, too. <br /> <br /> There may be something there that I totally missed. Otherwise, I believe that all comments from people who assume that anything done by French female director is high art.
