This should go down as almost one of the worst films of all time. Terrible acts terrible scenario ... and they were good times! One definitely miss! Joke, if you could call them that were so predictable to be miserable. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to distract attention from the fact that its actions in the same way as plastic! I sat ready to give him a chance in the hope that he is going to improve, which, unfortunately, is not so! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you settle for a good reading! I like Denise Richards, which is why I made this film to go, but why should she let her self be cast in this film me!
