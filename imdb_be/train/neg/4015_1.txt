a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic, as "Debbie does Dallas." Nowhere close. I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive starring in porn industry ever. Even more terrible is that it is on screen almost constantly. But I read somewhere that in those days, porn was to have a kind of "artistic" value. I could not find it, though. Check only if you are interested in the development of the history of porn into the mainstream, or can appreciate the art in porn movies. I know I'm not. But the director of the film seems to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel, to give him permission to use his song. Of course, they have rejected.
