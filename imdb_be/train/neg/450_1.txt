This show is painful to watch ... <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the authors did not have a clue what to do with the show, from the ever-changing "jobs", roommates and actors. It turns out that they wanted to throw Amanda Bynes in something ... but had no idea what it is, and came up with this shitty show. They threw her in adolescence, surrounded by twenty and thirty-something and put it in the main adult situations repeatedly unsuccessful attempts at comedy. Soon they realize that it needs to be "top" and cast people in the late 20's to try to pass as a teenager. <br /> <br /> As the show survived 4 season for me. Anyway, ABC has now decided that it is "family" show, and threw it in the afternoon all on ABC Family.
