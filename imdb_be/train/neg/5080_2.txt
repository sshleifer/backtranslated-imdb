This is an overview of the Wizard, not to be confused with the Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. Master is the end of the eighties film about the ability of seriously dumb boy playing video games and going throughout the opening credits. Wiz is unnecessary to update the Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that the guy who supplied 100 straws together and had some small drink pull with him. <br /> <br /> Now that we've got all that out of the way, let me say that it is: there's really no reason to see this movie. It's just 100 minutes Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize PowerGlove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "constructed" in the broadest sense of the word, because it seems that the film has been written over the weekend on crack team people who have never played the Nintendo, and aimed at people with less sense of style than my grandmother. Maybe when writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, they realize that they were going to shoot the general garbage, and instead of going to a vocational school to learn how to install a car stereo. <br /> <br /> I hope this was an enlightening experience for you. It sure was not for me. In fact, I think I may have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this film and write about it. The next time you shop for videos and you see Wiz, The Master and The Wizard of Oz, all sitting on a shelf in a rather small number, give them all the slip and play Duck Hunt instead.
