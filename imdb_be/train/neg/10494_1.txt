On the show Steve Irwin, he Hillarious. He was not even trying to be funny, and he just, but his film was not even what I would call a movie I mean, if this guy is trying to kill him in his car, he just said, "Oh, this is one bad guy ! and, looking straight into the camera. He put his face in the camera too! And then, when the guy drops the car, you would not expect that he's dead? And Terry was the worst acting I have ever seen! For example, if a crocodile ate almost Steve, she simply says "Steve." It may sound scary or anything, it was simply "Steve." I mean, I do not want to sound mean but it's not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin, but the film was too stupid.
