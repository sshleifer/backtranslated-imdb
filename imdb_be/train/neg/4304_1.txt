It is anti-Serb propaganda film for TV <br /> <br />. "Muslims are good, Orthodox Christian Serbs BAD.Â» <br /> <br /> This is the message. <br /> <br /> With the help of "entertainment" programs to get across a message of propaganda is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This film lays it on thick. <, Br /> <br /> and, apparently, many of the audience and reviewer of his circle. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> Serbs under the command of General Sugar Plum Milhalovitch and his Chetniks, saved more than 500 American airmen shot down by the Germans during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to give Milhalovitch and put British support for the communist Tito. Roosevelt did the example, and as a result, after the Yugoslav war was brought to the Communist Tito. <br /> <br /> And US ally Milhalovitch were blurred by the media so far. <br /> <br /> This film is part of the anti-Serb propaganda campaign designed by George Soros and the International Crisis Group (ICG), which culminated in Kosovo "war" in which NATO bombed Serbia because of the completely false claims GSI " mass graves "in Kosovo are filled with" victims "nasty Serbs. that is there were no such mass graves of Albanians (Muslims) are not dealt with, while in Serbia, Kosovo, not the fact that most of the media will not print. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie to see, because the description of one rapanovy video cover looked interesting. <br /> <br /> Imagine my disgust when I discovered that he had been tricked into renting another industry propaganda machine aimed at Serbia. <br /> <br /> Instead of this propaganda who should make a film about the unwillingness of the Clinton administration to come clean with the Congress and with the American people about his involvement in the delivery of weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I will not hold my breath waiting for this movie.
