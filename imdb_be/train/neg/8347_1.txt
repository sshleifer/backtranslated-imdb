The title should be "walker". It was just he to walk. <br /> <br /> There was nothing in the film, which was nice. Description of the film actually does not correspond to the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I can get from the film is that he was a good son, but low life horrible person. <, Br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I'm wasting their money and time in this movie. I have seen people who leave the theater in the middle of the film. I stayed in the hope that it will be better .... what a mistake. I'm even worse. <br /> <br /> If there is a suggestion that I can make it to the producer has to redirect his life in a different field, because making movies is definitely not his cup of tea
