Chopper ..... well if you like horror it is definitely one to see, otherwise not even bother.It quite obvious that this film has a very low budget, for example, it looks as if the whole movie was filmed in composition somewhere, and in many cases you will see the shadow of the boom microphone and the camera mans shadow, believe me, you do not need to look for cheese them.Also try to ignore the actor, if what you call them !! The basic scheme has a few people decided to go on a game show where they have to survive the night in a large maze, because of their 3-killer on the loose, and the one who lives at the end rich. Now, there is something about this film that keeps you looking and rarely do you find that a cheap budget horror these days, such as when I saw him I thought he has, I would'nt mind to go in this game! especially for $ 12 million. Therefore, in any case, I would recommend you look at it and make up your own mind.
