The week before, I had seen in Iowa, I saw an art school confidential, which makes a pretentious student film and can not decide if he wants to, that is the art of exploitation or forced. Iowa can be a film, which he did. I can see the elements much better films in Iowa - wrapped and Congenital Killer. However, in addition to artiness, both of these films had good character development and a coherent storyline. Iowa. This film stumbles upon an absurd end. I have to admit that it had the consistency. This film is bad from start to finish and not particularly better or worse in any part. The actors all did what they could. Ryazanov Arquette deserves better. She reveals that she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why should she show it in this turd ball.
