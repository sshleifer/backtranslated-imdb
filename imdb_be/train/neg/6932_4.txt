I waited a long time to see the DR Tarr torture dungeon, and after I watched it, I was very disappointed with this. This is not a baroque film that I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw something strange DVD) is much better than the entire film, which is well forgotten. There is not hardly stand out scenes in it and look and feel interesting, but it's not even close to other baroque films out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. Symbols dim and there is almost nothing dramatic happens, even if we see rape, crucifix, insanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The main problem with DR Tarr TORTURE Dungeon was the fact that this was a conversation-a -thon more than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted to make a film there are moments of silence or mood or something, instead we see / hear the protagonist chatter endlessly about stupid things. <br /> <br /> missed opportunity.
