Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it has no advantages whatsoever of his own name !! The full movie, zombies and vampire fighting each other once or twice. In addition, we are never quite sure if the main character in the film MUST vampire. It could be argued that they were trying to "tone it down" or make it "realistic", but in the end simply boring. More than half of the film takes place in the car. The scenes that take place in a different place is not much to brag about either. In addition, there is no clear antagonist, and in the end, you do not have any idea of ​​what really happened in the last 30 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> However, I will say that the film is a low-cost production, sound was amazing by the way, and the tool (or origonal account or selected music from other places). <br /> <br /> I'm all for independent films, but it does not look like it was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "worse than Scarecrow killer."
