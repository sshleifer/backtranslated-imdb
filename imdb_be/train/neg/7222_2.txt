Knowing Comics Enki Bilal for some time, I had to see this movie. I thought it would be a good way for an artist like Bilan, to spread their art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought it would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought that I would enjoy the view ... I was wrong! The film was a real torture to watch. The idea has the potential ... but the film leaves too much to be desired, and basically everyone who sees this film was left with the impression that he could do it better. I will not make an offer, you need to see this film or not. Chances are if you are reading this page, you've already seen it, or that you're going to see it - but be prepared for a very poor 102 minutes.
