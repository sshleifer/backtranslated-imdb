It's really awful «B» cinema. This brainless and often uncomfortable. The plot, the basic "does in show business" routine, almost non-existent. In fact, the film is just an excuse to push the war effort and to highlight some popular music group 1942, including Brother Mills, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddie slack. Each group receives a standard three-minute, with the exception of Brother Mills, who for some reason justified the two numbers. Ann Miller does not get to dance until the last few minutes of the film, and it has nothing to do but stand her stuff on the background of a flurry of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> the most interesting moment in the film, in my opinion, happened in the Duke Ellington segment. The group appears to be playing on the train, standing in an awkward position. (In the deep South while group segregated by rail when traveling.) Hodges seen next to Duke, and Harry Carney may also be identified. In the last moments of the film, trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance sent down the aisle to the camera and makes "Uncle Tom" bugging his eyes and moving his head, as Willie best done in many films. For modern audiences, especially jazz lovers, it is a tribute to the segregation boring. Some movies are better visible.
