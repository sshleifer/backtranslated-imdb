I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember my first experience with stall terrible movie with a good commercial. Commercially was great, but I later learned that it was one explosion or a "special effect" throughout the film (about 4), and even those who were not in the movie. There was some story related to foreigners, but foreigners were never actually shown in the film, as I recall. It was clear that in case someone makes a cheap dollar exclusion film is designed to scam people. I believe that my world of innocence ended that day, when I learned that there were bad people who do bad bad movies.
