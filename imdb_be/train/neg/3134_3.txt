"Fallen" comes under the waste of life (WOL) category. I am sad that I have is two o'clock older Sun entertained. Other members of my family, too, watched the film and left insulting comments on the screen and rooted for the mummy. I felt sorry for the actors (Wagner). I read the other negative reviews, and I can not add anything else in the film, except it may be reduced to 25 minutes, so that it can take 30 minutes slot on TV without losing the plot. It reminds me of a dish that has some good ingredients, but when served is bland, with no taste at all. In my humble opinion, 42 None of the mummy to be 8-10 feet and has improved the conspiracy taking mystique and replace it with a few people who want to denigh facts and want DNA samples for stupid reasons. Heroes discredited and thrown on there ear their college. Later, after it was all fucked up by evil people. Heroes to save the day and prove everybody wrong.
