I chose this one because the music was made by Hans Zimmer, Metasonix client modular synthesizer (made by someone dear to me). Jacket art says "Version 2003". <br /> <br /> I give one point for a strong female, one point for a dialogue and cheezy one last point for a light-blue eyes Meg Foster, of which there are a lot of shots. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see David MacCullum casually swimming (pool has a viewing window made of plexiglass!), while his lady love chasing crazy in Greece. <br /> <br /> Many were slightly convincing, ie houses of the rich people in LA and Mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was. I wondered how they were able to keep up with all the cleanings dust blowing. The wind was not tough enough to be believable to me. I kept thinking that the skin of the animal on the furniture to be nasty ... etc .. and realized that the movie should be pretty boring if I wonder these things, when the alleged plot unfolded. I stumbled over things like why she had to light a fire, blowing the match, and then throw the match into the fire? Dumb like. It was awkward at best. Oh, well. Robert Morley must have a bit of fun with his kooky character GEEZER and enjoyable holiday with him.
