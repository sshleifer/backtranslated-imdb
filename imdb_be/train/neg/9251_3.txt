This film, in spite of his "independent" status, a silly version of Hollywood's unbearable mother-daughter relationship. it was not so bad at first, but somewhere in the course of the film - about the time that his daughter goes to this guy, I think - it turns into a cheesey mother-daughter bonding film. Im sorry, but I do not know any mothers who have that kind of relationship with his daughter ... it's probably better that way, though.
