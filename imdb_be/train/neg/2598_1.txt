Even in a bad movie, there is usually some softening, what can you say so, it was awful, but that performance, or that part of the script, or special effect, it was just awful in every way. Action was ridiculous, horrible scenario, complete with many unexplained breakfast at Tiffany's references, and even special effects were poor at best. It was a very bad film and one that even Drew Barrymore wish was erased from history. Look, if you want to: a) suffer from severe self-inflicted pain. b) Look how bad a movie can be. This is one movie where I can use the clich√© "there are ninety minutes of my life I will never go back" with some reservations!
