Boy, it was a lousy movie! While I have not seen all the collaboration Burton / Taylor, I can confidently say that this is the worst. This rich, but a sick woman (Taylor, of course) belongs to this wonderful island in the Mediterranean, dominating the tie-up-on an employee if it is suddenly visited by the traveling poet, mouth platitudes. In fact, the whole movie just talk the festival, a large part of the conversation, not making any sense. Even in 1968, no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense, and over time makes it even more clear. If it were not for the beautiful scenery and a movie, it would deserve a negative rating. The only thing that this movie is good for the unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars.
