Carl Panzram residential amazing life and scribbled down his memoirs on scraps of paper for perhaps the only person who ever did something unselfish for him. The book Â«Panzram: Journal of Murder" Thomas E. Gaddis and James A. Long, released much of the century Panzram after death, giving the historical context of the account of the first generation of Americans run away from home to go to the west and to be a cowboy, gets caught, thrown into the boy's home , escape several times and thrown in jail again and again, constantly getting tortured and raped. As Panzram grew huge and strong, he sought revenge for the damage caused to him as he had been in South America, Europe and Africa, and it does not matter that the people whom he raped, robbed, or killed, because we are all the same useless. <br /> <br /> This film throws skinny James Woods as a rough neck, medium ass son of a bitch Carl Panzram that the film is "drunk", overly dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of rape men and boys. The film is neither elaborates on anything else especially notes about the world traveler and prisoner career (eg, robbing former President Taft or the release from prison of Oregon until such time as he gave his word to return). In short, I do not think Charles would have been happy.
