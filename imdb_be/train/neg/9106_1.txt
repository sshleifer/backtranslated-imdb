From the opening scene, you'll notice how hard they tried to imitate a very intelligent and powerful "Cruel", and how he landed flat. You will also notice that they have made a terrible choice by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then in the second stage, you will meet two best things about this film, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers, Katherine and her mother. That is, if you can get past the fact that Catherine was a blonde in the first movie ... Then the film goes, you see a cheap romance with miles back, and you will notice, Sebastian has already met Anette in the past, is called Danielle, and Cecil, here called Sheri ... How original, that for the prequel. Then he turns into a low budget type of "Wild Things" movie with lots and lots of oh-my "twists". As I have said, Robin Dunn was a very poor choice. Not that he's a bad actor, it is well .. He just has no Charisma Ryan did. Amy Adams, who, in my opinion, one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again delivers. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way it was possible to keep this junk. In general, this "film" feels "Beverly Hills, 90210" episode. The score was stolen from "severe" and "Jawbreaker" ... Yes, they used the expense of Jawbreaker ... could not they at least leave that one alone! You want to go through it. If you want more cruel, watching Dangerous Liaisons by Stephen Frears.
