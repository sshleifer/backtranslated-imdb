Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand more than Ben Stiller. As this person has the right to even make movies for me. I can not understand how it happens, when I was spending at work, how it works in the movies, I quit and I have a company ..... I would dismiss themselves. GOD! This film was just an ordinary, steaming, stinking pile of poo, which should be vapoorized, when it was possible. Something else I have to say that the management of about 10 lines of text in the comment idiotic. What happened to just say something about the film? I'll never understand why sites require a short novel written as a short comment sometimes all that is needed.
