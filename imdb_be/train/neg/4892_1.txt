they have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> well. First, I do not doubt that, but after seeing the wayward clouds, I changed my mind and finally convinced that they have sex with watermelons, people, living or dead. NO safe sex, of course. (Terribly ugly) leading man shoots all the women in his mouth after he made a dead woman. You never heard of HIV? I think not. <br /> <br /> rest of the movie is mainly boring, but incredibly disgusting. in fact, in some parts it was so disgusting, I could not take my eyes off of virgins. sex with dead people! how gross is that? and that the message behind all this? we need water, we need the melon, we have to be dead to have sex? I'm sorry, but that's no good!
