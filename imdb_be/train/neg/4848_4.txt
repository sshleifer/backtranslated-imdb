I love a good movie about the war, and I fall into the "been there, done that" category. So I'd like to think my review is accurate (IMHO). Just watched this movie on DVD, I can say with certainty that it was a pile of garbage. There is no way I can recommend this film for you. <br /> <br /> He started with me screaming at the TV saying "you would not do it" and so on ... but I soon realized that having a bit with work experience would be an obstacle, so I chilled bit. But in the first scene, when the trailer wheel fell I got an uneasy feeling that this film will predictably hopeless ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There just was not any logic to the EOD scenes, I just know that the army team had some of the rebels, most patients when something on the other end command or remote start. So much so that I left scratching my head all the time. Then, just when you think you know where the story will be the guys in the Humvee off on their own to ride in the desert. One of the most valuable assets in the theater with Jolly bumping into some wannabe contractor SAS. <br /> <br /> sniper scene was so ridiculous. He just does not make sense at all, and I wanted to turn off there and then. Then for them to get him so long to actually check my patience.It began with "Contact RightÂ» and has gone down hill fast. If you have a Brit accent, then you got shot, but if you were part of the EOD team suddenly you were a big shot and saved the day. Then, just as you thought of him inexplicably delayed for a long time without adding anything to the story at all. You just left to look and ask why he had not ended? <br /> <br /> Then we had a drink the stage where they just beat each other on laugh..another scene where you just wanted it to end. It adds nothing to the film. <br /> <br /> Then, just as my life seemed very boring out the main star of the wire to hunt someone down. This most be the most ridiculous scene that I have ever watched. He defied all logic and the ability to write a good story ... it was senseless and horrible. I still do not understand why they wasted time on him. Then see how it just runs through the busy streets, which are sent back to the camp, I was rolling on the floor laughing. Pure comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this story throughout the show without really decide what he wants to be. I thought it would be stupid illogical EOD scene, but then it kept going off on trying to be involved in something else. But as hard as he tried it just bored me to death. All I wanted it to end. It was a messy collection of stupid scenes mixed in a batch of stupid, meaningless actions (MIGHT) scene. <br /> <br /> There's no way I can recommend. Maybe my experience in jeopardy enjoyability even naive to understand this just does not make sense. The only thing more stupid than this film is artificially inflated IMDb rating ... to be a 24/7 job box office PR-team, who seem to use this site as a way to get everyone to think that it was good. Unfortunately ... people just do not have! <br /> <br /> We do not recommend ... it will just bore you.
