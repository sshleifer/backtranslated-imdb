I read the book, and the book was fascinating. <br /> <br /> This film is the direction, script and acting are completely intolerable. I cringed in the absence of a script that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity and courage, to illustrate the folly of the greatest, perhaps, the fact-based story. <br /> <br /> I can see why this movie was never released to the general public in most cities. I will not ever recommend this film to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> Just one of the worst I've seen it adaptations, the story turns into a sky less research on the ground. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was really the only event. But how could this fail when taken in a beautiful country like Peru. <br /> <br /> For potential viewers, do not waste your time and energy on this flop.
