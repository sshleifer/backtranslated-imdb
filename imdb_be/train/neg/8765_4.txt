I saw this film with some Indian friends for Christmas. A brief review of this film should be avoided. JP Dutta wrote, director, producer and editor of the film, and did none of these jobs well. <br /> <br /> The film is about trying to Pakistan in 1999 to capture a portion of the disputed region of Kashmir from India, presumably based on the fact, you will be prompted with this film challenges the Indian Army had to capture the area from Pakistan troops - who occupied high positions. But instead of saying that there must be convincing and heroic history, all this movie does is make the Indian military look ridiculous and stupid, I know that's not true. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with almost all the Indian audience, who were very patriotic and would clearly like this film, but found herself laughing at scenes that were not meant to be funny. <br /> <br /> script was absolutely abysmal. This creates the impression that Mr Dutt does not know anything about how the army operates and uses bad films about the war for reference. The result is a script, which is headless and repeats. <br /> <br /> operates most leaders was not stellar, but given the script they were given, I find it hard to criticize them too much. As for the supporting cast, all I can say is that I hope that they were lovers. <br /> <br /> Editing was also very bad. It was quite difficult to follow what is going on for a long time, and the music suddenly ends in a scene changes <br /> <br /> Good things :. The cinematography was pretty good, although it was a little hurt by the fact that the film does not seem to fix the color (color balance often varied considerably within the scene). In addition, several songs that were in the movie were quite nice - during the first half dozen or so poems, at least. Unfortunately, they have gone a lot longer than they should be. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This disorder FOUR HOURS LONG. There is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1.5 - 2 hours to film that was filmed. Unfortunately, a good editor did not work on this film.
