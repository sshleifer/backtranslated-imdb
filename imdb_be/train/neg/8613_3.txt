I almost cried watching this film. Do not laugh, but the memories of the great Rodney Dangerfield film. Candyshack was his first and stole the film, easy money have him at his best, and Back To School Today 80th classic masterpiece. Then there was a ladybug, and that when he began to show. Poor Relatives grew old (Meet Wally Sparks was a small step from the ladybugs, but is not saying much). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Wives Kin plays Mont (the name he should love, as it was his name on the Easy Money) rich (or always it is) a guy who loves a woman and marries her anything. Well now it inherits a huge piece of land and because the land was administered by the Amish, it inherits the 5 wives. It sounds like a great idea for a movie Dangerfield. The problem is everything. The script is so poor that Rodney seems to say its one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing in common. The film looks like it was shot on video with some very bad stunt sequences, which are obviously not a native. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who looks like he's dying to say the word F (that he should from the movie Rated R, but played as if it was PG) and Jerry Stiller has a good 2 minute cameo. Do not get me wrong, I sometimes laugh at some jokes Rodney, but have become too old and too slow. We can see that his jokes are coming from miles away. And the film is too PC, thanks to the monstrous 1990s, '70s and' 80s, Rodney just does not work anymore.
