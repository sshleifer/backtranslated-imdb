This German film from 1974 that has something to do with some of the women who come to the castle, and besides, I can not tell you, their purpose, or even the fact that the purpose of the film. I can tell you that there are some women who also moonlight as a maid in this castle, which will relieve, put on the paint of the body and coiled at Bong, as they were in Goth Kit-Kat Klub, though, and it seems , a good part of the execution of this film. Yes, there seems to be something devoutly to the devil and vampires, and there's some girl on girl stuff and so on, but the focus seems to be baby pictures spinning away in the cellar. I did, but as his eyes rolled one of the main housekeeper / supporters of the devil, who lent authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more angry look. It was Wanda Evil lesbian (as an expense in the credits)? Whatever. If you are not too picky about his lesbian outline Worship movie, you can have it, otherwise it's pretty boring stuff, and I could not even finish it, I was so sad. 3 of 10.
