Given his pedigree, it should be much more enjoyable movie than that. Even with his lips spanking collection of eccentrics in the cast - that supporters entirely willing to provide a film that combines Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Zhingold? - all events dully paced, melancholy shot and, most often, brainless <br /> <br /> Kim Novak gifts were essentially comic, as she continued to confirm in Kiss Me Stupid .. James Stewart was a great comedian as he ably demonstrated in movies with Harvey from Philadelphia history. I think it comes out better from this disorder than anyone else. Except, maybe, the cat.
