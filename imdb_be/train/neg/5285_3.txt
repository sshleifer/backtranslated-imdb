Somewhere on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of Jane Austen, you just need to read them. I agree with that. Nevertheless, we love the device of great literature and current writers strike suggests that without good writers, it is difficult for the actors to bring their roles to life. The current version of Persuasion by Jane Austen shows us what happens when you do not have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare with the version 1995 with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which is well operated and maintained the essence of the era, and restrictions on the characters (except for a bizarre parade and kissing in the street scene in the bathroom), version 2007 shows Twitty Anne, who seems angst-ridden. The rest of the characters are not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austin could write such wonderful characters with some carefully selected unproven. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel completely threw himself, and Mrs. Smith, bedridden and ruined classmate Anne goes to the bathroom - - chirping away, as many of the characters seemed to do. Strength of character and intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which led Anne loves it, first of all, it seems, should not be written to Rupert Penry-Jones Wentworth. Ciar√°n Hinds was more substance, and was able to convey a lot more with a look than the P-J was able to do with his poses. In general, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel to purposely spin, costume melodrama debatable value. If they wanted our modern emotional extravagance to the work of Austen, they had to do what they do with the screen adaptations of Shakespeare: to adapt it to the present. At the very least, "Bride and Prejudice" was derived from historical and settings and the location of it was interesting to watch as it was "Clueless." It was not a conviction, but they did not know what else to call it.
