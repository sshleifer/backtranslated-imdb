I can not believe that people think that this stinking pile of garbage was ridiculous. Attempts to change a joke among the cruelty and stupidity of disgust, "There's something about Mary" leaves little reason to stay until the end. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very beautiful, but it will never be enough to save the film. Ben Stiller tries his best to work within the framework of the story, and obviously very talented, but the film is a loser. <br /> <br /> I was not just some of the scenes believable. Shots were poorly timed and poorly decorated. Brothers Farreley should be kept away from making films at all costs. I check the IMDB, to see that they work exactly the way I know to avoid <br /> <br /> 2/10. bonus one time I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone, in my opinion. My wife hates it, too. The next day we saw the "Rush Hour" and laughed themselves silly. This film is just smelly.
