Oh, it's so bad it's funny. The only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that led to the resolution, to make a film just for fun. I mean, you can see the topless porn actresses, sex, and then killed the man mutants. There is a lot of gore, including the classic "something wrong with her, oh no, that's half the person she used to" and random murder, causing panic. But you can also find funny things like bowel continues through someone's ass and a guy working in the woods, then find themselves beheaded wire tied between two trees (making metal doiiing sound then, like in the cartoons). Then there is a market for people who are outside the scope of pornography, they really need to know what's inside of the actress, just the sexual organs are not enough. Thus, you can see a lot of short autopsy on the dead girl only. NO there is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey really small pieces, and I really wonder what Richard wanted Creek, taking part here. I think this is a movie you need to watch by clicking on the fast forward and look only juicy stuff, just to remind grade horror movies of old C.
