Hearing such praise about this game, I decided to see if I bumped into him on the cable. I do not see how this «elivates» women and their "struggle", focusing on the topic. I think if you have an interest in the history of the private parts of women and how it affects their lives, then this is for you. Otherwise, it is pretty dull and boring. Anyway, I found it a little humiliating. <br /> <br /> I asked a female friend who also watched it, and she thought it was awful as well. Thus, it is not just a guy "does not get it."
