I felt mine was while watching this ... but it seems to me that the reason of insanity runs in the family in this film. Not that that makes a lot of sense in any case, as already mentioned, it was one of the last films Karloff and this is just his presence is a screen that gives it any credibility at all. It's sad that all the great legends of horror movies in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low-class trash like this. Slightly, Boris did get off a little better than poor old Bela Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris is doing everything possible and give him credit for trying to carry out this mess together. Poignant background music does not help, and distracts from any conscious moment. Besides Boris, the rest of Mexican gypsum duplicated to some amazing cut, English monotone reminiscent of the type used in porn films late seventies. <br /> <br /> Under the assumption that I think is Edgar Allen Poe in "The House of Usher," which is taken from, but you would be hard to find a lot of Poe in the finished product. <br /> <br /> However, there are much better movies out there with Boris Karloff in his best, to look for them and to give it a wide berth, unless you want to curse "shrinking of the brain," too!
