I watched this movie for a long time (about 10 years or so), and liked it then. I remembered the other day and decided to see it again. The second time was not pleasant. Valid "yes, yes", the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> Then ... I'm sure it was not a stretch for the actresses to play these characters. The plot is ... there's no way in hell these women would get away with the first robbery is much less than 2. (Side note: Why TT do not realize that even if it came with a load of money on it, they will ask the court date, where she got it and she would have no logical answer Dean, Dean ... we have a cheater!). It's awful stereotypes black women, saying basically that the only way black women can "beat the system" and get a large amount of money was stolen, and not to use their intelligence, or other resources. He plays too much sympathy b / c they all die in the end (Jada bar), but it is not sad (you think, "They were so stupid that they deserve to die). You just do not really care about the characters if you are not a small man. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this film rates for 5.
