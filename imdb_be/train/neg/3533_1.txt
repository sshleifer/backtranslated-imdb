Let this film is the death knell for the "big twist" film brought to the 1990s. Known in some circles as a Kyser Soze syndrome, this cinematic sleight of hand has now been done to death M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation of the mind. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna"), uses much more silkily Soze motive manner. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with a rather dubious hair) stars as Jack Green (known to all as "Mr. Green.") He may or may not be criminal mastermind Mr. Gold. Or maybe Mr. gold annoying spirit that may have members of the underworld. I am, but I'm not sure, of course, not all the same. REVOLVER is one of the most congested examples of cinematic excess I had the displeasure to experience in a long time. witness the broken structure of the time, painful jump cuts, a constant internal monologi- and painfully pret entsyozny animated sequence. This "everything and the kitchen sink" style of direction makes the work of Quentin Tarantino appear balanced. The cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that Richie was sad to tell this banal story, as I watched it. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with moments of revelation which supposedly shocking, but they only come as news to Mr. green. I would like, as green as I always like to Stratham as a character, which is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, however, he and all the forces together, as a procedural reader in the class of the University of English literature. His lack of wit is matched only incontinence shown his nemesis, Urine (Ray Liotta). Feasting at the scenery, like a starving man at a buffet, Liotta spits, crying, and smoke through the film in an awkward display replays and leopard print swimming trunks. <br /> <br /> There's no redeeming qualities for a revolver. This is another cinematic faux pas by Ritchie and may even surpass his wretched remake swept away as his worst film yet.
