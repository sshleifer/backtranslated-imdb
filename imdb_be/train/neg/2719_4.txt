If a small portion of the space age silly putty land on the ground soon starts to consume Earthman and gain weight. Only part of this senseless stuff, what I liked was all the cool classic cars. This dog has so many holes could be cut and sold for Swiss cheese. This thing actually made $ 20 million? And McQueen's salary was 3K? All were greatly overpaid. "Monster" is very similar to a large rattle and "adolescents" looked as if they could have children approaching their teens years. And these blasts from a shotgun; It sounded like a pellet rifle with a silencer. The ending pitifully banal; Obviously, the manufacturers had to leave the door open to continue .... and there were many. Thumbs down.
