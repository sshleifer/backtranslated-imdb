I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is attractive, appealing and talented actress. I'm sure it would be a good movie had something happened to him. Nothing doing. This is a short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I looked through the remaining 20-plus minutes. . Painful <br /> <br /> Freeman plays the actor - who has not worked in a while - exploring part he could play as a clerk at the supermarket checkout. He visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing happens. She decides to give him a ride home, and they go to Arby's, Target, car wash. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Ever. <br /> <br /> I do not understand. But I do not get clicks, Bill Murray, "Lost in Translation" and "Broken Flowers." If you like these movies, you might like it. Many people find movies like this quirky, charming, or - for reasons which escape me - to find an exciting dialogue. Total device in the films of this kind should have a LONG taking property / silence after the actor utters a line that is supposed to make sense. We know that sense because it goes two minutes on the screen nothing. Unfortunately, I have to be a wimp. I do not understand. For me, these kinds of movies are not funny or charming, or reflections. They are simply boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. A lot of drama. A lot of stress. A lot of laughs. A lot of uncertainty. No action. Nothing to look at. In short, none of the things that I do not go to the movies for. I can miss free. I see wonderful / whimsical characters in real life. I go to the goal, and fast food restaurants, and car wash. These elements do not film, even if the stars do this stuff. I'm paying to be entertained. <br /> <br /> If you are crazy about Morgan Freeman and just wanted to hear him ramble on about anything, have fun. If you want to drool over Paz Vega, you can watch and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. In total snoozefest.
