The film is boring, the characters and scenarios unreal, incredible, hilarious action. This film is a big mess. It seems that if the music acts feet in the impressive stunt work. Or voice dubbed by Mr. McGregor and Steven sang too much, and it changed his voice. There is too much dialogue in this movie, and really bad acting on behalf of all. The film is a lovely sleep therapy. Fighting is ridiculous. Effect of change in shape of the eye to the evil drug addict women's designer was decent. The main villain was a joke, and his character was poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through the interrogation, he'd just throw random sites such as (spoiler) Â«CTX (his designer drugs) will be in the water supply," which never refers to the conclusion or even mentioned again in the film. This film is highly recommended to go through.
