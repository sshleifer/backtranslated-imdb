It is very sad, obviously tiring Exorcist rip-off featuring a Doberman with bloodshot eyes - is the degree of special effects in this song is made for television. Tilt about the same as a live toy chewing. Very 70's dress and music just add to the torture. If you put you to sleep almost as fast as the "disappearance of the corpse", or «The Blue Hand». Virtually nothing. MooCow says eaghhh a smelly dog! : = 8P
