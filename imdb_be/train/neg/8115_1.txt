This film was the most horrible movie watching experience I have ever had to endure, and what's worse is that I had to look, and it was not possible to stop him, because he was in school! It must be admitted that the story was decent ... but I found the acting is terrible! The exception was Marian Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was great. It was the only event without her, I doubt that I would be able to bear to watch a movie. Every time I hear someone say «daarling» I crawl! I was almost attacked by a client the other day, because they said that "it". It made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life! <br /> <br /> (I'm sorry if it offended anybody, I just express his opinion)
