Well, TiVo records it because Angelina Jolie. It was 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. She went downhill fast. <br /> <br /> There are many replays, even with Angelina. She is about 20 and play 16-year-old. There are three characters that have to be Italian. All other Italian- American. Local Italian accents were good, I thought. Young male lead cute, my wife says. Everyone else in the film thick Italian woman. Even men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that, when Dick Van Patten was cast as Randy doctor that it was a bad sign. Two pairs chasing their children around like four Italian puppets. <br /> <br /> My wife will not let go of the remote control. I hope she did not take makeup, clothing and decorating tips. He was sick and twisted combination of disgusting and catchy. It was hidegarishous. <br /> <br /> cut my left ventricle was not enough to distract from the pain to watch this movie. If the movie appears on the TV screen, do yourself a favor and head to ram through the TV screen instead. You'll be glad you did. The only film I've ever seen, it was worse than it was «Hamburger: The Movie». Or maybe, "Deadly Friend".
