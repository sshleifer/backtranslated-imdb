It is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80-hit. It is set in the modern day, as we see base in Afghanistan destroyed by a drone right at the start. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly where the film jumps the shark. UAVs are not armed. They might be, but I do not think that's ever tried to really. We will see the computer that has planned this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are familiar with the "hacker" Will Farmer (he is good chemistry and electronics, which does not make him a computer hacker) & his love interest, Annie) & Will's first attempt to break not only the complete failure of its IP-address is also included and Annie guessed who it It was. We also meet Wills mother, who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Wills to take money from your bank account neighbors (Mr. Massude) not hack (it helped him to create an account), then we get a nod back to the original film, where they decide to play against global thermonuclear war and they play The Dead Code. Next Ripley office is closed at Will, but Massude computer because all the evidence they gathered was useless against his will. <br /> <br /> That is why Ripley shut down the machine Will not explained (he only plays online games?) and also why he felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity he lived around the block as well. Why a counter terrorism agency will consider this as a viable goal is very doubtful. As for Ripley activating your mobile phone? I think that no, it was not connected to the PC, and the message will not play if he really did not answer the phone, so there is more bad "hacking" science there too. <br /> <br /> Ripley agents come home Massude in, grab him, and Will gets an envelope, which is obtained contain a lot of money. It will search for the CLP, which took Massude not "hack" as you've never seen him break into the DMV computer. Ripley agents that capture Dennis at the airport as he searches for freedom has no right to arrest or detain him. mother Will not "steal chemical agents & Bio» either. And even if they did not have the right to arrest or detention of Denis. Patriot Act or not. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Will is worried about arrested for any crime in Canada, as its completely different country with different laws in the United States. <br /> <br /> the computer has gone rogue and all action taken against his will, his mother, and Dennis was not sanctioned by the government agency. Phone cracker we see did it first show any hacking skills in a movie, we also get a hack in Ripley, which seemed too light for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> «Man», who ruled in Annie at the airport and also watched them in the street did not have anything to do with Ripley and ridiculous notion that Ripley can track a cell phone while underground was also on -durnomu, as well as the idea that the computer reads lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film when they mention Stephen Falken as a system designer Ripley replaced Joshua Project. We find that "man", which collided with Annie Falken (original actor did not play boring), who faked his own death. <br /> <br /> We can also see the WOPR as "something that is going to help," they beat Ripley and they have kept the same voice that used then. Falken and WOPR are destroyed too quickly after a little used (the same explosion to kill Will, Annie and Russian. It is also unlikely that they would have to create a self-contained computer system that has the ability to Nuke or drop chemical weapons the country she works with. < br /> <br /> as a whole "deactivation" story and the idea is absolutely incredible. Such orders have to go through the President or the Joint chiefs of Staff. So that is another ridiculous and unbelievable idea. <br /> <br /> IP-stuffer against Ripley made Will not he the lki contacts one of his friends, which provides and implements the idea. It's too funny that Will would get a login only from the growth in operating Ripley temperature. With Joshua ~ d as a backdoor in Ripley (especially after he was blown to pieces ) is unbelievable excuses and cries with a very desperate writer who had no ideas are not left, and wanted to see this movie over and done with. <br /> <br /> There are awfully good, where Ripley Y plays Dead code, and we see a countdown (say 17 minutes), and then Ripley says "Dezak tyvatsyya for 30 minutes "as shit is that, if they can not even keep up with your timer? Ripley attack mission against Philadelphia terminated (too easy, in my opinion), and he decides to attack Joshua in the internal circuits and redirects missile aimed Philly to Washington, where Ripley is deployed. nuclear exchange idea to do a rip to see what it does will not work (of course, she already knows, when it was Joshua Insider her, as he had already learned this lesson in the original film?) Another nod back the original film. <br /> <br /> their pretense at having Ripley repeat the same Joshua words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how much the original ideas that they could not come up with. <, Br /> <br /> If you want to point the finger at bad ideas stolen and people are to blame Randall Badat and Rob Kerchner. This is a terrible movie, and are best avoided.
