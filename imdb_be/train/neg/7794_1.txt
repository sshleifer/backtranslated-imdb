This film is god awful. Not one quality to this film. One would have thought that the blood will be fine, but it sucks badly. Effects worse and acts, if you can call it work is the worst I have ever seen. This film was obviously filmed on a video camera and runs on a budget of around $ 500, probably. If you want to see a good zombie movie than watch Dawn of the dead, or Day of the Dead. If you want to see a good cheap shot on video zombie movie like this, but it is much better than watching Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this film at all costs. It is pointless and unwatchable. You have been warned. I have nothing to say about this stupid movie.
