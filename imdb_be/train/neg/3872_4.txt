The film never becomes unbearable to watch. And to say it right, it has nothing to show anything, except, perhaps, some sexual Alicia Silverstone in botany without sexual nature disclosure rather sexy. The story is very easy to follow and there is nothing to follow - you can see anyway. There's no waiting, a little action, incomprehensible dialogue, poor sensibility, the same sad place and very mild. Kevin Dillon is absolutely useless. Silverstone ... well, I did not concentrate too much on her actions, I confess. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, when one has nothing to do other than watch a movie, it will not look so bad. 4/10
