The film itself is so pathetic. It reflected the deaf man, as cynical in relation to the fact that people hear. However, some people are afraid to meet deaf people hear, but they do not necessarily angry as character Marly Matlin has been throughout history. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance like Matlin made. In general, the film itself is sadder than deplorable. It is so sad that I would like to believe that this insomnia cure the film. If I have trouble sleeping, I can just pop in children with Lesser God and watch. It will put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Note this deaf guy talking.
