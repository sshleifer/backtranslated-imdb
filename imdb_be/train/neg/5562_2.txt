This unpleasant film has little to recommend it. Dolph Lundgren gives an idea that it is better than any of this script or any other of his films actions allowed. And there are occasional fragments of dialogue, who believe that the film might have been able to provide some insight into the strange subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. Motivation or dull or trite. Most of the action is the subpar. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And it goes without delight director with a focus on baked distraction. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who the audience for this film.
