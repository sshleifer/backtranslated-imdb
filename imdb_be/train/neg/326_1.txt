This early Adam Sandler movie could be compared with his life as a comic in the same period in 1989. Its constant recognition of the character of his comic genius and hidden frustration at the humorous material seems to come more from Sandler, than the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as Big Daddy, or even trite Billy Madison. Unfortunately, Sandler has not yet found a way to express themselves in a consistent, successful and funny, if this film was made, as well as his character. Most of the film "joke" comes with Sandler pogovoriva with themselves, as a rule, on his comic talent unrecognized and beat themselves, because it is too ugly and can not get a woman. The film is hard to watch, too, because it does not treat like a real movie. Sandler speaks to the camera and the viewers across the film, often referring to a low budget movie or questionable content. The film ultimately uncomfortable and embarrassing to watch. I just wanted to forget I even seen the film after it was over, afraid that if more learned about this, he would destroy his career Sandler. Pass this one up in the video store, I rented it for free, and it was also a waste of time.
