As a supporter of Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series to be completely stupid idea about them. Vampire Bill is not very good looking, and looks much older than those described in the book. I found that they did have a surprisingly colorful characters seem to be very well known and vulgar. One of the things I liked about the book that, despite all the shit that she's going through Suke always a lady, and yet in the series it does not seem to be that at all. Not only this, but as shown in a series of television prejudice is not as widespread in the books. I did not expect an exact copy of the book, but I at least expected the feeling they can be used for the series.
