<br /> <br /> At the end of my show "Trance» or «The Eternal», or what the manufacturers call this film, I thought to myself, "Of all the bad movies that I could see, I could not, at least, I saw that was interesting? "Even if the film is not very well done in terms of acting, directing, writing, or what have you, it can at least be fun, and so you should. But not only this film is bad in artistic value, it is incredibly boring. For such subtleties portion, it moves very slowly, with little drama. At least in the base trying to entertainment, the death of the characters could be cool and / or mountains, but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well. <br /> <br /> What makes this film has going for it? Virtually nothing, if you do not get the fun of watching Christopher Walken, which is able to be brilliant, to put so little effort into his acting, he falls into self-parody mode (why he decided to make this film anyway?). <, Br /> <br /> I give this film 3/10, because God help us, there was actually worse than the films made earlier.
