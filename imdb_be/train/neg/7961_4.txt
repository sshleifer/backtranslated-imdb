Five years after the original Creepshow, even worse horror sequel written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. At this time, there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is not really original or different either. The first story is a basic horror sample scene on a wooden Indian statue seeks revenge against the killers of their respective owners. Effects are very careful in this story, but it's just too good to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play older shopkeepers. The second story, "The Raft", a story by Stephen King. It is about four teenagers who unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon the children screaming for their lives as a watery blob makes each of them without any reason. However, instead of being in suspense, children are burdened with bad dialogue and slack-headed behavior prevents us from really care about what happens next. There are also some unintended humor in this segment. The third and final story "Hitchhiking", which is actually RETREAD re-adapted for Creepshow 2. original story, Lucille Fletcher, was shot in 1953 as a film noir suspension. Then it was adapted for the famous episode of Twilight Zone with Inger Stevens. "Hitch-traveler" works best from these three proposals, but it is not without its problems too. Chiles plays a cheating husband, ending a run of hitchhiking, so she thinks. However, we do not know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her. Like many middle stories of this kind, the characters exist only to tell stories with his twists and turns. Wrapped around the story of hooligans, it seems a bit out of place. Savinykh those acts as "creep" in the party. The good thing is, there were no more than extensions. * 1/2 out of 4 stars.
