This is not art, it's the inner city, politically correct propaganda! political intolerance Zhindabayn appears for the unforgivable ... he does not see people as individuals, but rather as members of categories. <br /> <br /> This is the patronizing approach of the Australian movie I can remember, ever (and it is to against some pretty tough competition!). Movie posts, each a trivial topic of favorite fashionable left there: the natives sacrifice; white people aggressive or alcohol; White women are not so bad -particularly, if they are lesbians - but they are likely to depressive character <br /> <br /> Four men who go off fishing, find the body of a murdered woman (natives naturally ,. ) and leave it in the river for a few days, while they catch a trout. It is a strange decision taken with virtually no discussion, as if people are animals. One man, who briefly expresses objection is Goody ... we know that it's because he lives with a bisexual woman - he likes to keep his child a lot - and in the end becomes more fashionable rib location (away from all the brutal bush dwellers). <br /> <br /> This is a film made by these fashionable citizens, who live in fear of the Australian landscape and evil goons who live inside. This ignorance of the country's life is almost as shocking as his contempt. The film is riddled with long-distance views of the bush with the support of foreboding, mysterious music. It is very clear to the end, that Aborigines are the only ones in the house in this landscape. Finally, painfully implausible scene black and white reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In Zhindabayn life of the country is reduced to little more than a backdrop for history, which implicitly states the preference values ​​of the enlightened leftist urban residents through the other Australian. <br /> <br /> This film was not made by people with real jobs, but funded by the Film Finance Corporation Government. It is the product of a set of ambitious, soulless emptiness that filled the beautiful people for whom lavish state funding supports these patronizing offensive projects (which are divorced from real life as much as possible), and does not really make popular movies people want to see. It does not matter if the movie is a bitch, they still get paid. <br /> <br /> Save yourself from the time-wasting, avoid it like the plague. More jaded social commentary than the actual entertainment, this film deserves to pan!
