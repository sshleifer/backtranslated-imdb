Wow, I can not believe that people think it is a "good" movie. Now, I've seen much worse, but there is much more romantic / funny comedy with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre film at best. While the action was not terrible, but not great for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, a little romance. There were many loose ends that are not found or are not considered. Unfortunately, the main characters really come off as full of cowards. They do not know themselves well enough to realize that they do not like the people they deal with. How do we know that they do not love each other? To complete lack of remorse, both characters have for what their finances. I can think of few things more romantic than a permanent escape from the obligations that these two shows. <br /> <br /> The film does not even end with the wedding scene, more likely, both will get cold feet and falling for each other, like a hot potato once the obligation is approaching. This film is really about two people who can not commit to anything, unlike previous characters Cusack, who were more than willing to make deep affection (Lloyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). <br /> <br /> greatest failure of this film was a complete absence of any twists turns, or anything of interest. When the movie ended, I felt that they did not include the culmination of history, which basically corresponds to all of the film: boring. A lot of uncertainty about whether or not going to end up with two, no joy, if they do not, no consequences for their actions. HN <br /> <br /> It is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie, they simply prohibit any criticism with the "All too cynical!". Criticism of the film is not cynicism, just impartial examination. There are many other more romantic comedies, even those with Grace Kelly and Eva Marie Saint <br /> <br /> If you think that this movie is great, try these movies, you will blow up the heart :. Princess Bride, Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping the Faith, Charade, rear window, north by northwest, or There's Something About Mary (which is a good study of the idealized romance against modern society).
