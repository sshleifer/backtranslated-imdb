This movie was the worst film ever made in the world, I love Barney more than this film. The graphics suck, half animated film, sucking death, and above all, that I was ready to sue the people who made this film! Do not waste HOURS OF YOUR LIFE watch this movie. The only good part was when the movie ended *******! The film Jurassic Park, 50 percent, .1 percent saber-toothed, and 49.9 percent DUMB! Please do not waste your time watching this film, you will regret it.You want to know why this movie sucks? Well, cover sucked, sucked on a graph, the blood looked (I mean), ketchup, people have tried to blow himself up, college students think that everything that can stand up to the animal. I mean, there was 5 feet. Tiger running straight at the woman, she throws a spear at him from 100 feet away! Wait until you can actually hit it! Action was awful too. Jurassic Park is really a good movie and it just had to go and spoil it.
