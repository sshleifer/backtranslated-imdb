I found this movie to retail OOP-x. And it certainly is one of the PLO. A year later, after The Exorcist she was back in business with this film, but what we all new that Blair's career never broke out, it never became a mega-star. This is one reason's, many of her movies object-oriented programming. It gives a good performance in this film. It is about rejecting not confess her parents and have no friends. Played under the age of 15 years, playing a girl of 14 years, it's ridiculous. The film is also known scenes of rape in the showers they stick a broom up her virginity. In most editions of this cut, why, I do not know, no blood is involved, well, Blair example naked, but nothing is displayed, NO T & so did offend people. But the film is slow, very slow. He was not happy, fine for me, but I almost fell asleep. It's just that 14-year-old becomes a rebel against society, but not the flow of blood or gore nothing. Why it is classified in the horror it is still amazing to me. If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it, otherwise leave it as it is.
