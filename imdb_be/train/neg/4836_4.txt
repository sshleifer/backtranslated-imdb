This shows the drama of life in the war. In my experience as a serious movie thriller "addicted" guy, I missed this flick that gets my eyes and mind stuck on the screen. One of the things that must be present in the film in order to, I think it is good is the ability to immerse the audience in the cinema of reality and time. This did not happen with me. I remained "conscious" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I think that this film got its place in glory on the basis of the "unconscious" the attractiveness of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but entirely adequate use as a movie fame generator. More than a movie about the war, it is growing its popularity is based on the fact that <br /> <br /> Just a thought. And if it was a World War II movie, or I just change the time, everything remains the same, it is to be awarded? Not sure. Why? Because there are more of them, which raise the bar way to high. <br /> <br /> In comparison to its competitors in the Oscar, I do not think that all the prizes he won properly sentenced.
