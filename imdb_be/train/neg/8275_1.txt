(First of all, sorry my bad English) Of course, only in the movies starring Jessica Simpson may include serious mess like this .. I am Norwegian, and I was offended and shocked by the creators of this movie is not the time to make them research on what makes the American / "Norwegian" movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to the facts about the country <br /> <br /> So I send my adjustments from my disappointment :. -The country called Norway, Sun Norwegia -. «Yes» is a Russian, not a race ezhskim. -Norwegian priests never use these black capes with this white paper on the neck, as a Protestant church is dominant today It's true, we have a native traditional folk costume (which we use only two times a year ), but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit. I could not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie .. Jessica does not make any sense .. neighter made "Norwegian priests» <br /> <br /> the only thing I recognize is the Norwegian flag (and against the hat, but it is so stereaty on what people think about Norway - Vikings :! Ghosh on) <br /> <br /> Well .. I think the people who made this film will never read this comment. but at least I explained some things and get rid of this frustration ..! <br /> <br /> I'm proud of my country, and I would like, if people in the United States were less stereotypical and more accurate when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> It's all .. Lenge Leve Norge! ; r
