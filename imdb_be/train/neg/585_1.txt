The original film, The Man from Snowy River, is one of the best I have ever seen, almost perfect. Lady and the Tramp story in two ways - rich girl / poor boy, and the ability of anti-genealogy. Continued, however, is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original, but also funny, bloated mess Disneyfied best summarized as "Rambo Meets Black Stallion." Without charm Black stallion. The young hero is back with a 3-year absence, and suddenly he was a superman on horseback; in the original, a good movie, it was real and believable, but, unfortunately, is reduced to a caricature in the future. I could not have been so disappointed in a movie, and sometimes this thing I was very angry - they missed a bit clich√©. Copper manipulation audience - studio heads do believe that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience relates quite horses in front of them, to make them happy? Mess of a movie.
