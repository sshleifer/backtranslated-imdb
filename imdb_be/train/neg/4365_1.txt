Ariauna Albright is a really good actress, but for some reason she participated in writing this lame parody is a mystery. What might have entertained wind up as the classic depression. The unique thing about Ariauna is that it can act as well as looks real sexy, unlike his partner Lilith shots that look good, but obviously she had spent the money on acting school at the spa or cosmetologist. This production, which cried out for some T & A & submission of a writer could achieve it in the flow of things. However Ariauna is doing what it can dispose of reputation in these conditions and to the extent. Company Tempo should know that when you put two attractive women in poor fetish police uniforms viewers will wait for some fetish games & T & A. Nough he said.
