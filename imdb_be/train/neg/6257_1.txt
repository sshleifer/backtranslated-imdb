SPOILERS. Strange people with a generous taste was a review of the film. Let me add balance, finding as follows: <br /> <br /> Written by: Nightmare. Tom and Dan are "getting to know each other," making fun of movies, it is obvious that one person, and I suspect that it was the director who has been carefully compiled his words sound smart. At some point, Dan asked, "Did you hear about the HIV virus?" And it sounds about as natural as asking, <br /> <br /> Acting "Have you talked with nine races?": White teeth make and precise face not sensitive performer make. Speedman did well enough with what he was given, I suppose, but Marsden was terrible - stale, unbelievable, and all smug and smarmy throughout his captivity. There void its performances (see also Interstate 60) <br /> <br /> plot :. Sorry! Moments half escape were not spectacular, but annoying and weak. Let me remind you, Marsden pretending to try the key in the door, and then threw them down: "They do not work, people" Tee's and beware of the floor black and white memories are initiated with some sound schlocky taken from the CSI and other crime drama <Br.. /> <br /> most important and most dangerous evil and offensive, it is homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in the film in which HIV is considered a weapon. it says that Dan may have removed a condom or not used it at all - I'm sorry, where the while they have sex There are several villainizing partner inserted? Who comes off as villainizing gay rights in general <br /> <br /> As a result :. Carefully!
