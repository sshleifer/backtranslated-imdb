I give it five out of 10. All five brands are for Hendrix, which provides a very decent set of his last day material. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera work and editing is bordering on awful! We have a full-face countless arrows Hendrix, where he could be almost nothing to do, taking the piss possible? We do not see his hands on guitar Thats the point! In addition, we have obtained is sufficient Hendrix boom due? There seems to be three cameras on Hendrix, but fans of fools run all of them. The guy in front of Hendrix, it seems, tend to wander lazily his focus on the stage as if Hendrix guitar just entertainment. While the guy behind this Keener in aiming for some chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work Thats bleeding from the amplifiers (sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) alternate on the tracks of students protesting against the losers clips in 'etnam etc. on tracks such as Machine Gun, film waste! If Hendrix lived even two years, Berkeley is one of those things that never saw the light of day as a full official release goes. One gem it contains is incredibly Johnny B Good, but still in pretty bad visual document of a large and yields as the Woodstock and Isle of Wight
