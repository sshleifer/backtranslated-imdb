This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen! There were people who left the theater, others fell asleep (ok, it was late in the evening shows) ... This is not the meaning of the film, one of those who can make you never want to see the failure of the primary image again. I would like to see the decision-off of the film, as I have a strong interest in what is happening in the minds of the authors of such debris. They laugh when they create these ridiculous things, or they actually think they are doing something interesting? Interesting ... The soundtrack is awful except for some instrumental stuff that reminds you of the preliminary album Bjork. Even if you're a fan of music Bjork, stay home. This is best done. Small, tiny pieces of good music there is no reason for you to come out and introduce yourself this torture. God! ...
