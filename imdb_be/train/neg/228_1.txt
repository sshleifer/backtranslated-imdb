I thought it was New York is a film: wrong! It's a little British countryside <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy :. You are wrong! It is a drama .... Well, until the last third, because after the story becomes completely «abracadabrantesque», symbolic word for the French presidential mandate. This means that close to nonsense, even motives would bring a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What do I have left? Maybe a good actress duo: Yes, I know they are 3 friends, but a little red-haired police invisible to me. High doctoress surprises from its impact, and McDowell provides excellent operating as usual, all in delicate, soft and almost silent respects. This gentleness confuses me because, like other outstanding artists and directors, the same pattern repeated over and over again. In her case, it's like, regardless of the film, it's always the same character is defined by its senses, its values, living the endless stories. I still do not know how to set a limit (or merger) between the artists and the works. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of this film is its feminine and interesting different points of view. Women have each their own way of life, even if they are all the same. It brings a lot of tolerance and learn to observe, how and unique reality can be interpreted in as many ways as people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is fully available for viewing, but the big final cuts following vision of desire.
