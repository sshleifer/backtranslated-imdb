Scary amateur filmmaker (no, not Todd Sheets), his new friend and sister to explore the cave. Friend and sister get in and get saved. Meanwhile, the gang acted badly girls, protecting their "turf." Whatever the hell that means. This film and I use that term very little so bad that it's good .. bad. Humor painfully unfunny, "action" is simply boring. Now I have seen some horrible horrible movie "" horror at the time and could not grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget movies, but I still cry open to those who choose to sit through it. Only for the most seasoned maschocists among you. but the rest run away FAST !! <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
