The film begins with a rather intriguing scene, three people drink and make small talk at the bar. they all do a little bit outrageous stories. As the film unfolds, it turns out that the most egregious story is true. However, for that the film is not very interesting for the scene in the bar and on the stage, which discloses the secret of the exception. Statement this is just half of the time in movies and, frankly, not much is left to be seen. The remaining Directors time lingering in the Russian god left the village, full of miserable and horrible old women. Of course, it is exciting and a bit shocking images, but admiring them is too long, sacrificing any possible plot or character development. I found this film as yet another example of any lousy and lazy film-making, where instead of trying to make an interesting story, the filmmakers focus on the bizarre captivating images, and later in several almost unrelated stories (case - history meat traders ) to leave the viewer to figure out all the scraps. On the surface of it it has a fanciful appearance, but in this case it is not more than incompetence.
