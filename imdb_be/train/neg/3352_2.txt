I do not even know where to start on this one. "It's all about the family." This must be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in "horror" movies, though it may not be a horror film, even when he tried !!! Ugh !!! And I know that Owen Wilson is the best actor. He should stop playing tokens guy who dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). In the end, people did co-write "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He's got some talent. In addition, Lili Taylor must follow indie films. It has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones is to become a porn star. There is no place in a legitimate acting on it. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, ever.
