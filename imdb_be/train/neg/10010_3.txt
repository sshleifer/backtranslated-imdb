The plot is not worth discussing, even if he hints at corruption, murder, power, and the other theme-related thriller. The characters are interesting, although sometimes. Not realistic, but nevertheless interesting. <br /> <br /> The development of slow, like tea ceremony. Sun stunning visuals, but well enough to ease the strain on your eyes. A good movie to watch after dinner before staying up - nothing shocking too much personal overexciting. . Film sitcom style <br /> <br /> I loved Woody - excellent performance. I had to fight the inadequacy of the plot and did his job very well. The remaining tolerant, but very predictable. All watchable and better than most TV shows.
