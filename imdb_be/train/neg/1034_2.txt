After the success of Scooby-Doo, where are you, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But, unfortunately, they have added a new symbol, which spoiled the success of Scooby-Doo forever. They came up with a new show with a new name, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo, that made this show a complete failure, probably, for adults and children together. Scrappy was stupid brave puppy who was always ready to beat someone. Scooby and Shaggy got scared villain, and they also tried to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need a little annoying ugly puppy nephews. If they wanted Scooby-Doo, to be more successful, they need to have, or have not killed or did not think to patchwork. It was just a bad, maybe your kids will prefer it!
