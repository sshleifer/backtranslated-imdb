If you are not twelve, this film really is not worth it. This is obviously a low-budget film with actors in, and the genre is fantasy, which often requires intensive work of CGI, it's not good. I knew it would be bad when I shot him. I like to laugh at bad movies. I did not know how bad, though. It was not like, until after 2 hours, then it really starts to burn. Fighting style go between normal combat operations that obey the laws of physics, and wired fighting. There's no real explanation of the transition. It has a plot, but again, this is obviously a children's film. It seems that there are clear moral lessons of the day is being transported as Sesame Street or something. It is tolerant. But it is much better if you, say, nine.
