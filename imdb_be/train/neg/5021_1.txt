This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The story was sad, the dialogue was brutal and unnatural acting. I'm not sure if this film was the result of homework film school project, but it certainly played like one. It's not even particularly successful in its central pride tries to act as a single continuous take. The whistling horizontal trays cameras are cheap and non-original way to reduce shelters.
