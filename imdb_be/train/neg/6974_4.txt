Blue monkey actually mentioned in the movie, but in any case, making every possible sense. At some point, some of the children roam through the deep levels of exploring. <br /> <br /> They begin to discuss what they find there, and one of them (the girl) said that it puts that they will find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, here it is quite unimportant to the story, only sad over the name, and did not understand why she assumes she will find a blue monkey in the basement of the hospital. <br /> <br /> I was confused, remembering it, but someone has to remember, I suppose!
