Most books adaptations bad, but the film came out of the key parts of the story line and changed the description and some characters. They rewired the plot and the combined scene and changed the order. They added the funny things in it, that there never was in the book, and never will be. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book in advance it would be incredibly stupid film, it will not make you care about the characters, or they do not like them. It turns symbols into a joke. <br /> <br /> Awful. <br /> <br /> Funny. <br /> <br /> Waste two o'clock my life.
