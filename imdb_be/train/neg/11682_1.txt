Who is right? Taking into account all the good work done by Danzel, Clive and Jodi, the film never developed into anything more than a terrible indomitable / Heist imitators films. And a couple of jokes, there is absolutely no unexpected twists, to be honest only unpredictable moments there, because, as a director and editor made some stupid mistakes, it's a shame for them, and a waste of time for us. If someone can tell me why on earth they had to dig a hole inside that safe, who the hell is the Rebbe, and how on earth they knew that the diamonds were in a particular cell, he could just make my day, but I think Spike asks us to take too many things in this, as a matter of course, and do not raise eyebrows, if something looks stupid ... it's just another movie studio contract to relax and enjoy ...
