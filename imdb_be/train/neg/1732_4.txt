Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I'm happy to see any of his films. Most people on the factory horn fourth crack and quickly Ollie crack with all the horn noise. He is resting at home with Stan on his side, needing quiet, and the doctor (James Finlayson) phones to say he was coming to check on Ollie. After the implementation of plumbing and electricity messed up to squint technician, doctor comes for inspection, and after some tests, it is recommended to drink goat's milk and get some sea air on the ocean. After Stan practicing some of the games on the tube, hanging window with a telephone cable and a car accident, he and Olli dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the dock trying to milk the goat, and Stan brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the first page of the newspaper says that the killer Nick Granger - an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) had fled, and he sneaks onto a boat boys while they are sleeping, and goats chew through the rope boat drifting in the sea. In the morning, you see their location, and the killer goes demanding something to eat, and he sees Stan and Ollie doing fake food products, such as string spaghetti, soap, cheese, belts bacon, sponges for meatballs, and he makes eat them. If Olli starts to choke on something, Stan blowing his trumpet, to help, and the fury of Olli gets his killer punch, and it keeps going until the police arrived, only to rabies Ollie get them put in jail, too. It was the finest moments of comedy, but it's not a big black-and-white film. "Well, here's another nice mess you've got me!" There was a number of 60 100 years, 100 Quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had a score of 7 on the humorist of humorists. Good!
