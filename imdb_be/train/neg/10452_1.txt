I saw the 10pm show and I have to say that this film was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater want my time back (I do not actually pay for a movie more), I did not find saving qualities. <br /> <br /> There were a few lines, such that made me chuckle, but mostly the film seemed to consist of unbridled fan service to the younger (mean more than age, what this film is designed R) male audience. Fan service seemed absurd and quite distracting as well. I know that you all want to hear Samuel L. says that his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a lot of hype very little pay off. The only truly terrible part of the film was CG, which looked highly digitized and not adhere well to the live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a smart person, I knew going into the theater that I was not going to see «Casablanka», and I, at least grateful that this film is the original (albiet meaningless) idea, not a re-do or spin franchise. However, to be honest, if you are not part of the cult following, you're probably better off spending your money elsewhere and watch a film in the second theater performance for a few weeks or rent it for a few months.
