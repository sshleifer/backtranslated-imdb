Worst movie ever !!! Please see comments in real movie from the pros on this movie.Check Rotten Tomatoes on the Internet for some good independent reviews of this film. Comments made on this site, apparently by people with some financial interest in this film. I believe that the positive comments are very misleading. I think it's amazing how negative comments are so bad against the film and the positive comments sound like Oscar speech. Do not waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This film is delayed !! I can not believe that a film like this will ever be done. Why Hollywood to spend their time on such rubbish? This film is an attempt nothing. I ask myself what would be freer to really sink their money producing such waste. I went to the blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste time and money. I did not listen, and I spend my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really "the worst movie ever made!"
