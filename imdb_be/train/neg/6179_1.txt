This film is the second worst film I've ever seen (the first Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict, or any other major parts required drawing history. This "film" is basically just another reason to Toby Keith, to show their masculine side, and on the "tough guy he really is." I completely wasted my time watching this movie. The best part has to be the ending credits. If I was Ebert and Roper, I'd cut my fingers off and threw them on the manufacturers. Who in their right mind gave Toby Keith a chance to star in a feature film, obviously, on the same mental level as him. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this film, it could be quite possibly the only thing you'll regret.
