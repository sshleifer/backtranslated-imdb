... then they will have a proper place to file this crap. Unfortunately, no "mystery" is claimed to be a religious fetish. I kept waiting for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised to me, but "evil" in this film is just an incredible five years with learning disabilities. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that they actually managed to find some great actors name, wishing to participate in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, it forever changed my opinion of them, and I will most likely avoid everything that they do in the future. I'm also a bit cheesed off that I now have the writer's name and the name of the director, to remember how I avoid everything that they do, like the plague, from now on, too. <br /> <br /> It's really a pity that all religious fanatics posted here and say that this film is 10 of 10, etc. They will receive their reviews posted first. This can lead to more people getting cheated as I was judging this movie is something else than a religious sermon. <br /> <br /> Well, it's off to the video store to get their money back for false advertising. It is a pity that they can not give me back I wasted 105 minutes watching it, thinking that it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural film.
