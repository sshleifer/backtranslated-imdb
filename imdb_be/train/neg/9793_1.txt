Powerful Morphin Power Rangers was the worst TV shows ever made. There is no plot, just a heap of silly costumed children using martial arts while dressed in second grade spandex clothing. <br /> <br /> The special effects look like they're from the '70s, the costumes look like something from a bad comedy, and the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the television show are toys, only the second year of plastic waste is fed to our children. <br /> <br /> there is a much better show for your kids to watch! <br /> <br /> Try to give your children something like Nickelodean, these shows actually have intelligence behind them, as opposed to the power rangers.
