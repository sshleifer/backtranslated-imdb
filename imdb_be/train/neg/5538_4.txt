It's actually not a zombie movie, when we define a zombie, like a dead walking around. Here, the main character, Armand Louque (played incredibly young Dean Jagger), gains control of the method to create a zombie, but in fact, his "method" to mentally project their thoughts and control the minds of other living people, turning them into a hypnotized slave , This is an interesting concept for a movie, and it was made much more efficient by Fritz Lang in his series «Dr. "Movies, including" Dr. Mabuse Mabuse gambler "(1922) and" The Testament of Dr. Mabuse "(1933). Here, unfortunately, is subject to his quest to regain the love of his former girlfriend, Claire Duval (played by Anne Heche look the same with the bad haircut, Dorothy Stone), which is actually the main theme. <br /> <br /> the movie has an intriguing beginning, and sent to the military Louque archaeological expedition to Cambodia to put an end to the cult of zombies who have come from there. In any type of connection (where we get great 30s sets and clothes), he announces his engagement to Claire, and then barely five minutes later, she gives him his ring, proclaiming his love for his friend, Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland ). This unintentionally funny how they communicate with each other, not making eye contact. It would be a great movie for «Mystery Science Theater 3000", if they have not baked it. <br /> <br /> He never showed, in fact Louque learns "zombie" in secret, but then he uses it to kill their enemies, create a gigantic army infantry support soldiers and guards. We will not see such a clear willpower, while John Agar in "the brain from Planet Arous" (1957). <br /> <br /> Finally, Claire agrees to marry him if he will let Greyson live and return to America. Louque agrees, but in fact turns it into one of his slaves hypnotized. On their wedding night, he realizes that Claire will begin only love him, if he would give up his "office." In order to win her love, he does this by calling the "rebellion" in the title, in which all his servants to awaken and attack his compound and kill him. Grayson covers Claire, and we seem to be at the end of the parable: "Whom the gods would destroy, they first make wisely.» <br /> <br /> So in fact what it is not so bad film, despite IMDb on a low rating it currently has. On repeated viewings (?) You can see the artistry in the well-formed script! Dean Jagger has become a good actor, and did not find in his youth - that is what is actually his own hair? We remember him more for his bald, old role in 'White Christmas' (1954),' the X Unknown '(1956) and' King Creole "(1958). Story borrows a lot of its major themes of the brothers Halperin better earlier film "White Zombie" (1932), in which the luckless Robert Fraser (as Charles Beaumont) uses a "zombie" to win the love Madge Bellamy (as Madeline Parker). <br /> <br /> If you want a real zombie movies (of which there are hundreds!), I would like to start with the "White Zombie" (1932), "King of the Zombies" (1941), "I have played with the zombie" ( one thousand nine hundred forty-three), "Night of the living dead" (1968), "The Last man on Earth" (1964) and its two remakes. In the modern era of cool films is the "Horror Express" (1972), "The Serpent and the rainbow" (1988) 28 days later "(2002) and its sequel, as well as many, many others too numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> This one is not quite a zombie movie. Judging from this film on its own terms, it is more than half a gothic romance. As such, it takes a little less than some of the lower part of Universal's horror films by the end of the 30's and early 40's. So I give it a 5.
