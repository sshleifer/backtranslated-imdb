I just rented it today .... previously heard many good reviews. WOW !! That steaming pile of poo this movie !! Does anyone know the address of the director, so I can get my five bucks back ???? Finally someone was pushing "Stop-loss" from "the worst of the war in Iraq Movie Ever" number one spot. To be fair, I do not think there is any good movies war in Iraq, in any case, but it was really bad. <Br /> <br /> I will not go into any technical inaccuracies, there are hundreds of reviews of other veterinarians GWOT, detailing them all. If the director has worked to handle even the darkest E-statement of technical accuracy, but they could have done film .... more realistically possible. I believe that a writer must be in the "credit" for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot of this film with some imaginative, entirely affected with the limitations of reality. Does anyone, but I'm wondering what the point of this film was? Was there a message? Sur 'ozna ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I am very surprised by all the positive reviews really. This film is difficult to see how the vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies, but even if you could not see that the plot of the sludge, the characters are small (to put it mildly) and active poor at best. Ironically, I think that this film should be about the Explosive Ordinance removal because it is the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
