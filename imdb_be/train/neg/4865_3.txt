I just do not like this movie. But then I loved Babe, Pig in the city and was spoiled to say the films of animals that are exceptionally well done in every way. Animals were not pretty. All of them were annoying especially Chris Rock pig, but what could I expect this Chris Rock. I believe that once or twice smiled a couple of nice lines, but it is.
