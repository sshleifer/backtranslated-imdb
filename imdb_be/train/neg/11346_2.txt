Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" in this land of the island) is the only reason to watch this film. The story is very thin, and when the friends return to the United States Air Force Cobra with curses on their action is simply waiting game. See Faith Snake Woman and try to pretend the rest does not occur.
