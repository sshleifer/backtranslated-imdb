Yes, there are great performances here. Unfortunately, they occur in the context of the film, which does not seem to have a clue what he was doing. During the first 45-60 minutes of all this music happens in a realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour into the characters who up to that point, do not always talk to each other, suddenly begin to sing to each other. To make matters even more confusing, a little further in, out of nowhere, they are actually about 15 minutes Sung through dialogue, it seems to abandon the idea and move on to other things, such as the number, which begins in a jazz club with a drummer two electric guitars suddenly transformed into a fully-planned the whole with a massive invisible string section. In addition to all of this disparity in how music is used, it is obvious inability composers actually write music in a style that is supposed to be portrayed. While the first couple of pieces to make a sort of mimic the 1950s Motown sound, the rest of the movie is simple (bad) Broadway show music. Then there's the pure stupidity scraps group doing a poor imitation of the family Jackson and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard, James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he began directing Stevie Wonder, I could not help laughing out loud. This is clearly one of those movies that make me realize how much time I have on the earth and angry that I spent two o'clock it to watch this movie.
