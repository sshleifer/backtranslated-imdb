It is a kind of genre stuff, that is, you either like 1950s musicals or not. If you do, you'll love it. Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with dance talents of Astaire and Rogers, and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple, and so on, but the songs' 50s, the slower dances and soap melodramas decade all turn me. <br /> <br /> This movie is a case-in-point. The first song was alright, but the following three have done nothing for me. By the time the story has no great appeal, either. The presence of Deborah Kerr another minus. I do not think I've ever seen in a movie, she starred in the fact that I liked it, including this one, where the buzz two shoe English teacher, she spends half the film reflects, threatening to leave C. (I, that she had to!). <br /> <br /> However, divorced themselves from such-and-dislikes, there is no doubt this Rodgers and Hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many people, especially those who are fond of «The Sound Of Music» ten years through, there are similarities in musicals R & H. So, if you liked the movie, Julie Andrews, you have to like it, too. <br /> <br /> This is a generous production, so that the capital "L." It's kind of a big production musicals you rarely saw after this generation. You can also get duplicate singer, unlike today, where the actress is not exactly sing so Marnie Nixon comes to the aid of Kerry, as she did with Natalie Wood in the «West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady." <Br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is the "King Mongkut» and traditionalist stereotype, good filmmakers have always portrayed in a negative way. It is not a "progressive" as left-wing, as they say, but the teacher education (Kerr as "Anna Leonowens») will set it right. Secular-progressives today is always a teacher is higher than that of people who are trying to cure cancer! However, Yula good in that role, and even use some comedy along with his more-bark than bite character. Rightly, he is the big star of this film. Brynner was magnetism. Even in the "Magnificent Seven" Yula was a cowboy who fascinated the audience. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great movie for its time and millions of people use it. I'll leave it at that.
