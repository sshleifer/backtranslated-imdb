Just finished watching, I can not say that I was amazed. <br /> <br /> It starts from a pretty good visual atmosphere and gives a terrible feeling, like this type of movie should be. But all this comes to an end, when the first Lordi monster. Not only do you learn from their group Lordi, but they are seriously malplaced in the film. Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings as 80. <br /> <br /> As for the storyline, it starts out as such horror, people trapped inside a hell hole. But there is no clear story about why and what is happening. The viewer is thrown a few lines about the possible causes, but the lines never meet, and ultimately nothing but confusion. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this film with an intriguing start and some good effects, I thought that someone would take better care of the product. I wonder if Lordi made this film in order to prove that their show costumes could be scary (except they are not). <br /> <br /> So the film gets credit for visuals, I believe that the money had to go somewhere else, but inconvenient to attempt a rock band to make them scarier monster on stage aliases.
