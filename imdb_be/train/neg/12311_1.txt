I know that I've added a comment, but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not some old generation of baby boomers who grew up glued to the flickering b / w photos, Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, etc. <br /> <br /> Bilko for 20 years before I was born, but I have had the pleasure to discover Bilko courtesy of Phil Silver with BBC2. I wonder if I enjoyed the parody of Steve Martin, if I had not seen or heard of Phil Silvers - I do not know. - maybe I would <br /> <br /> Some of the other reviewers who think this movie deserves "10" admit that they have not seen the original. I can only encourage you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching one episode. If after viewing the original Ernie, Hall then Colonel, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dean, with Flashman, Zimmerman, the Mullin and others you still think that the movie Steve Martin is woth anything above "2" - I will stand you pint ....
