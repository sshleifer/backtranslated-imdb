There are several things wrong with this film character Brenda Song is one of them. I do not believe that the girl was a lousy actor- I honestly do not. I think she gets a bad line. It just has to be, "that vain rich girl", and while it's funny in the TV show she plays, he can not even get a dry laugh at me here. <br /> <br /> Either way, I really had to know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> film is not so bad ... initially. Wendy Schoen reaction was quite natural. I mean, how would you feel if the person who claims to be reincarnated monk chasing around you commanded to wear the locket and insisting that you were required to deal with the "great evil" and save the world ? This brings me to another point. I know that this film is entirely fiction, but it still has a base in the Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" in the family line of Wendy were women. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt that the monks had just been okay with that. Of course, maybe they could have worked it out somehow, but they have not offered any explanation at all. By doing so, they only contributed to many cheese attempt to empower the female made in Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> Nevermind, which, however- let's stretch. <br /> <br /> character Wendy is becoming increasingly unbearable as the film go on. Yes, she's a teenager, and it is near the homecoming- I mean, who wants to fight evil while returning to their homeland? The problem is, when "evil" begins to manifest itself, Wendy does not give as shocked as it should be. It is extremely careless- even for someone like her. She still does not take care of their education. I will use this conversation as an example, Sheng: "If you do not win this battle, the evil will take over, and all will be well." Wendy: "Wow, talk about pressure ... Well, let's talk about something else .. "Yes, let's Wendy. Let's also dance, when you should be on the right training. Shen course allows it, but his character is an excuse. It is better that he is working with her, which he did not, and she did not train at all, and get them killed. <br /> <br /> Oh, speaking of which. Sheng also said Wendy, that it is his destiny for him to die for her in the battle, as he grandmother (I think that part of it). <br /> <br /> This makes the action more Wendy unforgivable. <, Br /> <br /> As a writer it would return to the homeland, and Wendy is a "big battle" is to do the same day. You know what makes Wendy? You even have to guess? Yes, it will eventually be a fight when she tries to leave to return home, the monks, (which are covered in the body of her coach and teacher Shen, because she "felt amazing fights old man") to tell her that Shen went to fight in alone, so she goes to rescue him. <br /> <br /> Initially, we see some half decent fight, which is really interesting. Until, finally, a great evil does not come out due to a competitor, returning home body Wendy, and create a virtual version of himself with his body broken pieces of ancient warriors. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy gets all the "panic". Shen then goes and protects it from this with the help of extensions, forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese Name- and managed to get himself killed. <br /> <br /> Wendy Shen catches, as he makes his long descent by pushing uncomfortably high into the air. <br /> <br /> She cries out the name of the said articles. <br /> <br /> at the moment ... it was bad enough that Wendy has become a powerful far, too fast. No, I will not let him apologize, because it was her "destiny" and she was "the power within" it. <br /> <br /> Since when, though, she found healing? No, the worst thing ... since when she could resurrect people? Since Shen is risen from the dead. Then, Wendy and he fight the guy. <br /> <br /> He gets lost easily. Worst of all, when they jump together and push it at the same time, and he is banished forever. Then the monks give Wendy on her sacrifice <br /> <br /> Two things # 1 :. Nha writer and director know, the fight requires a bit more "finesse" to him? # 2: What to donate? The fact that she did not go to homecoming? Since she does not sweat, or even bleed. I mean, let's now, this film was the PG TV, I would like to see someone hurt. <br /> <br /> A-hem ... move on. <br /> <br /> I know, it sounds like maybe I should give the film to one based on my comments. Part of the criticism, you should know, though, break things down. You do not have to try to look bad, but if it is, to draw attention to it. This film has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect anything to be too much in the first place. <br /> <br /> So, I believe that it was all right. Not that I do not say that it was not all right to stop someone from his watch.
