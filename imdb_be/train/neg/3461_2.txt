Slasher films are often regarded as a derivative, repetitive and unoriginal openly. I happen to be a movie fan of horror, but this film was so poor, words fail me. Scenario severely lacking, the plot ridiculous acting amazingly bad. Just round the bitch that I wasted my time on. It was all the entertainment value of the 15th sequel to the film, which was ominous, in the first place. <br /> <br /> Who has the green light to this mess? <br /> <br /> I loved only two things in this film. The first one was the killer mask - it was very nice. The second was Austrailian affinity with humorous profanity. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this disgusting mess.
