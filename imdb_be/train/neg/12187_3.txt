Worst cooperation De Niro Scorsese in this terrible wrenching violent too long medley. Scorsese is completely out of his element in this film with horror formulaic suddenly loud phone ringing and doors slamming tricks that seem ridiculous and embarrassing to come with such a master. The cast is completely lost here and southern accents is very annoying and forced. Nick plays Noltie wimpiest lawyer in history, ever believe that he can protect anyone! psychotic Bowden De Niro is not more than the film psycho killer typical 90s. The scene with De Niro and Lewis in the early stages is very inconvenient and the climax goes on and on, and we should all be more than tired of the crazy stalker who never dies. One of my most terrifying movie experience. Original Rent is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
