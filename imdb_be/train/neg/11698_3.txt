This movement has reminded Tales from the Crypt Keeper. He has the same ideas of the people get what they deserve. I think that it is always in the Crypt of their stories. The same applies to the bad acting. Very bad game. I enjoyed the movie, knowing that most people do not like it, and I was not expecting much. Every time I watch a movie by Stephen King, I did not expect much, because all of his films are terrible compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie, and they were great books. I love how Carrie is played as it was a true story and the book is a bunch of reports and theories, and the like. It was so good. But I have noticed that both the novel did not have anything like that in a movie. End were very different, the version of the film. I believe that these two novels that his novels have changed a lot and always ending cheese. I'm the end of the solvent is the worst. So cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the real ending. I suggest to anyone who is going to read the novels of Stephen King watch his movies before hand, so you can compare. And thus, you will be very pleased with the book. I intend to do so with all of his novels have been made into movies. I am sure that if they were made into movies, they were real good books ... and the script went horribly wrong.
