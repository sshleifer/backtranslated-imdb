This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but I really can not remember when I've seen worse one. I thought that this would be the investigation of accidents. That it was in fact this is a soap opera, and bad in this. They beat in "conflict" card to the extreme. The first hour or so it seems to have quarreled, some implausible scenes thrown in. <br /> <br /> * possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> 40-minutes-so "Memorial" scene (with the necessary black umbrellas and rain) on a fictitious plane crash victim was lame, and I thought it never ends. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs if you do not revel in "conflict". <br /> <br />
