Imagine, The Big Chill, with a cast of twentysomethings who all the characters, unpleasant and iguanas, as a man-lizard chasing them around, and you have an idea about the foolishness herein. On the positive side, the film does not skimp on the show monster. There is no drop in the superposition shots, or night scenes where you have to imagine what it looks like; he was right there people. Unfortunately, design and construction are not so inspired. A bit of mystery could help. Keep in mind that I have seen much worse, but if you have it on full screen for many clicked your monster better look damn good. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead !!! <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a twist ending involving supposedly dead brother, which makes absolutely no sense. This is not a surprise, considering the rubbish script writing. As for the action; well, let's just say that it was not painfully bad, but I do not expect that we will see many of these children in the future cinematic excursions <br /> <br /> Gore factor :. 2 of 5; Nudity factor: 1 of 5; Intelligence factor: Negligible
