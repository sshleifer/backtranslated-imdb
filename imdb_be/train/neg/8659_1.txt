There are some things that I can never understand. Such as this film. What if I had to create a really cheap and crappy looking at Dean and crocodile pattern polygon in Maya, and then proceed to cut and paste that in an amateur video clip that my people crying and have eaten the same thing? How could anyone even think that is completely false Dinocroc CGI that looks quite ridiculous, will influence events in this film? I know that his B-class, low budget and all, but the producers could have done better than to make a piece of shit that nobody has ever seen or sit and see. It's just does'nt make sense. Are people really so stupid that they'll sit through it? Apparently so. For a laugh? No, it's not even worth laughing.
