It's like a bad 80s TV show broke free and tried to become a soft-core porn. Oh my god it's bad. Graphs each character had little to do. The story itself was not anything to say. Something about a stalker, I guess. In the end, he shot himself? It is not entirely clear, but for some reason there is a volleyball game play. And the main character (Randy) sleeping around a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie because Wang Ding was in it, and they will eventually want to fast forward to the scene with him in it, which were almost watchable in this. Thank God, I do not spend money on this, but I want that hour of my life back.
