Well, plain and simple, if you are a fan of Tomb Raider to other games (yes, even AOD) protected from LEGEND. <br /> <br /> This is, without doubt, the most disappointing game TR else. It looks very nice, it sounds very good, but it is absolutely impossible to play, and I refused. I feel like I was robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It is very simple. TR was a computer game before anything else. You control Lara with the keyboard. The game Tomb Raider 6 controls were standard. The AOD they were "sticky", but still the same sequence of general management. In Legend they have completely changed its methods of motion and control, and it is absolutely uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> I have seen other comments from people who say that "with the mouse." No, why should I? Others say that the "Use a gamepad. No, why should I? Others say," But it was the standard for third person control for many years, "Well, I do not care, this is not a standard for any other games TR so why mess with it. Oh, I know, because they could not care less about their original loyal fans, they want to capitalize on the new children who have not even heard of the series, while the movie does not come out and make a lot more money. Helpless. <br /> <br /> My advice for any serious TR fans to stay away from this game, and if you buy it complain of Eidos. I saw a lot of other positions, mainly on the Eidos forums from people telling them how rubbish it, perhaps they will listen.
