A bad one. <br /> <br /> Oh my ... this is one of the films that do not have even one positive effect. Simply everything from the actors to the story stinks to heaven. I just wonder how low IQ you need to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy. <br /> <br /> There is something that is worth looking at? Well, there's a lot of nudity drawn, but it is not anything special. And if you just think it could not get worse, your realize that all the naked ladies there looked like forty years. Come on, guys, where you are looking for these actresses. The permanent home, perhaps. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the leading actress has some tight and knows how to show it. Again, it's too bad that it is too thin and old. In general, skip this one. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
