In college dorm guy killed someone with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dora Barton) finds him and tries to kill herself. She institutionalization. After a year, she has a new guy named Hank (Joseph Lawrence), and how to spend spring break with Hank and four other brainless friends in a big, beautiful condo in Florida. Of course, the killer jumps out (for no reason) and then starts killing <br /> <br /> Lousy slasher thriller -. A textbook example of how not to make a low-budget horror film. For pervyhi, large portions of the film ENDLESS filler of the six idiots movie itself, having a "cool" (more fun than the audience) getting drunk, acting stupid, etc. etc. In addition, no nudity here at all. I'm not saying that the horror film needs poverty, but to spice it up would help. None of the Death Sun really showed (you hear them), only a little blood and no gore. There's one real obnoxious one - but it is not until the end <br /> <br /> With some exceptions, the current sludge .. Dora Barton terrible as the main woman, and Tom Jay Jones lousy as Oz. Chad Allen pops like Brad and he's scared. Lawrence is actually very good - nice and a hard worker and gives him all that shit. And Jeff Conaway pops up in a small role does a very good job <br /> <br /> The logical blunders abound - once they understand each two women casually talking about sex was killed. Sun Bastions reaction to seeing a friend killed is funny and what is happening with Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace, after all! Stupid, stupid, Sun gore or nudity - skip this.
