This solid little horror movie is actually one of the better Renny Harlin. History pretty routine stuff, but the atmosphere is what really makes it alive; in fact, the story of the ghost is almost an afterthought. This fear comes from the prison setting, and Renee H. spares no detail, showing us how bad conditions inside the broken, leaking, old rat hole (with sadistic wardens, too!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent, as is usual in the title role, with the support of some very authentic-looking prisoners (NO cute boys in the cast.) supporters horror should check this one out.
