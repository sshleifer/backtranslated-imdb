I love the special effects, and witness new technologies that make fiction seem real. The special effects of the film very well. I've seen most of this film, as it was airing on HBO in the past few months. I must admit that I may have missed a few scenes, but I usually get involved in film and saw some scenes several times. But every time I see some «Hollow Man» I feel depressed, almost like a "film noir". I do not know why; perhaps this is what I do not want Kevin Bacon to be evil, and there is disappointment that. But I think it's just a witness HOW implacably evil it becomes. Despite this, I can recommend this film for the excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do not recommend for young people under the age of 14 years (possibly 12, when they are mature).
