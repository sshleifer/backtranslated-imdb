Overall a very disappointing picture. Very, very slow build to the main storyline. The role of Mary Schroeder in search of her family secrets of the past. (Each double seems to last forever ??. There really is no rhythm in the film.) *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth saved from the Nazis, a German woman, played by Kate Rome. The whole character of Ruth is so one-dimensional, so stereotypical. *** SPOILERS END *** The cuts the film back and forth between the present day in New York and Berlin and Berlin 40s something. Please, if you do this, to give the audience an indication that it is time the story takes place. There's never an exact indication of the time ?? very annoying. Worst of all, the end. *** SPOILERS *** All show and chatter about Jews so badly tortured, simply bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. This is how the Jews came out of Rosenstrasse? The question of who liberated the Jews will never answer. Was this Goebels, who released them? Is Lean Fisher sleep with Goebels? In Venice, the film won the award for effective K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. There should be a Jewish theme ??
