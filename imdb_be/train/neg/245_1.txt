Beyond a shadow of a doubt the mystery planet is one of the worst movies ever, but retains the love in my heart, because of its poor special effects and amazingly awful sound track for the first 15 minutes (and, to be honest, that's all you it is necessary to see) come together to create something that's funny side splitting. <br /> <br /> in the first scene in the "space" is about as difficult as cinema gets as washing-up liquid bottle, brushing past your eyes to the muffled dialogue. Before you have time to work out whether it is you who are descended from the mind, titles and effects tries life. <br /> <br /> And on the side of the two-headed clay giant snails that are terrorizing our hero, you also get an extra bonus to have a double as the original voice actor and dubbed voices simultaneously. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> The most sad for the fans of this type of fare is that I only ever saw one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it myself very unlikely. Perhaps I have a single instance in my life. <br /> <br />
