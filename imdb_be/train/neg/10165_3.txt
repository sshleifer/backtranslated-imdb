San - Francisco is a great city with a lot of the loan. In this, the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city. They had not even the most basic of realistic details. So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being in a cinema in San Francisco. You will not think, "Oh, I was there," you'll think, "how did the two-story Firetrap / smelly armpits turn the quiet lobby of the hotel" Some of the findings are used East Coast styles of speech and mannerisms?. This does not diminish, but it is always a valid jurisdiction. <br /> <br /> The stories seemed to appear in three different styles, at least in the beginning. The history of Chinatown is the most effective and interesting. The plot is weak, torn from scene to scene class fighters Hong Kong. The originals were much more stress and emotional resonance, they are framed and the pace better. But the actor's fun and we'll see, James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> white boy intro was pointless. I think that the filmmakers did not know what to do with them, so they left it freely structured and knocked him out. Father odd attempt at a liberal Berkeley - in fact, people all know that this is not a "groovy" to live in the ghetto - but the segments are the most humorous. They threw a good opportunity. Educated and angry on the West Coast yuppie jerk is another kind of yuppie jerk, than they do in New York City. They are equally unbearable, but always recognizable. It would be interesting; it was not. <br /> <br /> The point of intro Hunter was the most disappointing. It was the derivative of the three, and stylistically the most remote from San Francisco. You've seen it done before, and you've seen it done better. Even video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite the general non-locality and aimless script, these characters have the potential actors have talent, and something interesting begins to make its way around an awkward direction ... for about ten minutes before the end. Good concept contained in someone else's hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there is a missing minority here, if you can guess which one.
