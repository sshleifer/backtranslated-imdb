As far as I can understand, TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. My doubts if this work is a regular guy who happens to love movies or if it is the work of the student cinema, as there is a link to the Oporto School of the Arts in the closing credits. <br /> <br /> however, the director Ricardo Pinho shows this film in total ignorance of some basic concepts about the movie. What is cinema? How to tell a story? It does not matter, for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you study film, how to tell a story. You will learn that, like in novels, movies, you also need to build your story in three acts: the introduction, development and conclusion. You will learn that your story should have a hero and antagonist, and what should be the climax. You will learn that it is fair for a 3-hour epic, for a conventional movie, for a short film and even, believe it or not, for a 30-second commercial. You will also learn the subtleties of the levels may be in its approach to the academic structure, and that, ultimately, you can even destroy it. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, Tim WATCHER presents us with his main character, and then the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Amelie Gene in. There is no second or third action in Tim Watcher. This is not a parody or a feature film, so you can not even try to justify the lack of respect for the academic structure. Are you waiting to tell a story, and it's not going to happen. Worse than Tim WATCHER defines itself as a warning; and one with no real purpose. It does not make a point, or at least not valid. The essence of his childhood, with a sense of revenge. The situation is drawn quite simple and Manichaean approach. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a lot more from this short. The film begins with a rather good-looking credit sequence, and you quickly realize that you are watching something with better production values ​​than the usual Portuguese Short. I do not know the budget of the film, but, judging by the list-thanks in the credits, the credit must go to the production team for such good ties in the country where it is difficult to have the doors open to young filmmakers. <, Br /> <br /> Tim WATCHER, it seems an exercise in style, color and carefully selected plans, combined with an excellent number. That's all. There's nothing else. There's no story. And that's a shame, because it feels like a waste of production values. It is unlikely that you can see in the regular Portuguese short of such a variety of places and so many supplements available, to enrich the story. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the comparison may seem, I have to pass shorts BMW as an excellent example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film product placement is strictly trained and over-the-top stylish cinematography.
