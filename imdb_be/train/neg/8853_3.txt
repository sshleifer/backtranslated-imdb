In the first howl we are introduced to a world where there are werewolves and more organized. The plot in this movie made some sense; TV reporter investigating this and tries to uncover the truth. She ends up killing many of them, including her boyfriend, who becomes a friend. Then she shows to the world that they exist, turning on the air. Special effects were ridiculous in the first film, and they do not get better at it. Whether it's converting or bad doll or cheesy computer graphics showing superpowers <br /> <br /> The story line is not all that bad. they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason. This is not to destroy all the werewolves, and it really does not end the threat posed by werewolves like this ... they just want to kill her. I think there was some gray reason for this, but it really is lost in the film. <br /> <br /> After the movie "ends" we have 10 minutes montauge movie we just watched, and any other scene where one female leader werewolf breaks her top exposing large breasts while some virgin-squire the band plays to the crowd werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this film even watchable Christopher Lee.
