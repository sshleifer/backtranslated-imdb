Some people make a point of dissing this movie, because they call into question the credibility of the black people in the Old West, Asians in the Old West, or women with guns in the period of the Old West. Gain control and read a book. There was quite a lot of Asians (Chinese), there was a lot of black (freedmen), and all outside the generic class have easy access to weapons; This second amendment you know. And as far as the use of modern language is, none of those people westerns sun waxed nostalgic actually used the language that corresponds to the era depicted. The Americans had different accents, used a variety of inflections, talking to a very different pace and used a lot of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. Do not blame the historical inaccuracy, because you just do not dig it. Be honest. Maybe you're just uncomfortable, you see.
