I must admit, when I went to see this movie, I did not have high expectations. But even with my low expectations I was entirely disappointed ... <br /> <br /> In general, the hot shot Luke Wilson, who seeks to go a little crazy with his girlfriend. There's a small mention of the girl who had it, but that's pretty much it for this character. I'm not really mind because it is likely to be developed as well as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Thus, while the metro Rhine Wilson (which I really liked this movie before) convinces him to talk to the "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. It is strange, to say the least, as everything is clear to see that Uma Thurman does not apply to the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> performance Rhine Wilson also far from "hot". I'm usually all his actions, but even he could not save this film. His character was nervous, unrealistic and rather annoying. You could never tell when the authors have tried to make it a comic token closet gay guy, or just desperate. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But in any case, someone stole her purse when she was going to leave the subway, and Luke Wilson is magical savior he is running for the robber. Now we all know that the Uma Thurman is a superhero, or «G-Girl», as they like to call it in the film. It still confuses me to the fact that the «G» means, but we will leave it to the bulletin board for discussion. <br /> <br /> In the sex scenes I think is supposed to be funny, but I find myself asking who has sex like that? They almost throw the bed through the wall because of the "passion" Uma Thurman, for example. It makes my head hurt, but not in the "I think, in fact, it is difficult to understand this" way. <br /> <br /> If the mind offends Anna Faris, calling her a "whore" I had no discussion about it. In addition, she can not choose a movie properly, it can not act and belongs souly that it blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> In general, I would come out of the theater when I paid $ 8.75 to see it. The symbols are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, particularly Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that just because you are moving your head a lot does not mean that you act. <br /> <br /> In addition, the script and the plot could be used as a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid. I actually began to feel uncomfortable for the actors, and their dying careers. In general, if you value your money, and your self-esteem, do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt to film.
