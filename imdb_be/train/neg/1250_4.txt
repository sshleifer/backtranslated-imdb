I must admit that it was "rethinking" of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment. Especially when it is taken into account that this is a film by Tim Burton. He defenetly one of the most original and, I may say, steep directors made in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I'm personally a big fan of his work, but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick, Planet of the Apes. I really enjoyed the original film. When it first came out people were waiting, just another cheezie 70 sci-fi movie, but it is very strange Anding fully proved that theory wrong. It was really a clear cut message. The obvious anti-war message. The fear of the Cold War, where he takes the world and the fear of nuclear weapons, has played a big role in the minds of filmmakers. These reasons have made the film rise above all expectations, and it has become a classic. Although, the new film, the "re-making", or any other, leaving us with nothing. There are no posts, no ideals behind it. This is just another money-minded summer blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Visually Tim Burton will not fail. Dark and eerie settings were fine, and, of course, makeup was amazing. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is not enough to keep people interested in the film. There should be a fascinating story or plot. In this film, the story is not very interesting, and it is very poorly designed. The script is very lame, and it is full of gaps. It seems that the film has been written in a hurry. An explanation of why monkeys, where there is, and why the rules of the planet was really a very stupid and proved screenwriter ignorance. <br /> <br /> He raised a lot of questions that do not have a reasonable answer. <, Br /> <br /> For example, Why did the monkey say in English? Why were there other ape species, chimpanzees than in the world (given that there was only a chimpanzee in a spacecraft, which made an emergency landing on the planet) where, hell all these people come from? As several chimpanzees can turn into a huge raise all kinds of monkeys, only a few thousand years. (I mean, it took several million years for us to evolve from ape to man!) <br /> <br /> And, finally, the end of an unpleasant surprise just plane dumb. Perhaps he was just thrown in because the original film was such an end, they felt that viewers expect the same end. The ending also raises a lot of questions that I know ,, I do not have the intellectual answears. Theid or learn how to operate a spaceship? Who was less than capacity, and learned to fly back in time and take over the land of one hand? And what he did, the breed with all the females? And let's say that this will happen, I am of highly doubt that history will remain the same as Washington will be built in the same way as it is today! (I mean wouln't there will be a huge banana instead of a memorial?) <br /> <br /> Well, just to say something about the film posative. Some of the actors were great. character Helen Bonham Carter was interesting and well acted, as well as for Tim Roth in Theid. He was very good, a little exaturated at some points of the film. Michael Clarke Duncan was also good. I was not happy with Mark Whalberg. He is not so much an actor, and plays a very brave character color less. Very unbielevable and nothing compared to the Hestons character in the original. And a female main character was not in the film there is no reason or place. She just cast for appearance. Barely said a word throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Well, I think that in the future, when people think of the planet apes, they will think of the original. The latter will soon be forgotten.
