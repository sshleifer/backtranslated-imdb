One thing that struck me about this film (and not in a good way), Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to pride himself on the fact chief historian on Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this film, considering how most of the actual events that have been changed or neglected. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that von Trotta said she never intended to Lena bed Goebbels, but in that case, why she gave every impression that it was something that happened? Why not show the other possible causes of male liberation, such as accident, was Stalingrad or the Nazis feared that the international press, in Berlin, was to know about the protest. <br /> <br /> Also, why the whole story to play second fiddle to a weak family bonding plot has been done time and time again? Of course, something as strange as it may carry its own history! In places, it was as if the film was a two story lines which actually seemed to have little in common. <br /> <br /> In general, the film failed in its purpose, which was to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance, which is a shame, because to do better, it could have serious consequences.
