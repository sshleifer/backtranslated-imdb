I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time, and it was even sadder than when I first saw it. I do not understand why it has become such a "cult", if it is so tedious boring. The opening scene looks promising when fat nurse takes blood canister and ran for her dear life. After that everything that happens is actually a fusion of man stalks around some forests and houses, while having the memories of his life as an astronaut. Makeup pretty good, and its melting sticky face looks pretty realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws Mani's head in the river and it floats until it reaches the waterfall, where he falls on the rocks and breaks. There's not much to wet himself more, though, most of the scenes shot in the dark and you can not see what is happening. There is not much gore, at least in Vipco DVD I watched. <br /> <br /> No, The Incredible Melting Man is not so great at all. I will give him signs of their cheese factor, but that's about it. If you want a true sci-fi / horror cult, see The Deadly Spawn instead!
