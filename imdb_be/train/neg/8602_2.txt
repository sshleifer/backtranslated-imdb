All you really need to know about this film comes after the opening scene where the guy falls into the lake and gets eaten. Then they start rolling credits title: Do you see the "snail" large letters, and then shortly thereafter «The Movie». Phew! I was worried, I accidentally tuned in to "Slug: The Musical» or «Slug:. The Game Show» In any case, there the film deteriorates in the destruction Festival. You see, the guy cut his hand on him, because snails in his gardening glove, two men attacked a snail during sex, and she falls on her back in the underground passage stung to death killer snails. It's pretty silly movie that falls into the category of "so-bad-is-good." She also starred as bad with the grain of the film, you shocked to learn what was done in 1988 (my guess it was 1974). I am very surprised that he received as a high score, as is the case here, because most people here do not give those kinds of movies no love. but if you want a film that tries to be scary, but it ends up being funny, this is one of your top candidates.
