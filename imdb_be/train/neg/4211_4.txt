About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I would watch it again and again and again. But now ... I do not know. In fact, I think that this film would be great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. He has a bunch of comments severe actors (Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg), and quite unpretentious plot. My favorite part is when Culkin is riding a bike, and he gets gangs and gang member says: "Hey, Tyler! Where am I wrong? MOON ?? "Also pay attention to the classic line," Do you have a feeling in your toes? »<br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is better than« The Good Son ".
