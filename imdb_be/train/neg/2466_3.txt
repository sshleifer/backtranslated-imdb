There was a fashion for the past few years for often as ironic zombie-tion-related movies, and other media incarnations flesh food to revive the dead. «Fido» This film is either an attempt to cash in on it, just a manifestation of it, or both - and it goes directly into the ironic zombie category. The joke is that we get to see the living dead in the context of contrasting widely stereotyped, squeaky clean, alternative-history (we are in the wake of a large zombie war, and is now being domesticated as slaves) version of the suburbs of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> This is a moderately funny concept itself, and quite possibly within five minutes of a comedy sketch, but it can not hold a full-length film on their own. Joke that rotten corpses are inappropriate for employees with this idealized version of the small town of repeated it again and again, and lose their effectiveness. The soundtrack plays a relentlessly sunny tunes while zombies eat bystanders. The word "zombie" is constantly builds otherwise familiar home line for a cheap attempt to laughter. <br /> <br /> The very breadth and artificial notion of "nineteen fifties" here can not help but annoy me. It is so stylized it, obviously, «Pleasantville-» inspired by the way that it is more obvious, waving markers of its 1950s-ness around than actually having no resemblance to anything that might happen in the period between 1950 and one thousand nine hundred fifty-nine . There is something insulting sarcastic about it, as if the film is empty bluster and mindlessly about how a more open, down to earth, and above the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Since the characters are sweeping views of the pop culture of the 1950s, "type", it is difficult to develop a lot of emotional investment in them. Each of them has several traits thrown at him or her - Helen is obsessed with appearances, and Bill loves golf and he was persecuted, having to kill his father - but they remain rather two-dimensional. Performances within the constraints of this bad writing in order. Best Billy Connolly as Fido the zombie, who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in "Frankenstein" is actually attached to the character and sympathy for the lumbering green monster who can not speak. <br /> <br /> There are small pieces of non-thin allegory thrown around - to commodity fetishism, racism, classism, war, paranoia and so on, but none of them actually does not work on a comprehensive level, and the creators of the film is not; really stick to anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film does not really get past sticking fragile jokes "OHSMS! Zombies in the "Leave it to Beaver" For good and hour - a half.
