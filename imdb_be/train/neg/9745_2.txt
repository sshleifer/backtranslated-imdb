This film was spoofed in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was in the best case they ripped the film. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, bad makeup, bad effects, chicken in a poor (1960) underwear, I give him a 2. <br /> <br /> The pest is difficult to understand because of the makeup. Aides say things like "do not you" that sound like NACHOO !! (I think, sneezing). It's just a poor Oration. Long eyebrows fun on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know which means "projected man" in terms of plot. I missed some of the beginning, though. <br /> <br /> that this line for at least 10 accommodation ??
