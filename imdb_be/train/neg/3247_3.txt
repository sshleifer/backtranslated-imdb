I'm seriously looking forward to see this movie because it seemed really promising from the nearest points of interest: Jim Carrey with godlike powers had the idea that most definitely worked for me. As a huge fan, I was sure that he would be in the highest degree in their element, with such a promising location, and what could go wrong? Yesterday, my bubble was burst big time, boys and girls, because I've seen the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (where it is determined that he hates his life, he was unhappy with the employee and it is important unhappy campers with an ax to grind against God) is serviceable, the second act (where it is called God on the phone and be empowered to Almighty ) high - Carrey gets to enjoy their new "toy", and it is nice to look at, really funny. But the third act miserable beyond belief. <br /> <br /> rot starts setting after dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, which comes off very well in this film, considering it part of a plot device, even her name smacks unsubtlety) - she thinks he's going to pop "the question", but instead, he tells her (on his knees, so far), he will finally get his news anchor job, and it's not so exciting? <br /> <br /> She does not think so. She wants him to marry her, to see, so that it will be completed, leaving him, you see, despite the fact that she still loves him very much, see, and spent the rest of the film will hit us over the head with one pathetic, is heavy-handed spiritual sounding cliché after the next, until in the end, I did not pray, too. , .For this is over. <br /> <br /> I do not mind the lack of finesse in the first two acts (one example - in the 2nd act, after he gets his powers, Bruce reared in the room singing, "What if God was one of us just a slob like one of us ", blah blah blah) and I was even willing to miss the amazing amount of controversy harass us (for openers Morgan Freeman - a / k / GOD - says Bruce, he can" t violate chyyu- or free will, but it makes it a lot). These elections were forgivable - it's a comedy, Jim Carrey, directed by Tom Shadyac - it AINT Remains of the day. <br /> <br /> Or rather, should be a comedy. When writers lose track of that (in a terrible act 3) and try to turn things around at some (gag) Movie messages that we receive, instead of hell on earth. Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, he realizes that his savings GRACE - I must say that it is - grace, and that his priorities in life were severely misinterpreted. All this could be transferred to a much lesser autocratic ways, however. The film should not go into the dumper to make these points. Unfortunately, the authors and Shadyac apparently did not have the slightest idea of ​​how to solve this story in some clever ways to track your hand, so they went bang-'em-over-heads route in the hope that we do not notice. They even attached some amazingly unfunny of doubles in the end, further hoped that this will reduce the unpleasant taste. This does not work for me.
