because it is the only way that you will not think that this film is a waste of time and money. A remake of «Heaven Can Wait», (which was at least worth a look) is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy. This is more a vehicle to give Rock a while on a film for the weak to stand up comedy that does not play well on the big screen. Especially because his joke at all to be of the old man's body, fat, rich dead man, but is manifested from the Rock. He insults black and white chemistry is all wrong. The film is not funny, shoot bad acting is weak at best. Go rent «Heaven Can Wait» and live rock video, and you'll be far ahead of the game.
