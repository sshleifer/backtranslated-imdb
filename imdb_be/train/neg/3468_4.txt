Student filmmaker recruits B-class actress (and great diva-ish Ringwald!) To complete the horror that her mother (and terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) I tried to do 12 years ago. It is a curious choice of subject, to say the least, as any fan of horror Aussie knows that the genre, unfortunately not enough women directors. There's a curse on him, because Molly had to kill the psycho killer in the original set. But she came back because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there, and people start dying in the "set". Cut is an attempt at a modern Aussie "slasher", but unfortunately, nothing new or exciting to the table brings. In fact, he tears half 90s filmography of Wes Craven. Many film world of name-dropping a la "Scream" (with the exception of the Aussie name-drop - Jane Campion ... see how it's not so funny) and a lot of "this is real or is a film" about l "New Nightmare". Editing bad music annoying, funny effects, almost everything is bad about it. Fortunately, the film may have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed woman in the crew of the film tells the landlord they were filming on: "Do not worry, we will treat your home as if it were our own," to which he replies, "it does not mean anything to me, you look like you live at the dump!" Ha! And the ridiculous one-liners Molly was enough to not feel sorry about renting this one. "Do you have any diet coke here?" (As she rides in the car of Professor movie) and "Does anyone know where I can buy tofu?" (The first thing she muttered on set) and "Where the hell take, this is my agent? "(Oh wait, that's what I thought of her.)
