It was not good. The characters were not developed and the only face of the memories that I had in the previous film, which contrasts with the "new" parties (or their absence). I seriously thought that opening scene was a nightmare Ariel because of how ridiculous it was. This was serious. He just reminded me of all the annoying characters on Disney Channel every hyperactivity and history jumps from action to uncomfortable scenes without ever really connecting. <br /> <br /> himself unfortunate part was awful song, Sun catchy, is not surprising. Originally Ariel was an amazing and powerful voice and catchy songs and fun. You remember them, and I want to sing them. But the songs in the film were not creative in the least; it's like they say in annoying singsong voice is very weak, disappointing. I do not have what I want-to-sing them the feeling that you usually get from a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It's as if no one wanted to make this film, so that they barely made the effort. ,, This film will need a new story, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying "look at me! Look at me! I'm so annoying! "The mentality of this generation of Disney. : '(
