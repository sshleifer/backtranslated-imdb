I like Columbo and saw almost all the episodes, but this one definitely takes the worst of the lot. Mind surprisingly tedious, meaningless, confusing bunch of unwatchable rubbish that the waste as the time of the audience and actionable talent is extremely dull-looking Peter Falk. "Plot," such as it is, just it seems to be made up as the movie goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients in the formula that made the show such a brilliant success, to start with. One of the things that I found very confusing (or possibly annoying) was the character Peter Falk introduced to the guests at the wedding as «Lt» Columbo. If the producers insist on maintaining the first named Columbo secret why they could not omit this line as a whole, as it sounds funny? As I said, this is all well and true fans would be Columbo to do so to avoid it like the plague.
