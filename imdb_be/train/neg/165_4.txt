It is too early to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot was smaller than I thought it would be. There is still potential for the series, however. Of course, when I first saw the Voyager I thought it had potential, too - but was very disappointed. May gut tells me the company will not be as bad as the Voyager, however. <br /> <br /> As for the experiences from the pilot ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had some good ideas and good topics. I liked the introduction. opening credits show was interesting, with the progress of the study and a fitting theme song. Scott of the wonderful in the role of captain. <br /> <br /> Where is falling short for me was to a large extent, that history is not enough to "feel" setting on a big adventure. The plot of the episode itself was a "total" Trek story with themes of "intelligence" and "the first step towards space" simply plot and subtext. If you strike out references to this being the first deep space mission, the plot is difficult to distinguish between eras Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central plot does not reflect and pay tribute to the large series of topics. <br /> <br /> The plot is launching the first mission would be big enough without "action". Instead of isolated references to the novelty of the research, they could be history. Get a little nostalgic and philosophically (oh, for a TV show that would once again make us think). Make us feel the excitement of the "wind", being on the "sea" rather than to distract us salvation and numerous skirmishes. It was too much of a firefight. <br /> <br /> We had the feeling that people were more "newcomers" in the designated school. The new low on the block, rather than venturing into largely unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons have landed on our doorstep for us to find them . this meeting could be much more than a historical and sociological. just how two such different societies interact not only hint about it, show it! <br /> <br /> I had to think of it as a way to `akward crew and control technology "as opposed from` first bold steps in nevyad suit. "I wanted to see something newer and fresher. Series promises to be a new concept, but so far I have not seen this new, great concept. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I repeat the feeling that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Baku perfectly. Blalock has potential. The common theme is the most interesting, since we first saw Kirk in the world before Apollo 11. Unless future episodes can do justice to this great and excellent topic, we will have show, which will create new legends. <br /> <br /> you shoot from a bow into the air ... Good luck Captain Archer <br /> <br /> For manufacturers: .. more risks and make us * THINK *! :-)
