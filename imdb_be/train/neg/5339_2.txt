OK, so I, like most people, give me free tickets and I'll go and see most of the things now that multiplexes so good (I remember the old "flea pit" single screen movie theater, and I am a healthy 40 side). In England, the film was released as a "liar", the dog. This total waste good celluloid. 4/10 for and install a photo only.
