Well, let me say that I did not expect the film starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, everything I asked for it had to be a cinematic ... and it was not even that. It looks like someone's bad home movies. Poor acting, screenplay, and top to bottom with nudity unnattractive most people I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> «plot» The film focuses on a family of low class, who decide to go on "Jerry Farrelly Show", to discuss a number of cases of mother, daughter, step-father and the groom's daughter. From there, the film runs out of steam and grows in a unique experience. white trash porn Ibid cattle sex, Interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife (Yuk!) this movie inspired me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision, at least, it was mercifully short Disgusting and.. humiliating. African working class America should be offended. (Howard Stern should be set flax nevertheless, he did not squander his attempt to film his star was smart, funny and interesting) <br /> <br /> MY GRADE:. F + (the daughter was hot)
