First of all let me say that I have been thinking a lot about posting a comment for this movie. Best review for this kind of movie can only be silent. The film appealed to housewives and grandmothers. This film tries to look "real" characters and must assume "real people". Italian never have thought that the signs can be "real": they just "low-profile" stereotypes. This gives a very misguised vision of what life in the Italian countryside. The plot is weak (the story? What is the story?), And humor not tell anyone older than 12 years.
