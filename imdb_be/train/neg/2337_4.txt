I do not know what the hype around it ... This is a really bad film ... he did not do anything for me, but the descent stage, where everyone comes together at a party, and a good song is playing, elevates mood and rhythm of a good cinematic footage that make you go .... it was the best part of the movie ... otherwise this film lacks all to suck the viewer into the story is not there, there is nothing to think about how some people say that there is no cohesion between the different stories ... it was more of an attempt to re-make Anderson's "Magnolia" Who was brilliant, but it is not obvious ... Well, it's simple and easy to watch, but that, too, MovieClips. Perhaps the first to write a story before you make a film ... 4/10 One of the worst of Belgian films that I've seen
