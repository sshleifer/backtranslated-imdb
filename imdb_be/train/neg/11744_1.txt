After finally watching the film as a whole, I am completely taken aback by the love he received from critics and Internet users. This is the worst Western ever? No, I would not say that. But "the last great American West," a phrase that I have seen, is applied to it more than once? Not even close. <br /> <br /> The film, which tries to tell the story of how it should be believable characters who speak dialogue believable and the dialogue in the film is one of the template and the template that I have ever seen. The film can be measured in groaners per minute; how many times an actor or actress is forced script to say that not a single person would not say in real life? There are so many cases where it is that it's distracting. Funny lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal and often. <br /> <br /> If the bad dialogue does not bother you, then how about the bad shootings? Few westerns can show you gunfighting, it is very unlikely while desperately trying to get you to take action seriously. It's normal if there is a comic edge to such gunfighting, for example, in the Silverado, but the tombstones are very set and very rigid choreography early skirmish is just another reason to leave the film in the list of good westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director in this regard, but by the time I was so disinterested in the film, what kind of savings <br /> <br /> In addition to these shortcomings, I can say that the visuals are stunning. - the film beautifully shot and settings all look fine. Acting is passable, especially given the fact that the actors are allowed to work. However, if you are looking for the last of the great American West, do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
