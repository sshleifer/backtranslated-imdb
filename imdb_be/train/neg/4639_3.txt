Eyes Werewolf (1999) really bad movie. The room was really good, but the execution was terrible in general. I would like the filmmakers took their time to this project, rather than rushing it into production. Some blind man gets new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to the middle of the old werewolf. Ugly things start to happen to a guy, he turns into a creature that looks cheesy. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is this strange little troll who helps him, and that this female cop? If you really want to know, check your eyes werewolf! <br /> <br /> Or is not a bad idea for the film. I just wanted to be filmmakers spent a lot of time on trial before they decide to make a film.
