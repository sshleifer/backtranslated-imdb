It is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. If so Hollywood ever made a successful film that attacked the Republican? Why do not they learn. Dixie Chicks not. These Lefties live in their own bubble of luxury, the interaction between them; ignoring the fact that most of America is much further to the right than they are. <br /> <br /> the best Hollywood productions entirely partisans and rarely political in general. <br /> <br /> Aykroyd imitation of Cheney was bad. <br /> <br /> I would have thought Cussack could have landed the best films. <br /> <br /> It was not funny.
