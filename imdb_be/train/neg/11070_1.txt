It was a really bad movie. The "Cole" played by Michael Moriarty was the biggest reason for that flopped, the actor felt that conjure up incredibly uncomfortable southern drawl to this character more evil, it is not. After about 20 minutes I wanted to speech therapist to make an appearance, it would add some honesty <br /> <br /> -. 1) bad acting - 2) unsympathetic characters - 3) razor thin plot line <br /> <br /> Ugh! <br /> <br />
