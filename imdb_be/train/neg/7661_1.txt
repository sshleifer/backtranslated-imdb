The name of the film the worst of all time, one that gets handed out quickly and often. Most of the time this is an exaggeration of fact, but I would like to welcome Alone in the dark in a short list of real candidates :. Plan 9 from Outer Space, Battlefield Earth, and The Adventures of Pluto Nash <br /> <br /> I watched 90 minutes of opening, I found it difficult to even sleep even while I was trying so hard to laugh at a movie. But, unfortunately, I felt alone in the dark (I was going to try to avoid the pun, but I could not resist), I looked around, hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Unfortunately my friends and I had to provide the comedy throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about the effects and consequences, so that there should be only positive part of the film. The film contains the evil creatures that cross between the Xenos in Aliens (they even call them Xenos), and creatures in Pitch Black. Can become invisible at random (and I assure you that this is random), and the light hurt. Also small centipede creatures, which are used to control the people who turn them into something that looked like a zombie. They are all shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. Scenes chaotic and impossible to follow. People accidentally shooting a scene on a blue screen or a blank set for the monsters that were inserted into the post. The light flashes rapidly a dark screen making your pupils burning with fatigue during bad rock music booming in the background. <br /> <br /> And it was the high point. The story revolves around the paranormal investigator (Slater), whose ideas are looking for hard wearing black wife beater Tshirt with trench coat and not to shave for 2 days. Archaeologist (Reid), which is a pretty inept. A government agent (Dorff) whose lines include barking order. All three should be ashamed of their performances (not that they really ever did a good job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater should be lovers in the film, I think. The film contains only the most uncomfortable love scene I've ever seen on film in between. <br /> <br /> Then there is the story. Quiet open parts that make sense are not interesting at all. The rest illogical at best. Bore portion may include collective ego of the three stars. The film begins with text and voice, explaining the background. This discovery takes more than a minute, and have the audience knows they are in for something terrible. This discovery story later repeated adnausem in awkward dialogue in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion to the end of the film. And the ending entirely make an ounce of sense. Moreover, it does not make sense in the world of the film, it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the direction of Uwe Boll. A shame, that's all that can be said. His use of camera shake to simulate the unknown. His absence from the direction of the actors. Just watch Reid in the scenes in which she is the center of attention of the shot. Spending money on special effects bullet time effects. And, finally, he prefers to use voice over to explain what should be painfully obvious to the audience. <br /> <br /> I paid for $ 1.50 to see this show on the second theater perspective. And while I laugh and my friends presented made worth every quarter I would advise people not to pay more for this film. Take about 3 friends and split the cost of rent and to break this new film. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Uwe Boll. Ashamed Tara Reid. Ashamed Christian Slater. Ashamed Stephen Dorff. Shame on those who have been associated with this film.
