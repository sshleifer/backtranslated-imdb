The first 45 minutes, Dragon Fighter perfectly acceptable and surprisingly watchable. The characters believable and interesting. Cloning lab looks really high-tech. After that, it all falls apart. Characters start behaving idiotically, and introduces a new storyline out of nowhere about a thermonuclear reactor (which is supposedly "today") comes a critical, single site study that is what it takes to kill a dragon - only it doesn "t. The finish is extremely weak. I wonder what made a film that started so well so turn right. <br /> <br /> All the characters, except for Dean Cain playing Russian. This results in some strange situations, and details like a character that plays Wessel Dimitrova called "Bailey Kent", in spite of its strong emphasis (and, in spite of it, in one case, inexplicably switch to * Spanish *! ). <br /> <br /> due to a decent start, I thought the rating of the film 5, but it was actually more than disappointing, so I just give it a 4.
