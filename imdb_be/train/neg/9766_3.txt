Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was single-handedly responsible for some of my favorite horror movies ever (as adaptation of Edgar Allen's "The Masque of the Red Death" and "The Pit and the Pendulum"), as well as some unbearably cheap and tacky rubbish schlock (eg, "Being Haunted Sea "and" She's Shark Reef "Gods). Corman also made several films that are simply in which everything and just put ?? ?? almost impossible to judge correctly." trip ", for example, as well as imaginatively titled" Gazprom c-c-c 'may be labeled as more psychedelic operation. In other words, they are incredibly strange hippie-culture under the influence of films. half the time you do not get any idea about what's going on, who are the characters who walk back and forth across the screen and where the hell is the whole thing going. The plot is simple and together in order to be very effective: a strange but deadly nerve gas accidentally unleashed and quickly annihilate the entire world population over the age of 25. It * may * be a basic prerequisite atmospheric, gritty and nail bitingly suspenseful post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi milestone . but the writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a "hypnotic" road movie comedy. None of the characters are not even trying to prevent the inevitable future of death; they just partying on the streets and found a small juvenile crime syndicates. "Gas-s-s-sÂ» is depressingly tedious and trying too hard to be strange. The whole scenario seems to be improvised on the spot, and not at all funny. Not exactly my cup of tea, but the film does have a loyal fan and a lot of fans, so who am I to say it is not worth your time and money?
