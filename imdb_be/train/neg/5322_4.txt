There are two types of 1950s musicals. Firstly you have MGM glossy production with big names and excellent music. And then you have a minor league to the lesser-known actors, and lesser-known music directors of the second course. "The girl can not help" refers to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell and Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was known for her ... well, never mind. It seems that every decade has its share After Dereks or Pamela Andersons. Plot itself is as thin as a razor, and one can not help suspect that it is basically an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard and others from the 1950s rock bands that appear in the film. When the music appeals to you it's worth a look. If not, do not worry.
