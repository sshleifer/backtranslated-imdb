WOW! I did not know that someone would do this movie! it's awful! I wrote down 5 things that can be said, why do not want to see this movie <br /> <br /> â„– 1 :. "His biggest rave ever," where is it that a rave? I could see only a few people dancing around .. <br /> <br /> 2. If they are at a rave, they can only see the blood everywhere, no people, destroyed two tents and a stage .. and what they are doing! ? they drink! <br /> <br /> 3.the worst actors I've ever seen! Captain and his team .. awful! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the men fired conventional weapons, it shoots up to 30 times without rebooting! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that everyone in the world would like to fight like a pro! should be a new thing .. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that the manufacturer thinks! "It will be a great success, it was going to be a classic" .. am sure stupid s ** t is still not see this movie, its a waist of time. My eyes are still bleeding!
