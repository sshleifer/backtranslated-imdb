Pallbearer, frustrated and sometimes very sad with a love story that just does not work partly with casting Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow goes through the entire film with a confused expression on his face and it is difficult to say that David Schwimmer even see it. <br /> <br /> However, Pallbearer, sometimes funny scenes especially the church and group scenes with his friends are laughing, but that's basically it. See Pallbearer for those scenes, only forward and at rest. Believe me, you're not missing much.
