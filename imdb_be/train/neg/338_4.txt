Definitely one of the smaller films eccentric Eddie Murphy is raving about the stolen mystical child, three hundred year old dragon and the "elite". <br /> <br /> Murphy is "elected" on the issue, as well as the opening song says that he is "the best man in the world." Who found the lost and missing children, he went over to the mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis), who tells him that he was "elected" and that it is his destiny to find and save the "Golden Child". After all, if the child dies, responsiveness to die with him, since he is the bearer of compassion. <br /> <br /> If all this hocus-pocus junk did not spoil you now is, of course, will be, as soon as the movie begins. Suffice it to say that the plot is disgusting and destroys the entire film. Is destined to become another means (comedy is not so great, mind you) for selfish Murphy brand of humor, the film works on many levels. Even Charles Dance as an evil Sardo Numspa can not do much for the proceedings. Very silly and frustrating <br /> <br /> Sunday December 12, 1993. - TV
