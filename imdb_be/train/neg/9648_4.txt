Vipul Shah made some really impressive work as a director in the past. "Train - The Race Against Time» and «Namaste London» were interesting and fun to watch. «Singh Is Kinng» was fun, that he made. His last outing in for both his career as a director weak tariff «London Dreams». <br /> <br /> «London Dreams» is a mediocre story, it's about how the success of turning the friendship into hatred. I agree, it has the potential, but if you look «London Dreams» Are you wondering what's going on? This film is probably the worst climax lately. Vipul Shah writer puts Vipul Shah directed downward. <br /> <br /> The first hour of sad, The second hour is better; but again a terrible climax. As someone who can forgive the man who decided to destroy you? I will not. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask for forgiveness to his diaper buddy, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. If he reaches India, rather than slapping or abusing his Salman welcomed him with a group of Baha, and says that he was the cause of the entire fiasco? Vipul Shah's intention was to show the character of Salman as a god? If yes, than you have completely failed. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is that you would welcome the man who killed you with such a great reception? Write what you feel, do not deceive our audience {}, we are smart enough to understand that it's good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a musical, but the music of Shankar-Eshaan-Loy scary. Neither the song remains in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman wonderful, though. He carries the film on his shoulders, and makes it very, very well in the emotional scenes. But again, his character appears as a God that makes him look like a retard in the end. Ajay equally well, but Salman too obscured it completely. Aspens in vain, and that a great talent like Om Puri doing in this film? Rannvijay ham, although Aditya Roy Kapur equal. Brinda Parekh in order as a vamp. <br /> <br /> In general, this dream remains a dream!
