My wife and I have just finished watching BÃ»su otherwise Booth. She fell asleep during some parts of the film. I really wanted me to take a nap with her, but the sad fact that the voice of the protagonist is so loud and grating, it was impossible for me to sleep. When our hero says, it makes me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner singing karaoke. In addition, it has no redeeming qualities. I was hoping that it will bring down the bus five minutes into the film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love Asian horror cinema, but Booth is very annoying and full of scenes that really does not make any damn sense. If you want a good Asian cinema, check out the story of two sisters, or in the mirror. Booth Avoid like the plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
