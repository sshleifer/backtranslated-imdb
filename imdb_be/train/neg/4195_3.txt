In view of the people involved, it is difficult to understand why this movie should be so messed up and dim. The author, David Ward, wrote strange caper film "The Sting" two years later, Jane Fonda has just won an Academy Award for Klute, and Donald Sutherland has just done an excellent job in such films as "Klute", "Start the Revolution Without Me" and "Heroes Kelly." For all sites, the film is a tale capers, with a small band of bumbling losers planning a big robbery. At the same time, the film wants to be a hip satire, a series of comic sketches such as that TV show NBC «Saturday Night» will do the same two years later. A bad result is that the plot does seem awkward comedy bits and internally incoherent and comedy bits destroy any expectation that robbery could have. It is literally a film that keeps breaking in itself, as well as cars in cars in demolition scenes to work with each other. <br /> <br /> The only real interest to me was watching Jane Fonda. Her «Iris Caine» should be light-hearted version of its dramatic nature prostitute Bree Daniels in «Klute» However, no one believes her for a moment. It is always pretending to be a prostitute, Jane Fonda, which we observe. It's like a bad play for her performance in «Klute» was terrific. It would be a good lesson for existing teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or miserable. This suggests that the actors are only as good as their writers and directors.
