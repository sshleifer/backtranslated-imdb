I though it would be a good movie, because I love zombies and horror movies in general. But I do not think it would be such a piece of sh! T, as it were. Only zombies in the film is at the beginning, and he gets hit in the damn car !!! The film looks to be written by the director of porn and filled with porn actors, I would never call them actors! Costumes seem stolen from a local school games. It seems like a road movie with almost no monsters. There is no pleasure at all in this part of sh! T, only horror, but not as much as the director intended. I would like to be raped by a pedophile than watch this movie ever again !!! ugh!
