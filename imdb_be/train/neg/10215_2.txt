Awful sense and, worse, boring film. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, without any signs outside the stereotypes of the most unimaginative, and relies on clumsy central concept which is neither particularly original nor seen clearly in an innovative way. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is completely lost in what he probably hoped that his response to Jim Carrey The Truman Show, and inserts their usual quarrel routine (admittedly, very funny, if you discount Talledega nights) for, well, pretty much nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is not more than a little annoying (some reviews that I read here it is her Oscar nomination funny) while Maggie Zhillenhol does a passable job with a very weak script, which allows Sun nothing but the creation of the character, as a former law student who dropped out of Harvard to become a baker, because she loved to make people happy. Please. What she ultimately falls on the "character" Ferrell is totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster attempts to encourage film with computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired material, it should work. <, Br /> <br /> I had a choice: either go to watch Prestige for the third time or see it. I would opt for the prestige.
