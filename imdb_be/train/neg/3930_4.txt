Second Renaissance Part 1, let's show you how the machine first rebelled against the people. It all starts with a single case in which the machines claim they have the right to life as well, while people say the robot is that they have and, therefore, can do anything with it want. <br /> <br /> Although the interesting premise, the story gets really silly since then with (violent!) riots between robots and humans. Somehow this another reviewer points out it's all a bit too clever, but does not seem right. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix stories that are close to the core of the matrix (in particular Osiris) to work for the best, As to the second Renaissance Part 1, I would say that it is too strong and too stupid. 4/10.
