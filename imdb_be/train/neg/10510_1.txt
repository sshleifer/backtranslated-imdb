oh, where to begin ...... bad acting .... characters you just do not care about ... they are American or English ... they seem to think they are in America, because somewhere in a vast forest in the midlands ... <br /> <br /> one big fault ... they are driving all night through the woods ... if they are not going around and around they were in Scotland, came the morning .. if whiny one knocks the poor woman wandering over .... <br /> <br /> and they have cell phones do not work .. so that they do break up ... of course, make it easier to be removed so ... three to go for a house that could be there in the middle of nowhere and the two stay behind to "care" for the unconscious women ... so that they do not make it convenient, softens her head, cover it or move it a prosperous road they just leave it lying on the hard road, while they go and make a fire 100 yrds away .... and all the time they have a van campers they could put it in ... <br /> <br /> and horny angels to be coveted the human race so much that they were expelled from heaven to live among us ... so what do they do? start a sexual relationship with any of the people that they face? ......... no, they do not bite huge chunks of them and rip their heads ... I think they are missing the point ... <br /> <br /> this is not devoid of great sexy ex angels, they are cannabalistic vampires ... and as for Savinykh saying how they breath takingly beautiful .... but these girls have a good body, but nothing special in the face department. the leading role was much more significant than these so-called irresistible siren ... <br /> <br /> trash film waste Â£ 2,30 from my local library ...
