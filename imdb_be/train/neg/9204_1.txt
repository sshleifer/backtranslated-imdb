I've seen this movie many times (and the movie recently read a book based on) and every time I see this, I just want to slap all four of them. The fact that they are not the key to the fact that Tom Hanks's character throws his D & D (oops M & M) :) person ( "Oh, he's just acting in character.") Beyond the game session. That and the fact that after three months of treatment, let's just destroy everything and feed it nonsense! This kind of people that give a bad name RPGs. <br /> <br /> In addition, the banal "love ballad", and the music is "cat piano" and "stop us if we get too annoying," is almost enough to set your teeth on edge!
