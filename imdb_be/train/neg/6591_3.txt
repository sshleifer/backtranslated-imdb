This is the sound Stan and Ollie spinning in their graves. <br /> <br /> I will not enumerate the main disadvantages of this film, they are so obvious that they are without words. Little things like this to be "all-new adventure Laurel and Hardy", in spite of the stars has been dead for more than thirty years, when it was made. Little things like this. <br /> <br /> A good idea is to have actors playing buffoons, which just so called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as it is, it might work. For a really bad idea, try casting two actors embody the duo. Well, they may qualify for nephews, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Well, forget his stupid foreigner "Cousin Larry" in a perfect chip Alien, and look at it in True Romance. Here, though, it stinks. It's probably not his fault, and, as a director and supporting actor - all who better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money. There are those who say the Americans, it is difficult to learn effective English accent. This reason does not help here Pinchot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistan? Only trademark squeal STE he approaches, though, as the screeching exaggerated to the point of boredom, there is nothing to write home about. Gaylard Sartain doing a little better, Ollie, though it is to say that even worse - stepping in dog dirt or blow to the castanets? <br /> <br /> Remember the originals with them a second time, intuitive collaboration and congenital loveability? Well, it is absent, replaced by two old and stupid jokes so you can park the bus rolled through the gaps. While the originals are areas that can be summed up in a few panels, this one has some long-winded Mummy scam (and what a lousy name!), Which is mixed with the script fraternity boys. I can not say that I saw each of Laurel and Hardy's 108 movies, but I think it's a safe bet that even their Nadir leagues ahead of it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main problem lies in the fact that the originals were sort-play themselves, or at least using their own accents. This at least felt natural and unforced, unlike contrived cartoons Pinchot and Sartain shown. And since when did Stan make malapropisms, and so much for what? "I'm going to give you a permanent cremation"; "I would like to marinate my friend." Enough! <br /> <br /> Only distinctive point is a reference to Bose clown, a cartoon character, which is divided Harmon Larry L & H comics. Harmon, of course, bought the author's name (as disconcerting to see Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was a director and producer of this travesty. <br /> <br /> Questions abound. Will Stan and Ollie do fart gag when they were alive today? Will they be mummies glass with broken bottles? In Stan's time to give in the genital organs with a spear, and at the end of the big CGI-finals? Let's hope not. <br /> <br /> I laugh once, but I think that just at a loss how terrible it all. Why this film was made in the first place? Who are the creators would think like that? Possibly the worst film I've ever seen, absolute disgust I grew sick to look after only the first five minutes. It is about as fun as having your head is trapped in a vise, and a red-hot poker and nettle forcibly inserted into your anus.
