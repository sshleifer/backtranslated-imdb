Where to start? special effects should be named special defects, when the director yelled "action" I think he also said, the actor spends worst performers, they might think. Maybe he was annoyed with the producers, and wanted to make sure that they do not recover a single cent of their investments, and that the work is an example of how not to make a film. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant, but his family would not let him. <br /> <br /> One thing is sure, that the one who uses it in the future, because its in love with him (because of his objectivity jumped through a window), or because it has changed its name and has removed all previous previous links.
