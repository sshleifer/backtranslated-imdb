This is a rip-off from the same litter, we had to watch Bob Saget host for half an hour before. Dave Coulier just thought it was funny, and it was pretty much the same show, as America's Funniest Home Videos except with the hosts, who have a combined IQ of three. Kithain must really need the money and Coulier had to go in the trash for their jokes. That was enough torture to see him imitate Popeye and other cartoon begins washed Full House. This is one dude who played all the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a class A Wedgie Coulier must have needed money to please Alannis Morisette at the time they met.
