Wow. This film is boring trousers to me when I saw him. Bland, senseless and motionless. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Ash and co. can travel (a lot ?? "Princess Mononoke") There they meet stupid guy named Sam, and the "story" begins in time with the "spirit of the forest." <br /> <br /> So, how (Ash) and Huck (SEM) buzz with nature, to become a hippie and try to free Celebi ( "Spirit") by some eccentric guy hunter. I do not even know what else went on. All passed in a blur. Ash's friends were hardly in it, and all the action scenes were boring. <br /> <br /> After you have saved the day, Ash and his friends heinous, must return to my time watching Sam sail with Celebi (this scene was just awful OO;). Then, after returning to his time, Ash discovers that his new friend is actually the grandfather of his opponent. And I think it is. Pretty retarded is not it? If you love your children, you will not expose them to this. (1 of 10)
