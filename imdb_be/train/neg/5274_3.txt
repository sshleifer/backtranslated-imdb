If you like movies about horrific cities, hotels, homes, states (ala eagles «Hotel California»), etc., have people who are "just passing through", read almost any novel by Stephen King instead. If you want to install "disappearance" start reading "desperation" of the king, but also check out "The Shining", "Lot of Salem" and "Needful Things". <br /> <br /> crow motif, desert, driving the family desperate to escape or avoid ownership tired. Why do not they just make a movie from the novel "Despair"? Maybe they came to the king, and he has rejected? It should be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Hamlin look happy to be reunited, and they both were well over the years, but they still have TV and direct-to-DVD caliber actors.
