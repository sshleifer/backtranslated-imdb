This anime series starts big: Interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Not all at once explained, hanging on the proverbial carrot in front of the audience, forcing the viewer to watch every other episode. But imagine the disappointment to find that the sci-fi thriller / giant robot adventure only the background for the psycho-babble and quasi instructive operation. If you want to hear, "You are right. It's good to have you. "After the combat readiness of the negative slogans and negative emotions the characters, then this is for you. If you want a good sci-fi film, which is just fun to watch, forget it. Both the original and alternate endings were greatly disappointed me. All this, and the film was too didactic.
