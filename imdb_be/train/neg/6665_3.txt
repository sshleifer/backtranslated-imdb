Well, the story - a simple-crazy part of life bored to death of the young chick and her younger brother, and damages in their lives - it gently interesting. Anyway, the idea is nothing (they all have some kind of ...) - Implementation of all, <br /> <br /> This is what bothers me with this movement .. It really bothers me very much. Rhythm (directing, editing) slow pace was uneven and the culmination is expected. We have seen this damn highway five, six, seven times - why? trouble Norton character seen as child's play, not deep enough to understand his problems / soul / R and rooting for or against him. He is a coward, manipulator or just crazy? References to "Taxi Driver" was ridiculous and unnecessary, and probably not in favor of this flick (or EN on this issue). <br /> <br /> And IMHO, this cowardly executed at the end. Cheap emotional tricks for teenagers fans somewhere in the middle of America. This guy was supposed to kill the boy, accused the father, to create chaos. Or the child's father had to kill at the end, and so on, but no, we got cheese ending where children miss crazy, father puzzled over their own lives and relationships with them and crazy, you know, dying. Happy family problem remains unharmed, safely and happily bored again, so we can enjoy our pop-corns, serene. <br /> <br /> And the scene where the crazy part of the film, oh, my God, I would have to think long and hard to find anything more stupid than this! You do not shoot a scene with a hidden camera and hidden command. The creators of this film, probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you are not 16 years old girl somewhere in Kansas, or anywhere that there would be nowhere and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice her age, well, then you might enjoy this film and his "message" .
