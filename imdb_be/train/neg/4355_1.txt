Horrible. I see a lot of comments from users about how wonderful this show. It really Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan forgery. Lame jokes like ... and funny plot. The actors are obviously struggling to be funny, and probably cringing when they hit those terrible punchlines (if you can call it that). The bulk of the other users who commented, obviously from another planet (or, at least, on another continent). There are, obviously, thinks that television companies to cancel the show ... and none of that something is not right when the show well. Make sense? Anyway, stay away - even if there is rain, and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to do ... go stand in the rain, not - more fun.
