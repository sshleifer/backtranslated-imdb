This film is really great. He dives through banality to shit at this speed you can not see even the common sense and common decency of humanity rushed to go by. But it does not stop there! This film falls into the bottom of the barrel so much bounces back to the point of absurd comedy: here's how to square wannabe Beergutted Conan excessive richness neck brace his hair material brandished a sword, as there is no tomorrow (and the way he swung, I was really impressed with it * was * tomorrow for him, or, at least, his beer belly). Do not miss this movie, this fantastic travel about idiocy, and just bloody mind! And once you've finished watching this, dry the tears of joy (or a tear of disappointment at such a clumsy attempt of the narrator) from your eyes, because some stupid f00l gave these people an additional $ 5 to make a sequel!
