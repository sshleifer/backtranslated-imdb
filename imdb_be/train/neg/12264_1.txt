You get 5 writers together, each write a different story with a different genre, and then try to make a film with him. This action is an adventure, it's a sci-fi, it's a western, it's a mess. Sorry, but this film is absolutely stinks. 4.5 awefully gives it a high rating. Nevertheless, it's a movie like this, it makes me think I could write a movie, and I can hardly write.
