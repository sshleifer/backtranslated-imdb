Author excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this film was a small disappointment. It seemed too short. He spent too much time, creating an atmosphere of Hovis, and laughed at by Catholic demands. Then pretty soon you have a fascist and socialists vie for the attention of the family, and a terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> However, my wife thought that Lee was cute.
