I love the 80s slasher clicks, and I remember, when «Silent Night / Deadly Night» was pulled out of our houses, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of them on Fear.net. You better watch was what I have come to expect from these types of movies. Quality special effects are laughable by today's standards, the character development is too long, but overall it was laugh out loud funny! <br /> <br /> scene where he plays, because Santa, aka Dad, feels his mother, and then, when the crowd actually shown lighting torches - not lanterns, as if in the 80s, but these torches! - really tickled my funny bone. However, the scene where he checked on the children in their area gave me a terrible feeling of a different nature. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these character actors were. It took me a while to realize that the main character was a cute teddy bear on the brothers.
