Maybe you should not compare, but the Wild Style and Style Wars original Hip Hop. Beat Street has many original artists of the early hip-hop, but they were obviously clear that this could be their big break, of course, for some it was a good thing. But if we consider it as an original hip-hop culture, you are wrong. It is superfluous and has a dressing Hollywood. It is likely to seek in the first two films I mentioned. They convey the grain that comes to life in the ghetto. Thus, the rating for this film is low, but mostly positive reviews, or even nonsense. This is probably because, although the history of acting, dialogues and direction of all the terrible, music and dance is what people love about it. I, I love dancing, but at the time it was thought that electricity was the death of hip-hop (I was so glad when all 86 new generation and classic hip hop artists appeared as Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic MCs, Jungle Brothers, biz Markie to name a few), and I still do not like the majority of strokes in this film, and that's why it does not work for me. I mean, Wild Style has so much history, but music has a large and real. Of course, the taste and color, and that's good. But, as I understand it, this film is garbage to break and some of the music, with the exception, so I can not rate it higher than 4 out of ten.
