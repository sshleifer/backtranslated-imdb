If you have not seen it yet, I say just move on, take a walk in the park, do not waste your time. Neither the script nor the actors play worth your money. * Spoiler * - I can not decide which is worse: the movie itself or the hair Baldwin? Pompey acting talent is very doubtful, I hope she can improve it for a long time. The storyline is just incredible. Loose Cannon American police combat criminals in Europe on its own ?? Infamous mobster Slavic protected only two misers ??? Emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang ??? Spanish police executive stupid sack of hammers ??? Give me a break. There's only one good thing about this film, though: at least, the production costs should be lower than the "Ocean's 12" 's, which was just as meaningless, and over the top, like this one.
