If you ever wanted to see a movie that emphasizes style over substance, this is for you. For me, Son de Marie beautifully the SEE, but there is very little substance if corny, melodramatic, manipulative love thread will not turn you on. This may be one of those famous "chick flicks" you've heard so much about. <br /> <br /> We are about halfway through the film, before anything is actually happening: Ulises (mol) out to sea, looking for tuna, and never returned, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling) and son to fend for themselves. Then, in the frenzied six minutes of screen time, they hide of Ulises, Martin gets married again, and her son is growing in the middle childhood. This rapid transposition shock to say the least, and very messy: after 40 minutes more or less stick, we suddenly into full-scale melodrama, all six minutes. I think it is called willful narrative Shagan <br /> <br /> In five years, Ulises. (How to stray superhero Ulysses ;? Get it), returns to his "Penelope" (Watling) only to find that she was married to a Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), inexplicably rich guy (he does to earn all that dough ?), who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets. If by Martina, in the heat of anger, Ulises questions about his absence, he tells her that he would take her on Sumatra island, someday, and she'll understand <br /> <br /> And that's the point :. He doesn "T take it to the island of Sumatra. Link just dying somewhere in the script. He does not explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years. He did not justify itself as an honorable guy and the movie does not fill the plot holes, which looked at us, at least half of the film. I can only assume that the director Bigas Luna wants us to fill the storylines with mystical keys (fish, reptiles, sea), it offers through the spectacular cinematography and evasive dialogue. It just does not work. The story "arc" on the film ends more like a wobbly rope. <br /> <br /> I'm sure mole good actor, but I just could not buy it Ulises as any kind of hero (Ulysses that the original should have been). With wet sensuality, he spews a short verse of poetry by Virgil identical to about 2,000 times, and each time he excites Martin to explosive orgasm. This guy has to be rented revive stale marriages. I am sure that Virgil would have been impressed. He did not fuck that often, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> figures of this poetic "Device" prominently in the film, and I had no choice but to assume that it is a known sex reversal "siren songs of Ulysses" (that is, beautiful girls sing seductively into the far sailors who have been convicted, when they meet, well, the siren call). If this is something that Bigas Luna, yes, you can see the problem - it offers the mysterious symbols in an attempt to snatch-and-capture at a high art. Once again, it just does not work, at least in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Watling beautiful and magnetic young actor, but it gives us a character who does not seem to have a lot of intellectual and even romantic depth. It's me, how could she desperately in love with a guy who sports a sign of rent on his face (as in vacant), greasy hair of the 1960s style, which is more like a weed, and one of these "beards fashionable twenty-first century '( you know, four days of growth, no more, no less). He must be a dreamy kind of guy (I think), but these are his eyes suggest that he may suffer more from excessive absurd scenario. <br /> <br /> But do not despair, this film a pleasure to watch. Just do not try to connect the dots on red herrings, or think too much about what you hear on the path of dialogue. You can make the lost fast forward to this film (especially in the first 40 minutes), and you really do not miss much.
