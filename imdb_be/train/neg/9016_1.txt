Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi Channel (although I believe it is now called Syfy?) The original film I have ever seen. But I've seen one or two others, because, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but it really scratch the bottom of the barrel. CGI made bad acting is bad, the script is funny and what is happening at the end of a sudden and absurd (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean, I do not want to put a spoiler in my review). Furthermore, there was a musical tune which has been used to a large extent of each dangerous sequence. It was really stupid; they just played it over and over again. And it certainly is not original; I know that I've heard that somewhere before (I just can not remember where). This is one to avoid.
