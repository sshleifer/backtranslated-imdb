Natural Born Killers (1994) <br /> <br /> Film Cut: R <br /> <br /> Cut Director: NC-17 <br /> <br /> This is an unusual picture of Oliver Stone, but when I read he was on drugs at the time of filming, I did not need further explanation. "Natural Born Killers" risky, crazy, all of filmmaking that we do not get very often; . Weird, psychotic, artistic photos <br /> <br /> «Natural Born Killers" basically the story of how two mass murderers were popularized and glorified in the media; there is a great scene where the interviewer questions about some teenagers Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager said: "Murder is wrong .... but as I was a mass murderer, I'd Mickey and Mallory Mickey describes this situation," Frankenstein (monster). and Dr. Frankenstein "- Dr. Frankenstein media, which turned them into these monstrous murderers <br /> <br /> Most of the Oliver Stone movie to explore the vices America, a country that loves and admires the director I think," Natural Born killers "is. about the influence of media, technology and how obsessive like atsyi Americans (and most countries) over things such as mass murderers and strange situations. <br /> <br /> killer played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) made amazing two wonderful actors who step . in the life of two brutal killers Mickey and Mallory's interesting to think that some people are worthy of killing, possibly rigid theory of social Darwinism (survival of the fittest), - says Mickey in an interview in prison, that other commit murder, we, people to ravage other and operate around Noah environment; the script is interesting, but it is doubtful how this film is, in the sense that it makes us think about society and human behavior, rather than the intensity of 2:00 bloodshed that we saw. <br /> <br /> the last hour of the film takes place in the colony; we see the harsh realities of prison life; relationship to the caretaker, etc .; overflow prison - maybe Stone questioned the future, the way in which society is to <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters. Firstly, the reporter who runs the show on "American Maniacs" and the frenetic boosting ratings, he goes to great lengths to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. Another policeman Scagnetti, crazy, perhaps sadistic officer, who is in love with Mallory - it also has some weird obsession with mass murderers, as his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco, Texas, Charles Whitman <br />. <br /> beautiful cinematography; different colors, shadow, styles, create a feeling of disorientation; Green is the most obvious of all green, like a killer disease (in a drugstore when they are looking for an antidote to rattlesnake) <br /> <br /> The camera work is with the mind. wobbly, Buzz, it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it. Highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> «Natural Born Killers" is not glamourise existence of crazy killers, this casts doubt on it and how we as a community can supply this attribute ... <br /> <br /> Although the above overview of the sound quite positive, I do not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the screenplay for the film, was not satisfied with the edited script, and he asked that his name be removed. I can understand why. While mildly interesting from time to time, Congenital Killer mess picture. <br /> <br /> 4/10
