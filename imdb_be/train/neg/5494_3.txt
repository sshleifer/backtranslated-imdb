<br /> <br /> which looks cheap and ugly, this film does not seem to even entertain the child in the audience at a pretty funny joke toilet apart. Christopher Lloyd way past his prime minister, and in fact quite tedious in this role, although sorry excuse for authors of jokes does not help. Elizabeth Hurley strikingly amateur in a supposedly comic roles. Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There really is no reason to make this film, especially since it is inevitable that one will compare it with the often brilliant improvisations Robin Williams Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
