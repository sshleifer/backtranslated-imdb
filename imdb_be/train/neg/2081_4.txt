This film is shown again and again on cable recently, so .. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these two attractive women, to fight or Luke Wilson or equally insipid "" villain in this film. Female actress is very cute, and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I believe that it was "ridiculous" that even uglier / dorkier / stupid friend of Luke around, but it's good that this is what we get. <br /> <br /> None of the women is ever, ever talk to any of the men in this film more than 5 minutes. What do we get them weeping, and wailing, and struggle, and so on for 2 guys who are best described on Friday the 13th 4 Dead * @ $ #
