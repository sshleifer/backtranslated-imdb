Sentimental drama school in Denmark, 1969 "We Shall Overcome" offers a pathetic Danish perspective on American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Ratko), flower-force will receive a naive 13-year-old, out with half his ear hanging from the office (Bent Mezhdinga) brutal master Lindum Svendsno-in. Lindum-Svendsen, director of the school, indicated as fascistoid tyrant has the local community to manage. Lindum-Svendsen has gone too far this time, and his father, recovering from mental illness (of course, it was not enough drama already ..), and too stereotypical hippie music teacher Mr. Svale ( «Hey, call me Freddie") Fritz stands for justice. <br /> <br /> Tell me that. It's so convincing, superconducting (Me-) acted, and so full of suffering, that as a "family" is a grotesque picture with cliché's- filled with the basis for the film fails miserably to convince the non-Nordic audience. Unfortunately, polite readers Danish crash like this in your sentimental journey .. But it's definitely not a fairy tale about "a boy becomes a man to fight the system." The boy never becomes a man, and still naive, big eyes cry covering the face. If you call a church near the small town of people, led by a dictator like cartoon "system", I apologize if I do something not to be missed. <br /> <br /> If you are in family photos, to see Happy Feet instead ..
