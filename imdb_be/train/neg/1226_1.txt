My, how the mighty have fallen. Kim Basinger is a famous actress, but she's definitely the slums, when she took the role. This film is bad for one reason in particular: gaps in logic. His appearance as one of those films that would be traversed with all its plot holes, when he came out in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it just looks real silly. This thriller is the worst I've ever seen, and I could see the bone collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> The story details Della (Kim Basinger), just to get from buying gifts at the mall apa harassed by a gang of thugs who end up killing a police officer who came to her aid. Since then, she is pursued by these idiotic thugs through the deserted road, and it gets rid of them one by one with full instrumentation tools. <br /> <br /> So many things wrong with this film. As I said, this film jumps through logic at every step, and with the exception of Kim Besinzher acting made for bad TV. Damn, this pseudo-thriller made for Bad TV. How it kills each of these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, one Hispanic, one Asian and one African American all come together to pursue a Caucasian woman. Not just love America?) Ridiculous failure. How she killed Latino guy made me laugh hysterically. Sex scene with the main bully was so in left field that will make you shake your head in shame. I only recommend to fans of bad movies and no one else. Anyone else, especially supporters of Kim Basinger have been nice to have this film. You do not want to see you respect the actress in the film is bad is not it? Of course not. You have been warned.
