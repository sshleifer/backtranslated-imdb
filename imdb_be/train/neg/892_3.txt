(I will show in this review, the point where the spoilers begin.) May dissatisfaction split :. 30% tons of deafness, 70% dim letters <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the synopsis of the first commentator to the lack of diversity of the nature and volume of stories. I was surprised at how this film, at best, woefully shortchanges real NYC, presenting a collection of people and relationships, is so narrow to meet as if it is inhabited only cast Gossip Girl (this is coming from someone who loves Gossip Girl) . Several minority characters are written in the story, but they include the obligation, while we can see the gears under the film is so clear, the desire to be "diverse", but the fall is so short. <br /> <br /> 70% of all why does not hold. All characters, plus a few white minority tokens are one-dimensional, cardboard cutouts concepts people. Worse, their interaction with each other, the script in such a way that for each vignette in the film viewers were treated to what I would have said that this "gag": we get the basic conceit, some culminating intended to be clever twist. But even if we suspend the cynicism for a moment to say, "Well, it was a surprise," ... the story is not interesting, because they are also superficial. If you are a fashion story so that their existence depends solely on the surprise ending, you're a joke. <br /> <br /> Spoilers below ... <br /> <br /> The film is primarily trying to tell a romantic story. This is normal. But the romance of strange, deep, sometimes complicated. These "romantic" stories each have a girl and a boy, who at some time the same location and have to look one by one. exchange of words, thoughts are projected through the voice-over, but they are also only possible to convey to the audience only what one person is attracted to another. <br /> <br /> value, no deception (in the broad sense), without pressure, and neither confrontation nor the communication between two different wills of people who are trying to reconcile its existence to accommodate the other. Only history with superficial "Seduction" is said only that the audience ends up being surprised that the guy (Ethan Hawke) gets outwitted by a girl, he hits on, which is surprisingly a prostitute. Of course, his words when trying to pick it interesting to hear, and we had fun as we would if we were close to them, but there is nothing significant in this story outside of "A then B". So unfolds, if something like this card can "turn around", with all the other stories as well: And then B - here it is, a single point, which is that this is happening, is happening "on the set" in Manhattan. By the way, only in Brooklyn, we see a sketch of Coney Island; Only Quincy flickering of the train journey taken by the character travels in the West Village. <br /> <br /> It is easy to pick up in the films that play in all the common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on. _New York, I Love You_, however, deserves to be brought to a rigorous inspection because of its name. We expect to see the real New York, and the present resident of New York, but instead we were marching in front of us selected a piece of demographic, the characters arrived from The OC, as well as several others, to make it seem as if we pay attention to diversity. But if we take a closer who these characters all the hype becomes an insult to the very notion of diversity and ethnic groups and cultures movie shamefully unable to provide. <br /> <br /> For example, the story of a Latino man with a little white girl in the park, which gets mistaken two houses as it Manny (male nurse), when in fact he is a father. Despite the latest episode of this part was not necessary from the point of view of the design dramatically, (this would be much more interesting to finish it when the mother and boyfriend / stepfather are arrogant woman won), it opened a little disgusted that scene, in which we know for sure that the girl's father is a native of Latin America should also let us know that he is sexually desirable dancer. What, Dad can not just be some guy from South America? Now that he's obviously hot, that the public is better prepared to admit that he had a child with a middle to upper class white women? Are we really that na√Øve to claim that? As if Mexican builder is likely to be too bitter. <br /> <br /> It's not my place to dictate where the film was supposed to go. But in every conceivable setting, and plot twist, the direction taken yell status quo refers to security. All of these stories can be made more interesting, even if we were forced to keep the one-dimensionality of the characters that inhabit them, at least, not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes. Asian girl living in Chinatown being sideways to lean on an old white guy? How about Asian cougars has a white college child instead. Again, I'm not saying that all the vanity should be changed. It's just that one. pancake. story building. so cliche - and, therefore, they are unable to convey anything about why one can love New York, beyond the banal. The real way to improve the film should have to write a script to be read. <br /> <br /> I admit fun soundtrack, good Shagan film (even if what is now the pace has been, well, drags), and the general feeling of many scenes. The film was very well sit through, and I would not dissuade anyone from this. Nevertheless, this shows that the most important tribute nya-superficiality, when the old opera singer says (paraphrasing) "That's what I love New York:. All from somewhere else," Well, you do not know that from watching this one.
