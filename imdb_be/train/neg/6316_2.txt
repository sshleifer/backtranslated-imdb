The film, like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a great example of how the left in this country just do not get it. They never did. And liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing the ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy did not understand mocked up a bevy of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex English, to join his cause. Not just some of them to join the cause. By the time his movement reaches its climax, the whole league of professional and college sports have to cancel their season, as no one will play more. Just move along this review, I am willing to give them that space. Despite the fact that it will never happen in a million years, I just imagine that it can, and then go from there. <br /> <br /> I do not quite remember, but what kind of agreement will be reached, and the boy decides to return to the game he loves in an incredibly juicy and funny scene. <br /> <br /> Before you criticize the message of this film, let me say that this film is poorly written, acted and directed. Even if one agrees with the position of the boy, it would be impossible to overcome, as the film was built strongly. And that's a shame, because there are a lot of good actors who are going to waste. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex English does as he could with his character, however, and I wish he would try to be more films. Unfortunately, it is probably easier to find a job in the NBA coaching world. One wants Mr. English will teach these types of robbery NBA today, how to shoot the rock a little bit better. Alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop. <br /> <br /> As for the message in the film is concerned, it is simply wrong-headed. Plain and simple. All of these nuclear warheads hidden in these missile silos in the west warned WAR !!!!! It would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest the war or the actual use of nuclear weapons. This weapon was not actually used, and it was the genius of its existence. None of the parties during the Cold War was enough mind to shoot a projectile. Without weapons, who knows what might happen between the United States and the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The creators of this movie is clearly intended for children in the United States to take up the case and follow in the footsteps of Chuck. Kids in America, but the more intelligent than left cranks who created this dreck. <br /> <br /> The film has only 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war, Dr. Streynzhlav stick instead. <, Br /> <br /> Mr. Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
