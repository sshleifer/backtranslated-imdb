This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen, the graphics funny and pathetic scenario and the most important question is how this scenario is fairly low brow received trough the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies from the deep dramas to a more male-oriented kill everything you can see the film type, so I can not say that I'm demanding. I struggled to find something to compare it to, but I just can not think of anything that fits that may be, Starship Troopers 2. Witch in my opinion, makes the gods of cinema crying and I think about throwing me a DVD-player but compared to this its effects are great. It operates well and the script should be sentenced. You know, when the film is bad funny, but people is not one of those it kills your soul every minute.
