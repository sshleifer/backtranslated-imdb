I'm the kind of person who went to the local library and read books on Babbage difference engine while my classmates were playing soccer, etc .. So, if there is such a thing as a target audience for this film, I think, I «d probably be included in this. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just need to see it again. The previous reviewer mentioned the sun to watch this movie, while fatigue. Maybe it was my fault. <br /> <br /> I tried my best to enjoy this film, and there are aspects of it that I do like, but overall I found it to be an amateur and pretty down to earth. <br /> <br /> Being somewhat Self-confessed computer nerd, I just can not help but pick up on the exact time frame when the film was actually made, and how to use charts reflect the time (ie in 1997 year). Having played the game era C.F. "Mind Grind», to cite one example, the film can not avoid this 16-bit color low resolution multimedia explosion so far. Now, fortunately, it has decreased slightly in recent years in the gaming world, at least in favor of a real game <br /> <br /> The need to turn to watching this movie through the German FTA satellite channel (as I do not. "T think that it ever aired on British TV FTA, not recently anyway), I was a little surprised to see the end credits account Gottdog (God is a dog) had 4 people working on its design. Maybe it's the average thrust me play it, given that ten years have passed since the film was made, however, the end result makes the film from the eighties graphics look good in comparison. <br /> <br /> But, as for the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that the film deserves Hell no angle of sci-fi and a simple biographical approach would probably be better suited to cover the history of the life of this remarkable woman. <br /> <br /> There are fundamental mistakes that blow my enjoyment of the film. First of all, the basic idea that somehow lost the real information from the past can be accurately reconstructed after some extrapolation using the software-based intelligent agents, it seems like something ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In addition, the theme that runs through the film that the computing device can really predict the mechanics of all things over a period of time (eg, wind) is now known not. <br /> <br /> Thus, the Victorians might have held this view, but the work of the 20th century, Gödel proves that no mathematical system can not be completed, the work of Turing computability of borders, not to mention the chaos theory and quantum mechanics, all completely undermine these ideas, which seem to be central, as a modern explorer software should work. <br /> <br /> and finally click in the air is "programming" is just plain wrong, as mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> This film may be might be good, but at least some of the technical and scientific advice would have given the film a much needed loan of believability stakes. <br /> <br /> I will not forget the movie, though, as like "Pi" is obviously a unique piece, but too many fatal mistakes for me to really enjoy it, 3/10 from me.
