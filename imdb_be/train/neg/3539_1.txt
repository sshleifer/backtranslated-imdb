The first two films were instant Ritchie, stylish entertainment. Here he makes a foray into the last two classics ?? "The Usual Suspects" and "Fight Club" ?? and still leaves empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Despite parading himself as a cheater-mystery (with the chatter of sub-'Usual suspects "the greatest game he ever pulled convinced that he will" or whatever it was ... ) and an attempt to "Fight club" turn on which the characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film tries to maintain its interest in the second half. By the last third of the, you know, that the future lead to a dead end, and slowly tiring of it. <br /> <br /> Cons, chess and game theory all the big things, but Ritchie delves into them too superficial and too repetitive to make a lot of use of the material. <br /> <br /> the only thing that keeps the film (almost) watchable bold way Ritchie with a stage and a dynamic camera Maurice-Jones. If Ritchie stuck to the more satisfied the plot, and yielded tighter editing, there is no reason why he could not take another pleasant gangster capers. <br /> <br /> As it is, Revolver is a waste of time. Obscurity is not equal profundity. If you want to see a great movie that does not make logical sense, but it does because of this (and, incidentally, which also includes the inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) see Â«Lost Highway".
