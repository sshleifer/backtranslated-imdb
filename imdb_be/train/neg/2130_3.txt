I believe that I come late to the party. I just saw this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdie on Sky TV. I did not know existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 version of the film, when I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I've been playing for a long time, Albert, and I mean to put on an amateur production of a show, because I remember it as a lot of fun to do. I was not impressed with this new version. It just was not enough fun. It was not colorful. It was not an abundance of youth. The lighting was poor. No one seemed to mention this fact. This is not a capricious musical, it is bright and up beat. Decision coverage was poor creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of errors. I do not feel that in this version. The lighting was terrible, and dulled common characteristics. These dances seemed anemic as well. We have music videos that day. At least dance numbers must be measured to some of the best of those, or how about some of the best of Broadway. Choreographer fell asleep at the wheel, it seemed. <br /> <br /> While all the actors were extremely talented and had some really bad choice of casting. Vanessa Williams entirely Latin, and with so many talented Latin artists out there, there would be more correct to throw one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa black, beautiful and talented, but poor casting. Jason Alexander efforts were strange, he always does the intellectual work, but it just was not Albert. He was wrong and I have to distribute the roles I think it's obvious to most people who see this version. <br /> <br /> Means film is not among the herd. There must be a transfer from one medium to another. The richness and musical flash must be translated into film. There is no merit loyalty script scene when he takes off. Spirit, the essence of the production should be withdraw. For me, the production of 1963 movie Bye Bye Birdie was bright and lively, while the production in 1995 was gloomy, as the lighting and so dim as dance numbers. He was unsuccessful waste of the efforts of many really talented people.
