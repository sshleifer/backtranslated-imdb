I do not buy kung fu movies to the plot. I buy them for the fight scenes. Bad sector can be forgiven for his outstanding fight scenes, but not vice versa. <br /> <br /> The story was decent but too slow for my taste. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes in all, lasts only a few minutes apiece. The last fight was a bit more, but at this point I was so bored, I did not even pay attention to it.
