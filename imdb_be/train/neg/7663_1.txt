Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually large) as the dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well, this is Stephen Dorff for Christ !!!! Personally, I just want to thank those brilliant casting director for the hard work and effort. You guys are on. Heres an idea, just my humble humble opinion, as in the movie publicity, but it follows directly from the previous elections, a film about the most brilliant neuro-physicists invented a pill in history to cure all disease ever known to man, and get this, Heres decisive argument they should play Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you guys would like that. Seriously, you owe me $ 7.50.
