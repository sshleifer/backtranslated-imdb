Can A-Pix ever, ever, ever do anything wrong? This film was seen on TV in the format. Since A-Pix does not even believe in a pan and scan, we see the whole scene, where the shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to shoulder with the right hand. Of course, not what you are lacking. This film is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie, where the characters shout at the top of their lungs for 80% of the film without cause.
