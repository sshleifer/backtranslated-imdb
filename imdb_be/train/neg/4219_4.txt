This amateur film shot on video instead of "electrifying drama" as the DVD cover of falsely boast. I have seen much better things from the students' undergraduate film. The main part of the story unfolds all the endless taxi ride around Jakarta. This film could have been done with the help of a video camera, but there are some sections where the two cameras and the content was bounced along later were used. Editing is very rough. The final editing was done, probably, with two cameras, bouncing back and forth the content, not with due editor. Perhaps they did editing in a taxi, too? English subtitles were written by someone not fluent in English, such as "Where are you now?" To say that product quality is on par with the Blair Witch generously. If you are not scared yet, this film was an ambitious and creative effort, with a lot of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta.
