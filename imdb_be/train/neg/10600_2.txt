I'll be honest. The only reason I watched it on TV, it's in the IMDb bottom 100 And now, I wonder if my life half an hour is really worth another "check" on the same list. <, Br /> <br /> Van Damme Luc Deveraux, who finds himself on a huge fight with universal soldiers after the main computer pulled «HAL», to protect themselves. And so, after all obligate bombings, shootings and car chases he is the last one standing. In combination with a terrible effect and a little sad settings it does, it is a place in the infamous list simple. <br /> <br /> Only for idiots like me who want to see what the full list. 2/10.
