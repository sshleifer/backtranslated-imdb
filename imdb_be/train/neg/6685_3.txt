Although the film takes place on the "Ivy League" College, he was actually filmed entirely in Northern Arizona, mostly in Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff autumn of 1976, I was involved in the theater department there, and most of the extras in the film the then members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely ridiculous scene in this film (if you know the geography of Arizona), which shows the number of actors who go on a bike ride from the college to the creek. We know that NAU'ers campus and said stream (actually Oak Creek Canyon) about 35 miles apart, and while the trip there all downhill, it would be literally impossible to bike back UP the same road!
