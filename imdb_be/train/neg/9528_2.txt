There is a lot of talk about torture in these days. It's all this film. We are talking about a good man who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. Since then, it just kicks-off attack on him. I do not know at what point you are doing something about it. There is a wife and child out there somewhere; He has a great sense of guilt and fear. But there must have been a few times when he could act. The film seems to be someone's joke. I believe, as a result of the Manson murders, we had a little lock on the likes of these two. However, why would someone make a film like this? What appeals it has to sadism, but. The conclusion is unsatisfactory, but that could be eliminated with an obvious plot twist. Oh, well. Even a half hour of my life.
