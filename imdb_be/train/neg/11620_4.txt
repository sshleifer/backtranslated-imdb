I gave it more than 1, because I think that there were some moral lessons in this story, and it caused some thought and comment from my wife and me performing duty and the dialogue was mediocre, and I must admit, I left feeling as if I was beaten on the head of God, God and Christ is our savior material. Movies do not need. If, like me, you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you sick. The film did a good job of demonstrating the fine line between being a good citizen, and as someone who could be a potential stalker focused on what might have been.
