By the time you can suffer it! When you see how people wake up, get up, dressed, with a shower, preparing dinner, looking at each other, sex in the dark, and then go back to bed, to sleep ... if you like tacky apartments, narrow bedroom and kitchen, a long moment of silence .... if you like annoying for two hours, feeling the thrill of the "real false intimate art", then you'll love. But if you do not, just try to watch a good movie, there are thousands. "While you're here," but we want to stay? This German film won a gay film festival in Turin: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision, as the festival has presented many talented film. It may be nice to the German, because they do not often get a reward? Well, "The Lives of Others" did ... but this one is excellent, but not gay. So perhaps it comes to fashion. The Germans are "in" again? No matter what? Or maybe, just look at some of Directors businessman?
