This short, did not even raise a smile at me. I really never thought I'd say this, but "Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride Return Revenge of the Terror attack Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-DÂ» was a better parody and not so lame or boring <br /> <br /> My rating :.
