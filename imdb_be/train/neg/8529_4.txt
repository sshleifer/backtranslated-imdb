That an idol at MGM thought it would be a good idea to put a studly Clark Gable as a Salvation Army worker ?? Paradoxically, another beautiful starlet, Cary Grant, also played Man Salvation Army just two years later in a highly overvalued She Done Him Wrong. I think, in retrospect, it is quite easy to see the absurdity of these roles, but I still wonder who thought that the guys are the Salvation Army «HOT» and who could look at these valiant people and see them as a realistic representation of parts they played . A long time ago, I worked for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (Volunteers of America), and I have never seen a studly guys working there (and that includes me, unfortunately). Maybe I was supposed to get a job with the Salvation Army, and! <br /> <br /> Yes, very interesting, it is a good movie to watch, but also for everyone else, it is the poor writing, messy and annoying moralizing dialogue make for a very slow film.
