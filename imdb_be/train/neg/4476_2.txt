I just saw this movie premiered on MTV. I must say that it was very mediocre (at best). Dialogue does not explain the story very well, and I was left with the feeling that there was a lot of plot holes. There is not a pleasant character in this adaptation because of bad acting. I just think that all the characters are too possessive when it comes to someone they love. In addition, Kate and Heath love seems very incestuous. They seem more like brother and sister, not amateurs. I do not understand why my father would take something like that under his roof. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie because of the few actors who I respected and I use to view the previous films, but, as I said, it is very difficult, as well as any of the characters. performance Katherine Heigl was Horrid which was a complete shock. It was terrible to be a bitch older sister of Edward, and there just was not enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to criticize her work. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great to see him in something recently, and despite the fact that his character was a little kooky, he was the only person I sympathized. As for Erika Christensen, Mike Vogel, they had to be our heroine, but came off as whiny and overdramatic. <br /> <br /> I just do not like this film very much, or music in it. It was a short appearance of a Christian punk band, MxPx, but it's a small appearance would not have convinced me to watch this movie again. MTV has done a lot of work to convince me that it was a movie was not. I just presented something completely different.
