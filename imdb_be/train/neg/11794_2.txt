Mediocre Sci-Fi Channel original image. Bit squirmish, but not much. Premier League U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep in the dense cold ice at the North Pole, where he is attacked by a giant super charged electric eels. Crew Member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks that it has developed a way to communicate with the monsters, but do not give many chances for unspecified reasons. Also among the crew: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Weill. This film could have been a little better if acne / monsters were not so cartoonish.
