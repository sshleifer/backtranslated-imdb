My friends usually can put up with a lot of bad movies, but this one was too poor for us to even watch it till the end. It was so boring and unoriginal. Not even "hot" girls who starred in the film can keep me watching. Everything was just predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The action was sometimes good ..... but several times bad. The most annoying character in the whole film, you just wanted to die would become the protagonist's best friend. The more I see him the more I wanted to break my screen. (You know that fat ugly baby I'm talking about) <br /> <br /> The plot has been made so many times before, I think that they should be brought to justice other film companies. Well, it's a good idea, but that's all this movie was. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie can only look at if your self to keep any abuse with their friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better.
