I gave two stars amazing HD DV shot, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of his character. It was to be generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This film will not work on all accounts. I can not recommend it, since it is neither poetic nor stupid. Neither dramatic nor suspenseful. Neither debatable nor normal. It's just an unfortunate piece of garbage, which is not horrified or not to operate the fan can recommend in good faith. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, you who you are. , .Please, just stay away from this terrible product. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
