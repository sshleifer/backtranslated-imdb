(Spoilers Wealth) This is absolutely awful movie. First of all it is the guy from the environment. I believe he has made a career out of the game super caring dad. It was OK for the first time when he was trying to scare his son, pretending monster ... and then 10 minutes later they did it again annoying! And so on, the film moves into agonizing real time. At some point, I started visualizing it was a few days later, until I recalled that the storyline was only the next day early in the day ... more! I'm not quite sure who this couple should be in real life. First of all, they are presented as a sort of yuppie pair of Manhattan, who grew up and had children. But they are old blue Volvo. These types of driving Volvo stopped a few decades ago. Today they run Priuses. But in 2002, I'm sure they still have not been behind the wheel of a Volvo. <br /> <br /> OK, that is, the Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian" gives the boy a little magic statue Wendigo and tells him of his powerful magic. Oh well ... we still do ancient Indian secrets. Just go home, they panning through every Indian statue in its tourist trap upstate New York City. American Indians portrayed in such a way not seen for decades in this movie! Oh, and about the Wendigo. He really is not the cause of terror. He did not kill his father's baby, which is the most terrible thing in the movie ... he just killed a conventional sucker with insult and high-power rifles. Wendigo go out only at the end of the film, to avenge the guy who killed dad ... oh, but wait, it seemed before, that the Wendigo was kind of angry at her father, perhaps because he had killed a deer ... so then Wendigo should be happy that his father was killed ... but ... <br /> <br /> and so on ... disappointing, sad and senseless. There's no reason to watch this movie at all.
