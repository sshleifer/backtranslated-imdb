I just rented the movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I had not seen in any movie since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this movie was a big disappointment. Actions of all parties was bad for Mr Lundgren, who was well-ish apart. Kota Dobo had something nice to look at, despite its ridiculous outfit and makeup. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very smart, that's what it was repeated millions of times in various films. Fraudsters were quite stereotyped and character Lundgren had not any depth in it. I did not expect a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately, it's not even a decent action. Each twist in the plot is very predictable, and an incredible amount of over-the-top and unrealistic comics, the characters started to irritate me a lot quite quickly. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it for young children who want some comic such actions, but only if nothing else is there. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I believe that the current average vote 7.0 out of 6 votes to be influenced by someone else involved in the creation of this film)
