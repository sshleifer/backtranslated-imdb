«Mad Dog Time» ... «Trigger Happy» whatever you want to call it ... just do not hit the target. Maybe it's just me, maybe I just do not like Gangster comedy (as I thought that Oscar, Johney Dangerously and mafia also sucked) This is probably more "witty sharp pun" than all of comedy, but he did not as a witty and sharp as it (or the other reviewers) Make it out to be. <br /> <br /> Costa Rica, Mick, Vicki Thing was old to start with doing this running gag was a time of painful to watch. <br /> <br /> There has not been enough change in location or find time, they should have been. Most of the film was previously found in the "Club of Dreyfus' or the various departments / dim room. .. (what was with the Gun Hop Depart things Goldblum continued to win?) <br /> <br /> supporting cast was great ... on paper (great to see Silva & Drago), but the characters were killed off to that they have time to develop. and Richard Pryor cameo was a joke! Element Romance and love movies also swamped him. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I do not think I will return to it shortly.
