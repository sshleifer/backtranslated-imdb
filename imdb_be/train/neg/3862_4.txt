I just watched it. Couple laughs, but nothing to write home about. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. (Long) DVD gag reel is almost exclusively out of it, who have attacks of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair, seemed to punch the time clock, but then again, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so that the "young man" I think it is? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played the father of Julia Stiles (funny), 10 Things I Hate About You funny here. He is big, but the best aspect of this film was the casting of Julia Stiles. I could spend two o'clock watching her laundry times and I feel like I just did.
