A pretty safe bet if you are lulled into a stupor people who think they are in the production of «Suspense for Dummies." <br /> <br /> But Peggy Webber was a cutie, anyway. She had a few good moments acting here and there (especially when trying to contact the gardener) and nobody fills his shirt as she is. But it frightened face she makes - scary in itself. Wow. <br /> <br /> In general, though, there is a little uncertainty here and all telegraphed as a blow thrown by mime. You can not be scared of this film, it's impossible.
