The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co-star in this film. She is not even two-thirds of the movie is over, and then it was a minor role. I do not believe that supporting role either, but rather a "little" part. In addition, the site has a lot of unexplained elements. Here are some examples of why the protagonist rejects her eldest son? Why her younger son of the drive head on the train? He says that his "sucker" bets that does not explain anything. It is obvious that the writer does not know the definition of a sucker bet. This film is not worthy of the rent, in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on TV, if you think that should be seen.
