Dear dear dear dear dear ... me! I had the strength to see it through ... But why? <br /> <br /> The first two films, where fun and actually somewhat good. But it's so bad we had trouble seeing it all. It was some kind of shudder of children. I can not believe that this film was made in all..seems like props, which is taken from some poor western series of (for children), and they just did everything they could to him. <br /> <br /> With this film to audiences? I can think only of the 12-14-year-olds. If you are over 14 years you will have serious problems with this film. It is not only slow, but it is completely sad. Symbols replayed (not just a little), and so stereotyped is fun for while..but not long enough to not make you want to throw tomatoes at the screen. You know, all that needs to happen, too, because it's ... you've seen it a billion times before in any series hero on TV for children. I chose all the survivors and all the tremor of fodder received second character entered. It's so bad..so wrong..so ... shit. <br /> <br /> But it's good, we got a laugh now and then. Not only in the silly plot holes, but some scenes where there is a replay game or two ... or one scene, which is where the two children tremor jump on one of the obvious tremor guys..It feed really big scene, which made we play it again and again and laugh heartily. Still it makes me smile when I think about it. But this happened only once sadly..and is when "teaser" The offender shows and overacts his part of the country ... and that one comment, "They follow from the ground like some demonic trout!" At this point we where almost crying laughing. But after that..nothing could ever top that .. (?) .. so it's pretty much deteriorated. <br /> <br /> Thus, vertices are demon trout and replayed. If someone tells you that it's a good movie ... it is either "plant", vegetable or someone very angry. This film has got to be the worst of the tremors today. We are waiting for Tremors 3, he must be a box office hit in comparison with this ... this ... * * ants no..I'll leave it at that.
