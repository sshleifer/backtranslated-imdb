Seriously, there is absolutely nothing good about this shit all the festival. Randolph Scott, closet homosexual who lived with his beloved Cary Grant for twelve years, his most wooden and boring in the slightest role. At 57 he was clearly too old for these romantic roles, but it does not matter so much here because Gail Russell looks much older than her 31 years, and she is so ugly because of her alcoholism and smoking chain. Or Marvin plays its usual role of a villain, but not enough to keep this junk. Thank God that they do not make westerns anymore, they simply outdated, racist old movies, glamorise weapons and murder. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
