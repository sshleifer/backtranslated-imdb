Well, I could not even liked this movie a lot for their religious values. This B-thriller movie, the director of "Commando", which is, however, too inaccurate and foolish to think this is a good B-movie with enough entertainment value in it. <br /> <br /> This "90-Flick, but the first film should be reminded of a" blockbuster 80-ies, when this type of B-movies were at an all time high. These films have always gone over-the-top and never paid much attention to her story or action. It was all to blow things up, the great heroes of the muscles and the bullets fly. This film has all the ingredients in it, but I really did not like to watch this movie as much as I love to watch a similar type of movie. It's hard to say why in fact, as the story and action and are as bad as would be the case, basically any other genre of the film of the same era. <br /> <br /> This is probably because the film is currently often far too silly. All of these types of films have their silly moments, but this film is just filled with it. Fighting, Dolph Lundgren running around shirtless, the characters, the plot. All this is just not very good, because it is often simply too inaccurate term. History sometimes not even trying to make a bit of sense, and that even the main plot line of the total of the film? Its history is everywhere and definitely seems to be just for the record, to create a movie with fighting sequences, gun fights and the like. And those sequences do not look very good indeed. These points are too short and rather disappointing to look exactly, from the man who brought us the "Commando". <br /> <br /> It's just, Dolph Lundgren, in which he gets to play the hero star big action kicks example of seemingly relative ease, knows how to handle weapons and other weapons, and, of course, also gets the girl, played by Tia Carrera. All this also brings us to one of the worst in the history of the sequence of mounting insurgent and is definitely one of the worst sex sequences I've seen in any film really is. Both too lame words and just very poorly put together. <br /> <br /> None of the characters are not developed other actually. Good guys cops, but they never behave like one. They just killed around, not to the person in charge to anyone, and they are not very interested in making any arrest or inform anyone about their discoveries. Even if they know that the great Japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the street memos and brewery operates as a cover to plant drugs and major drug smuggling. And just think about it for a moment, that the overall objective of Brandon Lee in the film? The film could easily do without it, and the girls as well. <br /> <br /> Too stupid, lame, and simplified and simply not interesting enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
