This movie was so very poorly written. Symbols do not have depth. They have never made a film about it. My '11 son could write a better script then Hyung-Rae Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor who does not suck was a zoo guard. He was the only funny and believable one of many. <br /> <br /> I love the movie and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was up there on my list of lame at number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus. <br /> <br /> For those of you who actually thought it was a good movie, you need a serious brain surgery <br /> <br /> Most of the creatures in the film weren Â» . t even dragons ... so why do they call D-War?
