WOW is all I can say is, if your reading this ever watched it or think about it. believe me watch! <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard at the many parts of this film the worst acts ever done it very funny! I can not believe that they are superimposed school sign! I must have played this scene over and over again just to laugh more and more each time. If the movie, as it can be done that gives us hope in the creation of your own movies. even the costume was bad. he looked like my 7-year-old cousin could do a better job of preparing it. hell, I'm sure he could write and perform better as well. all I know is that I have to watch the second part just so I can see if it was as bad as the first. its a great idea for a killer scarecrow, but a much better job could be done. I hope another killer stuffed the movie comes out, just do not like it.
