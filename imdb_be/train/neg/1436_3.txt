Dear. Some of the best talent in the British television series made this, so I can only assume that they are working under incredible time pressure and had to settle for the first take many scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some frightening scenes in this mystery Highland (mainly when the "monster" attacks, and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid that I have found most of the history of unintentionally funny! Such as the moment when the hero discovers the corpse divided on the golf course: Yes, look, there is a hand ... Oh, and there is another hand out there ... hmm this is a little confusing ... <br /> <br /> for many years, fans of the British cult TV show campaigned to this series released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
