Val Kilmer, solid execution. Dylan McDermott, solid execution. Josh Lucas, solid execution. Three very attractive actors give decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Infamous for his well-endowed, a drug addict, and a guy who, in spite of AIDS infection, continued to make movies for adults, simply does not have an intriguing character. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds the events that led to and the consequences of the vicious massacre that occurred in the late '80s in Los Angelos, in which Holmes was associated, was arrested and charged with the murder, and that in the end result was acquitted. Just as in the case of OJ, the guilt factor, regardless of the outcome, ranged quite high in "He did it" area. <br /> <br /> There's no one to sympathize with in this film, as well as all is selfish criminals. Not only is there anything remotely interesting here.
