Do not get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series and movies, but enough again: Death on the Nile. Everyone did it! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say, enough already! Mr. Suchet could use this amazing talent in another one of the novels of Agatha Christie. I will say that all the actors acting was superb. A lot were amazing and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was surprised at how "horrible" it looked. I hope he does not look so "real" life! I really can not think of other films of the end was the same. Somehow I do not think so. I thought that was quite brilliant touch or wrote about it this way, Mrs. Christie. I would prefer that the end, it languishes in jail!
