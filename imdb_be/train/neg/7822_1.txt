This film is very weak attempt to make money by using the classic theme. I loved the Superman movies, but this is one I want to shoot myself. Very poor effect possessed special effects, and the plot is zero. To sum up: Superman leaves the ground, because scientists have found fragments of his home planet, some of them have been in space (Ghost), does not speak to her friend something before leaving (duh again), takes off in a spaceship, coming (? !?) so I think that in 5 years, and looks forward to consolidate with his girlfriend again (which is now destroying his son, who's son, in my humble opinion, at least 7 years). And what about Lex Luthor? Trying to grow a new continent to sell the land? Please !! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 out of 10 for this film, because I do not have the right to vote to 0. If you have something to do with your time, do not go to see this movie, and even if you have nothing to do, stay home and watch TV!
