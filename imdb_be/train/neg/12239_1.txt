Ever since I was eight years old, I was a big fan of wrestling. It does not matter that the federation I watched. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, all the action, I was watching him. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999 It was my 19th birthday. I ordered over the edge and I'm just waiting for another pay-per-view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead it was the night one of the best fighters to come out of Canada, the true man, had fallen to his death because of the stunt went wrong. Not much you can do to change the situation. But what happened Affter Owens's death made me very mad. <br /> <br /> Instead of the end of the pay-per-view and do the right thing as a human being WWE decided to protect what comes first, and it was on the money, keeping the pay-per-view takes place, as if death will never Owens it was not. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in my life, but it is certainly foolish decision he ever made. <br /> <br /> And this shit with saying Owen would like to view PEW salaries to keep going. Give me a break. If someone dies on the bench watching his sense of paid Comon, to stop it. That, as a police officer shooting a robber or burglar with a run and then just leave a man to die so that he could go home and call it a day, as if the lives of men never mattered. <br /> <br /> but there still is going on. Owen will miss and thanks for the memory for all the times you have given us.
