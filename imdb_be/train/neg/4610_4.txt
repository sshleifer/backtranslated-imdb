I watched this movie, because I noticed that she was Kari Wuhrer in a cast. I have long had a theory about it, she a talented actress, but never seems to prove that, because it is always in this kind of low-budget B movie. She is still beautiful, and she's still trying to act above the miserable stuff that I always see her. This is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but it does not make it good. George Wendt played against type, and it was so sharp that he receives recognition for its role. Another observation about Ms. WÃ¼hrer. Her breasts seem to have decreased considerably since I had seen her for the last time. Surgery may be reduced, or (more likely) removing the implants. It's not bad. She still looks great. I would like to see her in a better film.
