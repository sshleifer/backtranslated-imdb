After a life as a miracle, I do not expect much. Hard to believe that these films were made by the same person as you remember Dolly Bell, for example. Zavet two o'clock silly antics that have no history. Wild and unbridled humor Underground, seems to have degenerated into a wretched buffoon here. It turns out that Kusturica was going steadily downhill since it started doing life-affirming comedy, starting with the Black Cat, White Cat, which I think was great but obscure signs of dementia. I liked his earlier films so much, and that is why it is particularly disappointing to see something like this. Let us hope that his next will be great.
