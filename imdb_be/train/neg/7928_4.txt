In fact, the film is not horror or Sci-Fi. With a very strong Christian religious theme, this film provides the minimum content and the unknown. Second-tier actors half-decent jobs, reading their sad role. The only good performance of Sydney Penny, who plays the role of a mother ... I will not spoil the film, it's either Christ or Antichrist. Do not watch this movie if you are a Christian religious fanatic will get the apocalypse. <br /> <br /> As a non-Christian, I had to force myself to watch this movie just because I wanted to write this review. It is a pity that the Sci-Fi channel had broadcast the film at peak times in the evening.
