In what seemed like the longest 1 hour 35 I had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino provides accurate Performace, to be sure. Not his usual character types, which was nice. But his character was truly pathetic. Someone pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments, as we understand that the social life of Hollywood merges it into their life energy. But in this film we needed someone like that. And for some reason, every character in the film said, "I do not know why I love you, Eli" in chracter Al Pacino, and I could not even come close to his heart. <br /> <br /> All the other actors played their usual style. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff, Bill Nunn did not do anything to change their established persona, developed on TV or in the earlier films. And Kim Besinzher was not even in the movie long enough to put the work of any kind. <br /> <br /> The film's story was no pulse. Most of the scenes never driving history forward, and factoids just a collection of characters that later came into play in the fight against climactic denouement. It has the potential for their failure to build on the history, except. <br /> <br /> What's the point of the film? Daniel Algrant and John Robin Baits would you believe "After Hollywood, you can not get out." Yes that's right! And that's why so many people get fired in Hollywood.
