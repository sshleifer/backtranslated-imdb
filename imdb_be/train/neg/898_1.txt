Eddie Murphy «Delirious» entirely rude, crude, rude, and Lud. This is really the only way to describe this horrible, crappy piece standing. Eddie Murphy comes to shock value, not laughing, to try to win his subsequent more. He really knows how to be funny sometimes, but mostly lose the plot with foul language and unwelcome sexual jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget about it! If you do not happen to enjoy the style of Eddie unfair. I do not think I'll bother with the "Eddie Murphy Raw». . I prefer to Eddie in the framework of the screenplay <br /> <br /> On Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
