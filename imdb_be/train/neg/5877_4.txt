Williamson accent hard to wade through. He speaks incredibly fast, as he is in a hurry to get through the line. In the monologue, he acts as if he were talking to someone when he has to talk to himself. All that and it just annoys me bald. He was too old for the role. When reading other accounts Williamson, maybe he got the role because he has lost his mind, and the director decided to do a little bit of life takes on art or forced action. If the actors declare Hamlet mad you believe! Marianne Faithful is a great beauty and can spoil the role of Ophelia and still get a pass. A lot of dark and foreboding, but it looks as if shot in a real castle scene especially in tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines as the great world in the sky.
