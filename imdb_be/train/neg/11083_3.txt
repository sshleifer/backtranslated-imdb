This film was on late at night, when I saw him. It was interesting in the beginning, but it did not convince me as a whole. I am not a supporter of Tyson. In fact, I do not like boxing at all. This is barbaric, obscene and two-way (society), that some are paid for beating each other. <br /> <br /> However, I felt that the beginning of the movie was the kami. Actors good, especially George C. Scott (as DAmato). I do not know how reliable Flick is. I do not read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I do about this man I do not know, but it was pretty interesting. <br /> <br /> As the film went on I felt I lost a bit of its charm, and I also lost interest. I managed to stay awake, though, but in the last hour was just not good enough.
