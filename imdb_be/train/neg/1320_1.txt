This movie was exactly what I expected it to be when I first read the casting. I probably could write a fascinating plot, it is very unfortunate that they left him in a pack of Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba was definitely a good skier, but he should thank God (and we too), that it should not rely on his actor's skills to earn a living. He can not play, he can not speak, he can not even move very well on the mainland without skis ... Hunziker pretty blonde, and that's all. She obviously was not chosen for its remarkable expertise in dramatic roles, but most of all for her beautiful legs. Nevertheless, I have to admit that it could be applicable TOMBA teacher, because he is even worse actor than her, and it's funny, especially considering the fact that she was not Italian. I laughed while watching this film. I found it so ridiculous and pointless, it actually made me laugh out loud, very loud.
