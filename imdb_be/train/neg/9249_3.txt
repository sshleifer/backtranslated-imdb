While watching a movie, I'm not sure that direstion he had to take. There's a reason, the writer should not direct its work, and even to act in it as well, you can not do it all. I felt the story really suffered in this movie because the director to wear so many hats. Ms. McTeer is a film. In order to add her amazing talent, her image of the woman why I was doing. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my opinion, the conflict that makes the drama and a great story. I felt that this movie did not have it. It was somewhat easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles chahracters get what they wanted. See the movie for sweetness, but most of all for the brilliant performance of Ms. McTeer in.
