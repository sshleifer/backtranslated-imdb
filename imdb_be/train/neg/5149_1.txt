This is a film about a female rape victim / writer comics from New York, who decides to get away from all this horrible big city glamor and go to a dirty, run down a small town where she finds refuge in one scale of the trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of the 12th and nowhere. Citizens mentally ill, but it is crazy for inviting men into her trailer. Annoying is the fact that it has the ability to do exactly what you need to put yourself in a dangerous circumstance when dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney performance was a secondary school in the best case. He is one of those curious cute young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the career has not been kind and mother nature was right in tow. To the previous commenter that the action was "so real", well, I agree. In fact, it does not work. Two main character is really pathetic, weak and unable to make mature, healthy decisions. In short, this movie sucks, like anyone else, rent it, to laugh at him. The real scene of the crime? Brutal wooden panels in the trailer - is enough to make me commit murder. And finally, it is the artist / writer, so that she could not afford a double-wide trailer and something else than the sun yellow Chevy Chevette respect for God!
