Heavy film to categorize. I will never give him concentrations of 110% &, therefore, is as simple as the story appeared, I could not say for sure exactly who does what among the characters of the American FBI and what their roles were. I could not take Irwins seriously as the heroes of the film, if their lines and scenes were in the style of one of his shows, Sun played. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a glorified TV episode Discovery show, with the main story takes place a slight south, that just seemed to get in the way. However, as any Irwin shows are always worth watching this film is worth a look too, but not on the second day of Christmas. Speaking of which, I have better things to do than will also be here. <br /> <br /> High 4/10
