I thought I saw the movie twice in fact. Then I read all the other reviews, and they do not quite match up. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to the city to study the alleged Bigfoot sightings. I still feel pretty confident that this is a film that I have seen, in spite of the differences in the reviews. So I put my review back: If you want a random movie «B», as I do, and then go back to the swamp cries of the movie for you! Whether it's setting the sleep timer, and nodding to his favorite film-bomb, or just hang out with friends. Boggy Creek, a mute button, and you get the fun of improvisation night. Look! There is a legend right? I think we just might find, along with not so stellar cast. Will there be any faulty equipment in particular the key moments in the film? Should our blonde, brave, young hero of any chest hair? It will be exceptionally high-tech Technicolor last the whole movie? You have to watch to find out for yourself.
