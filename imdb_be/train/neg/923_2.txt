For some reason, various young couple hiking through the Italian Alps to share, to see who can reach their first camping destination. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters the cave, found the skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes obsessed with "Tyranus" spirit when he puts on the helmet belonging to the corpse. He then spends the rest of the movie running around in the woods hunting down your friends and hacking their limbs to add some corner to bring the undead «Demonicus» to life. This shot-on-digital Full Moon release silly, pointless, has a terrible effect and sound, (Los) Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy. However, it's pretty high on the scale of involuntary laughter mainly due to an overloaded performance lead. If the eye bug running around in a cheap looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting gibberish Latin neurotic about demons and resurrection, Kenyon funny facial expressions and awkward delivery lines must be seen to be believed. Well, at least it's not boring, like most of the rest of the cast.
