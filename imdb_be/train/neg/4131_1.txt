This film should be nominated for a new genre: a complete mess! a few laughs, and one or two scenes baked In addition, this film is a waste of time. Calling it "Camp" does not even cut it. "Camp" is the pleasure that this film was not. You spend the first half of the movie "thinking its got to get better, is not it?". Frankly, it does, in the end, when he finally explained, who "/ sister brother" team and what they want, but by the time you're unlikely to care anymore, because you spend the entire second half of the film I wonder what Mr. Onorato and Ms. flour to make a ticking someone is bad to stay in such a terrible movie. <br /> <br />
