One two three four five six seven eight and back, ha ha. It must be seen, first of all, to see the work out. There is a lot of work from the show to see the close-ups, the man you will enjoy it. A few years ago the video was, of course, on the basis of this film. This slasher, but without delay. The ending is funny, too, and the clothes she was wearing in the woods facing copper, Jesus looks like a clown. Murder is mainly carried out outside the screen, the blood flows, but never too bloody. There are a lot of fights too, and hey, no one was hurt. What about the weapons to kill, never seen one as big as this, do not spoil it, you have to see it. And the future slasher has a lot of T & A too. In order to guess who the killer is, you'll be trapped several times, and it's the best part, but what about the history of the copper in the wood, yes! Still, because of its cheesiness is another one that many would like to have. I am glad that I have a copy of one of these failures shredder. But man, those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! If you are in the 40s, this one comes back to memory lane.
