Laid and drugs to as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scar urinary tract, absolutely nothing better to do than to let me painkillers fainting in a semi-oblivion, I happened to catch this movie on cable. I would not want anyone to think that I have paid to watch it in a theater or rent it, or ?? Heaven, God forbid! ?? I watched it straight. <br /> <br /> play this sensationally terrible video game and eagerly advancing convicted rooms and afraid of home runs, struggling Chariot (type 27), hanged (type 041), and other possible guards, my curiosity was piqued about how the game will pass on the movie screen. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> hackneyed plot revolves around a group of "crazy kids" ?? a la Scooby Doo ?? attend to a remote island for a world shaking "rave" ?? what would it. (You kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirt and your Pat Boone ??) After bribing a boat captain of thousands available to ferry them there (nonsense which begs its own rhetoric network), they find a "rave" deserted. <br /> <br /> The transfer referred to "home" ?? presumably the titular House Of The Dead ?? but most of the action takes place on the open sets of false and elsewhere, detached from any semblance of ghosts residence. <br /> <br /> fallen camcorder act as retrospective filler frame that shows the island in pain ?? Party! Is it? Oh, yes it is "nonsense" thing simply "party"? In the great tradition of re euphemizing «used car" as "used" or "shell shock" as "post-traumatic stress disorder", the word "party" is now too square for your drug addled, silicone implanted metrosexual jagoffs? <br /> <br /> As it became known that the party was divided angry zombies. Intellectual thought stops here ?? <br /> <br /> I do not think that the pinheads, who call themselves writers and directors understand the Mythos of zombies re-animation. Zombies can not die ?? they are the undead. They do not bleed, they do not know any pain. If their bodies are not completely destroyed, they will continue to be animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me. <br /> <br /> This means that 0.45 shots at their "heart" is not going to stop them, and there will be a machete to the torso. And a shotgun in the chest, of course, will not bring gouts of blood. At least, in the logic of video games, the shooter in the pump so many rounds of every monster that he was completely destroyed, leaving a stinking mess, he can not re-energize yourself. <br /> <br /> However, every actor-slash-model gets their sample circular chamber point by killing zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more inefficient than stormtroopers from "Return of the Jedi", who get knocked out when Ewoks operate them. <br /> <br /> I think the film's author, Mark Altman, as was not too -shabby «free enterprise", was forced to insert a link to Captain Kirk, the character Prochnow, which should be required the milk yielded money desperately to appear this aromatic liquid manure. There is also a reference to the role of prima Prochnow in a magnificent «Das Boot», when one of the untrained B-actor says that he "looks like a U-Boat Captain». ". I wonder how many of the film's target audience of this square the eyes of pigs raised on any maliciously links to other films, and if Prochnow said, "Say hello to my little friend", predicting his gun point. <, Br /> <br /> Aimed at demographic, who have no means to comprehend the concept of the uselessness of Sisyphus video games (ie, the game ends when you die ?? you can not win), it's just for a mindless slasher and meaningless in the heart. Accordingly, everyone dies at one time, for heterosexual couples attractive white men, except. <br /> <br /> a better use of the poor still abusing the budget of this film could send a throw through drama school, although the left breast in Ona Grauer did a good job, as her right breast ?? and the SloMo running scenes: priceless I especially liked the final scene with Ona tries to act as if it was a knife, but it looks like she just ate ice cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Try to do something more con constructive with my time, I pulled Digital reopened 35 years, Special Edition, Widescreen anamorphic DVD of «Manos :. the hands of fate, "Oh, yes! ?? drugs were appropriately numbing the brain - now there was a quality shooting ?? <br /> <br /> (movie maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
