"1408" is the latest redneck mishmash of cheap scare tactics. The kind that would make data a movie in the style of horror fans sometimes jump in his chair and scream in his ear, but disappoint the spectators who are looking for a small depth and direction. <br /> <br /> Cusack plays a writer who has made a career writing books that describe his experience of being in the rumors haunted hotels. Despite assurances from the patrons and owners, that ghosts roam the halls, there is a bit to make it a true believer in the paranormal. When he learns about the history of the room 1408 Overlook Hotel - do not wait, I mean, Dolphin Hotel in New York - he decides that would make a perfect closing chapter of his latest book. But, Samuel L. Jackson, playing the owner of the hotel, much tries to dissuade his guest with a story about the atrocities that have occurred in Theat room since the opening of the hotel many years ago. The story is simple, and we, as a potential skeptics have to sit through a long wander Jackson omen. <br /> <br /> In other words, be afraid! Be very afraid! <br /> <br /> Of course, it would be easy to convince the audience that they had just paid to see the edge-of-the-seat thriller, if it does not take much time to create at this point. And, if what followed was much more than a cheap "boos" that are becoming so frequent and arbitrary, in the end, you might expect from them in the near future. The room temperature is automatically changed. Walls dig blood. Fearless writer can not open the door, etc. And after almost half an hour to deliver their promised viewers more thrills, you can sit back and hope that at least you may be surprised endings. Suspicious sequences of dreams and other derivatives of time wasters, even that is not able to suppress our doubts that before the movie ended, we could, at last, something to make the film a little less than completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Despite the loud speech (as always) for Cusak, which is essentially the entire movie, most still mention wasted (that is Samuel L. Jackson) in minor supporting roles. The true mystery of how this film got such a high rating view. Election-filling ghosts?
