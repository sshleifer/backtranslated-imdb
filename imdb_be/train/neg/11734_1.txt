Tasteless. I can not even write properly about the film. I laughed the whole movie. It was not supposed to be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he was doing. Its history is written, apparently, without any knowledge of Iowa Culture and meth problem. I know Farnsworth Iowa, making his film even more mysterious to me. Why are the two main character has an accent? It makes no sense. The acting was mediocre at best, and sometimes it is difficult to watch. Gratituous violence and sex filled film. I believe that violence and sex were to make a film a sharp, but he came across as unbelievable and insulting. The ending of the film so brilliantly bad that all I could do was laugh and watch the credits rolling with a grain of salt. When I came out of the theater and all the others who left laughing with me. The ending of the film was to cause tears, but he did the opposite. Do not waste your time on this awful film, if you do not want to see, ignorant, juicy, replay, the clich√©d nonsense.
