Enjoying Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones," my interest peaked, so I tried to sit through the second string of bizarre picnic investigating the death of a jockey - but I did not make it to the end, Arthur, was photographed with a transmission, fashion film magazine or wants alimony from her ex-husband, William Powell or another shot at marriage, but I have never experienced it, because the character is simply a string of jokes (she is the type of character prone to comic curiousness, but once in the morgue - like all women in those '30s comedies - it tra tsits consciousness). William Powell reportedly had a high time with Miss Arthur, but you never know what the final result; they look uncomfortable to stand side by side, are solved by their banter with each other. The actor plays a valet Powell painful, and pauses for audience laughter rich awkwardness.
