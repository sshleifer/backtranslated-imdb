I'm sorry, but it could have been terrible in 1978, when he left, but nowadays it is simply not tenable. The only interesting scene in the entire film has the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing a Halloween mask. The strangest moment in the whole film, when his parents unmask their son had killed his daughter. The movie goes downhill there and did not pick up until the last fifteen minutes, and then it's too late, we viewers have lost interest in the story. There is hardly any character development, and people always rave about Laurie have such an exceptional character, when in fact it is not so much for her. I'm sorry I do not agree with all frightened by this film, but if you want a great horror film to go and watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are two of the best horror films ever made. Halloween, of course, not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave it four stars because there's no way this film could deserve such high praise.
