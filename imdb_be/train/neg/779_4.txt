Seriously, I mean seriously, when I first started watching the show, I thought it was good. But sites have become even worse. Plot were either too boring and predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes he acts stupid. His joke exaggerated. His mother silly nature of the show. How can a mother treat her own son so good if it was a daughter, but it was her own son. I give it 4/10 show because the first few shows were a bit ridiculous. Actors Constance Marie and Masiel Luz does a great job. I do not know how they get to play a show for so long. <br /> <br /> If you're really bored, as I do, and nothing else to watch, I suggest you watch this.
