I just saw this movie on Flix after the timer recording on his film. I grew up watching F military and was a major hard Wrangler Jane, so I was shocked, literally shocked to learn after watching this film that degenerate mortal nurse Melody Patterson, that looks pretty good, but also looks very different and unfortunately poorly photographed. I would never have guessed that she is a million years. What the hell was she doing in a picture like this? I agree with the guys here, that the movie is not enough that it pushes. No sex, NO gore, not to tease. This also remake atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or so). Most of the action is tedious; the protagonist spends a huge amount of time that runs around the house a crazy doctor and a basement, and the district as a whole, or to be dispersed by the COP, all his boring and filling time. Now that the Italians would have done it, half of the film would be polished blade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam protege unconscious caressing naked girls. But you only get that for 20 seconds.
