This movie is another in a long line of no budget, no effort, no talent films are not filmed and gave spot coverage to cheat unsuspecting tenants in the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what to watch this film, like, take a video camera and some red food coloring and take yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night and roar "attacking" people. Congratulations, you just made Â«Hood of the Living Dead"! Now see if the distribution company will buy from you. <br /> <br /> I've seen some low budget films shot on video, which reflect the talent of the filmmakers and actors, or at least effort, but it has neither, Avoid, unless you are a masochist, or pleased with poorly made movies horror.
