There was such a hype about the game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially the right as a result of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So, of course, everyone had to tune in to see what all the fuss in the new game show. What a disappointment! Ben Stein as stoic and nasal voice says, «wooww». <br /> <br /> The only thing nice about this show was that you knew that eventually end. Sit through a full hour it was like going to the dentist ... you will find yourself looking at the clock in what you think of 10-minute intervals, only to find that only a minute has passed (but it seemed an eternity), so as the last time you looked at the clock. So, why can not I just change the channel? Well, probably for the same reason that most other people who do not ... made out of pure optimism. I mean, no one wants to think * that show with Bill Shatner can really be so bad. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I did not think it was a kind of vehicle that would showcase the talents of William Shatner. My main complaint is that the set was so dark. Watching it left me feeling depressed. Are you willing to continue to get ahold of a little excitement, but it was not just any cost. There was not even enough light on the set to get a sense of the energy from the audience (which you might not even see) <br /> <br /> Dear network :. People do not watch game shows, to cure their insomnia. ..they game clock shows excited and have a good time. Please, all of us a favor and lose it to the repository.
