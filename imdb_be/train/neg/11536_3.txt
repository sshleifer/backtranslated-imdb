Well, where to start here? Straightheads represents to me a little dilemma. If this movie comes from Italy, for example, in 1975, he was directed by Ruggero Deodatto and starred David Hess, I would have him lapping faster than the Labrador drinks water on a summer day. Because while Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their tribute Grindhouse movie, Dan Reid made a rape / revenge Grindhouse picture of its own in England, and, apparently, the same budget as it would take Rodriguez to turn the foot Rose McGowan in the gun. Because if you want to play bingo Grindhouse, let me shout "figure»: <br /> <br /> 1. A rich, high flying career woman meets a little rough on the wrong side of the tracks in incredible way and to the same degree improbable receives crush on him. Check. <br /> <br /> 2. Gratuitous Boom said high-flying career women in various states of nudity. Check. <br /> <br /> 3. Corrugated and highly unlikely plot development that sets the characters that exist only to do what they do, and that can not be alleged to have any existence out of the scene they are. Check. <br /> <br /> 4. Needless graphic scene of rape committed by a gang of men without appreciable depth of a person or other background, what they were raped. Check. <br /> <br /> 5. Gritty and bloody murder scene, and a place to round off the whole thing. Bingo! <br /> <br /> for all sites, Straightheads pretty basic stuff: Dyer met Anderson and she invites him to a party in a country pile belonging to her boss. On the way home, they upset three local residents in the form of Landover, who take revenge by giving Dyer good forging and gang raped Anderson. The pair will set about getting their revenge. So far, so that the "Straw Dogs», «Late Night Trains», «House on the edge of the park," "I Spit on Your Grave", etc. etc. So why did not I think a lot of this film? A number of reasons :. I think, first of all, with such Gillian Anderson in a cast seemingly leads me to wait for the best, but it's a complete lack of honesty here than to torment most <br /> <br /> Because every time someone sits down to watch Hess and women that terrorize and kill their men in these parts of the period from the 70s, they always know exactly what they are - low budget schlock intended only to shock and to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Villains terrorizing and killing sweets, goodies to turn the tables on thieves and kill them, and everyone goes home happy, their desire to see a bit of the opposite of violence hydrated and are confident that the world order has been restored. <br /> <br /> As a writer and director but Dan Reed explicitly considered Straightheads has a lot more to say about the state of the human mind than this, and desperately trying to absorb his film with philosophical depth, that simply does not exist, for example, when Anderson and Dyer plan to take revenge on the attackers, they learn that one of the rapists have a fourteen-year-old daughter, who is the object of desire for the two people he hangs around with. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that two of his comrades to their attention from his daughter !!! Casual and daring image that Reid drops this little opening in the story is simply amazing, it's almost as if he expected it was just a reference to pedophilia be enough to throw moral compass audience into overdrive and cause them to leave the movie thinking that they are " ve just sat through something important. In order to make sure that we "get it" at this point we have shown to run through the sequence of rape for the second time, as though from the point of view of the attacker and his worries about his daughter, but Reid will ensure that we get a lot more shots Anderson brutally treated and raped her over the hood of her car. The grant shall not enter therein. <br /> <br /> After the talk, his reason to rape her, Anderson links it over the table, rams working end sniper rifle (complete with bulky silencer only in case someone WASN «t clearly phallic imagery) to it jacksie, but do not have the guts to pull the trigger, let Dyer (who has no such pangs of conscience), that "it's all over." Dyer argues otherwise, their moral dilemma presented as what Wittgenstein and Russell may have discussed in their rooms back in Cambridge for tea and cakes. It is almost unwatchable in ludicrousness. <br /> <br /> In fairness, Ms. Anderson performs her intestine throughout the film. It's obvious that she wants to leave far behind Scully and, bless her, she certainly does this; It is interesting that Mulder would make his former partner squatting to pee on the roadside, and then raped a man with a gun? Dyer, on the other hand, is doing what he did almost every film he has made to date - which means playing Gor Blimey Uncle Cockney type boy with roguish smile, bold lines patter and individuals that most people would never get tired of punching . This is especially true at the closing scene, where, after the assassination of his opponents in cold blood, Dyer looks at the camera, which I'm sure is meant to be, a look of existential angst, offering us to sympathize in the hands of fate has dealt him and his moral problems had to overcome, but instead is much more like Oliver Hardy looks irritably at the camera after Stan landed him in another fine mess. Which, by the way, sums up the film quite nicely.
