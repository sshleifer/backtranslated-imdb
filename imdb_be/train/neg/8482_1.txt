Some of my old friends invited me to see this movie, but I got the chance only recently. I had high hopes to see something interesting from Kamal Hans, what I saw was a bunch of garbage camera angles, mixed with a high speed. I could not understand the message, in addition to humiliating Hinduism. I'm more like a lot of types of religion, but I felt like Kamal Haasan people lower nature, which has organized this kind of thought. He could make a horror movie than this shit. He tried to add the Hollywood genre of viruses and God forbid he did not turn this guy into a mutant and eventually going to go to world domination. It is very appropriate for a film Film School against the regular public. Shame it does not hold to the talent he has. Running stories tried Chaos borrow ideas from the butterfly effect, between a small religious harmony in the cost of insulting Hinduism (again I insult Hindu religion anymore, but this film is unparalleled, and my resentment as to religion in general, that may have made it intelligent film).
