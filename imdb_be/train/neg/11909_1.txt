I think that I found the most misogynistic film of all time :. Darklight <br /> <br /> The essence of cinema Lilith was Adam's first wife, and she is considered to be imperfect, and expelled from the Garden of Eden, because she thought she was still Adam and refused to obey him. Look, I took the words right out of the script. Then, the film continues to move on and, although she is the heroine of the film, the only time it becomes acceptable if it does what people tell her to do! She ends the film under the supervision of faith-based groups in the men's all! <br /> <br /> In addition, the script was predictable and FX were terrible. Apart from the obvious hatred of women, who tend to be much more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about Darklight.
