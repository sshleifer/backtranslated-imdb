Cameron Diaz is a woman who is married to a judge, played by Harvey Keitel, whose life is perfect, until the former does not show, and everything becomes a little more difficult .. While I watched this film have been several times I asked myself, why I was doing so..because film so funny and l and bad scenario with no credibility. Nor does the audience really a car that happens..Even great Cameron can not keep this on a scale from one to ten..2
