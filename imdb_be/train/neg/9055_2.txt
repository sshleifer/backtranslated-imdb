As an advocate, Billy Bob Thornton, and the diversity of his skills, I saw this movie in the list, and was surprised that I did not hear about it. <br /> <br /> I have traveled more than usual for both the period he filmed in 2000, and when he hit the theater more than 2-1 / 2 years later (which for the first time is the key, not all it was good with the production). <br /> <br /> now Patrick Swayze may not act for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough capacity to make up for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is someone whom it would be nice to see, even if it is revealed that she is watching paint dry. <br /> <br /> Being curious, I have checked the information produced by this site. He made a colossal <$ 600 per screen in its opening weekend, and slightly more than $ 400 each month after his theater run in the final 2002 total gross was $ 261K, I would doubt could cover pronunciation and crew hotel and food for a week on location. <br /> <br /> the story is quite benign, and even the use of generally interesting terrain Reno as dull as the rest habits. <br /> <br /> it's something like that.

One star for him, even here, and one, because the production was better than, say, a typical «Lifetime» Flick.
