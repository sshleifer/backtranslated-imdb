I do not really trust the AIDS conspiracy theory, but it is interesting to see a sociological phenomenon dramatized. In the early years of AIDS, suffering paranoia and frightened and die often generated such dark fantasies. This is especially true of the politically radical and sexy at twilight San Francisco. A city known for its beauty, few were uglier than in this film. The feeling of darkness and corruption permeates every scene. <br /> <br /> While the action and the plot can not be said to be well-made films a unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood, at least partially rescues the film on a complete loss. In fact, I found the most interesting performance will Irit Levy as a crisp and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Police Detective. It is interesting, though not necessarily a compelling <br /> <br /> Feature :. Use of a film about the tragic brightly Turandot is an effective motive is sublime silence cameos iconic performance artist Ron Athey.
