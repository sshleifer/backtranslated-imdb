I was just sitting in the theater is boring as hell, I wanted to leave halfway through the movie. The plot is simple 4 Samoan guys shipwrecks wedding. Thus, they should bring a date to get to the wedding. He. <br /> <br /> The thing that annoyed me the most was the so-called coarse jokes ... They were very unfunny, formulaic and thrown in the face, so you have got to have a dull film. Action was below average, and I felt that this film just went on and on about nothing but heaps of unfunny jokes and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the worst movies I saw in 2006 unfunny, bad game, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Well, thank God, one called out to me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
