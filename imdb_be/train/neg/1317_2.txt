When people in the Kino Video collected their excellent collection Â«Slapstick Encyclopedia", the choice of multi-cassette silent comedies, someone has decided to push the first installment with too much (1916), incomprehensible one reel farce made in Florida starring a very young Oliver Hardy. As nice as the set of all, the decision was unsuccessful, as too much is very bad movie that almost discourages viewers from watching on. Like any typical farce, this one involves deception, inspired by greed, panic, if plans go awry, and complications escalating to the point of absurdity, but in contrast to the good, too inconsistent, unfunny, and downright annoying. It is difficult to say at this point, or hopelessly tangled plot is the result of the loss of frames or inept film-making, but for whatever reason, by halfway even the most careful viewer has no idea that the characters or the relationship going, not to the end of more than one I do not care. <br /> <br /> The only attraction here to see the 24-year-old "Baby" Hardy, which is much harder than it is ten years later, when he teamed up with Stan Laurel, but who, nevertheless, full of youthful energy. in the opening scene, awakening with a hangover, baby has a very athletic reverse roll off the bed. Believe me, it's as funny as the movie gets. If you are reading this before you see the first cassette Kino in "buffoonery encyclopedia" I suggest you fast forward for it and miss the good stuff.
