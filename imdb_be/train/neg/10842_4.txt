Noting the cast, I recently watched this movie on that, hoping for the underrated gem, I think a lot of movies from the 30s. This is not a stone - not even semi-precious. Clothing anachronistic and 1930s Rolls Royce limousine just hit you. Casting strange, too. But mostly, too stupid and unnecessary plot devices. This film has a lot of good ingredients and the main plot, which holds promise, but the components are mixed in accordance with the right recipe. He just does not come together as it should be. And that's a shame. With a few fairly obvious, but minor changes, it can be a very good film <br /> <br /> The film is about an American dancer (Jean Harlow) is looking for a rich husband is British. - preferably from the nobility. She meets Franchot tonnes and his friend, who is on the larks in the Rolls Royce, owned by the employer of his friend. Harlow mistaking tons Lord, who owns the Rolls, and she sets her sights on him. This early part of the film is a light comedy is no real difference. <br /> <br /> However, the tone unwittingly reveals the fact that his employer actually a German fifth columnist on the eve of the First World War, and that, when the film generally changes the tone and begins to fall apart. Tons and Harlow married, but just as a honeymoon begins, he shot Mata Hari-type (Benita Hume), and Harlow leaves the stage, with passers-by, accusing her of murdering tone. (In fact, the tone will recover from his wounds). <br /> <br /> Harlow flees to France, where she falls in love again - this time with a rich French hamam (Cary Grant). Tons, is currently in the army, and Harlow suddenly back together in a hospital room Grant, where he is in a rehabilitation center with a plane crash. In the next scene, tons accuses Harlow in abandoning it, because it is in fact a gold digger. Harlow never explains to the witness, accusing her of murdering her panic! This is one of those unrealistic, movie plot device in the history of breakdowns. <br /> <br /> Then the tone and return in contact with a woman (Hume), who shot him. She is on hand to watch her lover, Grant, check out the new aircraft, which delivered tons of it from England. Incredibly, both Hume and tone dull to know each other, but just not a place where to! Okay, so that the tone was shot and almost died; may his memory a little out of whack. But how many men were Hume shoot that she forgets one of its brands? (It does not seem to be faking memory lapse.) <br /> <br /> It is inexplicable and unnecessary. Hume had fully recognized him, but played coy when she realized that the tone was not able to contain it. It would be much better to treat this problem. <br /> <br /> In the final it is also very unsatisfactory. The film is done and there is the tone and Harlow in a conspiracy to keep a good reputation cad, Grant, which led to his fraudulent funeral as a hero. Then, Harlow and tone just leave. It is noble to keep the perception of the French public about their national hero of the war, but it is very unsatisfactory as a love story <br /> <br /> The fact that the film begs is: Harlow explains that she was running in panic in the face of charges of murder; Tons forgive her and quietly smokes his love for her; it carries a torch for her, even helping her to falsify the scene of the accident to keep Grant's reputation. At the same time, Harlow finally admits Grant cad he is. Then, seeing tons for the brave and noble man he is, Harlow kindles feelings for him, too. At the end of the film, the two of them come to terms even as they work together to falsify the appearance of Grant's death. After the funeral, Grant's character, we see them hugging and kissing the fade-out. This would make a nice little movie. For fans of the Cary Grant, he would have been even better if the tone played French boor who killed Grant and suffering her first husband, reunited with Harlow. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that Franchot tons cast as an Irishman living in England, while the cast Cary Grant as a Frenchman. This film would have been much better if they changed roles. It would also be more favorable for the film, which was ...
