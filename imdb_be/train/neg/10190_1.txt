After watching this episode on MST3K, I need to know how much this film borrows movies. It seems to combine elements of Escape Logan, Farenheight 451 Final Sacrifice and at least a few others. At some point, I was really looking forward Cris Makepease call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, when the director has no idea how many holes there are on the site. as well as the fact that, even though the gas is not available, there is plenty of it in an abandoned gas station, and the station are situated close enough to each other to keep F1 race car going all the way across the country.
