I was amazed when I saw this movie. I have heard that it was the best ever filmed in the novel. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> like any true fan of Jane Austen may appreciate this adaptation is the secret to my eyes. Writers choose to follow in bits funny humor that confuse the best of times, but also spoil the sense of period. As for the actors: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a pretty small character (but if any "hot" the American star would be questionable in the role), Toni Collette miscast, and poor Ewan McGregor made to look ridiculously <br /> <br! /> I really can not say a good thing about this film. I seem to be among those few who did not appreciate it, but if you want my advice, instead, see the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me, it is much preferable that the surface debris.
