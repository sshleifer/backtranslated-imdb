This is the kind of movie that my enemies content I watch all the time, but it's not the bloody truth. I only watch it once in a while to make sure it's as bad as I first thought it would. <br /> <br /> What Mafiosis steal Boeing 747. (This at least is an improvement over having Boeing steal a good portion of the Pentagon.) plane goes down in the Bermuda triangle and washes under pressure to the bottom, a sort of after the fact submarine. <br /> <br /> This is one of those all-star casts, or falling stars, or slightly above the horizon. <br /> <br /> Â«We are by themselves!" says the pilot Lemmon. He is so good. George Kennedy except. He is in all of these films disasters. <br /> <br /> See another movie instead. Oh, no, "Airport" original. This is not good either. Instead, watch a decent film about stranded planes such as "Flight of the Phoenix."
