Dull, predictable and uninteresting story of a man polluted by chemicals (Weller), going across the country, only to find his ex-wife and child; Meanwhile, he kills everyone in its path just one touch of the hand. In his wicked way, doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) are trying to stop the man. The film has an original premise, but even if it could be much better. The final result is a movie without suspense or clenching moments. Even a good shot completely waste. I give it four (4).
