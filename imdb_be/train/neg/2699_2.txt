I have not read a single IMDb commentary for the film, which recalls a Jewish character in this film was jumping up and down like a little kid, like a gun pointed at his face racist skinhead while leading a black character in the film looked at the severity of the bottom barrel gun. <br /> <br /> I do not know how someone could perceive it as a balanced account of university life. I agree universities are not bastions of tolerance, as they should be, and the name would be appropriate if Singleton did his heroes such broad caricatures. <br /> <br /> On the surface, he tries to reflect the character of Ice Cube in as the bad guy, causing Remy to become racist skinheads. But who graduates at the end of atoning in the epilogue of the film? Singleton seems to point to a white or unable to empathize (I did not say sorry!) With his fellow black student, or only able to take the path of a racist skinhead. Many people who bully the people of other races do not go to the extreme fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Also, not women, who were raped immediately turn to lesbianism, which is portrayed as a cult rather than a way of life. Honestly, that was the point?
