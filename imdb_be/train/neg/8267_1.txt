I'm starting to see a pattern in the movie I give 1. They are almost all movies that my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop having faith in her taste in movies. In any case, it is typical chatter is aimed at pre-teen girls, but do even worse than usual. Once again, the author violated the cardinal rule of any film. He / she has made the protagonist unpleasant. It starts by being a complete b * tch to my friend in the beginning, and then finds out when she becomes 30, she basically sh * the TTY people (with the case, etc.). F Why would we feel for this man? Well, let's say, we can get past this. Jennifer Garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some kind of deformity. I do not know if it's her or wine writer, but her character goes far beyond my irritation threshold. Here's a tip for future creators of film: 13-year-olds do not entertainment, they are annoying. Far and away the most embarrassing moment in the film came when they danced in the «Thriller». Holy crap, that was painful. He showed it to adhere to the dance at the beginning. This explains why she knows, but the whole club full of people?!? Argh !!! Macarena will be more believable! She suddenly completely incompetent and has no idea how to do their job, and no one notices? At least Tom Hanks' character in the "Big" was the work that made sense to the child. These body switching / child becomes an adult at night films are really getting out of hand, and this is by far the worst yet.
