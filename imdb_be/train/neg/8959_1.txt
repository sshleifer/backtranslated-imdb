Some people might consider this film a piece of art - be able to express its view on the film, to create a film full of antagonism, pain and death .. I personally think that this film is disgusted that never should have been released, this the film is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a waste of time, but it makes you sick for the day to come. Terrible pictures shown in the film not only make you understand the air, but they have established in your mind, and it takes a few days to forget about them. Such a shame that people spend their imagination to such inhuman suffering .. "Kill Bill" is another example, but at least, "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution ..
