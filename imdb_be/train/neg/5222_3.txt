This is really a very bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is bad. It is an artificial plot, which combines all sorts of things together that make no sense. It just seems wrong experiment. Secondly, the actors can not play in a realistic manner. They can not even speak properly actor. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do with it now?
