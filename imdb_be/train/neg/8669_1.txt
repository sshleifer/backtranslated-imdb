First of all, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. This is so awful that gets under your skin and sticks to you later. It was one of his best books, from, you know, 451 degrees Fahrenheit, and Dandelion Wine. I once hoped that the film will be all right. It was a lot of chances, with a large cast, Jason Robards and Jonathn Price. And Bradbury wrote the screenplay himself. And on top of all this, he has Grier! <br /> <br /> How can it fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers inside. <br /> <br /> First of all, it has been simplified down. Most of the horror of the book has been lost as Bradbury were forced to keep violence to a minimum. All visuals of books ... gone. All that you have done to squirm ... I am gone. <br /> <br /> And then there is action. Like many films that Disney has thrown in 80 years, the children in this film can not act. And it bugs me a lot, none of them looked 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship has not been resolved. It was more like they were acquaintaces. <br /> <br /> You might think that Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could crank it in their role of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But now it's like they just do not care. All they want to do is to somehow pay off some of the mortgage or something. This is far from some of his best performances. <br /> <br /> Grier was beautiful, like a witch, but the charecter with the Dust Witch was not well pulled off. It is much less evil and has no presence as it did in the book. <br /> <br /> And all that was left of the book. Balloon overnight chase labeling Jim home, the real death of Mr. Darkness, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the carousel, the fate of a Salesman lightish rod, the real death of the witch, and much more. <br /> <br /> And the effects were bad, even for the 80s. Carousel death of one hand with the imposed horses come around was not really terrible, and surprisingly green mist, which actually has nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could keep going on like this film is broken the original novel, but it makes the blood boil. Nha see this movie, but read the book. This is classic Bradbury.
