According to IMDb, as well as any other Web site, providing an overview; This "thing" has no director. Well, that certainly explains a lot! Just a bunch of people who come together to pull off some perverted porn sequence and throw in an ultra-thin plot about worship devils and women sacrifice inside the walls of a secluded hospital. «Hardgore» is a prime example of a completely insane 70-smut, as it is really done with minimal production values ​​and inspiration scenarios. Horror movies about satanic cults were very popular in the early 70s and pornography, as well, so why not combine the two? Here we have simplified the story of a young nymphomaniac girl who held in a psychiatric hospital, and already on the first night, she is drawn into the drug network, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. In fact, a lot of dildo-action. Lesbian Friendly nurse tries to warn her, but she had her throat cut, even in the night. horror aspects really poorly designed, coming from nya-a ridiculously scary masks Satan virulence severed penises attack. Photographing and effective performance almost unbearably amateurish, but what do you expect from the film, which shows footage of sperm shooting dildos and talk severed male reproductive organs? The leading lady of Justin Lin's pretty good looking girl with a beautiful body, but most of her co-stars (men and women) is obnoxious and overly gray goo balls.
