I saw not so fabulous rating on IMDb, but I went to see it anyway, because I'm a big fan of the materials related to the Bible. First, that bothered me was a little too much of the film Indiana Jones wannabe, but he, too, looked Wang Ding not seen these movies through Jones (but it should). I think he tried his best, but the script just smelly. Music tried to be a kind of style of Jones, too. Nice work, but for this film, it seemed like too much work, as a part of the video did't deserve all that wonderful music. Robert Wagner gave his best actor, he did a good job, but somehow the script brought everything down. "Joke" old school, some 20 years; they brought only a cynic smile on my face. There are some really bad angels camera, SFX looks like home and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook was probably a good idea of ​​the history of (in my opinion, but I love these stories), but things just did not work in the end. Maybe he should put it on paper, when it was still fresh in his mind. When I (in the first few minutes) saw that the film was supposed to be one of those "budget films with low" I had hoped that I, at least, to "hear" a good story, but sometimes the movies only to disappoint.
