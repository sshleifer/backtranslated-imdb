I will be very vague idea about their potential damaging comments. There are enough preserved elements of the plot in this film, which is essentially to be spoiled. <br /> <br /> This film gets some ideas from the southern classic, To Kill a Mockingbird. I think, maybe, TKOM got their ideas from any source .... anyway, once you look at it, you'll say, "Oh, yes, it's a rip-off." <br /> <br /> I think it really entertaining thing about these McMovies it as soon as you have identified the land element, to see if they will stick to the original, or try to turn it around. Not many twists in it.
