It was a decent movie, I actually kind of liked it. But the ending is so cool !! There is absolutely no closure and leaves tons of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What's going on with her boyfriend? Does it connect with Grant? Switched it beckons the next semester? And what about Angela? It is obvious that the performance of Holly Angelo will knock down a few pegs, but nothing is specified, to show how it reacts. There's so much left in the air, and it is very unsatisfactory. I do not know when he's trying to leave the scene to continue, or something, but it's a terrible end, and I think it really makes the movie jokes. I was very disappointed.
