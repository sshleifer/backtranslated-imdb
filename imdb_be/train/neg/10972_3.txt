It was not a film of a needle or Guy Ritchie. It was a great wannabee. He wanted to be a sharp, nervous, laughter, urban life-affirming film, but it is more jerky camera mess. It is much easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I could not care less about the characters or what they were involved. They have always been always to strike, write, or weep from each other. Only there was no substance to what they are doing. Dialogue between characters is meant to be a hip, showing instead he goes banal, and one scene after another predictable. I know that there are audiences out there who really liked this movie, so I could be wrong.
