Since the Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was young, I was interested in its continuation. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animated film with high quality all the grandiose music score, and is aimed at a wide audience. In contrast, The Little Mermaid 2 are targeted primarily at young children, because it is a spontaneous, reflecting confidence in the child's perspective, music bouncier and less dramatic, and the ending feels a recess. <br /> <br /> Little Mermaid 2 begins when the child is represented by Melody in the direction of the family Ariel. Cool without any visual cues to help a drama, a giant tentacle missing child. I laughed, wait, it's not funny, a child being attacked! Okay, I'll stop laughing. Morgan crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity, takes the potential of drama, since it happened so fast. <br /> <br /> During the function, the melody seems superhuman, which I advocate, most children present themselves. This quality in the character of the melody is clearly brought to an end when she fights Morgan without an inch of fear on her face. <br /> <br /> As with the first film, the Melody Ariel has many problems, except reverse. Queen Ariel is like her father, limiting it to the ocean, while King Triton Ariel is limited by the surface. Ariel and Melody and rebel against their parents. <br /> <br /> music is emotionally moving in first. This sequel has a bunch of songs, but not as much orchestral work went into it. This is great for little ones, because he does not take the orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The end of the first film was a strong and uplifting. Continued Inflatable song ends and all playing in the water. It is definitely more focused on children, because instead of the end to be solemn and leaving you blown away, this is the ending leaves you thinking, "it's time for a break!" In the end, this film is fun for the children, so we have It will allow them to have fun.
