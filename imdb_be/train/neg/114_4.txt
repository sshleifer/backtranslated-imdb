He was not cast. The thinner a group of actors, you could not find. It is not the installation. The director is in love with New York, and at the end of the film, and all of us! Woody Allen can not improve what Bogdonovich done here. If you're going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the film is the script. There. The actors fall in love at first sight, does not need words. In my own experience director in Hollywood, that's what happens when they go to work on the set. This is the reality for him and his colleagues, but it is a fantasy for most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the film is hollow and shallow, and the message is less.
