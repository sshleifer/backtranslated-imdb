It blows my mind how this movie got made. I watched it while I was working at home to write and respond to emails on the phone - I only watched because I was hoping that "revenge" part will be fine. Needless to say, revenge and boosted turns of the plot is not worth of e-mails in which they observed. in fact, I'm not even sure what happened in the end more. action was as bad as scenarios staging the show «FBI Files» - certainly the worst re-enactment (in fact only the "Arrest and Trial» could be so bad reenactment). I did not even know that the leading man in the Third Eye Blind, until I saw the movie here on IMDb, but it is clear why he has not made any films since. I hope he's a good singer.
