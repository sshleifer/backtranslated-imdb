I may not be very long with attention spans, but this is the second film that I refused to see all the way through, and I even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought that the director plays a big joke, so I'm always waiting for permission to laugh, something to keep my interest, but this solution is not reached. Most likely, the letter was ridiculously amateurish film was delayed and disjointed feeling like someone cut a television series on a full-length. The Academy should be on drugs if they are denominated in this film is not less than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> Another repeat visits. This is the second film I refused to watch all the way through. The first was "The Fighter." I hope this gives you an idea of ​​how bad it really is. 1/10
