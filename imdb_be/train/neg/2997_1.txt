This was filmed back to back in 1992 remake of the famous novel by Conan Doyle's "Lost World". And it shows. <br /> <br /> The film begins promisingly enough, with a ruthless organization intends to operate a lost world and the Challenger and others returned to protect the prehistoric plateau, but then it goes uphill. All screwed onto the plateau, and we were weak, boring, over the length of a rehash of the first film. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (which hardly ever seen) is ridiculous. Are we expected to take this nice toy, which is supposed to be ankylosaur seriously? And tyrannosaurs seem short. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and get hold of a 1925 silent version of The Lost World. Unbelievably in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, Twenties version is the best and will remain so until someone finally decides to make a decent remake.
