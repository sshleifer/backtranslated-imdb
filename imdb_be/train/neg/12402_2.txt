I always thought that people were a little too cynical about these old movies Andy Hardy. A few of them were not bad. Contemporary film criticism are not the ones who tend to prefer well-ugly, so buzz-two shoe movies like these rarely receives praise <br /> <br /> However, I can not defend this film too. You can still have the dated dialogue, but still laugh and cry over history. Watching this, you just shake your head to ask yourself, "How stupid can you get?" It Cornier than banal, if you know what I mean. It's so obvious, I can not see too many people actually sitting all the time-and-a-half. <br /> <br /> The story basically "AndyÂ» (Mickey Rooney) is trying to get out of a jam, because it is the story of associated with some debutante from New York, as if it were a final. People were much more socially-conscious in the old days. You like to hear the term "social climber", as if knowing the rich and beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life. All this is nonsense, of course, is even more so today. <br /> <br /> However, it is about how innocent and clean history and a series (there were half a dozen of the Andy Hardy films did) as you can find. Also, if you want to hear Judy Garland sing, then this is your ticket, as she sings a few songs here and she sings her way into Andy's heart. About people, I almost threw up even write about it!
