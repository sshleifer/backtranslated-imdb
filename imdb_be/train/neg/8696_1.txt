I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park my father. Firstly, I want to say that the story behind the creation of this film, and Amber Alert system is good. However, the film itself was poorly made, and the effect was terrible. The main problem I had with the film included a second half with Nichole Timmons and parents Glen Park. Events around that part of the story is not quite correct. My father suffered from a mental disorder at the time and took Nikol without any intention to harm her at all. He loved her like a daughter, and was under the mindset that he was saving her from any harm or neglect, it is likely to believe, comes from her mother, who paid little attention to it for 3 plus years that my father cared for her and unceremoniously lifted her up so that her mother could have some fun as well. The film portrayed his father in such a way that he was going to harm her in some way or another. The funny thing is that Nicole spent many nights, sometimes consecutively in my parents' place while Sharon will work or do what she does. The reason that my father was originally thought to be tough because it had elements that could be conceived to be a gun in his truck. My father was a Landscaper. Elements are considered weapons gardening tools, which he kept in his truck the whole time. My recommendation is to take the film with a grain of salt, it's a good story, and is based on real events, but details about the film (at least, Nicole Timmons - Glenn Park part) are largely inaccurate and that show directed by the failure to learn the truth by telling a story . The funny thing is that if the director is interviewed any of Sharon's friends, who knew the situation, they said that it was I sent here.
