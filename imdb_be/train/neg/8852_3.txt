To be honest, I have not watched all the original "howl", but these scenes I saw, it was obvious that the first Howl was a great movie. It is so great that the seven terrible sequel had to be made. they started with Â«Howling II: Your sister is a werewolf." I got this film on VHS from my uncle some time ago, when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when Atari was completely new. I just watched it last night and it was not too bad, it was just amazing. I mean, all this with Sybil Danning takes place three-way with two of his minions werewolves just ridiculous and very disturbing (but like hot), Christopher Lee is going to hit a dead Karen, as if she were a vampire, etc. in fact, the film was actually like some hash Dracula and the Lost Boys ... except with the werewolves, because all Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) told about werewolves largely thwarted by any other vampire movie (shares heart, garlic, night creature must die at night, and the ruler of werewolves living in Transylvania). not so much for the action, but the worst came Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the film I found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat, because damn throat always had something to say. Anyway, the plot is pretty stupid and banal, so that there is no real point in talking to you, you can just read about it on Wikipedia. By the way, what really makes me sick about this film is the fact that this is the only film of the seven sequels Thats a, related in any way to the original (except Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of the original, or, in other words, it continued based on the same novel). so do not watch this movie. there is no real horror, hardly any werewolves, and simply awful special effects. 3/10
