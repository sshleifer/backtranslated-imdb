The group is very annoying A-holes torment lame dolls that some elderly people pouring night watchman closed the bag away in the film vault for twenty years, for no reason at all. <br /> <br /> Many people are aware that this film only with a point on MST3K ribbing about Flick. But I've seen a real movie and I can say with confidence that yes, it's bad, really, really bad. With one of the worst "fight" scenes I've ever seen that scarecrow "aliens" toys that are affected by movements lack (I had My Pet Monster, which was terrible) up to the brutal action (I had May Pet Monster was a charismatic) However, as stated movies "Vice Academy" Rick Sloan somehow, and believe me, I do not know how earth, much worse. This is not to say that this film is nothing but crap, because it is not. Just throw it out there <br /> <br /> Eye Candy :. A lot of nudity in the film proper, but there are 2 pairs of boobs in the DVD introduction to the film <br /> <br /> My evaluation: the D- <br /> <br /> retromedia DVD Extras: Jim Wynorski preface; Stills from the film gallery; and the trailer for this film
