Prior to this TV movie started, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was made after the last episode of the series was shown and many of the original series were gone. There's not a president Sheridan, division, Lennier, Londo, Vir, GKar or Lita. If you remember, on the second to last episode of the series, all regulars except Zack, Vir and Captain Lochley left B-5 times. Now, for this film, they return Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 films) to join the chained and the captain and the doctor makes a short and unwanted appearance. But because so many went out of the old chemistry, the film has serious disabilities. <br /> <br /> The film is about Hunter Soul (Martin Sheen), who brought to Babylon 5 in search of the world filled with the souls that were stolen from a hidden storage archaeologist (Ian McShane). Many ghost fetish stuff going on, but to be honest it was a bit silly and pointless. Yes, yes, the station is about to explode, but was saved and everything, but to be honest, I felt that it was a case of "been there done that - and have done so much better in the pastÂ» <br /> <br /. > Secondary site provided more to the comic, was much more interesting, because the entrepreneur has established holo-brothel, and those in the team were not sure what to do, and when they tried to force them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit. It was down, but it provides a few laughs. - something else tiresome story was, of course, is not enough <br /> <br /> By the way, Sheen first did a good job playing the recommended Hunter - with his wild eyes and quirky delivery. Nevertheless, several times throughout the episode he fell out of character. It was to be seen and corrected. <br /> <br /> Thus, the final verdict is only for general-hard nuts B-5 (I). Others, seeing that it can take on a number is drawn - that a great injustice. This is an excellent example of the show, not knowing when to quit.
