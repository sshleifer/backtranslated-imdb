This is very bad, when a general synopsis of the film has more information than the film itself. Paragraph-long "plot summary" written on the page there are details of the film, I could not learn from watching the actual movie. I have found that consistently maintains it to see the details, I just missed that could tell me what (BIP) occurs. Alas, to no avail - the film leaves the monstrous pieces of history when you could call it a story. It's like they are trying to deceive us into thinking that there was some film here, the shooting is simple enough, so that there is a similarity of history and leaving the rest of our fantasies. Newsflash to the creators: I paid to see how you make a movie. I can sit at home and imagine plots and storylines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I never paid enough attention to be able to put a name to the face, and I can understand why. She was one of the most artificial productions that I've seen on the leading character in any movie, A, or B. I figured, well, maybe she did not really want the role, just received a hefty offer for the film, she was not? Wrong. It was registered as one of the manufacturers. The next time you do something, the entire booking of ourselves as a leading, if you can not act. If you really can, and then create a worthy symbol for you to become. In addition, someone here mentioned white / latino question - yes, I do not want to say, but this film really came across as an act of revenge against the white college-age men who wear baseball caps. This is what happens when there is nothing in the film, to ingratiate itself to the observer in Latin characters. Adrian character seems cocky jerk who is not better than the antagonist of the story. As regards the nature of Maya, it did not seem like a real person. In any case, I am ashamed of Hollywood that the movie was even made.
