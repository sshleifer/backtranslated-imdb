Rob Schneider is a well-known comedian cause of his movements, the care of the person and the performance of "not human." He Beast at this time. Marvin loser who tries to be a hero and one day, no one receives a call from a man who gets attacked, so Marvin have to take the case and save the people attacked. But on the way to the scene, he falls to his car and gets really damaged. He does not remember what was going on, and the next normal day, his life is not the same when he learns that he has animal instincts. Of course, we have a female that our protagonist is trying to achieve, but it tryings, useless. She plays Lap Haskell. There are no negative characters. Negative, this is the fate, if I could use this metaphor. Marvin have to figure out how to become a normal person again. By the way, his animal instincts, helps him in some situations. Schneider performance is so-so. The film is so unreal that it becomes silly at some point, but it's one of those movies that are called dumb fun as I wrote above. So watch it for monkey style of Rob Schneider, but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever, or one of the best films that appear in Schneider. He is a great comedian, but this is not his best film.
