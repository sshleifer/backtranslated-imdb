Our teacher showed us this film in the first grade. I have not seen him since. I just watched the trailer, though. It looks like a first-class movie for you? I do not think so. I was horrified by the fact that this film, I could barely see. It was basically a scene from Shirley MacLaine sharp this little girl in half, and then there was a boy with ketchup! I was shocked by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion, possibly, small children should not see this movie, despite the fact that the PG. Be aware of possible outcomes, showing it to children. I do not even remember what it was about, once was enough!
