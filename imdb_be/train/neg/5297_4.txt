It really boggles my mind when someone comes through the movie like this and claims that it will be one of the scariest horror movies out there. This is definitely not one of the worst there is still not a good movie, but not the worst, though. It goes something like nurse's death or the lake of blood, and then come back to me and tell me if you think that the Night brings Charlie is the worst. The film has a decent camera work and editing, which is much more than I can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films. <br /> <br /> The film is not put to death on the screen, there is one death, where do you see him rip pruning saw in the neck, but all the other death hardly interesting. But the lack of on-screen graphic violence does not mean that it's not a slasher, just bad. <br /> <br /> The film was clearly designed not to be taken too seriously. The film was released at the end of the second cycle of the chopper, so this is certainly a reflection of the traditional elements of the chopper, made in an ironic way. For example, after the murder, Charlie goes to a greeting, "" city, and notes down the population is less than one. This is something that can only get a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are in the chopper movies, certainly give that film look. It's a bit different from your usual slasher with the two killers, but not much. movie comedy pretty much tells the audience to relax and not take the movie so god damn seriously. You can forget about a movie, you remember it. I remember it because I love the name.
