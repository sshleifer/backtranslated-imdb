Down to earth about Lance Burton, the black comedian who falls under the truck. He goes to heaven, and he gets to get another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, white guy. So Lance does a few things in the body, Charles. The film has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie, if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar 2005 animated comedy, the better. This is a good film, but Chris Rock did way better than that. It will only make you laugh about 4 times the film. And it does not really laugh out loud funny. You'll laugh to yourself, and you can giggle, but you definitely will not roll on the floor laughing.
