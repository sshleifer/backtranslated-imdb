John Candy. Need I say more? He is the main reason you should see this film. Most people do not realize how gifted he was an actor. Witness his change from bad to slush horny jerk. Just simple (thin) changes people and we go. There are lots of bits in this film, and many really stupid bit. The best times for me are the scenes Kung FU U, as well as the big moment when John (in a trance) comes on stage and says how much he loves his girlfriend, that is, how much he loves his genitals and his girlfriend. I'm sure that reading this you might think, this sequence sounds very rough. It is, but it is also very funny, because basically it is John Candy makes it a little. History generally pretty lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (SCTV, both graduates of candy) do not give enough to make the film. Levi has its moments, especially at weddings shooting at the end (I think Rod Serling) and the big stage when he is talking to his mother on the phone. In general, a good movie, if you had a bad day, and you need to put your brain to dull. I give it a 4 out of 10.
