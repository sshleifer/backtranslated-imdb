author of the book of the same name, does not allow her name to use for this film. if you read the book, this film takes such a liberal interpretation of actual events in the book and its spirit of the film and the book seems to have very little in common except the name and some surface details. the film does not add anything in terms of artistic value, to their own literary achievement books <br /> <br /> for those who have not read the book :. You will also be disappointed. not only the plot moving at an incredibly slow pace, it does not offer anything more until she moves slowly (for example, character development, for example). some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later in the film, but you can also watch as Showtime especially for material that they show in Therese and Isabelle - its pretty tame and not creative at all.
