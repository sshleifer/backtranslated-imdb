There is no doubt as to who in the cadets training team in this film: Major Chick Davies (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays the officer who sticks to the military discipline in the creation of a new type of soldier of his students - scorer. But it is not so hard to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his mind about the value of women in the armed forces. He's tough, when it should be, but in other cases it is a striking combination of coach and pastor, roles that he improved in other films. His character is the basis for action, around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role and played it in great shape. Two things helped this film: O'Brien's performance and impressive special effects that result.
