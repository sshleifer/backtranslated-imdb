only the worst movie I have ever seen in the theater. I saw this film at the film festival in Austin in 2004, and it blew my mind that this film has been accepted to the festival. it was an interesting premise, and it seemed that he could go anywhere, but simply fell apart every time he tried to do something. First of all, if you're going to do a musical, to find someone with a musical flair. Music games consisted of cheese on a piano that sounded like they were playing it on the stereo in the room that they rented. songs were written badly, and if they were not obvious rhymes, they groan induces rhyme, which showed how much they were stretching to try to make this film work. and you think you would find people who could sing, doing a musical, is not it? not in this case. Fortunately, they were talking half / half chanting in rhyme most of the time, but when they sing it made me shudder. especially when they are trying to sing in harmony. and that simply refers to the music. Some action has been pretty good, but a lot of the dialogue was terrible and most of the scenes. they obviously did not have enough lighting in the scene, or they were simply bad editor, because they consistently jumped the line and used a terrible choice during the cutting of the film. at least, the director was ready to admit that no one wanted the script, as long as they did not add a hook makes it music. I hope that investors make sure that someone can write music, before you make the same mistake again.
