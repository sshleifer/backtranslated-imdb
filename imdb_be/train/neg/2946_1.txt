I must say that in my childhood I was very proud of the many I rented movies. The exception is the Theodore Rex. Talk about constant cheater cinema resume any actor. Could you imagine that fired agent Whoopi must have told her to sign this piece of shit, "Hey Whoop, you ever see the dinosaurs, so well they make a movie out of it, and you can see Germany! "After that the agent should have a lot of Star Wars references. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, I thought that Whoopi shall redeem each copy of the film and it was destroyed. I just want to it could do the same thing in my mind, because my sister still gives me shit for watching this movie. I mean, c'mon, I even admit that I watched Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in theaters (good reasons why I gave up both of Hulk Hogan and Shaka for a while), but this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood, and with th largest rental regret of his life, and that was 16 years ago. I'm 24 now, if you want to do the math. <br /> <br /> Every time I think that my permanent list of the worst films I have even not talking about this one, because, as raped step child, I try hard to hide the fact that ever happened. Screw you Whoopi, just be glad that people just accept Sister 2 of Eddie as the worst case, you lucky stiff.
