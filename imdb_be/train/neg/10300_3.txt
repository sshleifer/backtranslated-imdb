I'm a fan of artistic films, but unfortunately I have to inform this film to be pretentious chatter. Painfully slow to develop a non-existent plot, based on a promising premise experience, say again. Even after the bad films I feel like I learn something, whether to use some aspect, but there was nothing to assess. The room was not interested, but the film begins and ends. Action was fine, although the characters were quite boring. For the protagonist strive for a daring goal, she was very empty. Sorry. I usually take movies that unformulaic, but no formula should not be confused with zero.
