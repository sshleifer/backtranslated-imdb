Really, really deplorable Canadian-German co-production, ever great Ryazanov Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - a few uears to the "action" of the child killed her father, and her mother took the fall for posterity. Now she stood in the north-western part of the United States to start all over again, but her child still have a problem in that it is dedicated to her mother. So devoted that she kills anyone who may be regarded as a threat to their relationship <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaffer (as the daughter) kills more than people. - it provides such a terrible job, it also wipes out the film, though incoherent script, direction useless and terrible music (check the saxophone for the first time, she shows off her bikini BOK) does not help; we have to find her sexy and scary, but it fails on both counts. Almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be funny (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer just do not see how a mother and daughter), all condolences to Miss Arquette and Prochnow, both of which are worth much more than that, and both of them (in particular, Ryazanov) are the only reasonable cause anyone to sit through this mishmash <br /> <br /> One of the production company called Quality International Films -. not as a three-hour "Love, Lies and Murder" (two short Productions) has been so "Are you kidding" credit.
