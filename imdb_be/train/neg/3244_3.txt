The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist involved with scams so cutesy that I must assume that this was the desired goal. Sets are artificial and not once did I feel like I'm watching a movie. It seemed that the actors just read them up, rather than reacting with each other. While the film has elements of early film noir (except in color) approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> Given that the presentation was not appealing to me, I was not, at least, waiting for an attractive story. I'm usually pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists, but you could see that they had come here for the first fifteen minutes. By the time of the Â«Gee, I forgot, $ 80,000" moment, I thought that this thing is really funny. For a psychiatrist with the specified experience in gaming preferences, to act so stupid beyond belief. If at any stage it behaved as a normal intelligent man, the whole story would collapse. <br /> <br /> This wooden products left me cold.
