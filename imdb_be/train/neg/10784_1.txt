It was disgusting and painful. Which waste gypsum! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed twice within 90 minutes. It's not a lie. Not even rent it. <br /> <br /> Zeta-Jones was too mean to be true. <br /> <br /> Cusack was OK. Normal. I felt sorry for him (actor) if anyone remembers this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as it always has. Charming and sweet, but without purpose. "Roman" John was absolutely incredible.
