Youth Victor Vargas could not terrible is that he tries to be himself: be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality to this film. Characters and situations feel quite artificial and fake. <br /> <br /> What is the reason? Bad directing. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in their arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollett read somewhere that without turning his film will give him a real sense. Wrong! She just gives him poorly made sense. Similarly, the camera shake does not give you documentary style film, it just gives the audience a headache and detract from what is on the screen, rather than to improve it. <br /> <br /> It is known that on the screen so painfully fake, as if Mr. Sollett wrote the script for the sole purpose of trying to look "hip" to his friends Sundance and show how "annoying" director he said. <br /> <br /> Overall, only a lasting impression the film leaves you with a bad manager Mr. Sollett there. Next time, how about taking some classes to write and direct?
