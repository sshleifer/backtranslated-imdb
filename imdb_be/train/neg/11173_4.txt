If it were not for the bad dialogue and script. I mean, the direction is really in contact with his subject. The actors do well to bring their characters to life. But in the end, what was really lacking was a solid script to keep all the pieces together. I strongly recommend not to look at it. If you're not an enthusiast Al Pacino, as I'll watch everything he plays. Even if the result of the recent rather poor. It is, after S1m0ne, the second film is very bad for the actor, who once knew how to choose roles.
