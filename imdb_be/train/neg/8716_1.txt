I do not know where to start; acting, special effects and a letter all about as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production staff has reached a point where they said, "Our work is done, the time for his release." I'm just glad that the first two in the series never made it as far as the United Kingdom. I would really recommend watching this film just so that you can assess how well done the majority of films. <br /> <br /> I do not know how any of the other users of IMDb may find it scary when the "terrible" dinosaur waddled down the hallway with his hands around the rubber rotation.
