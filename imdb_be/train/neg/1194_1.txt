I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but not many as bad as this. This is a movie that makes fun of overweight people, has no real history, there are bad actors, not funny, and much more. Is this a movie you'd like to see? I think not! <br /> <br /> I think that the creators of the movie trying to be original and creative, but it looks like it was done in the 12-year-old child with absolutely no skills at all cinematic. The so-called funny part of it is so funny how throughing pies in the faces of people, or a violation of the wind. Since when aware of this kind of humor that you like, then this movie is for you !! <br /> <br /> Dont spend money on this movie!
