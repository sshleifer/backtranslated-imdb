One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two big comics turned into juice for recalcitrant child. They both indulge in this one worse than the nature of Pryor. Two: A terrible, overly sentimental script that can be used in the film Harold Lloyd him so clich√©. Three: Choosing a black actor as a toy; racial subtext is intolerable, since it has never been addressed. There are no posts here, part of Pryor could be reproduced by any comedian. Four: That kid ... I would like to go back in time and prevent it from ever existing ... it would mean movies like this and Kid Co., it could not have been done ... and my childhood would have been free their mind warping power. So if you want to see some great comics unclean in annoying kiddie flick, go ahead. If you want to see them in something good, to see the old standing act of Pryor and Gleason in something better, like Young.
