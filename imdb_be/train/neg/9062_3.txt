This film is characterized by the fact that he did not show the typical gay stereotypes that I was used to seeing. But it does not change the fact that it is completely missing the story. I'm sure there are many gay men who are just happy to see himself portrayed on the screen as black gay characters are rarely seen, and if they are the characters usually are not fully developed. But, as it was difficult would it be for the writer is actually the scenario story with a beginning, middle and end. Or how about a story that was focused. There really does not seem to point in this film, and despite the fact that this low-budget film that is still no excuse for the lack of plot or story.
