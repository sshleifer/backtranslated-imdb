He felt that I was watching this movie a thousand times before.It was absolutely predictable.Every time the story trying to get a little twisted, every time I expected something interesting to happen, I did not see anything other than what I expected. As "Bread factory opened another means, because there was not enough bread." In a nutshell: Flat history, which has become a clich√©, bad acting, bad special effects ... only stupid Russian policeman, Vlad was a little funny, but punishing the poor around guys.The chest muscles were so incredibly stupid that it made me laugh them for a moment. I wonder why I waste my time spitting out of shame in his film ... It will not be worse (because it is not possible): D
