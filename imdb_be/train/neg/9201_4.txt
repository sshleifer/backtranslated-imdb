This is a film that embodies the D & D fear of the 80s (and even today). Fear that people who play in the D & D (or any other role-playing game for that matter) is "sucked" and lose the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and go on sprees murder, donations of children, suicide, etc.) . A great movie for those who like to blame the problems of society at inanimate objects, but anyone who plays a role-playing video games, or even acting in the game is to see it as an insult to their intelligence. This D & D, that was Wargames computers. In addition, as a movie, it's just kind of sucks.
