... let me count the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. Title only "remake", which stretches all the clich√©s in the chopper manual. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot is so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. Very weak performance of all attempts tension or thrills. <br /> <br /> 4. PG-13 rating, which does not insure no gore, violence, or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. The villain who does not frighten even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. Cast characters are so finely written and stereotypes that we could not take care of them. <br /> <br /> 7. The absence of any effective eerie atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night). <br /> <br /> 8. Dialogue scenario, it is for the poor - is mind staggering. <br /> <br /> 9. cardboard Series performances (not sure whether to blame the lousy actor or above scenario for this). <br /> <br /> 10. Quite unsuitable teen-oriented slasher remake this is not brave enough to try to have an idea -. Or even to show a pool of blood <br /> <br /> It is entirely elementary horror fans, save your money <br. /> <br /> bombs ****
