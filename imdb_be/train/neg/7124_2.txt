A man brings his new wife to his home, where his ex-wife died from an "accident". His new wife had just been released from an institution, as well as very rich! All of a sudden she starts to hear the sounds and see the skulls everywhere. Will it be crazy again or first wife comes back from the dead? <br /> <br /> You probably guessed it, the end, so I did not write it. I've seen it many times on Saturday afternoon television as a child. Then, I liked it, but I was young. Seeing it now, I realize how bad it is. It's terrible acted, poorly written, very boring (even an hour) and has a huge cast of five people (one director)! Nevertheless, it does have some good things about it. <br /> <br /> Music kind of awful and install himself with a huge empty house and a pond next to a beautifully atmospheric. There are also a few scary moments (I jumped a little when she saw the first skull) and several effective ending. In general, it is definitely not a good movie ... but not a complete disaster either. He has a small cult. I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> In addition, try to avoid Elite DVD Drive in the publication of his (it's paired with "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). It is in a terrible state with leaps and scratches all over. He did not even look that bad on TV!
