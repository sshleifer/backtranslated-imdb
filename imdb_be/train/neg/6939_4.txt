R Balki tries to tell you a story that has been told before Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensual way. At this time, it is mixed with mature humor. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and has Indian cuisine in London. It is very useful and arrogant and respects his job just like any other work. According to him, cooking is an art. I still can not make Hyderabadi Biryani correctly. <br /> <br /> Enter Taboo, who sends it to her to make her Hyderabad Biryani and soon begins to talk and finally falls in love with one another ?? Amitabh and Tabu is 65 ?? 35. Many Probs! But one Hitch! Father taboo Paresh Rawa !! Couples decided to meet his father for approval of their marriage.

The dialogues of the film memorable. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled. Comedy is sometimes misunderstood.

Director R Balki could give much better from this scenario. But in the second half he looks confused. «Satyagrah» father scene seemed annoying. But the lines uttered by Amitabh Bachchan during this scene are clap worthy. <br /> <br /> In general, Cheeni Kum need to have more sugar!
