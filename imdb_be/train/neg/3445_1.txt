When a young Kevin gets his deceased uncle's boat as a present, he invited the five members of it on a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. While traveling, they drink alcohol, sex and play the game, each of them tells his greatest fear. Kevin later drowned in the open sea, the engine is stopped, and they were persecuted and killed their greatest inner fear. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three friends joined to watch "enchanted boat" on DVD. In less than 30 minutes of time, the group abandoned the view of this filthy and boring amateur piece of shit, and we decided to watch another film. Later, I decided to watch the rest of this flick to see how bad it can be, and it would be better to go to bed to sleep. Tangled is a terrible film and cinematography, with a cast that is likely to learn to be actors and actresses, and in the end, the fil LM appears to be a bad project Film School. A terrible and pretentious script shows a funny twist in the end, is really a mess, which made me understand that the history of everything. There was a girl with a mind and traveled alone in a boat, imagining the whole situation with ? imaginary friends If so, that is their friend again at the end of the fruit of her madness ?. My voice alone <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para Morte" ( "Journey to death")
