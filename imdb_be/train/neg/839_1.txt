Only redeeming part of this film was the price I paid. At least all that I have lost is $ 3.00, and the elapsed time sitting through this bomb. A crew member who was responsible for the continuity released. If a woman is the lead guy and went to the FBI alleged killer place, Mr. FBI handed female revolver. If the alleged killer went out the door, the revolver is magically transformed into a circuit. One is to think about FBP agent hands a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Ms. Xavier, seem very attractive woman. It's too bad, R rating is not allowed much of it to be seen. It would seem that the film editor to cut out what may have been the best part of the movie.
