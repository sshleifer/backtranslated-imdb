I'm a big fan of B5, caught on until the end of the third season. I actually watched all the previous seasons, when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought-out story arcs ever hit the TV. Even filling episodes were interesting. Films were also well prepared and as entertaining as anything to hit theaters. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the "River of SoulsÂ». Naturally, after viewing all the rest, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen seems to be acting in the film Ed Wood, not serious science fiction stories. The story itself, would look good in schematic form, even made it to the storyboard. Nevertheless, he suffers, obviously, when it's time to fill the concept with two-hour movie. There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the complete absence of compelling stories. There are places where they are clearly not enough time and simply improvised dialogue to fill the story with. If it did the regular season, he would rate among the worst episodes.
