I must admit that I was a Samurai movie for youngsters, as I remember. I watched quite illegible, whether it be "elite" works like The Seven Samurai or bloody comic variations as Lone Wolf and Cub. I also like us- / Japanese "crossovers" like Bushido Blade. And, of course, all containing Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I watched almost every samurai, at least twice. But Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993, the first time I watched Kabuto on video, even samurai films can be boring. In the beginning, I am looking forward Mayeda reach Europe and confrontations that would have come from it, but by the time he actually reached Spain, I really did not care so much for the movies anymore. <br /> <br /> It will not do justice to call the film "bad." Technically, it is a clean entry into the genre. But there is simply never quiet. Kosugi have limited skills, both as a director and actor, and have only a portion of the Japanese actors Charisma mentioned above. And if we talk about Sho Kosugis son Cain, who appears in almost all the films Kosugi as the son of OSB: he inherited little by either one of the parents is limited to acting. Adding to the negative point is the lack of blood and gore, that by that time there was a trademark of the film Samurai. It was apparently intended for a young American / European audience. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it's so-so film for the average fan of historical adventure, but sad for hardened fans of Samurai movies. Fans who «Samurai meets ??" - a genre, we must rather go and watch the Red Sun (1971), pointing to Charles Bronson as a cowboy who has to team up with a samurai Toshiro Mifume get a samurai sword from the bad guy Delon, This pretty much how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> Thus, despite the fact that the film is only 100 minutes seems to be a much longer movie. <br /> <br /> so I gave it pride of 4/10 instead of 3/10 points: The first time I saw this film, I saw him in the German synchronized version. In this version Kosugi can actually understand. I must admit that his «Engrish» sometimes funny but tiring after about 30 minutes.
