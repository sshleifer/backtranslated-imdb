Aah, dull TV shows and pilots who have been slapped together in 70 years to do the same dull TV Movies! Some examples will be Riding With Death (most hysterically cheesy lot), Stranded in Space (confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco (terribly dull and incredibly confusing), and this pompous little Quinn Martin glamor. <br /> <br /> Shot in Hawaii (though you would not know it from the exterior shots), it seems a bad pilot lame spy show. The real problem is that you do not; 'T like most of the characters, including the protagonist gray Diamond Head, which seemed to be half asleep throughout the film; his boss' Aunt Mary, which was really amazing delivery of their lines and shellac of white hair and a tan that looked like it was plastered on; girlfriend Diamnd Head / male agent (hell, I can not even remember her name) thin wooden woman with a flat manner of speaking, it's just not sexy or interesting; and singing sidekick Zulu (again, I can not remember the name of your character), which was not bad in small doses. The most interesting man in the whole production was Ian McShane, who is drawn like a bad guy, but still proved his acting chops. Alothugh makeup jobs so-called "chameleon" is used to disguise himself, were simply ridiculous. I have absolutely no idea what he is doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that made him dress like a South American dictator cum American general. And I do not care. The plot just was not interesting enough to hold your attention even ten minutes at a time, not to mention the one and a half hours or so goes. Just call it - Hawaii Five No!
