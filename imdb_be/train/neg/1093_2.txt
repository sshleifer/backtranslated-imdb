Kitten Natividad, a Russ Meyer movie fame, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has found her breast cancer, so she goes to South America in order to get some special fruits (Crockazilla?), Who is to be curative. Going down to some of these fetuses (which appears on the plastic banana stalks) Chastity given certain mysterious magic power, making it a super hero, in particular, Double D Avenger. Note that it also has a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, that all sounds very good. Pursuant to, well, it leaves much to be desired. One gets the impression that chastity belongs to a local pub and strip upset because she taking your business some of the strippers (including Haji, as Russ Meyer movie fame) to go after her, to destroy her. Of course, chastity manifested in the form of double-D Avenger. Watch her make a "Wonder Woman" type of spin to change her outfit, and lose your balance because of excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame ambiguity fly like there was no tomorrow. With a silly theme song played over and over again, it comes off as a twisted 70 "live-action" shows a small adult content, but while it is unrated, he can probably get away with a PG-13 at worst. And it is likely to benefit that pale stars are stored well covered. This makes Chesty Morgan films Doris Wishman look positively wonderful in comparison. A special kind of Forrest J. Ackerman, but so what. Very stupid, and I will never buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 of 10.
