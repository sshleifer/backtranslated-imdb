I'm sorry, I know that Fassbinder is still considered one of the greatest filmmakers in post-war Germany, and that the majority of his films are considered "master part", but when I see the "Lili Marleen" Today, in 2004, I wonder what it all and far about the movie! Act just scared - Schygulla all smiling like an idiot! - then changings between the Nazi and glamor battleground funny, the whole film looks as if it was done in two days in the attic. Probably it was in this way, and many people seem to take it for a "real art", but this film for me is just bad and cheap. Compare this to the Visconti Â«La Caduta Gods" and tell me again that "Lili Marlene" a good movie ...
