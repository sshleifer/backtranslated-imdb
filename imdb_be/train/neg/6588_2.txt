Below are some of the most roaring problems with this movie: 1) Cliche abounds. Seriously, awful "twist" everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative jumps in time, it would be good if done well, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Lama characters who do not develop the same way as any remain completely static, or drastically change without cause <br /> <br /> 4) The big one :. IO terrible ... On top of almost every person <br /> <br /> Here are some of the best points of the movie :. 1) Lead damn good looks <br /> <br /> As I understand it, there are only two types of people who would be in this movie :. a) People who can sit through 90 minutes of a scar just because lead is an attractive <br /> <br /> b) People often think to myself, "I like Hollywood dreck rife with cliches and replays but if I could just look at the Korean ... "there's a lot of good Korean movie there, so why waste time with garbage?
