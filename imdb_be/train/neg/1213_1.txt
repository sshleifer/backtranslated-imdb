I can not believe that love Guillermo del Toro and Basinger got involved ins this piece of garbage! The script is so poorly written and so weak direction (as the same person), it is difficult to find even one-dimensional characters in the film. Dialogues are so lame that this so-called thriller got a laugh out of the few fools who fell to the theater. Installation is difficult, inviting you to believe that you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly finds himself in the foolish pursuit of the film. Bassinger character is so stupid that she actually stopped crying to God: "Where are you" so that people could follow after it, and then takes a leak !!!! And then, apparently, they were in the smallest tree in the world, I mean, she runs all over the place and the killer never lose track of it, and it happens in the middle of the night. It really makes me wonder is that really the best writers in Hollywood, people may find that they spend millions of its production.
