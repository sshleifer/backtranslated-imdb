After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep, I decided that I could be entertained while I was suffering from lack of sleep. This film was on HBO, and I decided to see. What a mistake <br /> <br /> That's the plot of (potential spoilers if you even care): a neurotic man with a taste for sweets (Josh Kornblut) works as a temp for some ridiculous companies. Suddenly, he is offered the chance to 'go perm ", which seems to be a favorite phrase from the movie. But with the safe operation and safe profits in his hands, Josh decides, for some stupid reason, he does not want to do it. He is hopelessly spoiled a few minor problems, and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send several "very important" letter within a certain period of time, should be fun, but that's just silly. Josh meets a woman and brings a lawyer, and they wind up in bed (obviously Josh fantasy in real life, as such things would not happen ever). A lot of other things going on, but it is too banal and pointless to go now <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is billed as a comedy, I just laughed at him twice. the first time was the first shot from Josh Kornbluta (my first reaction was one of fear stuffy), and the second when he was in bed with an attractive woman (yeah, right). Josh Kornblut, perhaps the most terrible man who looks I've ever seen in my life. It is unattractive, overweight, balding Jew, I must believe, is having sex with beautiful women. I do not sympathize with the character of Josh. He is lazy and unmotivated, and I just did not appreciate the humor failed attempts. Miss it, even if your life depends on it.
