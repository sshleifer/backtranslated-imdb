First I watched 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): Pretty lame by the disaster of the Titanic is the first filmed version of this very event announced. Replication disaster is not bad, but the drama around it several times silly, poorly acted and the way too as a soap opera. The story is very much like the last one Oscar-winning In addition, we have shown how the crew was trying to hide the real catastrophe does not occur until almost too late. Well just to get a feel for what James Cameron opposed the (nearly ??) in his leisure nostalgia purposes.
