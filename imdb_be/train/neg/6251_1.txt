I was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget film. The most glaring absurdity is that while the American prisoners in North Korean prison camp all allegedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine, going without bathing, shivering in the old and dirty jackets, and sleeping on the bare floor, and - let us not forget, suffering torture - they always manage to sport perfectly coiffed hair. Except suitably stern-looking Harry Morgan as an army major, casting and acting are horrible. Ronald Reagan can not seem to stick drawing of the same sign, and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. Basically Caucasian cast drawing officers of North Korea's camp might have been forgivable, but if Russian officers acting as advisors Koreans strut around wearing a re-badged Nazi uniforms, complete with riding breeches and boots (obviously costume department recycles from the Second World War click) and speaks with an accent as General Burkhalter from Hogan's heroes, well, that's a total of six kinds of stupid. Do not waste your time on this.
