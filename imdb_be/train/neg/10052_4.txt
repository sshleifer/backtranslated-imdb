Warner Bros. I made a lot of schlock in the 1930s, and most of them rapidly, economically and very interesting. I really love how the studio is exploited less showy elements of our daily life. This is one of the few hard-edged dramas Warner, that just does not work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editor, which brings to 20-year-old killer story with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a live performance, but it is surrounded by the actors, do not cut the mustard. H.B. The Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff's good, but a bad game Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell second is really hurt the film. Starr is especially bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the film. In addition, the moral tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of previous Hollywood code. Leroy direction completely innovative visual touch, but he can not overcome the bad actors' and unintentionally funny situation. Cinematography Sol watered strong. Anyway, this piece of dreck received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (in the course of the year, which gave us the "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
