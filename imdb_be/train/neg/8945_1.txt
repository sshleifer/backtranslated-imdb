I must admit that there are several books with relevant films that I actually read before watching the cinematic adaptation. Nineteen Eighty-four cases, one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was an exciting and interesting to be prophetic. But the movie just sucks. This is easily the worst film I've ever seen. The only reason why I did not turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the film was half assigning two parts for the class. It was dark and grotesque, but did nothing in the way of achieving the proper atmosphere. Action was nothing above average, and taking into account the fact that there was not much to play, it is very annoying. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that he was unable to smoke more than one location at a time. Boring, disturbing and visually unappealing, the film is completely disassembled the book. Wait a second ... Is not it the British?
