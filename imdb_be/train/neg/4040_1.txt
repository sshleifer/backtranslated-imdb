I consider myself a bit of a snob when it comes to all, and even cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than high drama, I can be very delayed about movies too. <br /> <br /> Not all movies, but better than King Kong. I am quite possibly give Kong two stars, doubling the film in perspective. <br /> <br /> I think people got so excited about this, because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in the game. For less demanding art extravaganza, a film that looks like a game of "great art." <br /> <br /> This film, however, was useless. <br /> <br /> There was hardly any story so she relied on high drama. The only drama in this film was a cat falling off the roof or not. Thus, a deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No. Excellent work? . Hardly <br /> <br /> To be overly fair: Some of the decorations were interesting, though: the communist apartments, urban perspectives (? Petersburg) and the Soviet trams still in service.
