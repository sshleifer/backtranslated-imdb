This sequel is a complete rehash of the first film. It is pointless film. It's basically just took each sceanrio the first film, and they transformed it into Omen IV except the female of the Antichrist at this time. He even ends the same way as the first one! Music is too busy, and intervention, and because of its pretty much a copy of Omen I, it's very predictable. It's not a terrible film, it's not terribly done, there are a lot worse movies out there, it's just there was absolutely no point in having done so. Omen remake of 2006 is much worse, even more senseless than this, so I guess it has something. If someone showed a gun to your head, and you had to choose to see a continuation or 2006. reamke, I think I would choose this one.
