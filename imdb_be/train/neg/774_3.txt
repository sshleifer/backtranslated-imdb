This film seems to have been made by someone with some good ideas, but who also had never made a film before, nor had they considered that the script should be edited, altered, or even funny. When I saw this film, I saw John Candy and assumed wrongly that it would be fun. Instead, it was a stupid story about mind control and so many flat unfunny moments. And, to top it off, chocolates delivered to some of the worst lines I've ever heard so far. Thus, despite the potentially funny cast and story ideas, we are left with amateur and raw film, which is likely to be too stupid for the average adult, even though teens are likely to find a few laughs. It really is a shame - it could be a lot better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy it was great.
