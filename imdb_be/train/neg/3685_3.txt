The main reasons to see "red eyes" Rachel McAdams, which provides excellent performance and Jayma Mays, who is a beautiful as the assistant manager of the hotel. On the other hand, Killian Murphy overacts so much that it becomes cartoonish. The rest of the film is riddled with plot holes, which I will. <br /> <br /> Please do not read on if you do not want to know what happens! <br /> <br /> Here plot synopsis. the character of Rachel McAdams (as Lisa) runs the hotel, where a new hard-nosed director of Homeland Security is planning to stay the night. Rachel returned to Miami from the funeral, but fielding calls from his assistant until the plane leaves. At the same time, someone is outside his father's house, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him when Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All Lisa do so at your phone and move the package of the coach, where Jackson cohorts plan to fire a guided missile (from the fishing boats) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> So, here are some of the holes the plot or ridiculous coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make a call, and in the middle, phones on the plane loses contact. Lisa tries to fake that she makes a call, but coincidentally, the guy across the aisle from Jackson also makes a call and starts pounding his phone to show it dead. Jackson picks up and snatches the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> 2. At some point, Jackson's scalp examples Lisa, and she, of course, gets knocked out ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Lisa Jackson catches write a note on the mirror in the (very large) toilet, and he fucks her around a bit. Miraculously, the only one who hears nothing is a 11-year-old girl, whose word is, of course, be discounted. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa Jackson permeated with a pen in his throat when the plane lands, stealing his cell phone and makes a mad dash for the exit, adapting down the aisle between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite knowing there is a passenger with a feather stuck in his throat, a flight attendant Lisa oblige, opening the door to the jet way. <br /> <br /> 5. Well, all those smart (if not very unlikely). But here's where it gets really silly. Lisa enters the terminal at Miami International Airport, and there is no cell phone signal (every major airport in the United States has a great cell phone reception). <br /> <br /> 6. It passes through an airport with Jackson in hot pursuit, and no security officers did not detain them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport while the train pulled away from the gate to the terminal, lost part of his voice from the pen in the throat, but it can still be somewhat understood. However, he did not bother to call him a man outside the house, Joe. (PS: There are no trains at the Miami airport, but they showed a look an awful lot like Orlando airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and drives away. Of course, at this time, when it comes to make a call, the cell phone says "low battery charge" and soon eliminated (if they stop using this silly plot device?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone is said "low battery," Lisa reached her assistant, just in time to rescue the director and his family from the guided missile launched by a fishing vessel to the room the window 40 th floor, who was the director moved. Of course, they expect that we have not noticed that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by the ocean, so that the rocket could probably, was launched on the first set, the same except for the need of all Lisa-Jackson story. What is the story here? Was directing the original room on the 38th floor of one of the few rooms in the hotel with lousy eyesight? Nevertheless, all out just before the missile hits. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa goes to the house of Joe to save his father, only to see the killer outside. Despite the fact that she is working on it (as he shoots her), crashing her jeep to the house, no one in the area not to notice, or bother to stop. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrived at the home of Joe and knocks him (we do not see how ... perhaps another head butt). He then explains to Lisa that he did not kill his father also because he wanted Dad to see Lisa die first (Give me a break. What is it? Saturday morning cartoons?). <br /> <br /> 12. For the rest of the film (about 20 minutes), Lisa Jackson chases around the house, and she is fighting it ingeniously. Of course, the real killer (that is, one may play Jason Statham) have killed Lisa (or for that matter anyone who is not trained killer) during the first 30 seconds. During the chase, Jackson crosses Joe, at least once, without bothering to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson dominated, and he's going to kill Lisa when (you guessed it) it is removed Joe. <br /> <br /> So, here's my suggestion ... say Wes Craven horror stick. Or maybe he should get together with Michael Bay (who directed the same stupid "Island") and to make "Red Island".
