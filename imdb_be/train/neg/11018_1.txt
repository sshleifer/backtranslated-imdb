I bought this video is pretty cheap ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked pretty cute. And it was good, but the film is rubbish. I can deal with the B-class, I sometimes enjoy a good B-wheel drive (ie. «Surf Nazis Must Die» is a classic example of how entertainment genre can be), but it was only a soft soft soft. Incredibly stupid scenes were broken too rarely good healthy cheap porn and entertainment sequences horror dream. This film has very little to offer.
