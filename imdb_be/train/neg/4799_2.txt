I myself am a big fan of low-budget horror film 80. This is not the worst, but still not spectacular. The storyline is decent, but draws too long. You through half of the film, before you even get to see any zombie action. Murder is not very creative and zombies are not very clever. I really think that this film would have been better if they came out with a zombie and just did it to some mafia movie. It is watchable, but I feel that this film is made to steal at least an hour of my life. I will give credit for the film, which is somewhat original. If you are really into B horror movies it's worth watching, but if it is not, do not worry. But you should not take my word for it.
