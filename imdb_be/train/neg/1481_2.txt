Perhaps they use their entire budget to pay porn star or what?!? <br /> <br /> The sound effects, background music and editing in general was so bad, you might think that some 12-year-old want-to-be film. <br /> <br /> Most of the action was good, considering the scenario ... "innocent virgin" very well play a role. <br /> <br /> mutants look really cool, and it actually could be really cool flick to the right hemisphere of the brain behind the wheel ... but, unfortunately, for all participants, it is not so. <br /> <br /> Turn Left was to do better than this film, and these guys Wait "does not even have any money !!! Good thing I did not rent a movie itself!
