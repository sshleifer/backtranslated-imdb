I appreciated this film as wretched (1). After watching the trailer, I thought that this film could be pretty cool. "Guaranteed to offend everyone ...!" Said trailer. Well ... it hurts me, because this movie really sucks. Hardly a comedy, I laughed for about two seconds, throughout the film. And that all gay in this movie? I'm not gay, and I have no problem with those who are, but what is the point to add as many gay scene in the so-called comedy, if the scene is absolutely not funny? I believe that the director is gay in denial, or something like that <br /> <br /> So my advice to you. And if you want to spend a lot of money, go rent a good comedy you've seen a million times, you will be better than watching the mother of all Lousy Comedy. It's really common crap.
