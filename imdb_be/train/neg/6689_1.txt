I can only assume that the other reviewers of this "film" are shareholders in a manufacturing company, since it was quite possibly the worst film I've seen in the last five years. With the first shot of laughter Rabbi uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that in this film the actors would kill to be regarded as "B-level." Both my wife and I were in a good mood before starting this film, and we're really looking waiting for a funny movie popcorn. We know that we are not rented Citizen Kane, and we do not expect to see the weirdest movie ever. However, after 40 minutes of transferring the most painful neshutochnye bit rubbish I have ever seen, we close it rather than spend another minute of our lives. <br /> <br /> If the "comedy" without laughing, terrible action, thin plot and annoying characters is your thing, then this movie is for you. Frankly, Troll 2 is better. - at least I laughed popcorn sex scene <br /> <br /> I can not justify a longer writing this review, because I had already spent almost an hour trying to find a joke,
