National Treasure is about as overrated and over-hyped as they come. Nicolas Cage is in no way believable action hero, and this movie is not "Indiana Jones." People who compare this film with Indian classical trilogy Jones seriously collapsed their rocker. <br /> <br /> I can not figure out how the film was shot for the target audience. Maybe pre-teen audience like it, but I found it to be absolutely ridiculous. I also can not imagine adults or young people to find it to be that big of a movie. Simply put: it's just OK at best, <br /> <br /> The national treasure of unimaginable and uninspired, borrowing what he's got on "The Da Vinci Code" .. I would recommend waiting to see what the film will be released in 2006 and passing this nonsense. <br /> <br /> In general, the idea of ​​being able to easily steal the Declaration of Independence, and to run on all Washington and Philadelphia with him (while never hurt her once), while the fight against "bad guys "and experiencing what must be" non-stop action "is absurd. I especially liked the scene with the declaration made in its pipe laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz through it without damaging it. Oh, brother! <br /> <br /> He reminded me of that episode «Brady Bunch», where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Except that Brady Bunch episode was much better than this entire film! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such a huge treasure that no one believes, there hides a secret ruin of the US is a country. Literally, there are thousands of undiscovered "priceless" items in this treasure. That's right !! Funny !! <br /> <br /> Even worse, where speed and accuracy Cage to find and finds out that is supposed to be "hard" keys to unlocking the mysteries of the ancient pre Posterous !!! .. Oh mankind! <br /> <br /> performance Cage, Voight and other actors in the "National Treasure" is a hard, wood, and flat as they come. However, if you're working with such a lousy dialogue, it is difficult to 100% the fault of the actor for it. <br /> <br /> The National Treasure movie OK to see once. I can not recommend it more, and certainly not to buy it over the strange scavenger hunt mess. <br /> <br /> rent it if you have to see it first .......
