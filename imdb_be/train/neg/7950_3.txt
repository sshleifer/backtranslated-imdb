Cafe Lumiere beautifully photographed invalidity. The man with the work of the director, I am well acquainted with the director, he allegedly pay tribute - Ozu Yasujiro. Although not even close to the greatness of Ozu, Hou not reported Ozu depth of emotions and focus on value in an enclosed space. One of the things he misses entirely the attention Ode to the nature - we do not even "presented" Howe on his main character (the perfect blank page). There is no middle or close shots of his people. One of the DVD extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us exactly what Howe does not -. A good look at their faces <br /> <br /> There was a big Spanish film Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "nothing happens." This would be a much better name for this ridiculous exercise. All through the film we gave a hint about the little-known Taiwanese composer some of whose works we hear the soundtrack. But the key, as with everything else, add to zero. Unless you trainspotter, this film has nothing to recommend it.
