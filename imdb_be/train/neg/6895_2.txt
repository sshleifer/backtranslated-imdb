Plot stony. Actions somewhere south of games Jr. High School. Cinematography is not bad, but it looks like it was cut with a machete. I could not decide whether it was intentional fake movie, or if followed by people actually thought they did a good film. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running in the "powerless" modern city, wearing quickly draw a 6 gun installations. It has more than its fair share of things «cutsey». Draw Good Guys pulling up the old farmhouse, and parking right in front of the Ford Mustang hitching post. Imagine a clerk at the hotel, watching the apparently Western (hemisphere), the film sports a Japanese audio track, but with English subtitles. It's all very strange, but it can be improved if the watch it while participating in the small peyote. This is a real curiosity with contemporary parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good-hearted dance hall girls, and twanging harp on the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell them your a DVD-player died.
