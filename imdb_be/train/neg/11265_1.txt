There have been some low moments when I was bewildered and depressed in my life. Sit through Rancid Aluminum was one of them. <br /> <br /> The warning signs were there. Many premiere (even the stars did not want to participate) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I sat through the film in the hope that I could catch up on some December <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film has not been elucidated. The story was idiotic. I cheered up at some point, when the lead film, seemed to have been shot, and then to my growing desperation, he showed that he really was not filmed my moisturizing joy. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the film hanged for the crime. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, mostly unintentional moments of humor. For example, a scene in which the protagonist, for some unknown reason, feels the need to urinate in the cabin toilet manually, while the said person in the next stall to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can not explain the anger I feel, so I have to conclude, therefore, <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum :. for sadists, useless people, and only regressives who want to torture yourself.
