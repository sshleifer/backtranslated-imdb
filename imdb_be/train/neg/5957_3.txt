Negligible and low brains (ha ha!) 80-horror, as it is in the top ten and thirteen, but it can be considered fun, when you look at it in the right state of mind. Special Effects sticky, acting brutal and the script seems to have a few basic items! The "brain" takes place in a quiet typical-American atmosphere of the city, where every teenager working in the same diner, and where cool baby in high school cleans the cherry bomb in the toilet. It is here that the TV guru named Dr. Blake and his favorite animal is the brain begin their quest to control the national mind. Under the brand name of "independent thinkers", a giant cheesy brain sends waves through the TV and makes innocent spectator to kill! How great is that? Now it's up to Meadowvale teen rebel in order to save the world! The funny story that he never explains where Dr. Blake and his terrible brain actually come from. There are obvious links with respect to alien life, but that's about it. Meh, who needs experience in a movie like this, really? There are not many, unfortunately, bloodshed and "evil" brain looks like an oversized sock-puppet. The only more or less interesting element for horror lovers takes a look at the cast and crew who made this film. Directed by Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson, the same people who made «Bloody Birthday» (guilty pleasure of mine) and "The Plague." Those are much better movies, and they wisely decided to leave the film industry. The most familiar face in the cast, of course, is a big David Gale, whose horror fans will adore forever for his role in the Re-Animator. A girl named Christina Kazakh provides bare-factor, and it is obviously a great talent ?? It has exactly 3 films in his repertoire which is her "masterpiece". In its debut, it was credited as "unwitting model" and "3 people i child", her character, called "one of the girls Jack." I wonder how she thinks about her actress career ??
