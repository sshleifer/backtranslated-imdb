Someone has to Ang Lee to apologize. In fact, many people do. And I'll start. I've never been interested in the Ang Lee Hulk movie because of the almost unanimous bad reviews. Even premium cable channels seemed to rarely show. In the end I decided to see him yesterday in the US network, and wow .... <br /> <br /> spoilers FOR HULK Ang Lee And Incredible Hulk <br /> <br /> It was a sad! I almost did not make it through the Ang Lee Hulk. Eric Bana was unclear, Nick Nolte was awful, Sam Elliott was bad (and it's not fun, it is usually cool character). In fact, I truly think that they chose Eric Bana, because he has an incredible face was easily simulated by computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk had vestibular sound like Bruce Banner in his non-evil country. If the Hulk fought mutant poodle, I was ready to give up the Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever. <br /> <br /> But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious film, was really exciting and - dare I say - quite convincingly - extended action scene that begins with Hulk flash with protective chamber in a military base, the struggle M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, and then F22 Raptor riding into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. It was one of the best action sequences ever made for the superhero movie. And I must say that CGI was pretty good. This does not mean that the Hulk was completely convincing. But it does not require much more than the suspension of disbelief is required than in many action movies without a superhero. And it's quite a feat. <br /> <br /> Of course, I have a very silly ending with his father Bruce Banner turns into a shape-shifting villain, but before long the sequence of actions to put any short of heroic Iron Man to shame, and on the whole, except for animated mutant dogs it really looks like CGI in Hulk tried to convince you that he was real and really interacts with its environment. It was, of course, better than I expected. <br /> <br /> Okay, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what ... it's too boring! It has only a few performances of the Hulk, and here's the thing - CGI in this film is terrible. Maybe Hulk in Ang Lee's version looked fake and sometimes cartoon in others - but it had its moments too strong. The Incredible Hulk species positively ridiculous. He had the tone of the skin and muscle tone, it does not even look like a living creature, just some computer-generated textures. It was really stupid. Lighting, environment and face the effects were not looking 5 years newer than the Ang Lee, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for this. We do live in an age where programmers can spoil the film just as carefully as you would any director, actor and filmmaker never could. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the writer and director of this film, did not seem to know almost nothing of the "failure" of Ang Lee. The same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is almost soulless. In general, so inexorably, incredibly one-dimensional, it seems, the fraudster than Hulk. Love interest unconvincing (I have to give credit Liv Tyler is more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, despite the fact that it's only a movie for a few minutes. Hulk really does not do anything in this film, of course, no more than Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was a little more fast paced, but since nothing really happened anyway, it is not necessary. Oh yeah, the villain every bit insincere, looking like the Hulk. He's actually a lot more interesting as a person than as a monster. <br /> <br /> This is how I can say finally Ang Lee's version was better, if I ever have the opportunity to see the version of Ang Lee again, I might be able to sit through it, to see good action sequences, or even try to estimate the Dialogue a little bit more (more than likely, I would have just suffered a good part). But it is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk, worth to see once, let alone twice. It is really at the bottom of the heap superhero movies. CGI cartoon is an insult to the audience - at least in the version of Ang Lee seems that they were trying to make it realistic (for the giant poodle, with the exception, of course) <br /> <br /> This is absolutely mind-. incredible as the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee Hulk, making almost exactly the same film. <br /> <br /> The merit of Edward Norton, he seems to be distancing itself from this film.
