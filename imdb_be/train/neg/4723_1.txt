First of all, sorry for my english. <br /> <br /> Each of the former Yugoslavia, which is not some extreme Serbian Radical agree with me. This film shows the Serbian side, and only the Serbian side. It was not presented many Serb crimes. Fortunately, everyone can see that this film was made by Serbs, so there is no neutrality. All the "" "" professionals who were interviewed are not professionals at all. Some guy just read a book written by some radical Serb, the other one a genocide denier etc.etc. <br /> <br /> Even the Slovenes blame movie.And whole war in Slovenia lasted for several days, and only because the Slovenes were lucky.There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA was unable to reach a trough in Slovenia Croatia (after the start of Croatia-Serbia war). Each Slovenia outraged by the charges in the film. <br /> <br /> Every smart Croats agree on one side: Independence was too early. Perhaps all of the major conflicts could be avoided. Still, noted WWII and some unrelated things really pathetic attempt to justify everything. Just imagine the Japanese throwing nuclear bombs in Seattle and Washington, as well as that was justified by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find any evidence of the YNA soldier strangled, and killed Serb civilians near Vukovar. But you can find a cassette with a reporter for the commission that his statement of Serbian civilians in the area of ​​Vukovar was a lie. All over the Internet. And the director forgot to mention all the bombardment of Vukovar by YNA (now Serbia and Montenegro side and 100% complete Serbs and Montenegrin) And let's not start on the Chetnik movement. In the beginning, it was merely a resistance movement. But the director had forgotten to mention the collaboration with the Nazis, including the Ustasha, ethnic cleansing, and fighting again Yugoslav partisans. There are thousands of other things, but it can be easily verified. There are many things that are administered in error in this film. Only a few of all the accusations are true. Each Croatian outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> I believe that I do not need to mention Srebrenica genocide denial, genocide, that has too much evidence. Imagine a film about the Holocaust denial. This film is the same. And according to this film, the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombed themselves. Every Bosnian Muslim angered by this film. <br /> <br /> Once the director forgot to mention a brief occupation of a small piece of Macedonian (FYROM) Serb lands. <br /> <br /> Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians, Macedonians and never entered the Serbian borders. If you are not Serbian, and you actually started to believe something of this movie, I know that the Serbs have some propaganda, Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are actually Serbs made up his story. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs would say that this movie "" bit "," extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> Serb radicals A very, very satisfied with this film (there is about 40% Serb who vote for radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. In this so-called documentary is very little truth, and my advice to anyone is: Inform yourself before watching this film. After that, you only laugh all the pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> See the real neutral documentary films about Yugoslavia's death.
