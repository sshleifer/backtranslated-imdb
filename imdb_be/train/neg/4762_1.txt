I saw this film is nothing about this before hand, not knowing. The site was terrible with large gaps of information no. The film is not a "battle of wits" feel to me. Actors just thrown Mouthful years of stupidity, sometimes making me gnash their teeth in pain as they buzzed and on. The plot was predictable for a stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end, except for (I'm not homophobic, but I was physically sick), even the end was predictable. And you might say, Detective Jude Law was in a suit, all of the fake accent terrible dentist, hair costume shop in person, everything points to this time masking. The entire film just felt that wasted time out of my life. This film had a kind of puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as dolls and home, like windows to watch the show, really boooring in my opinion.
