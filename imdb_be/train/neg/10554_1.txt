Avent-garde nightmare, a very low-budget "film" that has delusions of grandeur. It's hard to sit through. I get a message that child abuse is wrong. Wow great discovery. I had no idea that it was wrong to view it. Yes, this is sarcasm. Do not watch this "movie", if you are offended by nudity or male or female. Do not watch if you are a little dismissive. Do not watch if you care about the action. On second thoughts just do not see this period <br /> <br /> My rating :. D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: make a movie premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, movie footage, director's commentary, 2 version of the trailer, music video from The Azoic and classroom room video experiment
