"Documentary", and we use this term in a broad sense, is apparently concludes that Muslims are trying to forcibly take over the world. Then they say that any Muslim who does not admit that it knows anything about their faith or lie on your face! in addition, every person who is interviewed in the film found a market for their absurd take on actually selling Claptrap conservatives, who want to let others think for them. that the West needs to know this is nothing more than propaganda, aimed on mental midgets. If you w ukaetse for the actual documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that provides multiple points of view of qualified sources.
