The story of a man who has an unnatural feeling to the pig. It starts with the opening scene, which is a stunning example of absurd comedy. Formal Orchestra audience turns into insane, violent crowd was crazy chantings with his performers. Unfortunately, it is absurd, all the time without a common narrative in the end, without making it too off putting. Even those of age should be excluded. A mysterious dialogue Shakespeare, it seems easy to third grader. At the technical level is better than you might think with some good cinema next big Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest shortly be seen.
