When I saw that Mary-Louise Parker has been associated with this epic movie was, I was intrigued. Being a supporter of the book, I assumed that she would play Tony, or Roz Harris, but more than that, I was intrigued to see how they would turn the nail on the head-y, almost psychological (but not a psychological thriller) romance in the film which will be available for those who have not read the novel, and it would be at least slightly suited for those who had. The book is a comprehensive reflection of society, women and modern life, and I was curious to see how they have used 3 different narratives that lead to the disclosure of the plot in the film. The fact that they actually had a crime <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake and confuse the issue :. Why oxygen network is advertised as women, take an amazing book about how complex and beautiful and scared woman is and can be, and to change the main hero of the 3 women at some stupid ex-cop with no real reason to be involved in history? It seems that those who adapted needed an easy way with this guy right to ask Roz, Tony Harris, and how they knew, Zenia, and at the same time, they rushed through a large part of the book. At the same time, although they have stirred up the story and cut out everything that is great about the characters in it, except for making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with. In the film, these women are not people, they are heroes. <br /> <br /> The book Zenia makes fake her death, but the book mentions this to get this point of view, while the film waste 30-45 minutes that focus on this former police running and do nothing to use . They were trying to make this difficult book episode of Law & Order or CSI. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mary-Louise Parker played Zenia, who was so wrong. Zenia Catherine Zeta Jones, Angelina Joly, or perhaps even the type Scarlett Johnasson. She is a woman, a man can not love a woman that women are intrigued and threatened, but "to keep the enemies closer" kind of way. And as soon as she gets closer, she seems to be quite sincere and credible, despite your better judgment. She is the woman who, even if she loses, she will win: it is always still beautiful, still rich, and there are always more people who do not know his game <br /> <br /> In the film. , Zenia did not take the man Harris (blonde American Pluto project, which used Charis in the first place ...), but instead took the August and tried to become her legal guardian (and, apparently, returned to be her lover as a lesbian kiss linger in a cafe in sight). And Zenia killed chickens before leaving in August, but it does not make any sense, since all the build to it has been removed. It was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws, to satisfy those who read this book, but I think if I had not read the book, I would have spent the entire film confused when I worked stick to it all. <br /> <br /> Roz and her husband was dead before Zenia came to the picture (which was weird, because Zenia took over the business and family life of roses in the book, so Roz hated her so much), and she and Zenia conspired to kill husband for years and years RÃ³z ago. And the film, Tony and the West have been dating forever ... even at the party, where Zenia and West (in the book) the whole place painted black and they made Tony feel that it is quite with it (and evil, bitchy) a person who has always respected for all her intelligence and popular for it. character Tony was so wrong in this movie ... it seemed a bit crazy and inspirer of that political organization plotting down as opposed to kind of awkward, mildly hermit teacher that she was in the book. The film mainly involves clever women evil, evil beautiful women, strong women are evil, and women who teach yoga from their rockers. <br /> <br /> They are basically trying to do so, Zenia is not necessarily as bad as it was in the book, and then, in the end, the three women to convince the former police (which, of course, in the process of research, the answers Zenia and has to deal with it, which must end their movement Barbados or something funny that, of course, Zenia guarantees on) to hide ZENIA body (which they found an exclamation at the hotel, she stopped at, but the film suggests that one in three women, pushed her on the balcony, or they conspired to do it ...), and then also Zenia Neg did take all the money in the ROSE process. By the end of the movie I was only half paying attention between advertisements b / c it spiral still in space on what it can and should be. <br /> <br /> If you do not hesitate to split this film, then perhaps you would like because I read the book and seen the movie, and the movie I'm one ridiculously confusing. It was awful. I understand that to make a movie from this book is not an easy task, but if you are going to take on the task, you have to start with a definition of what the book is not needed, rather than to create a useless character to be our Alice in Wonderland, <br /> <br /> Is there really no fluffy books that could be oxygen make at least half decent TV films?
