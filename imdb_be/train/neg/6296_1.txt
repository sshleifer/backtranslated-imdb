This film looks interesting; I read the book a few years ago, and he told me that the feature should plot outline pretty tight. <br /> <br /> I started to watch it, and almost from the beginning it did not live up to expectations. In fact, I did not watch it all ... total nonsense - the bad characteristics, bad actions and instantly dislikeable characters. - that was the point of the film, I think <br /> <br /> Watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth, and set me on a downer on the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Do not mess with this feature.
