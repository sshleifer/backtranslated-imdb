Naturally, I did not look «GI Jane" with the selection. I was more or less forced to watch this movie all my ex-girlfriends home. <br /> <br /> GI Jane loses credibility immediately, trying to convince the viewer that this is potentially a real scenario, which is, of course not. The result of this is that the story becomes automatically associated restrictions, limiting the amount of humor (which is not there) or entertainment scene, and soon it becomes too serious. Thus, the film becomes extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> «GI Jane» fails when other militants success, mainly because movies like James Bond, Dirty Harry, and various other larger than life, but never preach otherwise. They escapism, and therefore interesting. «GI Jane» trying to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott, with a very clear without a storyline, unremarkable action, and the only reason I give it 2/10 instead of 1/10 for some technical work.
