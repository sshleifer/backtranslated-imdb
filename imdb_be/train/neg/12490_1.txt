I've got this film. I bought it for $ 3.99 in a fairly large retail video to make some "indie", "movie type of research, since I had just finished its own function and editing. Now, when I'm feeling down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and cut. A few minutes later, I feel great !!! <br /> <br /> I hate to talk down to another director, so I'm going to use constructive criticism. 1. Find a good actor. Take your time. It really helps. 2. when shooting video, scenes of light and dark on the computer later in the message. 3. Closeups better for video. 4. If an actor enters the scene, a little wait before <br /> <br /> have their say so that we know what is happening and who is talking. 5. Never show the back door, while we wait for someone to come open it. Damn well worth the $ 3,99 <br /> <br /> True Horror will receive feedback piece is here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit ... they are spreading.
