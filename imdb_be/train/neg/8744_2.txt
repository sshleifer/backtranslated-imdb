I kind of randomly ended up watching this film. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt like I was watching a film made for this group of students of film schools, which is not quite make the cut. He plays every Hollywood cliche you can imagine, all the while whipping us with "corporations are an absolute evil" message. Sneak this film does not know. As far as that goes, it is even possible to provide its own spoilers. <br /> <br /> In the story, it seems a fantasy world is a computer nerd fulfilled. The protagonist is an attractive teenager with a friend, but it is the programming genius and apparently the hacker (I think), among many other nerd fantasies come true elements that you should see yourself. <br /> <br /> In addition, I should have known that this would Mr. movie when I saw Ned Bell ... he tends to be a good fire. <br /> <br /> can not recommend this one, I'm afraid.
