Based on the novel Chabon, Pittsburgh Secrets of the young son of a notorious gangster, who spends his last summer teen wander with two friends. 1983, and the young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Completely against the life of his father, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually contrived with a painful attempt to create a beautiful hip indie cinema, the whole movie feels the director - whose previous efforts bouncer was funny when the direct sales - is desperately seeking indie credibility of the bridge together aspects of other indie films, but by sprinkling it with stars such as Mena Suvar, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like many star-laden premieres at Sundance this year, he felt that it was a studio-sponsored Secrets vanity project to help make indie filmmaker points trust - it is not in this respect, and as a film in its own right.
