I could not watch more than 14 minutes of this. This is a great combination of really bad acting and a very bad directing. Frames that are used disgusting, they broke through 180 degrees at all times. I have a headache try to see that the cargo "you know that." The dirt on the window, "The Mystery Machine", so you can see the light from the lighting in the windows ... annoying. What else ... it's so bad frame all the time it's just make you want to yell at the lady directing there. I'm just a director of short films, but I'm sure I would have been much better than the direction of the film .... the story is incredible, just a long French kiss scene in the beginning to tell you, it would be pretty awful, so quite a lot, try avoid this really bad movie any price, it will save you $ 5 or so for the rent, and that your life 1h30 hours you'll never go back ...
