On a distant planet psychopath saved from execution space monk. He produces several inmates and prison breaks in a spaceship. They dock at ridiculously huge spacecraft that orbit supernova. This massive ship inhabited by only three people, presumably because the film's budget does not apply to the hiring of many actors. Anyway, to cut short, three sweets end up in a game of cat-and-mouse game with the villains. <br /> <br /> A psychopath in the film is interesting, that it irritates. "Unpleasant", as a rule, is not a term one would use to describe a madman - upset, scary, dangerous, maybe, but not "annoying," but it is. Three people manning the giant ship seriously lame guarantee such important roles - the ship is almost the size of the city! Given that the film is set 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man-made ship could exist, not to mention the fact that it is used for such a relatively secular tasks. Despite the huge size of the spaceship, the team still badly prepared, tiny room and dining area consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs. But there are a lot of corridors. <br /> <br /> The film is quite well acted, and it works like averagey sci-fi thriller. But nothing special.
