Who in their right mind does not do anything as silly as this film? <br /> <br /> accidentally killing a guard ... the characters are so two-dimensional, that two years would have painted him turn ... and better ... <br /> <br /> red set of instruments of death? Please .... <br /> <br /> hypothermic weak thugs ... <br /> <br /> actor from hell ... <br /> <br /> Stylistically, the film shifts between teen comedy, thriller , voyeurism ... and a woman ... (mmm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Incredible, and it is an insult to any thinking person. Do not look to leave, it's worse than you can imagine ... <br /> <br /> And to top it all, she is trying to be hip to it too graphic in this violence ... <br /> <br /> Mrs. Montford: Shoot Â«Em Up was fun and funny, it's just pathetic and scary. Success next time. :-(
