High school (Keenan Wynn) with the losing basketball team unwittingly hires a coach who is not only to be a gorgeous blonde (Cathy Lee Crosby), but a catalyst for these new ways of winning. Are you really surprised? Along the way, the novel grows between the coach and the team's star player Jack (Michael Biehn). The police never informed. <br /> <br /> Packaged along with other Crown International Pictures as a Grindhouse film this movie really no service. It can be easily edited in the television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as coach Randy Rawlings especially in its outdoor outfits, but I expected more than just titillation of the R-rated movie. Subplot involving blunt center that mesmerized his teammates, thinking that he was a former NBA player Sidney Wicks is the actual cause of the new team success, not training Kathie Lee. Too much is not enough to tease and nothing makes this a great disappointment.
