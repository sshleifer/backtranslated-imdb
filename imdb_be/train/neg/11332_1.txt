As big as the Texas prairie, and just boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills, and Dennis Hopper can not swim this overbloated boats. Taylor looks really bad - the wrong clothes, wrong hair, make-up and a wrong - a unique achievement in his illustrious career. Hopper gives only believable performance, and Dean in the climactic scene shows outstanding talent as something that we usually do not remember him - a comic actor. Rock Hudson his usual prototype of Barbie dolls Ken, and makes you wonder how, say, Redford could do with a male role. There is no appreciable portion that provides any voltage up to the final twenty minutes, only stylization landmarks that have little relationship to each other. except Hopper, no character development, just a collection of cardboard expressions that are from time to time for no apparent reason as random targets at a shooting range. To its credit, the film makes the fight against racism and sexism at the time when they were taboo, and it is of a size that makes it an excellent choice for getting rid of the uninvited guests at home. Those with a DVD version may deprive yourself of some of the tedious, starting with the second disc. You will not miss anything interesting.
