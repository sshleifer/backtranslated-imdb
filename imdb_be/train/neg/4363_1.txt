It is difficult to find any positive results in this movie. It seems as though the manufacturer need to make a buck without much effort and so we were treated to a full display of the Galaxy, which is Lamest excuse for the film in history. The police girl looked very sexy in their little uniforms. Arrows more action two policemen, and much less of the galaxy would be a way. Of course, that would add to the budget, so they decided to fill the space with this pathetic restart. Ms. Albright makes a great looking sexy and her acting first rate. Ms Stabs I heard, but not seen on screen before looked very desirable, too, but it seems to lack basic acting talent. Furthermore Ms Albright is real garbage.
