It's really rather strange movie ... First, we have the former US-gymnast is trying to turn the actor (or something), and it seems to be the only role he ever had (I know one way or anyway) - and for good reason. While he does pull off the role well enough to save some interest, it is fairly soft and flat performance. Secondly, we have the worst sound effects ever used in the movie !!! I'm not kidding. This alone makes the movie very funny, but this irritating manner. hehe And third, while we have, in general, the current supporting cast worthy, is not really so bad story and some nice visuals (including the required hot chick!); dialogue, battle scenes involving gymnastics (fun!), and overall performance of the plot is weak. This film was a little bit better as a network television movie (too bad Fox was not around in 1985). This is one of those movies that are just bad, but you can not resist watching and even enjoy it as soon as you get used to it, especially now that he has found the perfect eternal home on late night TV and cable.
