This game has (DIS) the distinction of being the first game that I stopped playing right in the middle and felt like breaking into pieces and then burning. Congratulations. The first and last Tomb Raider I ever play, I assure you, <br /> <br /> The plot :. Just typing the word made me laugh. There is not one. Nor has the nature of development. We finally have a girl heroine who can take care of himself, who is not * squeals * Mary Sue, but unfortunately, she dresses like a whore, and her breasts are huge. They had to draw the gamer sexist boy you see. In any case, all it does is go to the tomb after tomb of shooting things as it goes along. Why is she doing this, I have no idea. I had subtitles and tanker as loud as I could, and I still do not understand a damn thing. Development (or lack there of) for her, her two friends and villains * * were laughable. There will also be the levels that you have to go through to do it, it does not give you any hint of what you should do next, and you'll literally be in the most boring as hell tombs for hours, trying to figure out what the hell, you have to do. There is one course (of two), in particular, with her on the motorcycle (Believe me, this is not fun), you'll be within ATLEASE clock with NO save point in sight. This means that you are hit by another motorist, and the guys in vans, shooting at you or you hit a tree you start an hour long journey OVER <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck :. You know, allows you to make the level of a very long, has basically no storage facility, there is no history, no development of character, do not provide the diversity in the game, there is a big part of the music on the long levels bleeding ear, and do not give any hints at all to the player, so that they can stay even longer in place, instead of having to get to a nonexistent conspiracy <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: .. Those ideas sound like a knock down <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs character development, plot, or unboring gameplay <br /> <br /> Todd :. I'm sorry, sir, but these ideas seem like they are really p * ss player expelled <br /> <br. /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Shut Todd. You're fired <br /> <br /> The game-play :. All that it does is shoot. Of course, she can flip during shooting, jump while shooting, or stroke while again SHOOTING.But flipping, jumping and legs does not erase the fact that all she ultimately makes this shooting. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sad Music: intro music is gorgeous. I like to listen. The game music is coming from a moderate to a desire to cut your ears <br /> <br /> The video series :. Given that this game was made in 2006, I expected visual blow me away.Well I was blown up, but certainly not in a good way <br /> <br /> Bottom-line :. This game is a graph, however, is not a disorder of character with barely dressed unmarysuish (thankfully) young women in lead, which passes through the sad tombs for some sad reason (as it may be, I can not tell) with a sad shooting game. STAY AWAY FROM THIS B.S. !!!!!!!! It gets two stars for being a woman who is not a damsel in distress (No matter how half-naked it may be) and the beautiful music.
