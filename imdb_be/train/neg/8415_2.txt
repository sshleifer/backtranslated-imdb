It was more than the Ten Commandments, all the Lord of the Rings and Matrix Trilogy, together. My Oh My, how horrible. This is the single biggest excessive hype in 2006 There is a moment of sun, not on the script and templates. Musicals film can be made excellent and bring real excitement to the viewer. Dreamgirls takes the route of the Chinese water torture in the form of infinite music installation, bad actions, and poor selection guideline (seriously, Mr. Condon, you had to do the old count Billboard frame? It's at # 58! No, wait, watch it charts of growth and Billboard's passing notice to show you again .... and again .... and again)
