Susan Seidelman, seems to have had a decent career several leading credit expressions under her belt. Of course, I am happy that she jumped back from the film, which seems to have its fans. I'm not one of them. <br /> <br /> I've seen better acting in high school plays, what I chatter. The plot is the same as it involved young Susan Berman, ambitious to make it in the music world and is willing to do whatever it takes to get there. She even rejects the sincere courtship of a young artist who lives with his van at the River East plays Brad Rijn. <br /> <br /> The young Mr. Rizhn makes the worst performance in the film, in fact, one of the worst acting job I've seen in a long time. It is not surprising that he has not gone anywhere. HN <br /> <br /> I will say that Seidelman eye for the camera is a good place to capture the familiar East Village, where the film was largely shot. But her work with her live performers, does not correspond. I'm not sure that it was so much material to work with. <br /> <br /> Look fast and you will see a very young Christopher note before the rule of law, and Sex and the City as a street hustler. <, Br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can sit through it for the soundtrack. I'll stick with Bing Crosby.
