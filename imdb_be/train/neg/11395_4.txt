Not entirely new storyline, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. The young man (John Cusack) and a drop dead gorgeous woman (Kate Beckinsale) meet by chance and keep wondering if they were meant for each other. While both promised each ... oddly enough, they still believe that their associate is in there somewhere. Juicy bit in some places, but viva and love. Being a romantic, I almost have to be chained. My favorite scene where Cusack is on the ground and the snow begins to fall. The finale is almost too sweet, but the most worthy. This is not one of the deeper role Cusack, but who in the hell can not be punished Beckinsale. Characteristic support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the role of the worst I've ever seen him. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is peculiar and funny. Watch it with a soul mate.
