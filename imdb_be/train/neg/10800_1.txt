What is the point of this movie? What is the plot? I do not know. Shaq can not act, people do not know how to direct and I Kazaam! Jean, who knocks? Come on. Eminem Linkin Park or maybe be in a film like this. I remember I was watching it just to kill time. It does not really interest me. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this movie ???" The whole story seemed too silly. This does not make any sense. I believe that the unrealized moral of this film is that you can find anything in the ghetto, and anything can happen. I can not comment much more, because this movie is so horrible, that there is nothing worth commenting on. I "want" this film is gone.
