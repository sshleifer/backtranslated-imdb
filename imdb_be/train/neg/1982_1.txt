Who? What? Where? When? Why? The acting was terrible. Very robotic, rehearsed. I saw all the actors in this film in the best roles. The script was very elementary. By the end of the film, the plot has been linked. And Jeane Claude Lamarre must be connected, too. So he never tries to write / direct another film.
