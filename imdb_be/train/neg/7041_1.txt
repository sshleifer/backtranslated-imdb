What else can you say about this movie, except that it is clear awful.Tina Louise and Adam West is a reason to see it, but it is true, but their talents are wasted in this junk.I think they used a double in some of the scenes of Adam, for example, when it works, because you can not see it face.If Adam was embarrassed that a zombie nightmare, just think what it must have felt about being in this ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but still, the classic Zombie Nightmare (check Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of the first and the last) compared with this.The gang is very annoying and more action of some of actors.A plagiarism The Wild One with Marlon Brando in the lead role, with course.Tina looks amazing though.I hope her and Adam received a good salary !! Miss!
