Although I have heard that this film was a bit dry, I look at all that Scott Bakula in. At the beginning of this film, I had high hopes for the classic cheese but nice Scott gets-girl who ends up to 20 minutes before the end it would be fine. plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very smart. I kept my fingers crossed that it will work, and all this will be somehow a terrible misunderstanding, until when the titles, and I realized that I'm not going to be happy and satisfied end. Unfortunately, I was sorry that I was watching him, and hastily putting on a quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great Scott!
