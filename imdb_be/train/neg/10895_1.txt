I've seen a lot of bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a crappy horror movie for what it is. But it really does harm new extremes. <br /> <br /> This is a soft, subject to the fact that it never actually happens anywhere and take your time over it. There are no shocks, no terror, no suspense, just the guys load rub himself for half an hour, and then a quick finish. <br /> <br /> A bad mold on the horror genre, avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
