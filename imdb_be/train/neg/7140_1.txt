You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst films ever need to include one of the most beautiful cars. Why do cars have to be not only a victim of the violation, but the only real actors and performers in it. After all, in the world you are Porsche, Lamborghini or anyone could allow these people to get in touch with your car and ruin your reputation, for which you give millions.Stop Short edge cars and make money on their chests. It's painful for those who love cars. It's painful for those who love cinema. <br /> <br /> I want my money back !!!
