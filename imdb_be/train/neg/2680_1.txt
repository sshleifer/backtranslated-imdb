Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I would never want to see. I do not like the movie, when some Aussie man drug smuggling in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale drug smuggling. I would not go in this country, regardless of the fact that after I saw this movie. In fact, this movie stinks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is a country that I have to endure. I would also like to adhere to the United States instead. Once I saw some of the film in the theater, including false accusations of drug smuggling, I left the theater and had my money back because I can not stand this film. If you are going to Thailand to meet someone there who could be drug smuggler, forget about it!
