SNL is quite funny, but people who say that it is like watching a short skits on SNL bit dumb character. It's nothing like the SNL, it's just a stupid piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder, but fails. Although Jon Heder funny only in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries hard, and people think he's funny. <br /> <br /> Just funny people in the film are Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was decently funny Andy was part of the pool. <br /> <br /> They could have made a "quiet place" a lot better if they did not provide the stage 3 freaking minutes. <, Br /> <br /> part where he pronunciation he HLB more retarded. They are trying to go for too long, and half the time it looks like Andy laughs with him when he acts ... it is a terrible actor and does not deserve to be in the film. <br /> <br /> This film is a joke, and for ordinary people who are prone to the brain of 10-year-old level of comedy. That is about half of the United States.
