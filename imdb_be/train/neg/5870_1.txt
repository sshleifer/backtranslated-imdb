I do not like this movie at all! First of all, I do not know why, but it says here that the game Poesy is excellent, in my opinion, this is absolutely wrong! It is not like Natasha: another view, another character ... What's worse, she is very inexperienced actress, and that's why she was not able to play this role! It is completely disfigured character! It was very disgusting to watch how she plays! In my opinion, it would be much better to give the role of the Russian actress, because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul of the Russian people. Unfortunately, Kutuzov was like a drunken man, who has not shaved 2 weeks and lost the battle in which he lost his eye ... (Thank The God, in this film there are already some of the actors, whose game was awesome! I think Alesya that Bonnie coped with its task very well! I was pleasantly surprised! He's one of the few people who have read the book, which is very important for the game. also, I liked the play of our Russian actors, it was really cool to watch them) ) the only thing that I liked about this job was a very beautiful view and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand the real meaning, the purpose for which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps understand the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
