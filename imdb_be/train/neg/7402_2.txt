This is a typical example of a technically qualified director of video clips / videos, trying to make his first full-length feature film. On one side of the image, camera, lighting, CGI, and even the sound polished and has a really "expensive" look. Even the actors show a certain amount of potential -. Bread at the point where even the best action can not hide a bad story <br /> <br /> In this case it is not a bad story, but hardly a plot at all <. br /> <br /> Thus, 50% of the dialogue consists of "what the hell was that?", "What was that?" and "What the hell was that?". In none of the cases which or characters or the audience granted at the slightest hint of an answer, though. In most other dialogs one gets the impression that there has never been any form of a book of dialogue and the actors had to improvise freely on a site that was not ever explained them. <br /> <br /> The only reason why performance Skye Bennett can be so good that its character as an autistic and girls are not allowed to give her this terrible tragic line of dialogue other actors had to deal with. So, she was able to just show her acting talent which other actors could not even come close to. I mean, there's not a single actor in the world which could make for a dialogue as: <br /> <br /> Ben: whether it is real, but Emily: Stop Bains. mass psychosis, but John: Somebody has to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not from you and not from someone else. Emily: Not from you. Ben: No <br /> <br /> Got me shiver. But do not fear, a terrible attempt. In some moments I was embarrassed for the actors to add this to their lives. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for their excellent technical work.
