I've only seen the movie once, and that was enough for me. The film has very little, if any land and it seems there is nothing but continuous psycho-sadistic scenes of violence and very little else. I would like to see this movie because it starred Zoe trills second "Night of the Demons"; and I would like to see her play someone normal. Unfortunately, the script Tobe Hooper just begins and goes nowhere, like Robert Englund dominates the film and chews the scenery and the plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from the movie!
