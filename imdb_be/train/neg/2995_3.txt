Only in very rare cases does the episode of the second file, does not generate any excitement or contains personal episode that just really sad for watch.A detective and his former partner and dies in unexplained death circumstances.The associated with the presence of a little girl, I was there when death took place.Mulder developed the theory that the police killed his colleagues back reincarnated as a little girl and for requiring revenge.Now bizarre bit.The little girl is no connection and it seems just a random person, Sooner as reincarnation.I I think it was a bit lazy writing of authors and this episode is considered one of the worst in the history of the X-Files!
