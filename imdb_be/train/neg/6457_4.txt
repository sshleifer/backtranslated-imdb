I believe that I've seen worse movies, but it could have been me becuz so exhausted by how standard these bad horror movies. Killer monster thing is really very bad, basically her boyfriend in some green body suit. There are much worse, acting as B movies go, but do not think for a second it was something stellar, hell no. It actually has a plot with a substance, but still pretty silly. Basically it's just a bad low-budget horror film. But at least it is not as bad as titanium that movie sucks balls, this one is just crap. Blood looks really fake in this movie. Here's one complaint I have about all the horrors of a new millinium, low-grade gusset looks ridiculous. Good shocking death scene with a really fake blood so stupid. At least, there was a good shower scene
