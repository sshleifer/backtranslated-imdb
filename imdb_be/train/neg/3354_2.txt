It is my opinion that if you want to re-make a very good movie, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view. Now the 1963 Robert Wise speaking remarkable novel by Shirley Jackson's "The Ghosts Hill HouseÂ» is worth the price of admission, even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and re-manufactured. I kept nodding and asking why? The current wooden, history unrecognizable, and the whole point, it seems, to replace the original thin horror with so many computers can generate special effects. I heard that this update was bad; but I could not believe it was that bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. After watching this and told my wife how awful it was, she said; "Well, they got their money!" She's right, do not let them get your. If there is no profit in making repeated the lousy grades, maybe they'll stop doing them or go to a higher standard, do not insult your audience
