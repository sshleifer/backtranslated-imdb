I just finished watching the pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this film, even though the FX is very good, better than I expected, was not a good film. I really can not say that I liked this movie at all. Of course, it is effective in its own way, to be shocking, realistic, twisted 43 minutes of torture, but I found it to be very sad (and not far off, as I had expected). And I discovered that the cats were very annoying when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time that it destroyed more (and I'm sure there are some people who would agree with me on that). Now I saw the pig 1,2,3,5 and best friend of those, in my opinion, is the guinea pig 2 - Flowers of flesh and blood. I will not say much about Devils experiment, but the Great FX, origin, acting on a girl who annoy fu ** ING executioners, overall I give it 4 stars on account of FX because they are awesome.
