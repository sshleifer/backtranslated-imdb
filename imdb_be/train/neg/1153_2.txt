Disappointing and irritable. Writer has no real understanding of human nature, but instead of strings together clich√©s in a disjointed manner. The character has not been studied in depth. These puppet flopped in the plot, he openly recognized as an essential element of drama, it's a mother with her daughter's lover. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid gives excellent performance in spite of the fact, considering some specific situations and lines such standing passively to her angry daughter slug into her eyes. Scenario reflects Darren (Daniel Craig), Dr. Jekyll / Mr Hyde without any hints as to why, except that he sniffs cocaine in front of the big stage. <br /> <br /> A mature writer could have done much more with this theme.
