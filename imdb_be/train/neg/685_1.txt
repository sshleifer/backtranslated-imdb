My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the film must be at least worth a look. We had no right. In fact, we abandoned it for 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford Young and tone are British, but to speak with an American accent was, for it is impossible to pass me - hard to believe that this is England, where no one speaks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and repeat the previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for each other without any reason ludicrous. There's no reason to care about any of the characters, and that's why we threw in the towel midway. I found it hard to believe that the Hawk is directed, as none of the actors did not speak with the trademark Hawksian delivery rat-a-tat. So save your time and skip this one.
