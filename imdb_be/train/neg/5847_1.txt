I really like the quality of crapness, and this ranks up there with some of the best. DH is out of this world, or at least prior to the date of our world, and obsession with a 6-foot guy in a suit chasing rats after people ridiculously bad. I really enjoyed some of it, but acting is so fucking awful, and even have a nude scene does not really have any BAP in it. just a waste of time, if ever I saw one. I do not know, who has spent more time I watch it, or poor Sapa, who got dragged into doing it in the faint hope that it will start an acting career. I can assure you, it is a habit. However, on a lighter note, I was able to successfully make the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon in the film, so I think it was almost worth the 91 minutes to watch it.
