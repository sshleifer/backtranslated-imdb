<br /> <br /> One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the leading role to be a funny movie. This is not the case. I laughed once throughout the film, and it was not even during the last comedy scene (which could also be expected to be funny). This is one you can see, when it comes to television, not to spend more money to rent it.
