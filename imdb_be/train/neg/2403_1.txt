Bam !!! I got this movie, because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed that she was in two short scenes towards the end. In addition, I was basically hitting the button to fast forward all the time. A teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his dad and gets bitten by a wolf and becomes a werewolf when there's a full moon. He kills his father and friends. Nearly 30 years in the past, but he does not age a bit, and imputes to the high school. There he meets a shy teacher, whom he ends up biting, and then has a child with her. This movie sucked, and I do not recommend to anyone. Read War and Peace instead. Only Ms. Hartman did a great job. Check the very young Bob Saget in it !!
