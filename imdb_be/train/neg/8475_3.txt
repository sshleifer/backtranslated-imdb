(Note: I thought I was the only one to write what I did below, but I see that others here disagree, I think it was pretty obvious - it was overdoing it a bit device-cat Anyway, here I wrote .. :) <br /> <br /> owners left on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cat (Sylvester) all alone and locked the house. This does not mean that there is milk, but the cat to his relief, not to find a bunch of canned tuna. However, to his horror, he could not find the knife. <br /> <br /> It turns out that a little mouse in the house has a cat ... and accessories to him. This vile rodent that keeps teasing Sylvester with a newcomer, and then pulls it away at the last second. Sylvester is trying its best to open a can of tuna, but can not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a moving story, and why they are doing sadistic mouse "good guy" me. This is how some of the cartoon Tom and Jerry, where poor Tom always gets the worst, although mouse begins the conflict many times!
