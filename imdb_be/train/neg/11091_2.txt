Denzel is the only thing that is right in this film. <br /> <br /> Maybe sometime in the early stages it was the best film. Someone decided to cut some of the actions and plot points in the beginning of the film, giving much of the story line about the first 5 minutes. This destroys all that built in pace and rhythm of the film may have been in the past. <br /> <br /> So, first it confuses you, and then it puts you. Dramatization pushes for a suspension could believe. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a huge sense of injustice and anger that films like this are potentially unable to instill the audience. Of course, it is that so if you're looking for ... Knock yourself out.
