I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and saw only a few of them (and none of the "Halloween" with ", or Friday the thirteenth" a) - but I can appreciate the horror scary movie is not due to the gore. And I'm sure it's no big deal. <br /> <br /> What's so scary about a little plastic skull that pops up all over the world? In all its manifestations has long set shots, so there is no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that a skull that scary anyway, but ...) <br /> <br /> As for the plot of the third cousin of Claus von Bülow (John Hudson), who marries Donna reed-like look-alike ( Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever), who begins to see a mysterious skull and hearing the cries of peacocks group at the mansion of her husband. Did I mention that her husband had lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning? Oooo !!!! I wonder who did it !!!! <br /> <br /> It's the same old story about a rich boy trying to kill and / or manage their wife crazy. If you want to see well-done version of this material, try a "reversal of fortune". And by the way, Jeremy Irons hundred times more talented than John Hudson <br /> <br /> MSTing was OK, but nothing special. paired with «Gumby» short, however, it makes for good viewing <br /> <br /> The two stars in the "Screaming Skull". . Eight stars of MST3K version <br /> <br /> And now, to paraphrase myself, Mr. von Bülow: "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
