The final pairing of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald in the main scenario of a full misfire.The weak and was granted badly.The film simply does not have life in it.Eddy and MacDonald would have been better simply to make the concert footage for their final pairing.There nothing wrong with them singing, it's just that everything else is not digested in the turkey.
