I saw this movie when I was very little. This is definitely one of the strangest films I have ever seen. Now, as a rule, I like weird movies, but it was just a little too much. <br /> <br /> There's not much plot to the film. Anyway, it starts as Toy Story, where toys come to life and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to save his new friend, Babette. From there, madness is worth it. There's also a greedy that Looneys, sea monster named Gazooks, and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes, all of which just made the film more surprising. In addition, I can not help but feel that Babette's annoying and a bit too whiny. It certainly has not helped the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, despite the fact that I do not like this film, there were a few nice details. I liked the song camel. Despite the fact that it's a song about how lonely it was a friendly disposition towards him. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most Looneys were just plain nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting, and perhaps the most ridiculous. King Koo Koo was just a little Dirtbag, that made Dr. Evil looks like a serious villain. In addition, there was a song Raggedy Andy's toys are no girls. This is certainly a good song for little boys who like to act tough. But, to be honest, even those things do not make the movie better. (But remember that this is only my point of view.) <br /> <br /> While I personally would not recommend this movie, even I have to admit that it has its magical moments. See if you are interested, but only if you're in the mood for something "really" out of the ordinary.
