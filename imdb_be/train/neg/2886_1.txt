Fight, terrible, terrible, do not waste money on rent this film. It's like a low-budget Canadian film for TV. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen, and there were many others out there. This film is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD-player or video recorder. :.? ... ~ (You can write ten lines of action was horrible it was absolutely no flow, I saw a made for TV movie on the killer side and it was much better (than this) I'm not sure what they're going for in the production of this film, but if it was to teach us or tell a story about the killer BTK they missed by a mile. this was more than a commercial for animal rights.
