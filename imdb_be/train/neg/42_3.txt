Of the three names of Jess Franco, to find their way to the DPP Official Video Nasty List (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and women behind bars), it is perhaps the least worthy of fame, being terribly boring jalopy jungle comes alive only very slightly slightly inept gusset , gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous blonde film star Ursula Bachfellner play Laura Crawford, who steals a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by savage tribe, who worship the devil the "god" who is hiding in the jungle (big, naked, bulging eyes family who likes to eat the hearts of women victims of conjugal). <br /> <br /> which operates agent Lori deliver a $ 6 million ransom, the brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cleaver) and its pilot Vietnam vet friend journey to the island, but faced with the problem, when the bad guys are trying to double cross. During the confusion, ENT runs off into the jungle, but runs right into the hands of the natives of the island, offering it to their god. <br /> <br /> Franco sent in his usual style torpid and loads it to the ridiculous effort with his usual nightmare trademark: crap blood, muddy cinematography, fast zooms, many crotch shots out of focus imagery, terrible sound effects and clumsy editing. The result is an urgent mess that the real struggle to sit through from beginning to end (it took me a couple of sessions to finish the job), and even the kind of juicy Buchfellner in all its natural glory is not enough to make me return to this film in a hurry.
