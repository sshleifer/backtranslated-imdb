good handwriting was very sloppy, direction was sloppier, and editing has become even worse (at least I hope it was editing). The action was not bad, but it was not as good as. almost none of the characters are not likeable. at least 45 minutes of film time was spent, and the second hour or so, was not used anywhere near its full potential. it was a great idea, but still a good idea to go to waste. this could result in 3 different locations, but he just kept going on to the main predictable Hollywood ending. and that was not predictable was done so badly that it does not matter. the ending is not worth watching at all. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. the film looked too rushed. the film just was not really worth seeing, and had I paid for it I would have been very reasonable. maybe I was more disappointed because I was expecting a really good movie and got bad. the film was not all horrifibly bad, but I would not recommend it. I gave it a 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea so much, and I did, as a single character (Justin, I think super smart). and he also had some very cheap ways to cover the plot holes. it was like trying to cover the volcano with a cheap tape, it was not so. In any case, if you can, wait for 1:50 $ theater or video if you do not like almost every movie you see, I think you'll like it.
