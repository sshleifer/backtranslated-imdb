I mistakenly kept himself awake late last night watching this thing. About the only thing I could say good about this horrible movie that it can be used in film schools, to show how to do the film. No proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure that they were symbols. Settings were sentimental and pointless, and excessive use of split screens have been spent, as sometimes they are not even able to synchronize with alternative arrows. If I could give this rating a zero or minus, I would. Unfortunately, it is not even worth the time, a few laughs. <br /> <br /> It's just a sad example of wasted money by Hollywood, and now I'm wasting my time even thinking about it.
