No, I've never seen any of the series "Santa to Slasher Slasher ', that is,« Silent Night, Deadly Night »the original" Black Christmas "or the" Christmas Evil. I heard all about your reputation, or, Mads (Mothers Against mad Santa's.) I thought that rent one, as I have heard, that pops up as a reference to «Fat Guys at the movies" segment. <, br /> <br /> Mothers should be against it, but not for ooooohhhh "killer" Santa but the fact that this film was just crap. boring, long ?? even just 92 minutes a shit. <br /> <br /> the little boy sees Santa to come down the chimney in 1947, to deliver a arunki, there are some sweets and miraculously pops up the chimney. The boy goes to bed, but returned to the reception to watch Mom and Sant (sort of) get it. Apparently, this is messed up, that the child until the end of his life, though the scene was the same in pairs as if dad got Ralphie in "Leg Lamp" in "a Christmas Carol." he was sooo broken, he went up to the attic and well cut my hand. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! Now, it's 1980 and messed up boy working in a toy factory. We get him to be breathing a little repair, but it creeps up both children and parents. Who's naughty, who is good, blah blah. He takes a good two-thirds of the film, to make him finally snap ?? as if it were no signs from frame one. NO MOVIE should not take much time. <br /> <br /> I admit that this film had its tension building, but only because I kept waiting for him to do something, anything to anyone. When he finally does, good, punish the "who's naughty," is as graphic as «Garbage Pail Kid cards". And I did not mention the WTF ending. I mean, it's a metaphor, but in reality, it is as strange as the rest of the film. (Take a brother who upset his brother killed, and his decision is ?? well, murder). Do not open this mess, even at Christmas, or evil. Again, I have not seen other "Santa shredders," but this one sucked bad. He created the intrigue due to the nature of the film and never put a decent gift.
