wow, The Naked Brothers Band. I have to say. I believe I can say that this show is just crap. Number one: they do not have talent, they probably can not even play an instrument. Room 2: on the commercial, he said that they were known, but no one has even heard of them until there shitty show came on. Look, I do not hate it so bad, I would have given it as a 4 out of 10, but what annoys me, as everyone says, that they have so much talent and so deep and Nat wrote profound texts. Deep my ass! he speaks of hardcore fighters with inner feelings. wow, I could read what is written on the walls of the bathroom, and it would be deeper than that. And they do not get known by themselves, their parents are well-known celebrities and want their children were too, so they made up a bad show. I have a feeling that it will be canceled in the near future.
