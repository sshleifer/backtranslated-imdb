For many months I have heard about this little film, and now I see him. I think it's cute, cute as many fledgling filmmakers make films where they combine the creative ideas of others to make their own one-joke premise of the film. Troops, Swingblade, any one of a million Blair Witch parody come to mind. If all of these directors want it toe-to-door in Hollywood, they are doing the right thing, and they need to keep it, because combining the story describes how Hollywood makes movies. How many times have you heard the phrase, "This is a home for animals meets Back to the Future"; "This Wall Street meets Dead Poets Society"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films is original and boldest sun safely and predictably.
