All the X-Men movies were great. And I mean all of them, including long hated X-Men 3. They were solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best in my opinion), and a good story arch. <br /> <br /> I'm excited when I heard that the film was in production, and my expectations were becoming more and more, until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best film Fountain, although you will not hear about this movie, when they talk about the actor), and his actions are not that screw up the film. <br /> <br /> entire film is faced with a large number of significant characters that do not add anything to the story (as Blob and Gambit), which had been thrown there to supporters believe that the filmmakers had to read the original comics. <br /> <br /> I am a supporter XMen, I have read many, many of their stories, and this film did not respect any of them. Nobody. Even without continuity. He does not respect the Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Frost, the motivations for the Wolverines are stupid and have seen in millions of movies :. Revenge for the death of a loved one <br /> <br /> A. What I was expecting that the whole damn movie was a moment Berseker like for Wolverine to the one he has in X2 at school when Stryker people come and only he empties enemy forces, but hey, this is Fox, it's a family film and you will not see the explicit violence of the most brutal and heinous Marvel hero. <br /> <br /> In addition, I had a feeling of constant deja vu with this film, because the origin of Wolverine in X2 already explained, we already know how it got so adamant skeleton kind of does not make sense to make a film about we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that Wolverine is one of the few characters that do not need a solid back story because the secret nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker got his scars?
