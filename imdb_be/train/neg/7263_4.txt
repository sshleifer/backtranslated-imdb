This star-studded British / Spanish co-production looks great, you can see it. I have three versions, two VHS, a DVD, and they are all very reduced so much that it looks as if the building talking to each other. Few films are suffering badly from the pan and scan, as this, as director Robert Parrish, seems to have been so involved in the process of wide that it takes care of the screen to use both at once, ignoring the middle. Another user notices that we see the whole Church resident killed in the beginning; none of the copies I have. There are some drastic cuts rifle shooting peasants, a Mexican officer shot, Shaw and Landau celebrating, that's all. We will never know why the show became a priest (if he really is), we will never know what is going on with Don Carlos (Savalas), although I suspect that he was called home to play in a Kojak, since his departure it seems arbitrary. And there is a strange sequence of flashbacks, where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) dance around in a bowler hat and a bad suit in a big old English music hall tradition before 1960 hits BATTLE New Orleans, not sung Johnny Horton here, but with some lyrics I'd never heard before . On the positive side, location great, great old ruined castle with stairs Escher style to nowhere, some interesting scenery-chewing Robert Shaw, and good performances Stevens, Landau, and Lettieri Savalas Savalas like. I do not like this film, but I have not really seen. I'll look for a widescreen version and make my decision then.
