I bought this DVD without any prior references, but John Huston names, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on the cover. I found that the Brazilian title is very strange, but I decided to look, expecting to see a funny comedy can be as «Switch». However, the story is nonsense and terribly hard to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is supplied to the surgery to change their sex in Copenhagen, and he returned to Hollywood, saying that it should be Myra Breckenridge (Raquel Welch) and claiming that half of the property of his uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). Along the days, Myra and her alter-ego Miron corrupt young couple at the academy with her uncle curly sex. At a certain moment, a messy scenario so confused that I think that the whole story was just a mind trip Myron induced accident. Unfortunately, the beautiful Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to keep this film. My voice three <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "Homem & Mulher ATE Certo Ponte" ( "The man and the woman to the point")
