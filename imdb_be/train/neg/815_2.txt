I just got in a 4-disc special UK Superman 1 issue about $ 5. Additional material includes 1951 features Superman and Mole-man. So I hit him in the DVD-player last night, and here are my findings <br /> <br /> Some initial disappointment. - I have not checked, and I think that if in thought is listed as one of the series Kirk Alyn, I'm not a big fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I'm nothing but a strange clip Kirk Alyn did not see - but hey ho, let alone <br /> <br /> This black and white production runs. within less than one hour. It looks like a couple of episodes of the TV series of the early Reeves, two stalls, put together for the release of the movie, although IMDb says that it was filmed as a movie release before the first TV series. In any case, it's an odd choice for the reasons I get later. I'm at an age when I think of television and film productions, which are limited to one or two points and the sets, so that there were no major surprises. However, the budget for the film, this is really a low budget <br /> <br /> As for the history of the small town of Silsby -. The population of 1430 - which, inexplicably, is also home to the deepest well (6 miles) of oil in the world. The story begins with the foreman Wells quickly taking steps to shut down the well. This leads to conflict with the arrival of the Metropolis reporter Kent and Lane to report about the well, on the orders of the oil company. Clark sniffing out the fact that the drill has arisen in radioactive cavity 6 miles down, a few strange little boys and girls (of small stature, large head, black overalls and thick brow) to get out of a locked-off drillshaft and start mooching round town with a puzzled expression on their faces. <br /> <br /> deep breath now, here's the plot of the remaining paintings. Little guys scare some kids, so Jeff Measles (played by rampant xenophobia city) incite some friend to kill the "creature". Superman steps in the (moderately inefficient) and catch one of the little boys and girls who were shot and takes him to a local hospital. groomsman Corey burn the hut the other boy hid in and assume that he would be killed, but he runs off and his feet into the mine. Corey encourages them to lynch (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang hospitalized Mole-Man. Superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured boy to the shaft in order to return it to their friends. A total of 4 moles men are with the weapon of some sort, they fire in Jeff Corey (I call it a gun Aargh! Because its only effect seems to make Corey go «Aargh!») And Superman rescues him . He immediately changed his way of surprise, while maintaining his Superman after he acted cricket-men go down the shaft. . End <br /> <br /> Despite the film being only an hour, there is an excessive amount of crawling around, bewareing and pursuing - I dropped all the "Mole-Man 1 goose from A to B, looking to make . that no one was watching him "things Mole-men have never engaged in any way - they do not have any dialogue - they just turn up, get prosecuted, and back they look scary, but they are unlikely to bug-eyed monsters. which implies the reaction of the city <br /> <br /> Reeves pretty good Clark Kent -. very sober reporter, much more than Phyllis Coates rather indifferent Lois Lane. But it is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only that, he does not look a part (at least, his hair dyed black in this, which is an improvement compared to the relatively light hair, he wore some TV episodes), the way he played it all wrong in my book. I am sure that he was told to "strike a pose" (which Superman does constantly), but someone had to tell him, that it should be fists on the hips, not the ribs with his fists. And he plays superman as a rather touchy and strict teacher - he actually did not wag his finger in remonstration, but he might as well have done <br /> <br /> And Superman makes a huge amount of walking (I say large amounts. - he is not really in it all that much), and a little jogging. He takes off and lands a couple of times, but have not seen in flight at any point. Oh, some of the bullets bounce off him, and he uses a telescopic vision, Clark, but without a concomitant visual effect. . In fact, the visual effects are noticeable in their absence, and the few that exist are not well <br /> <br /> I tried to consider these efforts with reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards, I think it rather shabby efforts. Fortunately, the production standards of the series were higher, and at least they were not too lazy to come up with stories that were a little more to be <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. - I will not watch it again.
