I have a terrible pan and scan video tape, "Boom!" And I want to see it in all its glory widescreen. Therefore, I voted '1', and I hope that you will too. Together, we can pull the film down into the pits of cinematographic waste and hope that someone will see the opportunity for big money in the release of "Boom!" The Director has downgraded the extended version. The film is one of my favorites howl ?? you just look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the operator, and you say to yourself: "Yes, I think you can fool some people for a long time." Manufacturers considering DVD release with "Boom!" It is worth noting that all have been shown to have been sold out crowds in theaters. But it was not until Frostbite Falls yet.
