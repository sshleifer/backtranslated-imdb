I firmly believe that the best Oscars in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Host Steve Martin was his most witty: "I saw the Teamsters helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo" and "I'd rather not mention gay mafia when I wake up with a poodle's head in my bed" <br /> <br /> 2) winners surprise: Nobody Adrien Brody down for the best actor (applause license) or for Roman Polanski best Director (These taunts and boos), but they won <br /> <br /> award ceremony was not in the last year with very bad, but there was little in the way of surprises, and I was glad to see the appeal of KING sweep the awards, even if it was not the best in the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better), but the fact that even if the coverage BBC down Jonathan Ross gets some of his flattering friend round and pretending that they were gay when they are anything but. So when I heard the Sky made for British television coverage I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode, to make references, but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh Gawd, when the British TV critics desperately (It is obvious that they are), I'm sure Bob and Theo Robertson Moo joy to fly to Los Angeles to give their honest opinion about those who won and who lost <br /> < br /> Chris Rock was not so bad, but he's not Steve Martino, while the location seemed to be reminiscent of a sports hall with places to put in! Not so many attractive arena, in my opinion. The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with "minor" Oscars handed out to the winners, who were sitting in their seats! There's no such thing as a "minor" Oscar and just because the award for Best Animated Short and Best Costume Design, and they deserve it as the best film or best director. All winners must be able to go to the podium. Which is a bunch of arrogant snobs Academy becomes and I fully agree with the comments that this format is dishonest, and if there were no surprises this could possibly be the worst in the history of the ceremony. As for the awards themselves <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett. No big surprise for competitive category <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Morgan Freeman. No real complaints since Freeman is one of the greatest actors of the living character of America <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Jamie Foxx. The most predictable of the night award. Yawn <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Hilary Swank. Major surprise, because everybody thought that Annette Benning is going to win the right to the policy academy, but Swank did deserve it, and gave the best performance of the night <br /> <br /> Best Director - Clint Eastwood. Major surprise, because everybody thought that Scorsese is going to get an award, simply because he never won one. In fact, I'm glad about that, because if he did not deserve his Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and GoodFellas, he did not deserve his Aviator <br /> <br /> Best Picture - Million Dollar Baby. Again, another major surprise, since they thought that the Academy will split the award for best director and best film, and I thought that the Hollywood friendly site Aviator would make it a dead CERT for the best film and the controversial subject MDB would have turned many voters away <br /> <br /> what those rewards may show that this year, voters decided to ignore the policies and Oscar really give awards to people who have earned it the fact that they have not done in the past, I am BEAUTIFUL mIND mind knocking committing R ING for Gawd's! How long can the Academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts
