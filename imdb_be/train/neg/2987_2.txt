Dubbing / translation in this movie very funny and provides only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick. I have not laughed so hard in my life, as I have just made to look ZOMBI 3 (and I've seen some really bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, the filmmakers might have to re-edit the film and release it as a comedy, and earn millions of dollars. That's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But ... If you fall from your couch laughing at dubbing in Fulci zombie movie is not your cup of tea, then avoid it at all costs.
