First of all that is good in the film? Some pretty actress? exotic background? the fact that the actors do not laugh, acting (I would, if I were in their position)? I do not know. The storyline is simple: a Catholic priest who makes abstract paintings trying to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his younger brother, the male prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...). I'm afraid that there's nothing here to find out whether the enable bit to think about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst of the worst episode of the season "profiler" (series) with the replacement of the actors and incredible coincidences (the uncle is the police that the girl, who lives in the house of another victim could have children with the priest, etc., etc.) .
