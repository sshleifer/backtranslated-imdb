This film is full of shit! Avoid this waste of celluloid any price, it is incomprehensible and incoherent. I am proud to water depth 70-sleaze cinema from everything from Salo Salon Kitty. I like to be in shock, but I need a coherent story. However, if you watch the horses mate gets you this movie is for you. The saddest thing is that lame werewolf costume with functional Wang. I mean, it's just hard to sit through, not to mention the terrible acting and a soundtrack dubbed bad. Please, I know that cover interesting (that looks like a gorilla hands reaching for bare ass woman), but do not waste your time and money as you will not get any back.
