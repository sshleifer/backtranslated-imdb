** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a bad film. Seriously. Acting in absolutely awful, the FX are dreadfull and the plot down right awful. But hey, it is so bad that its fun to watch! The script is so bad that it enjoyable! You just have to crawl and laugh lines such as: "I think that's what you call CROCTEASING.Â» As women flash their breasts at the crocodile. I mean COME ON it will be funny to cause it so bad! He has such terrible jokes, they are funny! But after a while it just becomes more than the film turns to shit. I really started to fall asleep. Believe me, though, plastic crocodile feet stamping on the sheets and permanent swishes of the tail of a clay are well keep you laughing for a long time. Although I must say that it was one of the coolest, if this dude alligator ripped in half, and he just hung out there for a while to figure out what to do. Hehe pointless film to be nominated for MST3K line !!
