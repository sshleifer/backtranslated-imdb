Return to the cabin on the lake .... just was not there. He had to have a very low budget, because a fair amount of the film were removed from the usual video camera. So, in the same scene - you'll have some cinematic camera shots and the usual shooting video camera. This makes for a very odd mix! I think they had to find some way not to make the effect of the "home video"! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth it to see if you've seen the original CBTL, because then you can compare and see the difference. But if you have not seen the original CBTL .... you will never want to see, if you see this first! It probably sounds too cheesy and turn you even care about the original.
