I'm afraid you will find that the vast majority of people who appreciate this film as 10 highly Christian. I do not. If you are looking for a Christian film, I recommend this film. If you are looking for a good overall film, I'm afraid you have to go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by the characters and their behavior is illogical. The premise of the film is that the doctrine of morality, does not teach that it was Jesus, which is the basis of morality itself is wrong. One scene shows the protagonist, the boy says that it is wrong to steal, and then the character goes on to say that it was Jesus who taught us this. I believe that the attack: we believe that the "do not steal" came from Jesus? I believe that he wrote the Ten Commandments? And stealing was acceptable to it? I rented a movie from Netflix. I had to understand the nature of the film with comments. Oh, well.
