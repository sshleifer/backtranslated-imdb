I can not believe that so much talent can be wasted in a movie! Gingerbread does not start on the right foot, and manages to create some high hopes for ending. But at some point the film turns into one of the most horrible stories I have ever wasted my time. It is just unbelievable how fascinated Mallory DOSS managed to pull the character Kenneth Branagh around the nose. Movies climax uninteresting and flat as the beer that had been left in the sun too long. Gingerbread Man, probably the worst Grisha-film ever, and that has not changed is that the talented movie star crowds. Do not waste your time here!
