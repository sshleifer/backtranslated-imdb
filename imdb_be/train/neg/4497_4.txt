- I was planning to write something to explain that I did not like about this movie, but it will be much harder than I thought. Honestly, I can not think about it. I watched it three days ago, and he did almost no impression on me. This is usually a sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was incredibly bored most of it. The novelty of having Humphrey Bogart look-alike such as a detective disappeared very quickly. It would be different if he could act, but he's one-note entertainer. Destruction scene was processed amateurish and there was no stress, which leads to him. If you can not identify the killer five minutes into the film, you should see all the Euro fear. Casting is a dead giveaway to the identity of the murderer.
