By 1976, the western genre was exhausted, and the creators of this film is clearly aware of this. However, instead of shelving the project, and save us from having to look at, they went ahead and did it anyway. Apparently, in need of an interesting topic to get the audience to come and see the film, they decided to do it, obviously violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, he worked for The Wild Bunch, why should it not work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the advantage of an excellent script, but the script The Last Hard Men clearly old-fashioned junk. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays retired lawyer, which comes after the heap of fluent convicted headed violent criminals (Coburn). Hunting becomes even more personal when Heston daughter (Barbara Hershey), abducted prisoners and subjected to sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> It's a bloodthirsty movie is actually in which every time someone dies, it is displayed in the transferred-top detail. It is extremely disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like an appetizing prospect. There's no sense of pace or urgency in the film anything. It takes forever to go, but when the action finally comes it is overshadowed by the focus on the bad things. In general, it can be very worst film ever made Heston. I'm sure this is one of the performances he hates to include illustrious resume.
