What in the name of God, what happened here? How does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of the Redneck Zombies? Zombie was 90 ever have to entertain someone ... anyone, or even get a dollar profit? But basically, what happened here? <br /> <br /> 90 zombies Extreme Moore was sent to a lunatic by the name of Andreas Schnaas specializing in weird gore films such as Gore Cup, and cannibalism in 2000, and some of which contain profanity in the title. In the department of gore, this one is not much different from the rest. Although the level of absurdity ... well, strange. <br /> <br /> Zombie 90 Extreme Pestilence as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is a bloody, think about it. <br /> <br /> Getting too specific with the story will be a waste of time. Accidents involving chemicals cause the dead to come back, and have a life. Never concept has been treated in this way. Gore effects as a whole, a new low. Simply Z-class nightmare. I can not say whether or not it was originally meant to be funny, somehow, I doubt that the English dubbing had to be very exact original script, but stranger things have happened. All this just reminds me of the introduction of the shot-on-video to film three, except that lasts for a heck of a lot more. <br /> <br /> I have seen only one film, which was worse than that, Chooper. <br /> <br /> for evidence that Andreas Schnaas is the actual director, I highly recommend Nikos the Impaler If you think that there are no standards that you are looking for in a bad movie, Extreme PESTILENCE to try, but you We have been warned. It takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through. But if the blood of all of you here, you may be able to digest it. In addition, no atmosphere, no, and I do not mean no budget, no entertainment value, but in general, there is no honor. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Update 07/05/09: After a few more zombies 90 views, I had a change of heart, or I guess I just get it now. Zombie 90 oars, so Nevermind harsh words, though, Extreme Pestilence still deserves only one star.
