Whoever wrote the script for this film, apparently never consulted any book about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in the biopic, starting with the early years in Jamestown Celoron and her last years with Desi. I could write a long list of factual errors, but it will go on the page. Overall, I think that Lucille Ball is one of those unique people who simply can not be painted by someone other than themselves. If I were Lucy Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would angry with how many mistakes have been made in this film. The filmmakers tried, but the film seems awfully sloppy to me.
