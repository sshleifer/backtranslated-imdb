Unlike most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. <br /> <br /> It starts looking interesting, with the mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes up until the very last episode. In the end, I still did not understand what alien attacks were all about (maybe I missed something, who knows?) And I realized that I spent 26 episodes, consisting mainly of the characters, hating himself, selfishness, and self-pity to himself. It actually turns between the alien / robot fights, and these dark, depressing flashing-on-and-off stage, where one or more characters can just say or scream, "I hate me / you / it's" 10-12 times in a row. <, Br /> <br /> I can not see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters), which shows the growth or change. (I can not see any other characters learning or growing, or, for that matter). I wanted to hit them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episode, and this feeling has not changed over the past. Shinji does possess such helpless despair that makes people angry, not charity, and rabies Ask this know-it-all, I would like to split the image on the TV screen every time she came into view. Yes, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything, and say that it is often veeeeeeeery. <br /> <br /> I am otherwise a big fan of anime and manga, and never before have I enjoyed one so much. I have read that series creator / author wrote it while suffering from depression, and I can not believe that; it made me depressed to see it. Is that the goal of this series? I honestly ask. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed? And if you suffer from depression, why not just write a book or a biography about him, rather than mixing it with aliens and IU's? It's someone else's war story, as far as I could tell, not really lead to anything. <br /> <br /> And finally, since I really fascinated by how many people claim to love this mosaic of blind areas, I can "t help but wonder how many of them actually find it well and many say that they do, because they said it is.
