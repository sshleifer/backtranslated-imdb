I bought this movie for 1 euro, not knowing what it was all about. I thought, "Hmm, a film named injured person should be very funny if not, at least, full of blood." It was not funny is good. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I do not mind disturbing films, but this one just does not mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm ... Image quality was terrible. Then ... there was no action. Just some fcked up fcker injuring more than 90 minutes. This is probably the material for Sicko's jurking off the far Gore. <br /> <br /> Or do not look at it. It's not worth your time. It's just awful. I wish I never bought it. <br /> <br /> They have to maim the guy who did it
