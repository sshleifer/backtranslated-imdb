This film was a mediocrity, laziness and carelessness written all over it. If you are going to make a movie about vampires that have been made thousands of times already, then you better do a damn good job. I'll be the first to say that this film just does not cut it. Some movies scary / horror just does not break the mold with "lets do something forbidden and left for fun, because all these stories is simply" clich√©s. This one, unfortunately, is no different as all the horrors, if you do not there is no way back to risk this way. <br /> <br /> And the ending? As heroes doing the same work over and over again throughout the film, but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and can not do the job in the end? The ending was very anti-climatic and rye Part 3, I'll never watch. Scary movie.
