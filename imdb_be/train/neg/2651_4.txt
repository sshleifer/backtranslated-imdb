The first 30 minutes Flick was choppy and hard to know what's going on (if you have not read the book - which I did not). <br /> <br /> If you can stick to the first half, the second half sweet - predictable, yes, but no less sweet <br /> <br /> As it was filmed one would think that was obtained at the beginning of 80, instead of 2005. <br /> <br />. NO stand out moments, insipid, but it did not move forward without me sad. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, her part would be better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors, to keep his balance.
