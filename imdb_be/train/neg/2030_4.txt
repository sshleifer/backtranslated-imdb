Comment on «eliz7212-1» fall into the proverbial "bull's eye" for this program turkeys. But this whistle to watch William Shatner "jump" and "dance" (the "" signs on the dance words are needed, which makes the Bill). This show will be a great skit on SNL and MAD TV - and appreciate it a few stars for one show, or so, to see Shatner, who seems to have adopted a "camp" to new heights - whether as or as himself, but the guy is funny <br /> <br /> The girls who are in areas with booths scrolls game data will be largely out of success, if the turkey will be canceled. - if not the revival of a whiskey-and-go-go genre, with the risen demand for shapely young women dancing in elevated cages again <br /> <br /> I've watched the first participant who was irritable, and literally "dumber than .: post ", but through sheer luck, he got off with a quarter or so cute. The second party, a little more reasonable, but who would be lucky to get $ 1,000 of Jeopardy, Got mad with a card that requires answering a specific question -. That he did not know, and thus left with zilch <br /> <br /> It is a lot of game shows, hanging and sometimes rewards, a large amount of daily physical persons admittedly cheap efforts, in general, to try to seduce the viewer. Even if the owner of a well-compensated, and they pay six figures on an average episode, I believe that the income compared to the cost can be profitable - because you do not Cibitoke actors, where several stars are six or seven figures per episode, with some great residual transactions as well. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even the best of them will wear thin before long. This one has pretty much reached this point. I think that it offers, especially with James Spader, and the rest on the «Boston Legal» must give us a satisfactory amount of Bill Shatner proposals. <br /> <br /> Again, the higher the ranking by the way just to see Bill horn and prance, perhaps once; that should be enough.
