Firstly, I want to say that this film deserves more than four stars I rated it. I gave it four stars because it is a 86-minute movie always seems to be 2 and a half hours and is not involved enough for me to sit through the whole thing. Nevertheless, «The Big Alligator River» (the name of my DVD calls it) is better than your average nature Strikes Back movie. <br /> <br /> tourist resort in the jungles of Southeast Asia only open and work trying to manipulate the native wildlife around. Mother Nature looking for revenge comes in the form Kroona god, a giant alligator. But there is not only the tourists and the main characters (the photographer and the resort staff) have to worry about what the locals are rubbed the wrong way too. <br /> <br /> This film is very well done story of adventure / horror with good music and direction. But the alligator, the main attraction of the film is obviously a fake look. Some of the close-up of the jaws are good, but that should be all we need to see. Some of the underwater long-distance shots to make it painfully obvious that we are indeed dealing with an alligator squeaky toy, you can probably get in the zoo gift shop. But the natives are plausible, if not accurate. <br /> <br /> Probably not a film that will give you a non-stop thrills, if any, but shot and performed well enough to give any good. And how many creatures of films, this one ends with an extremely high number of victims. It also has a lot of good scenery jungle. Responsibilities below par, though, but who expected it to be better, eh? <br /> <br /> It is much, much better than its American counterpart, the recent «Primeival», but nothing to compare with "Jaws". But remember that this can not be involved in several points.
