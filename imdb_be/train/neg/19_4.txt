I'm a big fan of Oslo. Finally, seeing him as the star of the recent film, not just a bit part, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I took an assessment of the film in college, and the only thing that I can say I do not like the fact that the film was shot in an abandoned part of the city, and there was no background traffic or Lookie toilet. <br /> <br /> I have to say that acting is poor, but Arnold's a great actor, I have to chalk it lousy direction, and the supporting cast is poor. <br /> <br /> I love WFFL, and he made the film to view. Otherwise, I would have written it as another lousy movie. <br /> <br /> I found rape cruel and unnecessary scenes, but the actors who went were pretty good in the end. But the shoot sound effects were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity), but they overlookable given the low caliber of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed the film because it was WFFL. <br /> <br /> Jackie
