The first look at the cover of this picture, it looks like a good rock 'n' roll movie. But do not let the cover fool you, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie it. The plot is just awful, and therefore valid. Plain and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> This is not a film about the road, it's just fine love story, so badly that you can see right through it. The only good thing about this film is soundtrack.Some good songs, and that's why I give 2 out of 10. If it were not for the music, he would have been 0 of 10. Meat Loaf is terrible actor (at least it was in 1980 ), and a girl who plays a groupie not even pretty! This film was a huge disappointment for me, because it makes a lot of good promises.
