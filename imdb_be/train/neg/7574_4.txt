But he has some good action and the plot, which is somewhat interesting. Nevsky acts as a body builder, and it is not all that attractive, in fact, IMO, it's ugly. (His acting skills are not all!) Sascha plays very well Joanna flour, but it needs more lines than she was given her character, need to be developed. There are too many people in this story, there is zero novel, too much action and too dull ending. It's very strong. But I love scenery, this film will take you around the world, and it's a bonus. I also liked how it was a few things about the Mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough that caught my attention. Actors should have been more beautiful ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was simply too normal, not sexy. I think that for most guys, by Sascha will be quite hot, but for us ladies who are supporters of action Nevsky just does not cut it. Overall, this movie was good, I do not like, and I do not hate, just found it to be another normal effect Flick.
