To begin with, "Hobgoblins" trying to imitate the more successful "Gremlins." It's bad enough, but they did not even try to do something that is very reminiscent of the film here. Instead, it is more like a discounted, all-be sure to keep the clearance of defective scenes that do not match the sound effects, which act as fresh as unflavored tapioca and the script, which accepts all people a holiday store in their movies and throws them down the old tube -aroo. <br /> <br /> plot? Grrrr .... interfere with the children to hunt down gremlins-like creatures of the many films before they kill people by projecting their fantasies. Sound cool, is not it? Well, you see that the wall on the other side of your room? Run straight at him, the maximum speed, face first. Look, it's better than the movie. <br /> <br /> You can doubt it? Quick, name something else one of the conclusions was other than that. What other script authors have done so "houses"? What are the other Rick Sloane directoral effort. How many "Hobgoblins" action figures do you have? You see? Thank you. <br /> <br /> I can not believe it took me so long to write about such a terrible movie. I would like to write about more important things; as the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, this kind of thing. But no, "Hobgoblins" it is bad - bad as the wallpaper of your grandparents, bad as pink flamingos on your lawn, bad, like underwear that says "Home hamburger" ... and I think that we will stop there. <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and the robots fight bravely, but try as they might, they can only do so much of the "houses" before they realize that, yes, the director really needs a foot in shin. <, Br /> <br /> real, very difficult. <br /> <br /> One star in "houses", according to the seven stars of MST3K.
