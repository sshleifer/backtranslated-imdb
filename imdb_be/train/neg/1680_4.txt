Even with a cast that boasts such usually reliable names like Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland can not give any sense of depth to this film. It's just clean the surface of the incidents that took place that night in July 1981 Kilmer just goes through the motions, as John Holmes and Kate Bosworth Kudrow and we both hope to miscast the other two main roles; Holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast are such small parts, it is impossible to get any size of them. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott, and a cameo by Paris Hilton.
