Firstly, let me say that I am a great believer in Fanpro things. I see it as a way to continue a good show for a long time after it was canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations examples decent effort. So I have a folding seat for fanpro material, which means that I'm going to lose sight of the fact that I used to slate bad <br /> <br /> so on ST :. HF. Well, first of all good things. Enthusiasm is an important part of creating any show plausible and, for the most part, the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles. Further, no bad effects for moonshine efforts, with nothing that you really start. History is not too bad. Nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough material and at least have regular story-arc. <br /> <br /> But there are many disadvantages. <br /> <br /> In the first place, although they are quite obvious rip-off of Star Trek footage, screen savers, music and effects, I do not see any reason why they came to rip off almost any other sci-fi musical score if ever made. All that is foreign to the Starship Troopers is raising its head in the orchestral one time or another. In addition, most of the footage from other films, obediently CGI'd over to make it look different. Gray warships, for example, though disguised, obviously, Star Destroyers from Star Wars. And the station is also pretty obvious Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga from Starship Troopers. In addition, the sound effects from the various Star Wars movies appear in the cosmic battle between the fighters, as it does on the animated footage. In one scene in the first or second season, I think you can even see the two TIE fighters fly during combat, that hardly makes your suspension of disbelief affection. <br /> <br /> duties ranging from reasonable to horrible painful to watch. It really improves as the season progresses, though, but to wait for the screen to wriggle a lot, especially early in the season. They also made a number of interesting options. Let's just say that the food replicators on the show seems to be permanently installed in the "pie" and leave it at that. <br /> <br /> Make-up effects are usually quite effective in general. But they really need to mercilessly club to the death of a man who has decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian mask for anything, except for the use of background or "pass" frames. They simply unrealistic. Every time I saw one of them (apart from trying not to laugh too much), I kept waiting for the unfortunate soul to wear it, to pull out a gun and declare that "This regiment up!" In one scene, "Cardassian" actually He said, wearing one of them. Not only that, his lips do not move, but the mask is not even a hole where the mouth should be. Someone needs to be slapped hard for this. Could they have a craft knife to him, for God's sake! There are also some well-done, but unintentionally funny make-up jobs such as Herman Munster look the same. <br /> <br /> written form, though coherent, there is nothing new. Instead, the script works as an extension of DS9, with the ships of head of the DS12 on various missions. A new enemy, "Gray" is not very threatening and storyline involving their effective adaptation Borg threads. ie Starfleet meet gray, gray are extremely powerful, Starfleet just to escape with his life, and then with the help of technology, they are beginning to look for ways to fight the enemy, etc. etc. Everything was done previously with Borg. <br /> <br /> Another bone of contention is the dialogue. Star Trek writers have long had the ability to write "technobabble insert here" in the script. This usually means the last presentation of the plan to combat the enemy, using a "quantum phase discriminator" or «isolytic charges" etc. In other words, nonsense, that tells you that they are, in fact, and the resolution at hand. <, Br /> <br /> words just nonsense really. I have no problem with that, but where ST :. HF makes a mess of it, where they include real comments on this concept <br /> <br /> Tactical advice such as, "We have to regroup," sounds good, but not when uttered by a trio of characters are already in the group. Similarly, when asked what the situation is, the tactical officer heard to say, "We expect the three ships of the line." He actually need to count them? Come on! I expected that the questioner to ask him, "Are you sure?" Or, "You can double-check." But my favorite comment is: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we establish two-way communication?» <br /> <br /> Comms officer: "No, we can only send and receive .." < br /> <br /> Well, the spirit! ..... <br /> <br /> Having said all the above, the show does improve as it goes forward. Seasons 1 and 2 rather badly 3 shows an improvement, but 4 and 5 are where it starts to get much better. Season 6 still looks quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with their choice of media for the show, though. Quicktime sucks, quite frankly, and the sooner they erayazzhayuts in DivX / AVI format, the better. Some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on the screen of decent size and did not look into the small QT window on the computer monitor. Not only that, Quicktime make it difficult, but the resolution 320x180 show in general does not scale well. in fact, it makes the show quite unwatchable, as they were a videotape copy of the tenth generation. At least they could have done to enable high resolution of the loaded version. <br /> <br /> In any case, the show has promise, and I even started to like some of the characters. But it's 40 episodes, so I'm not sure what it says about what a lot of character development at all. <br /> <br /> But what can you say, it's free .... <br /> <br /> PS: 28 votes 19 people have rated it shows 9 or 10. Hmmm ... are we watching the same show? Or you are 19 three year olds?
