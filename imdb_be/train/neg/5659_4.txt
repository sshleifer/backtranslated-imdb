Disappointing end to a season that started so well ... <br /> <br /> Exodus Part 2 and other characteristic episodes were some of the best seen on TV in any series, where, as it was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure if it was an episode which was a disappointment, but the cheese guitar music that is accompanied by the closing sequence was ridiculous and would have been more at home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It is almost as if the Corporate Execs do not like the low-key note down the end and wanted to jazz it up. They failed, and rather spoiled. <br /> <br /> It is hoped that this is not a trend in the future. <br /> <br /> However, at least we have seen the return of a particular person, even if somewhat bizarre and banal done.
