I was glad to hear that someone has made a documentary about what it was like Puerto Rico. When I heard that it was Rosie Perez, I wondered..could she might know what it's really like to be Puerto Rican. As far as I know .... it was Nuyorican. Well anyway, I anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch. I realized 10 minutes from him, that my initial perception was right. Rosie Perez does not know much about what it's like to be Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is probably the first side, a very, very personal account of what it's like to be all that it entails Nuyorican..and. She (like most Nuyoricans I know) is divorced, partial, and sometimes developed sense of history. (How could they live not..they here.) Yes, they are all proud of. As they should be! But many do not know the ins and outs of the real culture, history and political background or language for the most part. All this was very, very evident with its participation in the Vieques issue. Regardless of my personal take on it issue..at At least I know what the hell fight for. There she was arrested for what she knew little about .. and only participated in because it was a "Puerto Rican Cause" I really do not know how she does not hesitate to admit it. For those of you not Puerto Rican, please consider this as a partial cost of travel and women self-acceptance. Do not take this as gospel ... a lot of it is not even true. Please pay attention to the source. Actress Rosie; not a historian. This film is not and should never be, for other Nuyoricans, the reasons for their information. Instead, just a step towards the search for more information, study and discussion of what actually was the case. Not only one is from the eyes of this woman.
