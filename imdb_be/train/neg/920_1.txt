Seriously. I just completed my first Demonicus viewing and words failed me. <br /> <br /> I remember the time when I see the name of the group of Charles in the film and my heart races. He was never Wes Craven and John Carpenter. He was a pillar of hope for the little guy. The guy whose films have arrived at a video store instead of the multiplex, but they still rocked harder than most fashionable stuff we otherwise had to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> <br /> painfully obvious California footpath takes to "Alps" and an abandoned train tunnel should actually be "an ancient cave." I mean, they did not even try to put the thing with moss or shoot it in a way that could suggest it was nothing but an old railway tunnel! Ugh! Instead of terrible demon Gladiator, the cover has in mind, we were treated to a dude wearing the latest in a Wal-Mart Halloween clothes. There's quite a cool looking corpse that from time to time comes to belch life and move his fingers, but he did not learn how to be entirely up to the last five minutes. Why can not he be a villain? Instead, we got a boy Joe fraternity with a plastic sword. Uche. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... You should be ashamed that your name attached to such scars. I love movies that are so bad they're good. Hell, I occasionally enjoy the flick will be so bad, it's just bad. This one, however, only unwatchable. A great example of what makes the dollar, instead of doing high-quality film.
