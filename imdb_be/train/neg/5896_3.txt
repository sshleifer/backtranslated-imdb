One missed call, other Asian fear, based on the mobile phone. I recently filmed Korean horror film based mobile phone called «Pon». One Missed Call was as sad as that. Perhaps the phone just is not scary or anything, but the move was dull and drab. A lot of stress or excitement for me, and the final monster was depressingly cheese and unscary. The film drew quite a bit in different parts, and felt too long. Do not delay my attention. It seems difficult to make a phone scary, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending terrible. And it's ridiculous to compare it with «The Ring», it seems every Asian horror film compared to him, and so far I have not seen that the measurements in the least. To the horror of directors - to take the phone off the hook, the device terror.
