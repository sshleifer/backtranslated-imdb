MONSTER - It was great; I loved the special effects that have created this monster that looked like an updated version of Â«The Creature from the Black Lagoon." Scenes with this beast roaming the land and the seizure of individuals ranged from good to jaw overthrow <br /> <br /> Social comments :. Most of the story takes place in the quarantine zone, as doctors (by order of the government) claim that the SARS-like illness there. In a nutshell, we get the familiar stories of the Government of hiding. You know, I think it's paranoid liberal thinking with Hollywood movies is always a picture of our corrupt government, but it seems that Koreans are copying the format and it is very tiring. Here, he takes the excitement and suspense of this "monster". It simply pulls the film down. The main family in the film should look from a distance at a time as a young girl in her family, thought to be dead, he was being dragged <br /> <br /> The moral :. A typical "water pollution" message, because that is what can happen - creepy mutant monster. Earlier this message of anti-nuclear bomb in 1950, when radiation giant ants, spiders, fish, or anything in these schlocky sci-fi movies. Now his "environmental problems", are in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> This humor was basically stupid. I used to laugh at the farce, but it was not funny. I do not know when the Korean sense of humor with it is that pathetic, or the film deliberately trying to be ultra-sweet with a take on the old films "Godzilla" Let's hope this is the last <br /> <br /> TRANSFER -.. Transfer the video was good it was sharp. that looks like the image and the sound was decent with plenty of rear speakers, the noise of the crowd. I watched it in Korean with English subtitles. This may have been a mistake, as the Korean throaty voice sounds got annoying after half an hour <br /> <br /> General -. it was a promise, but he was a big disappointment, and even sad too many spots, which is inexcusable for a modern movie monster. two o'clock it was too long for the story. As this film has attracted a record number of viewers in Korea, I do not know. They do not have much in the way of movies to enjoy and support.
