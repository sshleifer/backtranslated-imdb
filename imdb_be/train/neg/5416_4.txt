It was the third effort of director Background Stroheim - it's pretty rude and does not show any of the exceptional sense of smell for the camera and editing skills it will display a few years later with his masterpieces, greed and Wedding March. In fact, we have a trio Grifters, under the guise of Russian Count and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use the counterfeit money in the gambling tables and win some big money. Part of the plan is for the Count (von Stroheim), to insinuate himself between a visiting US ambassador and his "stupid" wife, woos her and hoping to get some money by playing on her weak side. He makes the mistake of taking as savings maid life he promised to marry. If she sees them together, she sets fire to the room, (von Stroheim and his victim are on the room's balcony). Here von Stroheim first establishes his identity as "the man you love to hate." He was deeply flawed and his character flaws will eventually lead him to the very poor and the well-deserved end. The film is raw in film and editing, not worth a look if you are fascinated by the director. There is a nice bit when he first tries to meet his wife after she reads the book - we see the name - Foolish zhoo of Stroheim. It was originally conceived as a 210-minute film, cut to 140 minutes in the studio and finally released on 70 minutes. Kino Video recovery restores survived frames (damaged in some way in most scenes) with an alternative earlier to give us 107 minutes of printing.
