Show business satire Monica Mitchell have some laughs and some intentional violence. I would not say the blood-soaked; but an insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character actor, which is adapted bizarre presence on the screen, but has track record of how to be selected for the parts he is following. There is always a nephew of the manufacturer or seemingly trivial reason for not awarding him the role he is looking for. Well, the best thing to do is to get rid of the competition ... Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts. Remuneration career only swing, push and kick off. Other actors: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini, and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, that's show business ... or is it?
