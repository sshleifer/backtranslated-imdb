I'll keep this short; Thanks Greg for helping me to put it succinctly: the capture of about a guy who girls drugs, drink, plants and torture her, and then posing as a prisoner to have sex with her. This is the only rotation and culmination of the film. This torture as a slow motion date rape. And it's not even a good movie. It's not so bad, it's good; it's just bad. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that among the critics, there is a "spoiler code" that they did not dare to break, even if some of them were inclined to it, because it was so disgusting. Why no one had cojones to step up and say, "this is garbage, and that's why" for me. <br /> <br /> Do not give money to the shit-peddlers.
