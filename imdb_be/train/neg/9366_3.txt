I hired Hybrid weekend. What a disappointment! Stupid lame attempt at a TV movie. The guy they got for the lead was completely weak and at work {it} did a lot of watching as he ate the mint candy ... with his ass! Wolf contacts he wore were great, although I feel that the actor turned to him too much, because there was nothing threatening about his actions at all. Wise native Indian chicken should be one of the most rocky carbide hardfacing Cargo ever seen. It is about a sweet cow! She smiled about once in the entire movie, and I think it's because she had sex. Sex scene was lame too. They may have also shown that blowing the curtains, if you can dig it. <br /> <br /> Last of all, and this is a great hates me, and on the cover of the DVD menu, the losers in the digital cold sucked sharp teeth at the boy. They were nowhere to be seen in the film. :(
