You might think that the first landing on the moon will be quite dramatic, without having to make material about it. However, this film seems to need to throw everything in a terrible light. It says about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions almost fatal Armstrong with training vehicle, and if the coach and the spacecraft had nothing to do with each other. This makes the computer overload problem (one thousand two hundred and two and anxiety 1201) arising during the final sound of landing sequence, almost a disaster if it was just an annoyance, not a risk to the crew at all. And it takes "thirty seconds" refers to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before launch, when in fact it for thirty seconds before the premature termination is required. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, go on "from the Earth to the Moon" or one of the PBS documentary films, but skip this.
