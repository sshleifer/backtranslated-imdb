If this is someone's "favorite" film, they are in serious need of help. There's nothing funny or intelligent about this crapfest. I have not seen the original film is a remake (a movie of the 1950s), but it just has to be better than this new bastardization. <br /> <br /> The main thrust of the military to be a fringe element, and the winds to teaching children to school ROTC. Unfortunately, the main one is the lady Wayans ... so that children are irritating to the world, a sense of humor nonsense. Wayans can whip those lost in the form of? Can they get it to become a bit more human? Bomb movie, as most films do Wayans, only a few brilliant moments. William Hickey receives about one minute of screen time, just too small. This charming old man (known best for me as "Tales from the Crypt" actor known best for you as Uncle Louie in "Christmas Vacation") shines every moment he is on the screen, which is not much here. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker, which suited him perfectly. I would not mind a little more Bam Bam, but I think that he carried as a "rocker" of how this can be done for the war film. <br /> <br /> And then there's an attractive teacher, someone falls Major Payne, even if it applies to children badly, has no social skills, and it is simply impossible to turn into someone you would want to spend time with. It must be either incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure (although it would seem "stupid", as the film makes it clear that she was out of the house often enough) <br /> <br /> Wayans had one bright moment :. The sequence of the dance, where he performs a series of moves (including very good "robot"), and with music by 2 Live Crew. This scene was pleasant, but hardly made up for everything else that made this film to the saliva of dogs. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to see the film loser battle, which helps children become lost heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he's cute loser, and really funny. Maybe when Major Payne struggled badger I feel better, but he did not. Forget Payne, forget Wayans ... you can do it much better.
