I have done quite a lot of reviews on IMDb, and this film is unique in the fact that I have never seen the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and unfunny, I just could not sit through it - though I tried <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and any film of Mel Brooks I call "Mel factor" .. In other words, the better his film, the less you see in the film. Think about it - Producers and Young Frankenstein were great movies, and he was either in them at all. BUT, films such as Life stinks and space balloons filled with chalk and rather sluggish movies (yes, I do not like Space Balls - but this is not the place to talk about that) <br /> <br /. > Secondly, in addition to cancer of the rectum, itching and mental retardation, I can not think of a less funny topic than homelessness. It's just a comedy breaker. Think about it, people. Funniest (?) Scene in the movie was Mel making whoopee with Lesley Ann Warren in the trash !! And it's funny, how?
