Well, maybe not, honestly the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> it made absolutely no sense, there was no plot, no characteristics, no action, just nothing. <br /> <br /> this is what I thought when I first saw it, my 28 2003 ** caution is a spoiler alert. it too much to complain about me, how bad the film :: /> Ok so the film begins <br /> <br and characters introduced, but there is no explanation of the nature. As far as I knew, that the main character was a novice at this school, but apparently not. It also turned out that he lived by himself ... that he was a foster child ... that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him until now. and all his friends, apparently, did not have parents and live on their own. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main story, this crazy guy escaped from an asylum and running rampant. Now, our protagonist will get this guy and focus intently on him for a freelance film. I think I have to miss the main element of the schedule here, there was no reason for the main character, to get hooked. even if it is a point, having no reason why all his friends who are skeptical like 5 minutes earlier suddenly behind him and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> so that the film goes on, and he gets well. they work havoc in the school, blah-blah-blah. but hey ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is working on a "show" here. second, entirely mad guy definitely say, the protagonist does not do this? he had to be anynomous. <br /> <br /> as another important element of the site was passed through ... crazy guy should not have been mad ... everyone said that he was not crazy. but the story goes, he was very clear in his mind. but I thought that the news people said that he was not ... um ... <br /> <br /> Currently, the film comes to an end. It was close? What the hell? not only the ending did not answer any questions about the main character, he did not answer any questions about the crazy guy. these people in the same situation? if so, there are some very basic storylines that do not seek to do so. if not, then what's the point in saying "it's in two weeks." ?? <br /> <br /> * end of things ... * <br /> <br /> This is what I thought then. this is pretty much what I still think that now. it 6 months down the line, and if I can get it for free, I might give it another chance, but I doubt it. I strongly doubt it.
