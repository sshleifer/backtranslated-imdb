Well, during the last break of gratitude, while having the whole family together all decided to go to the movies, and since then the position of Fred was recognized by most, that's what we went to say. <br /> <br /> In order to start the movie had so many plot holes, he was miserable. Simple explanations of why a certain event occurs is not legally binding. example; Who the heck is trying to "close" the point of Santa? Is this some kind of corporation? A little explanation would have been great. <br /> <br /> Second: The film you threw the flimsy characters that did not cause any sympathy from you about your feelings or actions. Example: little elf named Willy and only the tall girl in the elven village. they see each other twice, and then they were a couple, and I could have cared less, because this movie will make me excited. <br /> <br /> In the third place, I think it was suppose to be a family film? His rating was low just PG. For the family film had several articles suggestive conversation. It does not bother me, but when I was a father I could see the problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paul Giamatti looked very bored with his role, but to be honest, he was the only one worth watching in the cinema. Vaughn had a few funny moments, but playing the same character that he has for the last two films. talkative boy brotherhood. (Nothing against Vaughn, he was good in other films) <br /> <br /> so that this film gets 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because someone had to make an effort to produce the film and release this film, <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would definitely refer this movie, or if you have to see it, save it for a rainy day rental.
