Another horror film in which a goof ball teenager fighting mad and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over? Yes, but the fact that it was one of Canada gives it a bit of a different feel. The "brain" was a difficult teenager Jim Majelewski getting put in the treatment, which is the leader of a cult leader to contribute more ugly "brain." Jim can stop him? I think that, as our northern neighbor has achieved everything that they have achieved, they have the right to make at least one funny horror film. But still, they are likely to want to be known for having a national health care system and all. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had a brain. Why do not the people who made this film?
