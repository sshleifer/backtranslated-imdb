This film shows a racial hatred of Jews by David Mamet, than I <br /> <br /> ever encountered in an American film. In sterotypes so over the top that my ability to continue to look dead. I was so disappointed Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna calling a bunch of people sitting at the Jewish center in New York, gun cleaning, Heros, that common sense prevailed, and I stopped. I am deeply <br /> <br /> alarmed by the concept that the Jews are not Americans and "friend." I believe that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred Sun doctor away.
