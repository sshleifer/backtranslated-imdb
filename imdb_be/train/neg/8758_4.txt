Not a movie, and lip sync a collection of performances from acts that were part of the British Invasion that followed the Beatles dynamic entrance into the world of music. Some of these acts do not make a big splash on this side of the pond, but many of them did. Recommended are: Herman's Hermits, Billy Kramer, and Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycomb, Nashville Teens, animals and, of course, the Beatles <br /> <br /> It's so much fun to watch these young acts earlier. they honed and polished his actions.
