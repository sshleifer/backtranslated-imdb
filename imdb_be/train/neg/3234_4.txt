Well, how do you even appreciate the film such as this? There is even the cinematic value, really? This is a film that tries to get as close as possible to be a snuff film, as far as possible. Basically, the entire film is purely a bunch of boys tormenting a young girl. Not very attractive, and on top of that and not what it is actually realistic. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the film was trying to be realistic and shocking as possible. However, the film is just too fake to work as designed. Slapping and stomping all soft and fake look and sound. They are often just feet to the floor, not the girl, obviously. Furthermore, the method she is responsible for all meal pretty tame. I mean, if it was real, of course, she would have screamed it. There is a lamentation, than to scream in the same. <br /> <br /> The film is clearly a low budget, and an attempt to valor when trying to achieve something shocking and realistic, as well as original and provoking, with very limited resources. Is there really do not think that this film did a lot of influence, but at the time it was released, although he had to do something well as a total of six sequels were released after this. <br /> <br /> The proponents of shock and gore are likely to be disappointed by this film, although there are still some fetish people who will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
