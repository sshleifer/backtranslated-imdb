After watching this movie on DVD, I watched the trailer. Voiceover describes the film as surreal. Well, there are surreal, and there are unrealistic. <br /> <br /> There was really only one part of the film, which seemed surreal to me, but to be honest, it was more confusing than unrealistic. Other unusual images, especially diner scene where everything is on the floor were so meaningless, they did not matter. I do not mind the fact that the pictures do not mean anything, but these scenes just seemed out of place. <br /> <br /> I got the impression that the director tries to convey the inner monologue of Logan. I do not know what else to explain what is happening. Unfortunately, I did not see anything, did not give me a clue that Logan thinks of that his perspective was, or even his emotional state. All I could tell that he was not too happy with their appearance, and that he was in love with the older boys. <br /> <br /> I thought that the end signaled that happened relationships between boys, but not very much did. Deliberately ambiguous scenes matching those that were simpler, it seemed more like a cop than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> However, as hard and as the content of the movie was free for me, it was definitely a change of pace. I really liked the skin Madagascar, and I had the feeling that the film sought to this kind of narrative, and perhaps even the style. It's not even close. I have no doubt that this film deserves a A for effort, but D for execution.
