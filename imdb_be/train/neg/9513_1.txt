I tried to watch this film, three separate times. At night, I take it. There are approximately 20 minutes in the hope that it would be better if I were to relax at night. I watched another 15 the next day, almost snatched how foolish it was ... it was not even funny silly, sometimes funny movie to watch, but this film is just crap with a capital S (if you know I mean censoring the world we live in). And finally, on the third day I watched an hour stupid things, and I did not enjoy a single moment! even one not. As this script to get the green light. ! Oh boy <br /> <br /> G <br /> <br /> 1/10 - one for the cheerleaders ... they deserve at least a little something for all their hardwork.
