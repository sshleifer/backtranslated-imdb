This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I saw him at the premiere at SXSW and was very disappointed. The director did not know much about John Lennon and even said so at the premiere. It is a drama, but people were laughing around like a bad movie was. It's never a good sign. The only saving grace was Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien in roommates / bandmate. They were funny while the rest of the film took over waaay too seriously. Cheese dropping Beatles lyrics is simply absurd. The soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie. If you're not one of those crazy, crazy fans Dominic Monaghan, do not bother with it.
