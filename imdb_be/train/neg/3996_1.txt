I do not see what all liked about this movie. Settings for too long and Talky, and when it was done, the protagonist remained as flat and opaque, since it was in the first stage. After the film, finally got into the room Cusack eponymous hotel, I had to wonder, well, what will happen here in the next hour or so, to keep me busy. The answer: not much, just John Cusack, having a long, drawn, mental disorder <br /> <br /> Maybe if Cusack's character was more depth .. maybe if his freak-out became more careful processing their daily lives. ,, Maybe, if the movie was any better than the newly minted developed the theme of the loss of faith or not and stuck them in the first place. ,, Perhaps if the film selection was made to be a psychological horror and thrill ride of horror and was completely captured by one of these styles. ,, I do not know. All I know is that I saw this film with two other lovers of horror, and none of us really liked. <br /> <br /> disturbing episode in the hotel's ledge, disturbing the crazy lady with a hammer to save, and so stupid, it was fun-crypt the ball in the air duct, all three of which account for no more than five minutes screen time, the film was boring. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from the lights and use them is considerably less powerful effect. Stephen King is now reduced to stealing ideas from yourself?
