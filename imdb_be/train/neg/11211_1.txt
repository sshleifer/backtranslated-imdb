There is so much that is wrong with this film, but to summarize: Terrible acting- so bad to be on purpose. poor scenario - they may have some good ideas, but it is not the best way to present the story. ridiculously bad ending- in some cases ending manages to save the film, not in this case. if you can sit through the entire movie you want to push yourself at the end, because the ending is not even worth the wait. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It was a complete torture sitting through this movie, I would have appreciated someone warning me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie, unless you have absolutely nothing better. Even if you regret, put himself through unspeakable torture.
