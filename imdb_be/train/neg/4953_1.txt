I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel that I have after watching Batman animation. His absolute nonsense! Warner Brothers was the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 90s, so what the hell, they do try to mess with a winning formula? I feel like writing a letter to the complaint in Sat. Original animation was dark and brooding, just like Batman should have been. WB had to do it with some kind of scar Batman. Now they produce this nonsense. Joker entirely remotely resemble the Joker from DC Comics. DC should sue. I urge all those who agree with me by e-mail or write to the World Bank, and use the power of the people to return to the original formula
