Oh, dear ... as an Englishman, and a small part of the Welsh, the fan works by Anthony Hopkins in the industry ..... at the moment, I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You can see that I am not a nobody who hoped for the best. So my comments as a "straw in the wind" But this is not it -.? I have no self-serving on the commercial value of the product I, member of the great unwashed, go see a movie, to be transported to a different location so, to suspend belief on.. within a short period of time. But do not enter into a state of complete disbelief. <br /> <br /> If it was an unknown author and director, I would suggest that this "production" have been castigated in oblivion. Unfortunately, it no, and I was wide-eyed and confused. Seeing some people rave reviews bonds, this job I was a little concerned .... <br /> <br /> Maybe it that I try, without compromising on viewing each movie on its own merits .. Regardless of the author, producer, studio or even fame content <br /> <br /> my advice, as many before me have not entrusted to write the production This is fraught with danger Films must be moderated to maintain semblance of credibility <br /> <br /> According to the school reports "... maybe you can do better ... "
