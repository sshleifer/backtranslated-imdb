This film has a lot of problems associated with it, which makes it come off as a low draft budget class from someone in a film school. I have to give him credit for his campiness though. Many times throughout the film I found myself laughing hysterically. It was so bad, the time that it was comical that made it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a low-grade shredder film with a twist of psychological horror and shooting range mannerisms absurdity, then pop the popcorn bowl, invite friends over and have some fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that sounds very bad. The dialogue is almost impossible to follow most of the time, and sound like just there.
