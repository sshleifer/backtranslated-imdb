Well, I'll start by admitting that I am not a supporter of John Ford. (I watched "by Informer" Only because I'm trying to work my way through the list of "great men".) So, if you just move forward, because you are not going to agree with me. <, Br /> <br /> What shocked and a piece of nonsense it! I will say that it is a good idea for the film here (it made me think about how few films have about the Irish revolution), but, as usual, Ford decided to bury it under the excessive action and cheap sentiment. I believe that it is more fun to watch for a while to see less than a smooth transition achieved by Silents to the "radio" - style of acting of some of the leaders have that behind quality endemics early movies, really feel, as if he could play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. (Of course, the name of the card to prevent Ford from the list of every bit of emotion into six times.) What is the dialogue, as a rule, is "They're always after me Lucky Charms" quality, which is compounded by the fact that each actor, seems to have been allowed to use their own personal version of an Irish accent. of course, as bad as they are, accents help to remind us that we are in Ireland, because it sets basically look as if they are dragged to with some German expressionist piece is removed the next sound older. (He feels as if with an eagle eye, you can see some of the villagers set fire to Dr. Frankenstein in the background). <br /> <br /> The methods change. Thick change. So I will not go on like crazy, it seems that this film It was so well known in the day. But this is not one of the classics that hold up easier --- "fair warning" about what more simplified stupidity, to which Ford was going to dedicate his career.
