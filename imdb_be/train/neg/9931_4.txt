"Black Angel" little whodunit, June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he was found guilty of the murder of an old friend. Dan Duryea (killed husband) decides to help Vincent find the true culprit. Peter Lorre has a thankless role as a suspect. This noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer will never achieve anything special. Pleasant enough, but then, at some point, it ceases to have meaning and solving the mystery is one of those big "give me a break" reaction. This ending alone could have sunk the film completely, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good. Vincent is a cowardly character and Duryea was never very good at playing the good guys. I love noir, but this one was a real disappointment.
