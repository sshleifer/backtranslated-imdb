One note of comedy, which is likely to set the teeth of modern day feminists on the edge. Department store clerk Betsy Drake in love with the idea of ​​marriage and children, pinning her hopes on the women's magazines until she spies a super-bait in the form of a sleek bachelor Cary Grant. The rest of the film lasts from one trick to another, as the tireless grappel pursuing its prey. I believe that the word "fun" only SGM to approach the role of Drake. It has a magical smile, but after 20 minutes memorizing her dentures, I began to overdose. Grant's role is basically average and minus his usual sense of smell. There is one scene, however, that it recycles almost slim exercise. Drake asks hapless Grant following his lecture to an audience give solid. Here is her provocative image is unforced freshness, which is actually very common, and that the production is not rubbed their noses in this optimistic smile for 90 minutes, the film could be made for more than a day dream girls camp, about 1948.
