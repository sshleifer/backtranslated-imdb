I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is only the worst film I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler abomination as Schecky Moskowitz, wannabe comedian, working on a cruise ship. This plot. <br /> <br /> That's the way! Nothing in the film does not make sense, it's everywhere, like breakfast mad man, not in the silly Naked gun sort of way, but more concerned with "how to throw a shoe at t.v» kind of way. even General Noriega pretends no reason I can understand (this is, of course, not for the humor). Add to the mix the Miss Australia, which has the worst Australian accent I've ever heard, and you have what I will not call the worst movie ever made, because Going overboard is not even fit into the definition of the main movie. I highly recommend this movie to see how it will raise the credibility of every bad movie you've ever seen. I guarantee the first thing you will say after watching the bad movie would be "at least it was not as bad as Going Overboard».
