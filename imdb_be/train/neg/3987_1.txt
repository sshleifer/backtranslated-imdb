I came out of the very few films before they run out, but I could not finish this piece of garbage. It was the biggest load of racism is trying to convey the legitimate film since "Birth of a Nation." The characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. I do not see how any actor would like their name associated with this film. Must have better things to do is to put out garbage like this. I know that I am and who the brain have better things to do .... like watching paint dry. I would like someone to have made a film about race relations, that considering the theme really. There is a lot more depth to the subject of small talk bitter director, Lee.
