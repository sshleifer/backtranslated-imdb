Firstly, I'm not here for a dog this film. I find it quite enjoyable, despite the poor quality of the products. Act here is about as disgusting as a monster chasing them, even though the monster is quite well done ... well done impressively in this. In fact, he looks kind of otherworldly, like a stranger landed family on vacation in the Himalayas and while Dad taking ... is the call of nature, Spot got loose, and they just did not have time to track him down. That, or he caucasian brother Wishmaster. I have not decided which. <br /> <br /> In fact, it appears to have been filmed somewhere in the snow country, yes, but more likely, Canada somewhere, than China, anywhere. Trees and prospects say to me Canada, and it is normal that the area set never takes on the appearance or feeling uber-coolness one would expect to find in the Himalayas China. This movie Sci-Fi Channel, so we can forgive the lack of space. <br /> <br /> In addition, apparently (as we have just installed) Director Sci-Fi do not travel often, because they do not know that commercial aircraft fly over the weather, like the one shown here and following the collapse of actually I would not take place. But, as I said, this is a movie Sci-Fi Channel, so we have to forgive some of the things. <br /> <br /> The film is quite graphic at times, and rotates between the "live" on the Donner Party, "Predator" of the alien in the woods, and any bad martial arts movie where they fly by wire. Yeti apparently can jump like Spiderman or ... Super Mario ... do you remember? "Run quickly! Jump higher! Live longer! Â»<br /> <br /> In addition, Yeti missed his teddy bear. He searched high and low for him, but I can not seem to do the job of a corpse. Poor Yeti! You can not help but feel sorry for him. It has been preserved and developed thousands of years obsessed with only a serious loss of a teddy bear. He missed his bear. Or maybe he wants to mate, but this idea is banished! Did you hear me? Well, it seems to be a separation of men. REBANISHED! <br /> <br /> This is a superman. Well, this is not a man ... it's super-Yeti! But then again, it's okay, Yeti? I do not know, but it does have a certain Michael Meyers quality, which is completely alarming. And he has this incredible way of cleaning his fur. Fabulous Dahlink! This is perfectly white at a time when he should not be. He disparaged superhu -... Super Yeti. <br /> <br /> In general? It was very interesting to watch, has a lot of murders and a few honest story elements. Despite the terrible gravel as the style of the production, it is actually very interesting. I can not help wondering if they plan to another? <br /> <br /> He's rate: 6.0 / 10 on M4TV scale. <br /> <br /> He's rate of 4.4 / 10 on the scale of the film ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
