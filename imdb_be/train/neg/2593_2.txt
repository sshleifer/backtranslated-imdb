American Pie Presents: Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy, without a plot and a few really smart jokes. On the other hand, it's porn, it's a little too soft rod to actually include any audience. Essentially Beta House is a collage of scenes of sex - some obscene, others simply failed attempts of humor - with a couple of fine points of the plot thrown in an effort to connectedness. Almost two-dimensional characters, the main development is based on knowledge of the Naked Mile, and "important" story scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the authors have even felt the need for stories. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I did not go into this film with no expectations. I liked the original three American Pie films, and thought the group camp and Naked Mile were solid rental. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters, and so when I saw that some of the same characters back to the hostel, I was glad to see this contribution. I know that there are plenty of scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in several forms. And I was fine with it, because in the past, these scenes were supported by history and are well integrated into the story. In the Beta House, however, it's almost as if the authors have forgotten why the formula AP in other film works. They spent too much energy working in poverty, that they forgot to actually write the story. <br /> <br /> This film is a disappointment and not even worth renting for one dollar. Lame jokes, the story is not there, and the porn aspect of the manual too, if that's all you really care about seeing.
