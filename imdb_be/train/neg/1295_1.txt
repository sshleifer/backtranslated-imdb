It is seriously one of the worst films I have ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think another film of the same director, Electric Dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to love this film - Asano terrific actor and the story was very attractive. but I could not find anything entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> film takes forever for nothing to happen. and the effects of the director used - as a constant percussion and excessive use of slow motion - just added to my growing irritation at the fact that the plot was so amazingly slow and the actors were criminally overplayed. much grief was the result of extraneous additives, which were not necessary - like an hour spent on Asano going around cutting Buddha statues and declaring as he did not worship. it adds nothing to the plot. Japanese guy movie buff and I were both constantly check the time. we could not believe that this film was so scary as it was. and the finale was awful. I thought that the director, at least, try to reward the viewer to manage to sit through it, but unfortunately I made a mistake.
