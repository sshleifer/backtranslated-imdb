This film contains a step-down from 4 to 1, not bothering with the 3rd or 2nd, gear grinding up to the juicy, b-movie finish line. Snakes in the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the film. It's worth a look. Scene from Harlow in the bath happens so quickly, you can skip it. Definitely not worth all the hype provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this bad to mediocre confusion. There's no real conflict, and all the characters in this supposed fringe of society are saints - especially the incredible character, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
