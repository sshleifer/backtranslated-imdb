this film is terrible. Symbols absolutely incredible, and wildly contradictory. The plot is terrible and some of the coolest scenes worthy to crawl and make for uncomfortable viewing. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and characterization would suggest that this film was written by high school students, only a complete lack of confidence in the school environment would suggest that, in fact, the authors probably never I went to school. Acting in the majority of cases were mild, too, although much of this was down to a bad script and the story, I'm not sure that all the actors could do this film watchable. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the sound track was okay and cinematography was good in places (though editing was bad).
