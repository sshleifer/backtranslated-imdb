First, IFC works City and country, and now this. The difference between this and this bitch Pink Panther plagiarism is that the city and the country was watchable. This is not so. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the cast signed up for it, so they could goof off in Europe in the opponent's coin. Belushi especially annoying. His scene with kendo (making Z-class Dom DeLuise) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes incompetent shepherd, and I bet the prisoners at Gitmo crack like a walnut <br /> <br /> The real "crime" (besides being green-lit) character Shepherd: mouse wife, who takes Casino Monte Carlo and a half million dollars! When you buy that, I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona you might be interested in!
