Really lousy, lousy film, but with a small amount of real humor. <br /> <br /> The character of the father, in particular, is vulgar in the extreme (intentionally so, obviously), and are reflected in the most pitiful, shabby way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this film terribly worried, with absolutely no redeeming features at all. Frankly, if I had never seen before. <br /> <br /> I believe that it is the British effort to be patient and full of unease. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoyed this film there is a possibility I did not have enough :. that joy in the reflection of the deep depravity and misery <br /> <br /> producers should be ashamed of themselves.
