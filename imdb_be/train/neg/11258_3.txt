I have already spoken about this in other reviews, no history, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, nobody will all still hell. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a keen eye for 30s art deco (which I love), and I think that the idea of ​​using all digital backdrops and such can really be the wave of the future in making the film. However, obviously, the director got so interested in digital imaging of his film, he forgot to shoot a lot of scenes that would be extremely helpful to this strangely sparse coated film. (Spoiler) to call loudly, they forgot that the villain in this case! Well they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years until the film takes place. Conran misses the point HAVING villain. As far as the action goes, well, let's see, Sky Captain (Law) is shooting a robot, two or three of the flapping wings of aircraft (to Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting them down !!!), and a pair of robots, but mostly He spends his time looking for the dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or rotten or something completely lost in this film (the reviewer who commented on it, and the absence of Lo chemistry so sure), and I for one got a little tired of seeing the repeated shots at the top of her chamber, showing it has only two SHOTS LEFT, both of which it is waste from the film, one uncomically, one pretty funny, even though I saw it coming 70 years. Nobody, except the law and Paltrow has any significant time on the screen, and this is a real drawback of the film. The audience does not identify with the robots, they need a hero to cheer for, and see despicable villain to hate. Without this and a good eye-catching story, all the CG in the world will not help.
