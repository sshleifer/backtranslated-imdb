First observed 2009/06/12 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing musical in terms of character development, in my view, from this so declared Rodgers and Hammerstein's part. There are some good songs and a decent comic image, then, the King of Siam at Yulam Brynner - but the film does not really do a good job of presenting the situation and setting. I can only blame the script and maybe some action, why we do not fully understand the character and their situation. I know that this may be a little too much to ask of a musical intended for singing and dancing, but even this part does not stand out much for me. The main plot of the upcoming Englishwoman in C, to teach the child about the upscale European things. We later learn that the King is actually the largest student. There is a side of the forbidden love affair between the wife of the last king, played by Rita Moreno (Latin and Arabic - come on !!) and former lover, which causes some problems, but nothing really fascinates added, though. Deborah Kerr as the main female character Annie - it was good, but not that convincing. King learns something because of its presence, and then the film disappears, how he does it. It really is a miserable story with some singing and dancing, but not a great experience for the audience of exactly.
