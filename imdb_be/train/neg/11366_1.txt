The first (and only) time I saw the "Shades" was during Sneakpreview. He was not even in the premiere. I remember that one of the staff directors out there, I do not remember who. It was a Belgian film, we never heard about it, so we were quite neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor, and he stands far ahead of everyone else. He plays the actor, the star has long ceased to grow. It helps to realize the film in Belgium called "Shades". <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie started, we noticed how many of the mat there. Nothing against accidental not curse. However, it was beyond annoying. Every time Rourke uses the F *** word to express what comes naturally. However, if one of the actors, nya-English speaking or using F **** S *** word, it becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost count of how many times they used the F word and S. All of them were just glad to be out of the theater. And we had to give a voice, but it was difficult for us, because it was only from 0 to 10, and we are looking for -10.
