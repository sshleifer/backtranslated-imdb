this film does not offer anything but stupid conversations possible. in fact, I probably could not imagine how senseless the movie, not as a synthetic dialogs can be up to an hour ago, but then again I've seen this video. in a film that does not depend on a powerful script, one expects to see at least a good action and delicious conversations and even a bit of humor, maybe, but this film does not miss them all. You may have heard I do not miss them all. there is no single I like about this movie, no. I hate it. I'm sure someone will do it too. designed to give the name of the target audience some thoughts on poverty and so forth, but this is not possible, even in poverty. I do not know how, but I suffered watching this thing for an hour or so, and I would definitely recommend you not to do this. the worst movie I've seen in my life. If someone offers you a look at it, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
