Dolph Lundgren stars as Templar, who comes to New York, when the key that unlocks the anti-Christ found by archaeologists, of course, the demon only a couple of miles of Dolph and killed as easily as it moves out of the body the body. (As Fallen without suspense) course Lundgren is his element, and the film is completely unwatchable. I admit that a supporter Dolph Lundgren, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his movies whenever they are on TV. I caught mignon and boy was I ever disappointed. This film is absolutely terrible. With a sequence of actions so poorly organized and poorly edited, you can only make coherent sense in fighting arena. Worst of all is woefully inconclusive perforation Lundgren as a tough guy, a priest (!) All of this is even worse, the film with such a rip off of the Fallen (which was good) and End Of Days (which was bad, but better than that) in general, this movie is the worst movie I saw with Dolph Lundgren. He literally has nothing to recommend it. It's terrible, and it is the lowest point in his career in Lundgren. And I saw, Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and the Masters of the Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * From 4- (terrible)
