I borrowed this movie, because it is not only because of its gay theme, but the idea of ​​the role played by very intrigued me. I was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in San Francisco, since I live near San Francisco. And, of course, it was nice to see photos Castro district (although I really Castro serves more gay men than women). But other than that I can not recommend this film. The characters do not really designed for me to take care of, and when they finally started getting into "role-playing" I'm bored out of my mind. And the role played by the scene that I saw was a little embarrassing to watch. Action is poor. Needless to say, I have not finished the film. I would skip it.
