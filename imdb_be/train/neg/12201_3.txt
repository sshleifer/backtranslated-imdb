Summary largely sums it all up. It is not nearly as good as the original. With a script co-authored both Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time, he also wrote Aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron and political aspects were written by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was in the best condition physically, how he does it and Rocky 4, and it looks in good shape or goat eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo begins in prison and visited Colonel Trautman, who asks him to go on a special mission, which could earn him a presidential pardon. In the end, he agrees and goes to camp briefings run by Charles Napier, playing in Washington's suit is trying to impersonate the former former power to soothe Rambo. <br /> <br /> Mission to find out whether the missing prisoners of war are still alive in Vietnam camps. Rambo was chosen as the camp he has been tested somewhere before he was a prisoner himself. He said that this is not a mission of salvation, and it is there only to take reconnaissance photos. <br /> <br /> After an unsuccessful attempt to jump with a parachute from an airplane, he loses most of his set, he meets a contact (which turns out to be a nice woman) and travels down the river pirates in the camp. <br /> <br /> It is still prisoners, and save one. 3 run from half the Vietnamese army in their river boat they betray pirates, but Rambo kill them all, and they have to lead to a pick-up point on their feet after their boat rammed and blasted Rambo almost on board. <br /> <br /> Rambo given over and abandoned, like Napier ordered a review of rescue helicopter. It's unclear how Troutman returns to base to scold him that no survivors were not to be found. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff turns up as Russian Spetznatz Colonel Rambo and tortured and eventually escapes only to be prosecuted more Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. The killing of many of them, Rambo finally steals the chopper and save most of the prisoners to return to their base. <br /> <br /> He resisted the urge to kill Napier to abandon him, but destroys the Ops Center. <br /> <br /> weak plot and a very weak ending, like Rambo goes into the sunset as a free man.
