30 seconds in the opening credits, I had a feeling that it would be a bad film, but I do not know how bad. Then the actor plays the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decided that in order to survive this film, we have to decrease the volume, make our own dialogue and double speed on DVD. But it did not help. About half way through, we excluded it. Now that I've gone through some very bad movies before, both with and without an assistant «Mystery Science Theater 3000" and «Svengoolie», but there are just some movies that I doubt that even the Boots can save. The biggest part of the film that bothers me the most was that people hypnotized, believing that they were rotting zombie green skin. I believe that they all have been hypnotized into death and then mesmerized decay itself. Stick to the real B-movie cult classics as "Plan Nine from Outer Space."
