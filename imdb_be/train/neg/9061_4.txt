What can you say about this movie? It's not terrible, but it was not good! Two days ago, I watched Lillies and it was one of the best gay films I've ever seen. So it was not the best time to view the Gay mediocre film. <br /> <br /> The story was stupid and acting was OK. It was not so bad to be deleted, but it was bad moments, and some scary stereotypes. It was not very well matched either. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film? No, you will be wasting your time and money. I do not understand why these films as they are made, and who is funding them. Spend your time looking at Noah's logo instead. I think that's where this movie is trying to go, but did not get there.
