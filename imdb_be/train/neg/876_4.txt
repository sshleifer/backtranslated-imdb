Up until the last 20 minutes, I thought it was probably the worst film of Jackie Chan (except for his 1978 work, which I am not familiar with). Final battle sequence, everything changed: it has long and well and intensively - in fact, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of "comedy" that can please the five-year (oh, look! Someone threw a tomato in the face of this guy), and endless "football" scene. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line "How can I turn it off This is not a pipe?" - to look to find out what it refers to). «Dragon Lord» is the rent for only one last fight, but the rest of the movie is only for collectors Jackie, and even then, only for those who have already seen, at least 15 of his other films.
