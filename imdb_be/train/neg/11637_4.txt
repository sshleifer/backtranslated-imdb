Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create an adaptation of the game, which is at least somewhat true for games; it turned into a game full of anti-social and offensive content in a movie full of anti-social and offensive content. Thus, an adaptation, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll, we are dealing with here, so do not expect that the film will actually be any good. while he has this moment, "Postal" wears out his welcome and very quickly becomes a pain to sit. <br /> <br /> At its core, the postal satire on the United States, as was done in the twelve year old child. Ball seems to think that the stench is linearly proportional to the value of comedy: more offensive, funnier and funnier the more exaggerated. This results in a film that sets new levels of bad taste being highly ranked. So, some of the jokes work, but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director makes fun of himself and the people, to hit very hard on trucks and other vehicles. Low point include..well almost everything else. <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise wears off, the mail is simply boring to watch. Yes, there is a good laugh and a good time every ten minutes, but the rest consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other around for what seems like an eternity. <br /> <br /> This is probably working as a short film, but it just is not enough content to something that lasts longer than 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). There are good ideas and good attempts, but they get hopelessly lost in the endless and pointless scenes and content that is offensive for the sake of it 4/10
