They sell it as a horror film, it has to be a thriller, but I found it quite amusing (comedy? Yeah I do not think), I laughed the whole movie, I think it was because of the ridiculous action and plot. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but the approach I think Cillian very good "bad guy" I loved his acting in Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. Wow! she was beautiful, and a good actress as well, but let's try a few goals here, the story line ... mm mm mm mm ... it lacks a lot of great suspense in fact it is really sad movie, but there is one good thing tho, this short film, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (for me it was like 10 minutes under water !!!) <br /> <br /> I just do not know why this film is rated so high and rotten tomatoes, even above, what happened to the good, rational and objective criticism?
