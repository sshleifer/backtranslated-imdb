Horror movies can be great fun with a low budget, bad acting and a little panache. I think the movie is just not enough panache because one thuddingly dull scenes other people do ridiculously harmless grapple claw hands in the air. If it was not so boring, it can be fun. <br /> <br /> The horror film can go a long way with a tired concept as "college kids in a haunted house," in much the same way the evil dead movie was a lot of fun with a similar standard storyline. Hallow's End, unfortunately, does not go a long way. In fact, it does not go anywhere. He spends most of his hours of setting up the faceless and anonymous characters that seem like endless interpersonal dramas. I have nothing against the development of the character, not even a horror movie, but it's strictly one-dimensional characters (alpha male, so shy, and ... um ... disposable characters that exist mainly for the sex scenes.) The costs forty-plus bloodless, noisy minutes with them was more terrible than when the bloodshed began. <br /> <br /> Well, you see the bloodshed in either case. When college kids turn into what they wear, how they haunted house (one vampire, one is O.R. scrubs and some white pancake), they look pretty much as they did in their amateur haunted house suits; Dead Hate The Living, using a similar theme, it is a masterpiece in comparison. There is not really any gusset say, and there is no real deterrent. <br /> <br /> I thought about it, almost every one of approach. When he was supposed to be tight, disturbing horror movie (which might explain why it all went so slowly), the pathetic scenes of sex and cheap monsters cancel it. When he was supposed to be a real blood and guts horror film (that would explain schlock) ... where blood and guts? And this is one of anticlimax uninteresting endings in a movie I have ever seen. This is the kind of movie that, although he does not have a narrator through the film is bookended on the voice-over, because all the mindless dialogue simply was not enough. <br /> <br /> It was a tough one ... comes out of it, I wonder if I just sat through a Christian horror film. Maybe, "I know that hell exists" opening does not mean it that way, but there are some hints (or misdirection-- I'm not sure which). For all the profanity in the film, a line like "gosh-darnitÂ» off a bit absurd, and so does the majority of the crucifixion of worship, God-fearing, and Satan-fearing, especially after some T & A depraved sex scenes (one straight, one gay ). <br /> <br /> If this is a Christian company (Highland Myst logo even has a bit of the crucifixion of similarity), then this film weighs heavily for the atheist camp. Omnipotent being can not be this bad director. <br /> <br />
