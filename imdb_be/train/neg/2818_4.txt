Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit her hypocritical, bible quotes archaeologist father (William Finley) and attracts the attention of a group of sectarians headed by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays de Sade in retrospect, holding forth in his cell. Genie is interested Muhammad (Juliana Merr), who rides naked on the horse and Sabina (Alon Kamhi), Bisexual, who introduces her to opium smoking, which leads to wild hallucinations involving topless harem dancers, woman simulating oral sex on a snake, orgies and her father I preached in the background! At the same time, the black hoods sect decapitate, squeeze eyeballs and throat cut. If Genie puts drugs in their tea, it is de Sade hang from the cross, a gold-painted woman in a green g-string and very bloody on a bed, covered with snakes. This is because she is the reincarnation of the lost love Sade. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, it is put into production, Harry Alan Towers is redundant, shabby and rather pointless, but the sets, costumes, cinematography and workplace everything is fine and at least there's always something going on <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 3 of 10
