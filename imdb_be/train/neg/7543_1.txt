Wagoner on the side of the road, making sure that the speed limitation obeys every1 (does its job); then he pulls a woman who is a mother she is (there is a child in the back seat); then he tells her that it is not, and bam ... they killed. Well, this is the beginning of what I personally thought it would be a good movie. When I watched this movie in the theater, I was with friends. It was our first night after the summer, so we wanted to go and watch a good movie. We all decided to see a suspense / thriller, which looked good for everyone in the group ... it was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Not only that, I wasted $ 7.oo for a ticket to a movie, but I had to sit through a torture for the brain. The film began with mystery and the unknown, and I seriously thought that "it can not be bad" ... I was so wrong. The whole problem with this film, it does not make sense; even if you can get passed the bad acting, the "not so scary" plot, and over all a terrible mess of this film was, you will still be puzzled. It's not because you're not smart enough to figure it out, it's because the person with the brain can not understand that this is a stupid movie about. Right now you may be thinking, "Oh man! I have to watch this movie to see if it's as bad as this man says it. "Get that idea out of your head right now !!! I am trying to save you from watching this film, saying that it was so bad, there is no point even considering seeing it. please, people do not make the same mistake I did, believing that this film has the potential ... it's not. I give this movie 1 of 10 (if I could give a zero, I would have), and I do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie, you'll save yourself a lot of sleepless nights, trying to think of that before wtf lbanny film about.
