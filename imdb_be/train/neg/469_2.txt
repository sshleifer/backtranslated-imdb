Mad Magazine can be a lot of crazy people working on it ... but obviously someone out there was some sort of common sense, if the powers that be to give this waste of celluloid ... editing is El specks, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid ... and the only reason it gets two out of ten, that Stacey Nelkin removes some of her clothing, and we get a good chest shot ... I never thought that I would feel sorry for Ralph Macchio decide to be in this business, but I ... I really feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted ak Jorah, which should never be mentioned in this part of the film ... ... at least, Mr. Leibman had the cajones to abandon its name placed anywhere on the movie ... and he goes ahead ... there in fact, a copy of this thing from the beginning Mad sequence is still on it ... if you can find one, grab it because it is probably worth something ... the only thing in this movie that is worth something. .. and a note to the people in IMDb.com ... there is no way to spoil the movie for anyone ... manufacturers have spoiled themselves ...
