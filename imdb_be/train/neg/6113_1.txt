I screamed my head, because I saw this film was my first film would experience ever in any 13 months. I remember it being an incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I watched it again on television a few years ago. Big mistake - wooden acting, the plot does not exist, and the film lacks merit, when 23-year-old T & A is not what gets you going ... 0 / ****
