I really have no clue as to why some people find the Power Rangers television show even remotely interesting at all. Costumes completely ridiculous and the people who play them also look completely stupid at the same time. There is absolutely nothing remotely interesting about Power Rangers. It's just more expensive television advertising designed to sell exceptionally cheesy plastic garbage unsuspecting children throughout the world. From the notes, I see that it was banned in the country of New Zealand, and from what I've seen, I can agree with their decision. Avoid this at all costs the show, it's horrible and ridiculous.
