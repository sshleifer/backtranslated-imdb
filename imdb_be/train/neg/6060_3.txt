There is this girl, and she works in the forest, but it ends up in the hospital the woman, and she wants to have an abortion. Her dad comes into the van, and he was angry about it. The entire episode takes place inside and outside of abortion clinics. I'm really not a choice, but I would like the choice to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw that the baby came out and went into the corner. The part where they did an ultra sound was pretty funny too. I really felt sorry for the poor dad in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter, and I could not blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him at the end, or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I just laughed too hard, and I would suggest watching "Take me" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode, but it was not so great.
