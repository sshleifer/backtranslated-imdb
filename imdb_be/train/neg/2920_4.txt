Wow! I am shocked to learn that it is a small world, and that we are all interconnected. Which is a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunn put it much better in the same sentence. "No man is an island." Act was not bad. Children were given they had it, but sometimes the thread got so thin, I could not follow him, and the only real "hero" of the film comes to an end in prison after being tortured maid meter. I do not know. I just do not understand. Oh, well.
