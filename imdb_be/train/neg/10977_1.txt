I live in Ottawa, where the film was made, and I really wish it was not. This one God awful movie. I really try and maintain independent films, but there is a stigma on indie and stigma: Indie Films Blow. Well, this film does nothing to shed the curse. Actor, writer, director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre, and it is again a hash of tired cliches from the past movies. I'm really tired of the terrible evil looking characters who are hiding in the shadows and prey on unsuspecting, it's too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I remember one scene in particular, the right at the end of Flick, where the entire scene is illuminated by car headlights. Now some may say that it was the effect is used to set the mood and tension, but, unfortunately, it was to demonstrate lace budget of the film. As a film that dares to call itself the horror, the viewer will find something hard to find any actual gore, except for a few scenes from the corn syrup and red food coloring. <br /> <br /> The most important thing that carries this film down is the stimulation and lack of character development, the main story is that the children are abducted and parents should find this guy chiropractor before a certain time in order to get their children ago. Not that this bugs me the concept, but I do not find it plausible that, when the two main characters, both of which have lost children can find time to make out with each other. This is done in such a short time that it is unthinkable, my first priority would be to get my daughter back, and at least find out the house before you make it. <br /> <br /> The last moment that I have .... and I will not hold it against Kelly, but the film is shot entirely on a dull, heartless video and what is actually happening from any tense moments, would merely exuded style on film. Although, if the film has received a million dollars and makeup redone and sad story of action and all the lame could not keep the film afloat. My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel, which has been reported on its website, in the future, that was half written in one sitting. <br /> <br /> The Lord will help us.
