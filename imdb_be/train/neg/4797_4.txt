After the mafia boss Vic Moretti (the late great Franchoza) kills his partner, who cheated on him with Derek, their new driver / Vietnam vet, and accuses him of his side, Derek finds himself in prison, where he has to fight the corrupt overseers concluded Vic's brother, who escapes from prison, and, oh yeah unlawful experiments conducted by a shady CIA agent (a large genre of support and first time director John Saxon), to include a variety of prisoners in super-invincible zombie people. Of course things get out of hand, and it's up to Derek and the rest of the constant prisoners to save the day after being infected to take over the prison. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a great talented actor and as a director of Saxon is great ... a talented actor. To say that this film (the only directorial output Johns today) lacks some visual sense of smell is a little understatement. However, the film is not entirely unfounded. Dialogue, while stupidity, just bad enough to be humorous time. Unfortunately, this is not really enough for a film on the coast from the fact that he himself, and it takes forever for the film to even begin to come into his own (which is quite late in the film). Thus, the most I can recommend this film to say that if you're a fan of Saxon (which I really am), it's worth a look, just go with low expectations and you should be OK. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tanya McClure get topless <br /> <br /> My class: D +
