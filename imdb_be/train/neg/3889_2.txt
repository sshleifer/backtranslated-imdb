I've always wanted to see it, because I love horror movies and cheese with a name like that, I was sure that «The Incredible Melting Man» will be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was not. I mean, the action was exciting bad, the script contains some of the classic lines and bad special effects look like someone sneezes around the lead actor, so I had to love him. Unfortunately, it really draggy between these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the film, making your tax return. Here's how sad this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you like bad movies that you will enjoy dramatic exit Nurse fat, and stellar acting guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to the poor, he has to deliver some surprisingly inept line with a straight face - like a conversation he had with his wife on stalking IM Man: <br /> <br /> "I'll find it with a Geiger counter," "Is. he RadioActive? »« just a little. »<br /> <br /> So, the story is Dr. Ted wandered trying to find a heavy-duty zombie killing machine, armed only with what looks like a mini-Dyson. he is a brave man. Unfortunately, , his plan fails, when he finds a lot of great Goop on the tree, "Oh, my God, -. it was his ear," says Dr. Ted audience I'm so glad!. he cleared that, yes. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm doing this film sounds pretty funny. It would be, if a length of only 10 minutes, but unfortunately, it goes on and on, and The Incredible Melting Man just hanging out of a sticky mess when he should have more people in my opinion. I think if you really impressed you will probably like it, just does not pop tarts in the film, because the lead actor does remind one closer to end.
