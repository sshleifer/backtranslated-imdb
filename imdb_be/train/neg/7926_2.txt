The original operation in a classic, though it is far from pleasant at almost any level for some of the guys that make the cat eat the flesh in human monsters, because the cat food they do is done with people redone with the addition of SciFi elements. Cats can not get enough and when the flesh spoiled food will end cat play their respective owners. Bad together on almost every level, this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material, which is used to actually play theater in the early 1970s, updated with alien races for dogs and cats, who are fighting for supremacy. Director Ted Mikel hack, but it's so sweet person (I do love the guy because of his smile, induce interviews and commentary tracks), you can pretty much forgive the garbage he succeeded mostly. Mikels wanted to make films, and he's not all the same as they were for as long as he has something to produce. More power to him, but I wish he does not put us to their home video
