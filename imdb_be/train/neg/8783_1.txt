I do not think I ever was so amazed at the sheer absurdity of the film in all my life as I was when I came out of this piece of shit. Nothing in it is useless. none of them are intelligent well thought out. due to lack of really stressful time, they repeatedly use the common excuse trick, where you build the music before the character does something like open the door or push back the curtain, and then nothing exists. Now the OK, time to make one, maybe, but I counted three times. there are things thrown in for no apparent reason, the characters, storylines half-formed characters .... they were not well developed at all. end was .. bad. bad, bad, bad, all, each component of this horror film. and I'm here to warn you all.
