I did not destroy, when I tell you that you will get to see a woman having sex with a goat in this film. If this is your thing, then your film came. <br /> <br /> The woman and her husband go to see her mother, who lives his sister in a family house in the woods. Her sister is a terrible lady, to put it mildly, and she seems to have interests that go beyond the scope of family love. On the side of the artist pushes the characters appears and starts making all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> sketches rather weak and characters pretty stupid. Woman sticks around even after her husband begins to turn in the snatch and hang out with pagans, even continuing to have sex with him. On the exploitative side of things, there are many bared body and a pair of curly sleeves, but nothing that would not be better somewhere else. Oh, and the aforementioned goat sex scene. <br /> <br /> The majority of viewers will not make it to the end. Operation of the fans will ride on it, but will be wanting more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
