I've seen this movie several times in various short film festivals, and it always gives me the impression that I had seen a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> For the film school is very well prepared and focused, but the story ... well, it is necessary to something else, and to be more interesting film. A character named Tim Watcher need some in-department approach. This is what is lacking in some of Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial <br /> <br /> But still ... I loved this movie ... <br /> <br /> parabens.! (Congratulations!)
