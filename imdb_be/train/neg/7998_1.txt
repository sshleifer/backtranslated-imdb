Not only that, he always annoying to listen to, but he did not joking. I swear, some fobby Asian guy told Yo Momma jokes would've been funnier than shit Leary. (Well, maybe funny for a few minutes, but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once) Leary claimed that he had stopped taking the drug, during one of his "jokes" ... apparently, he It was still high on something; He was just some Crackhead imprecating rants related mainly drugs. One of his jokes was something like: "I would not use the crack, especially with the same name as that between my ass" - about people, how did he come up with that one I swear, the only guy who has to close F *?! * K up Denis Leary. Thank God I did not have to see it live. This guy totally sucks. <br /> <br /> If you are easily amused oath, and "a joke", where you can come up with yourself, then spend your time with this junk.
