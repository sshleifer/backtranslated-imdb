I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of his films, so when I saw the report for $ 5.50 at Walmart, I bought it. Although mildly amusing, the film never really hits its stride. Some scenes, such as a member of the bar scene just takes too long and does not really make any sense. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, there is an instructive scene late in the film, which gives the whole movie a bad taste, as far as I'm concerned. I do not think that this scene is added to the movie at all. I do not like stupid comedies, trying to teach me a lesson, written some 60 burn especially! <br /> <br /> In the end, though, I am pleased to have another movie Hawn, I'm not sure it's really worth the money I paid for it!
