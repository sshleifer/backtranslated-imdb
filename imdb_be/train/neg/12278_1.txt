When watching this show, you're not quite sure if this is a story or action that is more irritable. First of all, the plot of each episode is very predictable, the authors had to use every possible cliche you can imagine, not only the general plot, but the location of the scene, as well as the lines of each character, which makes this show a collage of each series of police there. On top of all this comes the "message" show that good is good and bad is bad, and that in the end good prevails and that we should love one another, be the best person and the best citizens, all this is done in the most ostentatious manner. Actors as vehicles of this message and nothing more, will use a limited set of acting: "I byt_nast good support people" smile, interested gaze and "our victory" of the body posture, while the bad guys are, "I'm bad" frowning, "you got me" look, accompanied by "I will not do, and I have to be removed from society," the head banding (this kind also sum up the overall development of each show). True story or not, show garbage, another proof of the fact that manufacturers do not give a s ** t about the audience that we all thought idiots. Well, this series makes all possible attempts idiotize living brains of you.
