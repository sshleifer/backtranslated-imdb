The essence of the original novel Wolf - actually points throughout history - is that things happen because of carefully calculated sense of expediency. The goal is to survive within a certain type of lifestyle. The novel is full of anger. The only connection that sounds emotionally truth is that between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and it just touched. That aside, everything to ensure that it can get publicity, power, money or self aggrandizement. <br /> <br /> Wolf has been criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of New York over his head, his response was a refusal. In the end, he lived in New York, and belonged to the improvement of the local committee and other prominent organizations, like qualifications, if you want in your resume, to deny that he did not like a New Yorker. (Wolfe holds a doctorate in American Studies from Yale University and not a dummy.) These alleged weakness, which made an unforgettable novel. No one was not good. And Sherman McCoy wound up stranded, professional protester social justice. The film throws all that away and imposes a moral frame to the story that just does not fit. Wolf did his homework. The novel is rooted in reality. Each event was not only possible, but also thoroughly believable. Wolfe could make a big cultural anthropologist - he knows how to get inside the system and record its details <br /> <br /> So, any one of us could find ourselves, and Sherman and his mistress to do, stuck in. South Bronx, faces a pair of black children, and make the rest after bumping into one of them. This scene is transferred accurately from print to celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after this scene, the film does not seem to trust his audience, and sometimes become rabid in its attempt to register his message, but the message appears hazy. <br /> <br /> Sherman could accidentally hit some child and arrest him, as he is in the novel, but it is not immediately after his release from prison to return to his phenomenally expensive apartment, takes out a shotgun and start shooting at the ceiling of them, as he does in movee. In what should be a fun scene, ceiling plaster falls more party guests, and they are carried away, screaming. It simply would not have happened. The film left indescribably detailed reality of the novel in the dust. touchiness Wolfe, the work that he put in capturing the real, has been lost. What we get instead of a noisy, fantastic and silly scenes, which is nothing but wake the audience up to do. Similar scenes empty stands, shouting for the credibility of Wolfe. <br /> <br /> The film is also not because it pushes a lot of sin and redemption in the fascinating history of moral nihilism. Here we see, "Don Juan in Hell" at the opera. We get lectures on getting rid of the poet with AIDs. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. Black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of these final speeches about how we all have to start well yourself again. Reporter which sympathizes Sherman after converting it into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending, in which Sherman astray, violating the law with an idiotic smile. The scene sits on a film as a clown hat on the head of a circus elephant. <br /> <br /> The film does not only point that has already banal and unoriginal, it exaggerates them, as if the audience had not been able to absorb all the subtleties. <br /> <br /> This is not acting or direction of, the poor. The film is not bad in this relationship. And the photos are very good, including two rather spectacular shots - Gargoyle building and Chrysler Concorde landing. This script, which completely failed. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film, roughly speaking, is good in concept and execution. It retains some of the fine details of the novel. Sherman and Judy the dog by the name of Marshall. Who the hell would name a dog Marshall? She loses focus almost entirely in the second half and in general hardly worth watching. <br /> <br /> cynical cattle right wingism Wolfe may be offensive to many people, but he has cojones to lay percepts. Unfortunately, writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of New Yorkers.
