If you do not cause a student film that has yet to see that this film will not only be a waste of time and money, and a huge disappointment, but it will also make you angry beyond belief. <br /> <br /> There may be a story worth talking somewhere inside but Hopkins decided to hide and encode as a continuous disordered layers, apparently random audio video micro-incision, making the viewer's patience run thin after a very short time. <br /> <br /> Why would someone like Hopkins choose a heavy, very complex and very unstable project as his first screenplay, the first tab and the third film can be anyones assumptions. Maybe he played with it in his mind for such a long time, until it was unrecognizable, he became, not even for myself. As a result, it turns out that it is not enough experience or skills to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even Veyrdest Carpenter and Lynch's films, to name just two uncoventional filmmakers, 90% more consistency, 95% fewer characters, and 99% more than the story flow. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony you are aiming for the stars, but unfortunately, he missed a couple of light-years. Please follow the steps in this department you beautiful giant and one should not ask for more from you, not even yourself!
