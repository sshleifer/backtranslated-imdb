You would think (as I do) that Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese, the film should be at least decent. . These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) produced some of the funniest comedies of works of all time <br /> <br /> Well, perhaps, I was grossly mistaken - this alone is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It boggles my mind as one joke after another may be so deeply unfunny. It hurts me to see these talented actors perform one of the most positive lame scripts that I had the misfortune to meet. Based solely on the big names, I still hope for a long time after the duration of the film, but he consistently failed to provide any entertainment at all. <br /> <br /> Usually, both the film and in life, I try to stay away from the biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this film, it's hard not to let out. I can count on the fingers of one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, major Hollywood productions, which left me more bitter than that. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to use this --- I really did. But Out-newcomers ultimately fails miserably. If you really want an effective time entertainment, just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush the toilet. But please, do not watch this movie.
