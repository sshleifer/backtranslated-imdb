I fully agree with some of the other critics of this film. I found it to be incredibly stupid (in the best case) and simply misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst). Like others, I found this film to be a horrible mix of "real" science and pseudo-scientific, New Age propaganda. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, I was particularly offended by Candace contributions in PERT. However, I was not a fan of her for this film, but its arguments about "consciousness" of cells was one of the best examples of the adoption of the term ( "consciousness"), which has a predictable value for most people, and to use it in such a distorted view, to cause it is not clear and not an update. This is an old Orwellian mind as ** k that the master himself has described so well in his highest article "Politics and the English Language." In order to address the "consciousness" in this way - in fact, refer to this film as "founded science "as a whole (that is its exact intent) - a use of language in the same way, which is used by Stalin when he called it a slave state" democratic republic "and Hitler, when he called his party" socialist workers' movement . <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that to really understand kVA tavuyu physics. I know enough about it to know that in fact understand that it will take considerable research. Ah, but we Americans do love "instant enlightenment", and that is that the error of the film is trying to achieve. If you ask questions it would be one thing, but he is clearly trying to ask and answer them, that no film could not do simply because we are far, far from the answer (if they really exist). <br /> <br /> By the way, from an ethical point of view, the film needs a disclaimer to combine several "expert commentator" with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM), to say nothing of JZ Knight, who often speaks to her "Ramtha" voice. (I always wonder is channeled grasp of 10,000-year-old Atlanta Superman concepts of the 21st century and terminology. But then again, this film proves that the past, present and future, all the same, so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years therefore, I believe it could exist today and tomorrow. only, how his financial advice was so incredibly bad for his followers? Oh, I forgot, I'm the creator of "good" and "bad" advice, so it's all my wine, not Ramtha.) <br /> <br /> What a mess.
