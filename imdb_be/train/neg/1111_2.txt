Closing song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this film. Unfortunately, that's all the positive I can say about this Western. I have to write another 8 lines for my comments to be posted, but there is more than 8 lines badly in this western. I'm not sure if the film was a tribute Hop Along, or just a parody. The hero and the villain in this film was too plastic. It is not realistic at all. Many support the actors in this film look real, but the shooting scene was a joke. Previous commentator thought this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap shot at President Bush. It was not a Democratic or Republican western. It was just a bad western movie will be sold on a commercial basis. Interestingly, when he made any money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie, make a movie by college students. If this were so, it was a great movie.
