I used to be the name of Wesley Snipes as the key, so go ahead and watch the new film The prisoner, in which he is. So now, for the first time, my Snipes method movie recommendations failed. Through. I had first come here to see these reviews. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed to allow his otherwise careful effort to be so wasted "the Contractor". <br /> <br /> One of my worst fears Flick came to a bitter fruiting. I was afraid that shaky, blurry, pseudo-documentary, "ill-conceived" directing and editing style (first brought to my attention by Paul Greengrass, director of "Bloody Sunday") may be distributed to other movies. disgusting style Greengass' then brought to a sickening new heights in the last two of the trilogy of Bourne films. My fears were justified. In my opinion, these films are made very bad motion sickness induced by these methods, the error blurry swipes for "action-improvement." But «Bourne Franchise" as Greengrass so loving calls his cash cow, apparently, to convince others in Hollywood to go unprofessional looking for fast, big money. <br /> <br /> Read my lips, you Hollywood types. Actions should be clearly photographed and presented not only hint at the poor, lazy cinematic technique. <br /> <br /> A "Contractor" goes so far as to imitate the "Bourne Ultimatum" in the parrot sound bites, hoping their minor (apparently appreciated) the audience can not feel them. For example, when I hear the police radio crackled «Yankee-Romeo» again, I just cry. Chances are good, I will not hear it again, of course, I'll never see the "Contractor" again <br /> <br /> I recommend to those who have yet to see "the Contractor" :. Only to meet this lack of rest allows itself in your life <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. I would like to reduce that to 1.
