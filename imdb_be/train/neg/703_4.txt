College students are clearing a convicted person dorm, which pursue the elusive killer. <br /> <br /> dormitory This dripping (aka Pranks) is slightly mixed bag shredder fans. Film production values ​​are quite low, and the story for the most part fairly routine, there is even a terrible ass hanging around a red herring. In fact, most of the build-up of a pretty forgettable story, except for one or two brutal murders. But the film has really made it better surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric environment) and one a bold, unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> cast dim for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot, as he does a very good turn in the character. Also pay attention to young Zuniga as the unfortunate student. <br /> <br /> For all this effort is quite standard B slasher, but the final worth savoring and for this audience saved the film from being a complete ho-hum. <br /> <br /> ** to ****
