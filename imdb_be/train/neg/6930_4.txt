Dr. Tarr Torture Dungeon about a journalist who travels to a mental hospital to write about a new technique they use with their patients. Nevertheless, the journalist soon learns that things are not what they seem, and the shelter is currently administered to patients and physicians in the cells. First of all, some parts of the movie are just bored and just want to sleep, and interesting details interesting for all the wrong reasons (A guy who thinks he's a chicken, for example). I must admit that the story is actually quite good, but the film itself is a bomb. Music of the film is really strange and somehow you would have heard in some mad comedy, and so, there is a scene involving dancing chicken men, which are largely made me want to avoid screen. Watch this movie on your own risk! <br /> <br /> Evaluation: R for violence and nudity.
