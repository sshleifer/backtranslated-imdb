I believe that the "Shooter" was not quite as god-awful as most films that «Mystery Science Theater 3000" shows, westerns but simply forte Roger Corman. Drawing Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) becomes a sheriff in the Old West town after her husband gets killed by the sheriff, and to fight the villains of the film is very predictable. John Ireland new hubby Rose secretly working unctuous Allison Hayes (so 50-foot female). Also being briefly often Corman roles postman Dick Miller (Miller currently stars in the film by Joe Dante). <br /> <br /> I really want to say that you probably want to see «MST3K» version to really enjoy this film. They had a great time with him.
