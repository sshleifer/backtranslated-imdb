As a veteran of the Army, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it is a shame for those who participated in the war in Vietnam. To say that real soldiers SF I knew, I was outraged that shit is an understatement. If the film has been presented as a satire or even a cartoon (it was), it would be better received. But it was taken seriously a lot of people, especially abroad. Silly as it sounds, no matter where I went to Europe in the late 80's man seemed to judge me, and Americans in general this film. Unreal? Hmm, let's see. Terse, muscular nerd drawn to prison labor brigade, to go on a secret mission to Southeast Asia to liberate American POWs. In the running battle he killed 500 enemy soldiers with a machine gun M-60, which never runs out of ammo and never overheats. And he never misses, is working with 32lb gun held by one hand. I could go on, but I'm getting a headache. I gave it 2/10 only because it is a bit better than Rambo III.
