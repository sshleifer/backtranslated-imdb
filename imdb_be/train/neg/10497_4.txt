So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into the river, which is clearly filled with crocodiles, snakes, lizards, t feed the reptiles of the above, and dirt, not only daily, but with enthusiasm. He was never able to make me want to do it, but he was able to make his wife close <br /> <br /> This film is not included in my parallel universe of the film categories -. Movies for people who have just had their teeth drilled, have migraines, have no experience in the film and, therefore, as a quiet mediocrity (now well settled Disney films). It's too noisy. Well, Steve is too noisy. He's just happy all the time, and will cut straight through the supersaturated "teenager (I can hear it now:" this movie was so dumb ") or Tylenol with codeine. I would say that his enthusiasm is catching up, but if it were me, I would have your own room full of snakes, and that still has not happened. I agree, they are handsome, but I'm still not going to pat them. <br /> <br /> The plot really predictable. The bad guys are so bad, for a minute there, I thought I was shopping in the electronic hypermarket consumers. But the film was filled with animals, and Steve and Terry, so I watched it. This site (if you can call it that) was really more of a reason to take one more step in the truck. My expectations were low, and stayed that way. <br /> <br /> I had hoped, however, that it would be a bit over where Steve and Terri (having worked on their acting) is a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still can not believe that we will not see more than Steve. I hope that Terry and children continue to participate in the Australia Zoo and Discovery Channel, at least. I can not imagine seeing the crocodile, without any member of the family Irwin told me strength, how cool that there is a crocodile. Crikey!
