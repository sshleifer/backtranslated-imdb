This film should be held in the Seattle area. Why shown Porteau Cove P-O-P-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Park? Provincial parks in Canada, not the United States. The inspector uses the Palm Pilot complete with a stylus to "read" that someone hacked into the computer in the bridal shop. I did not know that was possible with the help of a database device. Woman appears in the film, without any introductions, and never imposed. We learn from halfway into the film, that the woman works in the office of the district attorney. Then, in a correctional center guard actually preceded Jenks through the door and keeps it back to the offender !! This would never happen in real prisons. The director is really messed up on this one - it does not happen in real life. Action is adequate. Land is good. Cinematography is good. Nevertheless, many of the errors found in the continuity of the lead to 3 out of 10 votes.
