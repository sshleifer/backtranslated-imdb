I can not say that this is the worst movie ever made, but personally I think about it that way, because when it was originally released in theaters, (1) the source noise was pretty sure my friend insisted we see it and we actually waited in line to get tickets, and (2) it is still only "serious" film, I remember where the audience began to chuckle at some point, and basically laughed at the film the rest of the way to the end. Once we got to the infamous (and endless) kite fights, I think everyone gave up. <br /> <br /> Common positive I can recognize it's a great shooting position. Oh, and there is also a breast B, although its actions are so wooden that was already unerotic and does not assess much more than the iconic Playboy. <br /> <br /> «dramatic» in this film between fact the terrible and horrible acts direction her husband. Snake fight should be one of the most incompetent "action" sequences ever filmed. Nevertheless, this is one of those movies that's bad enough, it may be worthwhile to look at the level of unintentional humor. Definitely the worst film I've ever paid to see.
