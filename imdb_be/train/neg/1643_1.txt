"Whipped" is one of the worst films of all time. This mean, hateful piece of garbage that I force myself to stay in the theater more than any other film in 2000, in addition, may be "The Grinch." It is not, as people call it, insightful portrait of modern relationships. That would be a little film called «High Fidelity». While this film was an honest and responsive, "Whipped" hostile, cynical, misanthropic cinematic poison. To avoid this, as well as many ulcers, if you do not want to see how really bad "comedy" can get.
