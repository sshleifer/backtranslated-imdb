children have created a bunch of theater to be all night horror movie marathon. However, as the night comes, there is one of them kills them one by one. Who is this ... and why? I saw it in the theater back in 1991. I'm looking forward to it - but boy! It does not work. The premise is good, they have a very attractive young cast and some of the pros as Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it does not work. History ceases to be meaningful halfway (this may be due to some huge editing before the film was released), relatively bloodless murder (as it got R rating for me) and the opening of the killer in the end was sad. and stupid <br /> <br /> This is really too bad - the film had potential. With the best scenario, this could be a great horror film. As it stands, though it is mostly forgotten and cast himself he seems confused him (I've heard, the stone will not talk about it). I give it a 3 and that's just for actors.
