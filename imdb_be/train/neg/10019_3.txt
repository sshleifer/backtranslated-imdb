Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br / > Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Well Banner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> not a good reason not to see this movie .... <br /> <br /> so I thought ........ Didnt these people do JBJ ... <br /> <br /> Why oh Why I forget about it. <br /> <br /> Despite all the criticism in the first half of the film is not so bad ... <br /> <br /> There is some intrigue and you feel SNP irritation mixed with the excitement I felt when I SEE Guy Ritchie film LIKE TO HAVE castle and jerk. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor sizzles in a very thin model sort of way. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar Akshay Kumar, as soon as it can be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor annoying but funny, you almost forget that the majority of the time you can not understand it. <br /> <br /> Saif Sidey ala Main Khiladi .. again. <br /> <br /> There is sometimes a laugh and a few chuckle s, and a few ants while Kareena-Saif love story (Karina rain behind me on my bike Hmmmmmmm). <br /> <br /> But mostly it is half promises more than it delivers ..... <br /> <br /> THAT MAKES THE SECOND HALF OF ALL unbearable .... <br /> <br /> I was almost cheer when the interval came not only because of the wet Karina due to the fact that people thought was the future. <br /> <br /> Instead, we were treated to MIND Numbing torture that is hard to put into words. <br /> <br /> Saif suddenly seam like a comic sidekick ... <br /> <br /> suddenly sexy Kareena looks anorexia, you understand that the penultimate floor is now empty and her face looks great for your body (only girls can notice it and make the other guys notice the second floor were my last observation). <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor and his accomplices on the nerves. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who brings madness to some extent, but even he becomes unbearable after a while. <br /> <br /> ALL WHILE YOU ONE subjected to absurd for others. <br /> <br /> WHY ?? !! WHAT ?? !!! WHEN? !!! WHERE? !!! What have I done to deserve this ... <br /> <br /> collective gasp went trough the audience before each song in the second half, which were common, even without a film around it. <br /> <br /> you can not reduce the injury longer .... <br /> <br /> Conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film begins as a buzzing, YOU FEEL even has a high, but slowly comes to an end on the way to a headache and then quickly turns into a full-blown migraine. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s Cast, Akshay Kumar, the first half. <br /> <br /> +/- s, what, when, how, who a lot of confusion. (Need a book to fill it). <br /> <br /> + s bandages, the entire second half (requires a lot of pages to fill it). <br /> <br /> overall 3/10 (im trying to avoid the 1s and 2s and does not seem extreme, but do not be mistaken, this film is not unwatchable no matter how decent the first half).
