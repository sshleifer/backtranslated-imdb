I found this film quite strange. From the get-go, I found it very hard to like this movie, and now after a little thinking about it, I can pretty much determine the reason why. Jean-Marc Barr, even though I love him to pieces (I think Zentropa is one of the best films ever made) completely here miscast, and although I can not understand for the life of me, who will be better, I am sure, that someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this movie work. Everything else is in order, for shots in low comedy, with the exception of (A Joke Dating Parents do not really need, filmmakers!), And I really like Richard E. Grant as the British major. He just suffers from one thing .. Jean-Marc.
