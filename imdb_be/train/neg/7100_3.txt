This film makes a promising start, and then it becomes very confusing and convoluted. Kamal Haasan made a lot of effort in getting period look right, it is a pity that he did not spend more time on the site. Most small characters in the film appear for no particular reason. <br /> <br /> In general, very disappointing, I would recommend to avoid this movie.
