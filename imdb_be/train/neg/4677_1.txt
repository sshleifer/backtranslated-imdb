What a load of Hollywood leftists hold. This film celebrates the revolt as a brave and noble, if it is to the principles of pacifism. Fabulous ends pacifist character played by Danzel Washington really helped get him to change. With these tools in Hollywood? It also payback for McCarthy? <br /> <br /> When I sound cynical it's because I'm tired of films hawking the political agenda. in this film are portrayed as a military brass, what else? Gung-ho warmongers. Sounds familiar? Ever seen a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not evil? Think about it. But then again, Crimson Tide underscores the point. Hackman character, the captain of the submarine Ramsey, Sun comes as the ravings of a madman, until the very end, of course, if he wakes up, makes a complete 360, renounces his blood lust, suggests promotion on treacherous Ron Hunter, and repents moving away from the service. A man revolts, takes command of your boat, put U.S serious risk of a nuclear first strike, and you promote it ???? What garbage!
