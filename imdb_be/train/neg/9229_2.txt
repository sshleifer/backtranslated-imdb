This is a film about the making of the film. Such films can be interesting, but they need some stuff to do it. That did not happen here, I'm afraid. Mr. Coppola entirely inherited his father's skills, unfortunately (nor did his sister, who, however, can make movies that can be watched). <br /> <br /> I wonder how this film came to get such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the leading male actor, the director allegedly as clear as frozen squid, and his voice is the same pitch, he said, the leading female actress has no expression on her face that never changes the plot is completely segmented in bits, possibly each other connecting element, a film in a film idea must be greater than the stale Paleolithic rock ... would that be enough? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry every time I watched this movie. Walking the dog is far superior game to this incredibly lame movie. It is as if conspiracy Francois Truffaut were sent Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, some other classic films SF? You should really be joking ...
