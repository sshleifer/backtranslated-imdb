I'm sorry, but I do not like this paper very much. I can think of a million ways it could be better. People who have done this, obviously, do not have much imagination. Interviews are not very interesting and not a real insight not offered. Frames are not going very informative either. It's too bad, because it's a film that really deserves the fascinating features. One thing I will say that Rossellini became more beautiful older she gets. All considered, it gets only a "4"
