Before you start watching the show, I heard that it was perfect and aesthetically very interesting. That fraud scenarios so stupid that I am quite sure that the authors of the son and grandson Scoobidoo writers. What about SFX and colors, they are so large that it is painful to watch, not saturated colors are more saturated, as the scripts will be overwritten and show exaggerated. It shows how bad the cake in which the child would put the sugar and butter, thinking that since these ingredients are the best, they are sufficient. Unfortunately, for this show, only two components of the show, finally, the sparseness and a complete lack of confidence.
