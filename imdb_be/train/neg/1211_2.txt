Only redeeming quality of this film is quite original death scene. In addition, this film is a big DUD. Kim Basinger, we deposited a housewife slowly meandering through the local mall for the first 30 minutes. from the film, which does not add anything. Then, the film picks up a bit, because she has a conflict with the 4 punks who took the 2 parking spaces on the busy Christmas eve. They begin to pursue it after the nearby local security guard who tried to help her. From there, the film becomes worse, much worse. I know it's only a movie, and you have to go with the flow, but it has about 5 minutes. Headstart and she can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, it goes next to the wood on the half-built subdivisions. In typical fashion, she does all she can afford her followers easy to keep track of it. But now it turns into a hard mofu. You get the point. Nha under any circumstances, buy or rent this movie, no matter how much you like this type. It's so illogical, you will ask each scene. This is inconvenient for Besinzher and Craig Sheffer and other actors, as well as consumers.
