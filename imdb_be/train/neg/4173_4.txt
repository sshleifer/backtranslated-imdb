The person must say, when I saw the trailer, I was excited. Futuristic soldier by taking on bad ass vampires led by genre vet Michael Ironside .... in space. I mean, I did not expect high art, but it looked like a potential classic B movie. This is without doubt the pilot TBA edited after a certain time in a feature film, after he was picked up. Okay, I'll start with the movies a few good points, actions of the lower budget film and CGI, and the place was used patency. Who is poor, firstly Michael Ironside had barley in it, and his work here .... well, it's not cheesy in a good way. But, as I said, that was not in it much anyway, so I can not blame him. The only thing that was really stupid, was the type of group PETA for a vampire, no, I'm not kidding, it's stupid the most incredible thing I've seen in time, and it is serious. In addition, the film makes one of the major sins in the movie, he was teasing lesbian scene, and does not deliver. Most of all, this film is that the sinking nothing happens. Since it was to be a pilot script almost does not exist, and it does not have a regular ending. Even the main villains, just come to an end. If ever a film, it is necessary that a Sleaze and gore factor is the Vampire Wars. In conclusion, the main crew on the boat were all very capable actors and could easily put this mess behind them and move on to bigger and better things. They just do not have anything to work with here.
