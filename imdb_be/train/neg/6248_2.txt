Something very strange is going on when you're talking about global warming: the science. Goes out the window and "faith" and "consensus" becomes a topic of discussion <br /> <br /> This is due to the fact that I give a failing grade in the Al Gore documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of encouraging intellectual discussion, he continued the discussion on the "belief" level and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, if you are trying to sell the world in spending trillions of dollars to "stop global warming" you may say that this is a problem scientific truth: we do not know how much of this warming was caused by man. Maybe none, maybe some of them, maybe it's not too gave way to the next ice age, and we got very lucky, the sun cooked the planet. <br /> <br /> But the fact remains that we do not know. <br /> <br /> so we asked to "believe" in the "consensus". Never forget that any scholar who departs from "consensus" ostracism. No matter what the scientific study of deviating from the consensus. Einstein did not "believe" in the consensus nor did Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> So why so much ridicule is located on the same researchers who have contributed to the field, asking the tough questions? If global warming is so overwhelming, of course, a few people testing this theory may not be as threatening. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? This is a film that I was hoping that Al Gore would have done. Istead, he has decided to strengthen its support to the true "believers" in the "consensus". <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
