I have several fans working Lynche, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very later. This is a series of short cartoons that are trying to show an alarming and disgusting kind of humor. The animation is very rough, no doubt, made using Macromedia. Each cartoon has a big fat guy beat up his family and, as a rule, which acts like a jerk everything he knows. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with this vein of animation, they will probably be more impressed by it. However, if you have spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, as I do, then these cartoons will be no different from any other stuff you've seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists on Newgrounds do much better work than what was shown in this DVD. If Lynch presented this work at the site, it will blend in perfectly with some of the best artists of the Newgrounds. But since I saw it on DVD, rather than over Newgrounds, I give it 4/10 rather than 7/10, since I would have otherwise. These cartoons are suitable for the Internet, but with a name like David Lynch on it, I was expecting better quality and in history, and in animation.
