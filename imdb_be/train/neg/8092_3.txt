Stretching Tom Wolfe watched brilliantly satirical novel of life among New York snobbery gets a glossy look here, but still not very well served. The film suffers not only from miscasting everyman Tom Hanks as a dispassionate yuppies, Kewpie doll Melanie Griffith as manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis (?!) How's favorite writers in New York. The most serious miscasting was in the director's chair. Robert Altman could have breathed life into the unsympathetic character and make them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all its visual complexity, has never been an eye for the nuances of human experience. The resulting film looks good, but it seems rather to his subject dehumanization in favor of the status. Honestly, when satire is not to force the viewer to get angry, what's the point?
