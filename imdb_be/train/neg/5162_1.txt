This movie reminded me so much, "A History of Violence," which pretended to be a careful study of violence and violent behavior, but do not end up just being nothing more than a cheap action movie disguised as some kind of thinking about film violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride go on a small English town and face endless harassment by the local drunks, who do nothing but hang at the bar throughout the day and into trouble. Do not these people have jobs? Anyway, Dustin takes all that he can take to the end of the movie, he keeps in his house and beats each of drunken napadavshihov through such abominable means as boiling whiskey poured over someone, feet being blown gun and someone the head will fall into the trap of a bear. It's funny that someone has a need for such a large bear trap in a small British town, except, perhaps, to put the mans head in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah, who made «Wild Bunch», which also covers the topic blood giving the violence, which has not been saved not one. But it was done with style, and you have believed. Straw Dogs entirely plausible. First of all, the place is not and does not work. Why put it in England? I think maybe, in some inland areas of the city or in a small town in the American South in the 1930s or something. Secondly it is not in my opinion, really clearly explained why these people are so quick to violence, except, maybe they drank and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. <br /> <br /> Peckinpah missed the mark on this one.
