Yawn induces clumsy disappointment, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington), which is under investigation for his possible involvement in the case of lack of money. If a bank is robbed and hostage held against their will mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team, a detective assigned to force the thief seem ?? his one shot to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a strong woman (Jodie Foster), the secrets and intentions of his, sent to restore the item from the safe of the bank's owner, which is stored in the bank, and you have a pretty three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, all that you get it set up in the film, and nothing does not pay off in the end. Denzel Washington in its most uninteresting in the inefficient and dismissive egocentric performance. The only salvation for the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, which is much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster delivers the most amazing and high-caliber performance against type ruthless thug villain of sorts. Clive Owen is not given much to do but brood and postures, but the depth of his presence and his acting ability achieved more than compensate for its underdeveloped role. It is surprising that so much talent is wasted in this film little influence or interest. You have to wonder what the director Spike Lee thought, while he was creating the film. The most confusing aspect of Inside Man, but as far as undue praise she received. For a film that seemed to have all the makings of a summer blockbuster, this one falls terribly flat.
