This film is forever left an impression on me. I watched as a freshman in high school and was home alone that night. I think I have lost respect for Robert Reed as an actor, having been a huge supporter of «Brady Bunch». I also thought that the role of Chuck Connor was terrible and evil. However, this movie made such an impact on me, that I am now a volunteer in the state women's prison makes biblical studies and church services, and trying to change women's lives, one at a time. What fascinates me that so few people actually watched this movie. None of my friends have not seen it and my family are ignorant to this day, when I discuss this film, because they have not seen it.
