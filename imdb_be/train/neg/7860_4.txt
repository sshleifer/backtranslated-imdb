Martin Weiss, who has directed solid «Rohtenburg», will take the heat, with Wes Craven, still battered "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an incredible story and a dog that has a flashback, will be permanently deleted it more technically polished remake (in name only). A beam of National Guardsmen (and women) went to the desert research, surrounded by rolling hills filled with mutants. One of the soldiers took off the weekend. That's all. There are a number of hardcore violence and rape scene is pretty tough, but there is very little else to admire. Film "heroes" are usually a bunch of cliches and mutants, far from the original "family" Craven, mainly reminiscent of Brian Thompson "Cobra" in combination with certain existing Stan Winston has left over from the «Wrong Turn» shoot. Much of the action takes place in a cave, la «The Descent», and a good shot Sam McCurdy. Ridiculous aspect is the addition of Wes Craven and Jonathan lovely mutant who skulks around his cave, as the leather in the original Hooper "chainsaw". Weiss will be charged in this dull fiasco, but it is not really to blame because he was doing everything possible to keep the intrigue and squeeze fresh with contrived situations. Not a fan, unfortunately.
