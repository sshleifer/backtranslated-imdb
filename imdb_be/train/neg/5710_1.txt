Well, it looks good on paper, Nic Cage and Bruckheimer to work again, this time on a mixture of robbery movie, The Da Vinci Code, American history 101 and Indiana Jones. But my God, this is Indiana Jones, that the rate of acceleration is 2. Clever cast (including Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel) battles against child script and lose badly. The film is a little bit longer ads for Freemasons.However these Masons are not your ordinary shopkeepers, using funny handshake, and play golf, the Masons are the natural heirs of the Templars (and no any "From Hell" or Jack the Ripper.) I do not think I showed any plot spoilers, because there are none. There is almost no suspense, no surprises and no climax- it just stops. National Treasure tends to Dan Brown, but falls into the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo SANs humor.
