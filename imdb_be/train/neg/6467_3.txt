I still can not believe that this film. They got so many incredible things about it is that it's hard to believe that anyone would like to do it. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but in the sense that it is ridiculous, but more than any history at all. As you can mix a farce with a train robbery, prison movie, city plots, sex jokes and an FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrible direction most noticeable things are the actors. I watched this movie and thought, "Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be. (5 minutes) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe exactly Brando. (5 minutes) This may not be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes) No, Mira Sorvino. This film too bad for all of them. (Conclusion). No, no, no, it can not completely be Martin Sheen !!! Not 10 seconds of the movie. Then it was over, and I'm down to my nerves. So many good, Oscar-winner, as a rule, to persuade the actor in such a stupid, stupid, terrible film. I rarely like to know, as they have come to operate it. They could not have so much money, <br /> <br /> Only just incredibly stupid idiotic movie <br /> <br /> 3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1 + - 6) ..
