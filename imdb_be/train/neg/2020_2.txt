This is similar to two films: one dreary, pretentious long Saga Ac-Tories, who takes the part he played; another brilliant social commentary about the average age of divorce, which is picked up by a waitress. Shelley Winters great waitress with another business on the side. She drops heavy hints about the necessary connections, certificates in massage and her desire to get in the game model. I love a glimpse of her shabby apartment with a kitchen behind the curtain, and its terrible seduction outfit navel demonstration, puff-sleeved top hook. <br /> <br /> There are actors receive Oscar for Shakespeare? We know that they Oscars impersonating people with disabilities, to wear a lot of prosthetics, or pretends to be crazy. Shakespeare's scene (which go on and on) are confused and dated. And here it is "going crazy" scene where Tony looks distracted, listening to his own voice-overs. <br /> <br /> By the way, John Anthony entirely aristocratic. He does it well know in the beginning of the scene, that he used to be a choir boy. When he quotes his father's advice, he slips into a Cockney accent.
