This one was marred by a potentially great matches cut very short. <br /> <br /> The opening match was a waste of the Legion of Doom, but I think the only way that they could be eliminated by the demolition was a double DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have to put in overtime. Kerry Von Erich, the champion of I-C, here was wasted. And it was the third consecutive PPV where Perfect jobbed. Remember that before that he never lost a match. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, probably the best night. Dibiaste and the undertaker was wonderful, while Jim Neidhart was one of his highlights of the WWF, pressed to Honky Tank People. Koko B. Ware continued the tradition of being the first to put on a new heel (remember the Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). It was the prototype of the singles career of Bret Hart as he returned from a two-on-one and almost survived the match. He and DiBiase put on a wrestling clinic, causing us to forget that the point of the match was a sad hostility Dibiase with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the Dreamers were the first team to all its members to survive (and only the second since the 87 have a four survivors), this match was not squash. It was the longest match of the night, and Jake did a repeat performance of his 88, when he was left alone against the four men and dominated. I think he could have picked up exactly upset. These days, the match would have ended the other way around. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest SS matches ever had as one of its most bizarre. Perhaps the most underrated Wrestler ever, Tito Santana was inspired fighter of the night, putting on war paint and pressed Boris Zukhov, Tanaka, and even the military commander in the final game of survival. It was so strange to see it set over time, in most cases, and then go back to his mediocre career. Sergeant Slaughter is good too, by getting rid of Volkov and Bushwhackers, but it just was not a surprise. Tito. <br /> <br /> I think the only surviving match point was to have Hogan and Warrior win together in the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and the matches were too short. The debut of the undertaker was great, but Tito Santana reason, I will remember it.
