I watched this movie as really enjoyed Gregory girl many years ago. This is nonsense. The plot vaguely unpleasant to the teacher and his friend perving over the 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts. Previous commentators seem to think that it does not matter, but I found it quite disgusting. If you have children in school, the last thing you want to think that every young teacher lusting after his students. We were surprised that the censor let it through. In addition, the film was just a waste of time. The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair tries too hard to recreate his image schoolboy silly and slightly away from the wall. Why anyone would want to desire it in this performance is unbelievable. This film is not a success on all counts for me. Dreadful. Please do not waste your time watching it. Life is too short
