This film is just so awful. So bad that I can not spend anything but just a few words. Avoid this film at any cost, that's awful. <br /> <br /> None of the crimes of parts is not played correctly. Many slaughterhouse staff. Weird cuts and edits. A lot of continuity with the plot. The acting is absolutely the best lover I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is a bomb movie clearly made to make money without any regard to the accuracy of its contents. The camera work is out of focus at times and always cradle. It looks as though it was shot on video. <br /> <br /> In fact, now that they have Dennis Rader to life in prison, I wish they would put the guys who made this horrible film in jail as well. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not even think about watching this. I would give it a negative star if I could.
