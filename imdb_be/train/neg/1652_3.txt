I'll be blunt and point. This film is not suitable. Film buff part of me hated acting, script, plot, direction and almost all editing. Amanda Peet has proved that it can work, because it was a high point of «The Whole Nine Yards». Thus, it should avoid this movie with a ten-foot pole. However, infantile part I found this movie very funny. If you can forget about how underpar quality of production, and if you find a joke funny embers, then you should be all right. And for those of you who can not get a podium, that's your choice. My inner child hasen't died, and I laughed a fair bit. Even then, only three out of ten, because, as a movie, it really stinks.
