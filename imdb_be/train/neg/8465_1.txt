I can not believe how terrible this movie was. I'm feeling magnanimous, even referring to him as "cinema". Action was flat, editing was terrible and the plot leaves many important questions unanswered. The room was fine when unoriginal: a small group of foreigners who live in the United States and trying to slowly take over mankind. But it is rapidly deteriorating. How could they convince "people" to accept a foreigner as his wife, to make it a foreign-human hybrids, they require? They show larval alien, but never show what he is doing. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce perfect skin on an industrial scale. They throw in the obligatory huge alien monster with teeth. The ending was too painful to watch. I believe that I was basically disappointed that Boxlietner Bruce will have nothing to do with it. How could he say the huge alien monster with teeth, "Get away from it you son of a B * TCHÂ» with a straight face? It's a long fall from his Babylon 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
