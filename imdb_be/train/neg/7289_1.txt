This is a film a huge appeal to a relatively well-defined group (of which I am part). I went to the preview of this movie not knowing what to expect - I eventually found it disappointing. History terribly dysfunctional (often downright "twisted"), a Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. The epic saga, as it should really provide its viewers more in the end. In the end, the pictures, such as it is about the human condition - this picture does not cast a little new light on any of his more important facets.
