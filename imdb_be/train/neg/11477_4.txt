Unfortunately my fellow neighbors Nevada City, but this one bad. <br /> <br /> Brian must have had too much Botox, because he had very little facial expressions through out the film. <br /> <br /> Alice looked like she was a board strapped to her back. It was tough throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I looked at Alice and Brian, and was surprised to see a huge bio work. I would suggest that they were freshmen. <br /> <br /> Asner and Peter Jason carried the film open with their banter and ease with each line. Ed, of course, has not lost its charisma. I wish I took the time to meet with him when he was here. <br /> <br /> I love the snow scene and scene shops and the church, because I was there. I do Nevada City is my home and looking forward to the premiere. I, unfortunately, disappointed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately.
