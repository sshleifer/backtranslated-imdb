The film deserves 2/10. 1.5 star for girls (I'm sorry that I'm biased, I think that pretty girl is the only event in the movie), and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Aza 1. I watched Azue 1 and 2 1 seat. I surprised myself by being able to sit through it. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the advantages of the film. Girl. Ueto Aya cute. That's all there is to save the entire movie. The fact is, when the main character was a man, I am sure that most people (including me) did not affect the movie in general. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about the negative points. Firstly, it is really draggy, with lots and lots of repetitive scenes. Nachi Azumi scene and keeps coming back. It's more like theater shooting mode. Typical Japanese drama like flashbacks, and this film too. Secondly, the film is too unreal in a historic setting. I am not against unrealistic movies. But this film is bad way to show creativity, throwing ninja who act like bears and cobwebs, etc ... it reminds me of Shinobi, Shinobi although it is a film with a fantasy setting. Moreover, in order to identify the "I-nya-know" what effect the director of films people who die with a sprinkle of blood (literally) all around ... people are not aware of their heads cut off, and so on ... ., etc ... etc ... Too many of these spoils the show. It seems that the influence of the anima much in this movie. This impairs the show greatly. Third, Azumi just should not be the killer. It is more like a one-man-army to me, only that she was a woman. I do not think you can charge the murderers in military camps. The only time I felt that it was acting "killer loved" when she killed Kiyomasa Kato in the end Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both films. Its linear plot, without development and surprises anyway.
