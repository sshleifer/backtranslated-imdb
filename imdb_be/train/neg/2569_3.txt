Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) mildly amusing in this turkey in 1970, but the script is so lame and sad that even the young Goldie Hawn (in only after her Oscar win) can not begin to pull this one out of the mud. As a skirt-chasing celebrity in his 40s, sellers basically drive themselves to the highest degree. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. Best performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young type of research <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and sellers are well paid, because I do not see any other reason the scar, as in 1970 (a very good year for movies -. CATCH-22, Mash , men, JOE, WUSA, five parts of the lung, and many others). You can not win them all!
