Box «To Die For» caught me - shirtless hardworking guy and promises some laughter and sex. There was a lot of Thomas Arklie (Simon), which is easy on the eyes, but do not laugh and a bit sexy. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, Sun reportedly been together for several years, but neither character is interesting enough to take care of, so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other. Wine seems to lie in the script, rather than performance; the actors do their best with what they are given. <br /> <br /> ending juicy and unaffecting (well, not quite unaffecting, I was relieved that it was more). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a film about gay relationships and AIDS, this is ridiculous, "Parting views" much better.
