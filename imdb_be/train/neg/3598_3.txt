You know, when you look at his collection of old, videotaped movies, and understand that there are some that you have seen only one or two times, and you can not remember where they are the time it takes to see them? Alibi is / was one of those movies; I found it not so long ago, and decided that I might as well give him a chance. I'm not quite sure if I'm happy with my decision ... on the one hand, the film is really, really bad, on the other hand, now I have one more free tape ... yes, you get it. The plot is predictable and does not in any way original. Go bad. Act is bad, but it really is not surprising, seeing as the two wires are former soap opera star ... they are used for replay. Symbols badly written cliche. The film even manages to spoil the easiest way to hit the damn me (via film): the court scene. Even those that do not cause a single emotion or against any of the thin cardboard signs. The film simply has no real redeeming quality would however ... Even the dialogue is bad. The fact that it is so full of clichés, it's funny. And this is one thing that raises it above the rating of 1/10 (albeit unintentionally so) comic of the many clichés and stereotypes. I did not pay much attention to the movie, but almost every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh. One last note: I considered using a string «Tori Spelling can not act," as a summary in one line, but I think everyone knows that, so I opted for the current, seeing as this is more informative. In general, thoroughly bad film, but not the worst, if you do not get anything else, and if it's on TV. Good for a few laughs when you can sit through it. 3/10
