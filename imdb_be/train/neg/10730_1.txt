The film begins with 3 people meet each other in the bar. GOOD. They talk about their imaginary life, lying all the time, for no reason. Another OK.From from time to time, they even make you laugh. That's interesting. The first 30 minutes you really like it! But then ... things get worse ... nothing happens ... in a long time ... and when something happens, all you can see naked old "house" touching each other! Nya OK. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be in the upper part of the movie, but that's all, except that! The film does not make any sense, it's sad, and sick! <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) on FEST (Film), the film was the most popular according to research, of course, before people watched it! I even thought (front view): "Ah, it might be interesting, although it is a Russian film," But, Lord, not !!!!!
