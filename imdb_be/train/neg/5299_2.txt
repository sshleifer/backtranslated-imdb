I really like the chopper movies, but this one really awful.The action lame, bad script, and the atmosphere is not existent.The plot is as follows: deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughter people in a small American town. this right is plot.Very original as well! "Night brings Charlie" even bloody enough, if the film is not going to be afraid, at least, they should do it bloody.Avoid this cheap piece of garbage costs.If do you want to see some good Tesakov clicks check "Crazy" «The Burning», «The Prowler», «Before the dawn" or «Humongous» - just do not waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage.
