I saw the movie last night, and I really wanted to like it. My expectations for the film have been up and down since I heard what was going on. A few days later I see something exciting, and some days I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> However, being a kind of fan I am, I had high hopes for this film, but in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> while I love films, Richard Donner, I did not want their mannerisms sometimes nature or the changes they have made to the character of Superman and his power. <br /> <br Singer /> but decided to take the worst elements of the Donner films and put them in his version. <br /> <br /> while his Lex Luthor bit darker, it's nothing more than a dark business man, with a crook and a common criminal. He is not smarter when Gene Hackman played with him. Kevin Spacey is doing everything possible to play well Luthor, but eventually, he becomes the victim of bad writing and unremarkable dialogue. <br /> <br /> His aides more dimensional than even comic henchmen. Most of them are literally no dialogue in the film. <br /> <br /> **** **** Spoilers ahead Kitty Kowalski almost exactly the same character as Mrs. Tesmacher. It seems as evil and cold as Lex Luthor, but it is simply fry that melts to see Superman's in trouble, and predictably alter Luthor. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the film Frank Langella as Perry White. I was not a big fan on top of Perry White in the movies Donner, but at least he had a soul. He was, after all is said and done, a veteran reporter who cared about truth and a good story. Langella Perry White is nothing but a corporate puppet. He wants everyone to focus on the Superman-related stories, because they sell the paper, even if the rest of the paper do the same. He does not care about the real stories, real mystery as to obscure the fact that Lex Luthor is still that he out of jail. <br /> <br /> The worst Langella, it's boring! Some participants may be calm and sober, and yet there is an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. He's okay, but again, not a single memorable lines in the entire film. Not the actor's fault. His movements are clearly meant to look graceful, as even the slightest movement of his fingers affects the way he flies. But she still looks choreographer and artificial. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane while was poorly written surprisingly well acted Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, once again, on the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writer, she is as eloquent as any teenager on Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden has been my favorite actor of the whole film, mostly because it is more like Superman than even the police department. Without any superpowers he manages to find a message Lois Lane, the airplane is flying at the place gets on board Luthor and saves Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> The only exciting moment in the film when they are trapped in a store room as he pours the water, the ship sinks. You can see that they are going slowly when immersed in water. You know, Superman's going to come at the last moment to save them, but yet you can not help but feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I have said the plot is very haphazard. Unlike Singer said that this is not a film about the superhero returns and tries to find his place in the world. As soon as he returns the world meets him with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him. Even Luthor Superman happy to have back, because it gives him a chance to become the person accounts. <br /> <br /> Superman shows that is probably one of the most stupid characters in the universe. Big green piece of meteorite stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor gets out of prison, he now has a knowledge of the powers and the weakness of Superman, and yet he is still not able to connect the dots enough to know Luthor uses krypton against him. <br /> <br /> the movie the only thing that Superman really good raises, very heavy stuff. Workflows all incredibly predictable.
