<br /> <br /> As usual, I'm really looking forward to the new TV / movie on my favorite subject - it makes a nice change from the familiar strange * * documentary about the Kursk and Stalingrad on the History Channel <. br /> <br /> I eagerly looked forward to Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates - but was rudely brought down to earth with the realization of evil, stupid-ifying the power of Hollywood - and its ability to carry out an absolute fortune on the scar. <br /> <br /> So once again, I got excited about "The Rise of Evil", especially when I heard that John Kershaw was involved, as I enjoyed his book. I can understand why he quit <br /> <br /> To quote some guy responsible for this stuff :. <br /> <br /> "In the book, Kershaw was the academic part," he said. "It was <br /> <br /> pretty dry. We need more incidents." <br /> <br /> incidents? ? are they completely nuts Hitler's life can not be said that without the "incident" - so two volume biography of Hitler Kershaw was long and detailed, but they had to be <br /> <br /> The thesis of "The Rise of Evil "seems :. <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no, he was not a bad man, who hated the Jews, and just in case you missed it, we are going to emphasize the fact ., In every scene in the film <br /> <br /> There has not been any effort to try to explain the mood of the time, and why Hitler might have taken the views and strategy, which he did without saying himself -. Unlike usually fine "Nazis - a warning from history" - this film has neglected to mention the fact that almost all the leaders of the communist Munich revolt were Jews, and that this may have colored his views on this subject - and his engagement with the axiom of Jewish Bolshevism -. absolutely important aspect for understanding the greater part of the Nazi era <br /> <br /> But there was not much point to make - the filmmakers were not going to go there, so we just got all the things we know about anyway. Of course, we do not get a fascinating fact that Kershaw suggests that there is a Hitler shortly socialist / communist immediately after WW1. This, of course, it will be too difficult for the film to handle and may even detract from the constant "he was very bad" mantra, which knocks away incessantly. <br /> <br /> We know that he was a bad man. However, we also know that he was a fascinating figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. It could even be polite and sympathetic, and, of course, some of the views espoused as vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking what many readers keepers could agree with. He was also famously fond of animals, so that is why it is completely invented dog flogging scene was so absurd. <br /> <br /> It is also, by all accounts, I saw a brave soldier in WW1. While we have seen it with the Iron Cross, we will never get to see how he won the (acts of courage were not in the script, of course). We also did not get any understanding at all to why he was so fired up for his military experience, while Sassoon, Owen, Brooke, Remarque and many others found it so off-putting experience. And again, as in the above paragraph again / Bolshevik Jewish link, it is very important for the understanding of someone about the subject. Why he loves war so much? Why does he think that she has always been a good idea, despite massive evidence to the contrary? Why he does not care about his colleagues who have died? Or maybe he is. - but still drawing the wrong conclusions <br /> <br /> This film is, of course, has nothing to no interest to say about it or <br /> <br /> As they too often. days, the film is a classic example of "making history relevant to the present" and invent things, or leaving the inconvenient facts to fit into the "real" - that too often to satisfy the lowest common denominator, where you do not 't trust your audience an inch, so you just ram things down the throat, knowing (unfortunately, right), you'll always get away with it, because there are so many stupid fools in the world. <br /> <br /> the story is really about making our relationship to the past and see how our colors at the moment, for better and for worse. This stuff has been a great opportunity to once again lost. They spent millions on it, and the location and the big scenes were impressive, but did not tell us anything we do not already do not know, and did not contribute to any understanding of this dark period in the history of mankind. <br /> <br /> WT
