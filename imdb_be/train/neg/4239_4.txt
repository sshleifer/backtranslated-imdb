It was better than the average movie, I thought, in this time on the cables. I was expecting something along the lines of cheesy melodramas and bad special effects seen in such classics as Christmas Rush and First Daughter / Target / shot, etc. <br /> <br /> cast was elected ... I especially liked Ron Livingston as SWAT Commander difficulty. It's good to see him reviewing the same material, which he had so much in a state with the Brothers band. Manufacturers and designers have done their homework, because all the scenes and frames looked as they did on that day in 1997. <br /> <br /> So, if you get a chance to see this film, and I'm sure you will as FX repeats every 50 times ... 2:00 and enjoy it.
