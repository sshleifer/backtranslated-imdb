I believe that this goes to prove that Joe Don Baker would do anything for a dollar. movie concept was not very good to begin with. This film has so many bad things about him I do not know where to start. Actions terrible. Cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. Cost scary. There's a reason why this film was on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this, and I can not believe that 9 people actually thought that this "film" is fine. They must have liked the two Go-Go dancers. Final justice will be, if they do not shut that bitch in the movie store outside of Wichita, and never let anyone see him again! A 1 to 10 ranking is much better than it deserves.
