This film is so bad that it's funny. It stars Scott Backula as some coaches, but it does not matter, what matters is the big black guy who plays 1st base. Firstly, it should be at least 75 years, but still plays a minor league baseball, the second film he starts in the outfield, despite not being able to walk, let alone run. Coach Backula brilliant moves it to the first referring to the fact that when he tries to escape, it remains in the same place for too long a period of time. Backula shows a brilliant coaching strategy at the end of the movie (spoiler), he says that his star player "in the middle" to hit a home run, a clear "center of the city" is viewed as a good move. He hit a home run and won the game for his team, little league team to play twins who were majors in film class. Now, if only Tony Muser, Royals manager would be such a smart coach as Backula and tell their players to just hit a home run in each not to mention lose at-bat, the Royals will never end the inning game.
