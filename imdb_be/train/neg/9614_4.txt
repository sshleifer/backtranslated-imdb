I would not recommend it if you are not interested in David Copperfield and want "to complete the set." There are some good features (for example, Uriah Heep), and well-designed moments (for example, beats), but overall it really pales in comparison with the BBC version 1999 and earlier versions. <br /> <br /> There are unexplained changes in a story that does not really serve a great purpose, except, perhaps, dumb it down (stolen art to be an example). American cast were poorly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she's not like Betsey Trotwood, and her English accent only slightly better than the cockney Dick Van Dyke in. I can understand why Michael Richards was selected to play Mr. Micawber; He hams it is rather too much, however, and becomes irritable. He also speaks of his lines with a focus that goes beyond the eccentric and becomes simply absurd. Anthony Andrews menacing as Mr. Murdstone, but one almost expects him to put on a black coat and tie David's mother to the railway line (although this may partly attributable Dickens). <br /> <br /> I got it for free with the newspaper for. It helped to pass a Sunday afternoon, but I felt more disappointed than charmed by the end of this
