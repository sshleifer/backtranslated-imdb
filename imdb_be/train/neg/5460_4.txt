Interestingly, the series Columbo Season 6 contained only three episodes, and there is very little evidence of the quality of at least two scenarios based on this outing for a "people-to-Mac" and "Fade to murder." <br /> <br /> In addition, it is no coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman wrote both the above scenarios (by the way, he plays the role of a security guard who was killed here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is rarely convincing and many of the artists just look disinterested with the material. The story is quite underdeveloped with some prolonged periods of melancholy conversation. <br /> <br Columbo /> also marred by colleagues here (similar to the "final salute CommodoreÂ»), but the entertainment value is minimal. To add to this, Celeste Holm feature, which is designed to farce, causing embarrassment and laughs. <br /> <br /> The script by vibrating to deal with a family history and a killer doing enough as a gift for CLC any case, although never trustworthy discussion in connection with the motives of her crime. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, what is, perhaps, the worst Columbo adventure makes the funniest moment in the series. He Barber quizzes and a haircut / manicure at the same time. The following 5 minutes of fun - it's just that Columbo hair is so beautifully cared for, it can not afford to pay the bill, and then, when he makes a request for jewelers, he keeps looking in the mirror to admire his hair <br! /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent time from a script that looks like it was beaten for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for completionists Colombo.
