Examine your credit with only one name, which I admit was a preacher in the film (Russ Conway), I was not expecting much from this movie, and I was not disappointed. A man plans to kill his new wife, to convince others that it is crazy and will take their own lives. Unbeknown to her husband that looks plastic skull, which he uses, in contrast to this, the ghost woman, apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses real skull. A simple story with a twist of irony in the end. If you're tired late at night and need to sleep, it will help you sleep, that sleep.
