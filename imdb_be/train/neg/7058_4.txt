I arrived at the new port SOUTH waiting surrogate film about a school massacre Columbine-like Elephant by Gus Van Sant, and, of course, a synopsis in TV Guide that the student sociopath rebelling against the system really gave me that impression, but it is a very sad movie where the little I am so consider yourself warned <br /> <br /> history of Maddox, a high school student in Chicago who decides to strike back at what he perceives as an authoritarian regime. The main problem lies in the fact that the nature of the following terms and actor who played by Blake Shields are not able to embellish any script limitations. Do you have a flair that Maddox should have the charisma of evil Hitler, Saddam or bin Laden, but he has never come across as something more than an annoying teenager in February, and it is impossible to believe that he could rally any disciples. Subtext you overturn a manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative mode is too obvious, which means the new port SOUTH is completely unconvincing drama that is not worth going out of your way to see
