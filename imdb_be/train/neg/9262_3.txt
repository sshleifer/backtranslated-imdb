On the surface, the idea of ​​Omen 4 well. Nice to see that the devil child might be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls own or devilry it is very effective. But Omen 4, smelly. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think that it could be a devil child, and she was the child's problems. Problems that may only therapist, then the priest can help. She does not look scary or diabolic. Rather, it looks bombastic and moody. <br /> <br /> This film had potential, and if it was done by the same people who made the previous three films, it can developed. But it is quite a shame actually to make the sequel to one of the most beloved trilogies horror as TV movie special. <br /> <br /> On many levels, this allows down. It is cheap looking, the game hammish actors and effects typical of television drama. Symbols do not bring any sympathy, and you is not the way for them. I recently re-watched it after someone brought it to me for Christmas, and it is from terrifying. <br /> <br /> If your thinking to look at this, I would suggest that you do not know. See one of the other, or playing an exorcist, or watch a good son. Just do not waste your time on this nonsense!
