Before seeing this film, I would say that I liked all Kathy Bates did. Now it all minus one. James Woods pathetic ... not his character, his action. Someone should have told him that the "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, nor ignorant, nor clich√©s. The same applies to the stereotypes Randy Quaid. The only mitigating Henry Thomas, who is not strong enough actor to wear the wet mush. If you love country, you will enjoy the scenery. That's the best I can give. <br /> <br /> I am a serious supporter of independent films and quirky, but it's just awful.
