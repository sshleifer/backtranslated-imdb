I took the title 15 or 20 times, while at Blockbuster, looking for something to look halfway decent. All I can say is that all of them were halfway decent movie night, I decided to rent. <br /> <br /> I will give credit for the fact that yeast is better than "Dracula 3000", but in reality it's quite easy to say, because this one had capers Van Dien in it. Other things that did not have in abundance were interesting cast, interesting plot, good dialogue and originality, but I suppose you can not have it all <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers *** Mismatch forward crew. of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire ... go figure it out) circled with mining colony in the mining colony trying to destroy all vampires, he could find. The crew consists of: captain cocky slacker (who died early), it is a book, even inexperienced first officer, the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (not a typo), wannabe cowboys and really, really Asian Butch commando "tough guy" woman. .. it sounds almost like a cast MTV «The Real World». Once the captain is killed in a fierce confrontation with the crowd bloodsuckers (and, as it turns out, fans of thin parts of human anatomy) his first assistant takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... all hate it ... blah, blah, blah ... I could go on, but as I said, it's the same story line used about a hundred other "movie" genre. <br /> <br /> cheese effects and why Michael Ironside was in this movie for me. Vampire vampire hunter (still not a misprint), it was pretty hot, but, of course, if you expect it to show more than just her cleavage, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can not say that it was the worst movie I've seen, I actually rented a «Starship Troopers 2", but wait for it to come to the Sci-Fi Channel.
