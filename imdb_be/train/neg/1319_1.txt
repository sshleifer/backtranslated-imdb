Maybe someone heard about Alberto Tomba. A former police officer, a former champion of the sky, and now the hard actor. "Alex L'Ariete" was scheduled TV "mini-series", but the Italian television refused to show the film on their channels. Now it is, believe me, a funny movie. The scenario is just plain fun (this should be a dramatic movie), something like 5 years, a small work. But what really blows you an amateur action: Alberto Tomba, who was in fact not true, as does the police plays a very very bad temper: a special operation Italian police specialized in breaking open the door! ( "Ariete" is "ram"). This is a super guy will try to save the life of a young beautiful girl (a real Italian "small" TV dancer, married to the singer Eros Ramazzotti): beautiful, but totally inappropriate in action. Lose this one and do yourself a favor. The film, which is a shame for the Italian film industry: only John Travolta got close to the Earth attack ..
