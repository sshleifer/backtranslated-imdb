A long list of "big" names in the film (including the ubiquitous John Mills) is not bowl me to such an extent that I could not judge the film on its real merits. It is full of stereotypes, caricatures, and a standard set of scenes from humble air ace hero to loud yank leaflet. Musical track was such that in some time, about an hour before the end, I thought that the film was finished: loudly, raising crescendo, the immense scale and end the silence, and then the film went on! I have not found any real storyline to write haphazard, but the fight-extruded shapes and pretty Jean Simmons (after nose job) with a small incendiary song. I can not say that this picture is any of the ingredients that make a perfect movie. I found him maudlin, sentimental and minor.
