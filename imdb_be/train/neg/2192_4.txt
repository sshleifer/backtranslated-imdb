Another film, which is based on the banal, worn-out clich√©s mad scientist gone madder. The film centers around a surgeon whose life ambition is to bring the dead back to life .... I know, I know ... you've never heard that one before! Of course, as with all these movies go, the experiment goes very, very wrong, and makes manic, bloodthirsty creature. For this promising settings, you might think that it would be at least a little bit disturbing. Wrong. As with many films of this era, the idea is good, but the execution of the script and mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I saw (NO, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but not one of the gems, either.
