After a very happy occasion, he begins to work in a reputable journal Sharp administered safely in the form of Jeff Bridges in New York City. This is more of The Devil Wears Prada, than Shaun of the Dead. Hardly beloved provided Kirsten Dunst, who works well with Pegg for a laugh, but they did not exactly set the screen with their passion burning. <br /> <br /> Sydney goes through some emotional problems, trying to decide if he should forget about his journalistic principles in order to get the material in the magazine. Of course, he eventually seduced glitz and glamor of the world of celebrities especially young sterlet Sophie Maes (Megan Fox Transformers). Supporters Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced be wondering if he Pegg ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and the degree of Run Fat Boy Run, as one of the best comic talents of the UK being destroyed in the United States. <, Br /> <br /> as a whole is forgettable comedy.
