This film is a self-indulgent rubbish. Watch this movie if you just want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy a pleasant soundtrack. Watch out for any other reason, and you will be disappointed. He must be charming, but it is not - it's just annoying. Symbols difficult to take care of the poor and acting. Stories within the film as ugly and sinister. I was expecting a heartwarming family film, but it's not attracted to my fourteen-year-old daughter. It rarely happens that I can not see the movie before its conclusion, but this one was the best of both of us. <br /> <br /> Although the film is set to the current time, it has the look and cheap East European film shot during the Cold War. There is not even enough in the way of beautiful Scottish scenery and cinematography, to redeem him. This is a shame because, as the film is the difficulty in Scotland.
