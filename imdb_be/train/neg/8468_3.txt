"They are among us" bad science fiction at best. Satisfactory action bogs down the film. Many plot holes. Foreigners who once came to Earth meteorite and hiding among us for more than 100 years, but you need a plastic surgeon to make their people. They have a strange form, which they allegedly have the exo-skeletons (which is why they need plastic surgery), but if you see them they have teeth and nails. The father of the heroine "disappeared" after closing the Blue Book project, but supposedly the pilot F-sixteenth And on and on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie, select the "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," and see how it is done correctly.
