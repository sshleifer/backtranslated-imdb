You've probably heard the phrase, when he came in this film ?? Â«Herbie: Fully Loaded shit" and yes, it's true. This film is really awful and completely inaccurate. <br /> <br /> This should be the second worst film of Lindsay never so Confessions Teenage Drama Queen. The only good thing about this film seems to have a talent of the cast, which is much better than the movie a million times and is the single point of sale of the film. I do not understand how such a respected actor, Matt Dillon could be a part of this film, is not he read that awful script before he signed to be in it? <br /> <br /> What I also like about this film is the basis of how Herbie and surreal imagination as extraordinary ability and climb the wall and go faster than a car driver after all a Beatle. I know that this is a film children, but they have gone overboard with him, and he just be dumber than entertainment. Little realism is needed, plus the plot is too predictable <br /> <br /> The final words :. If children are not really 5 -12 years, I doubt very much that anyone could enjoy it pointless movie. What a waste of my money. I feel cheated <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 3/10 (rank: F)
