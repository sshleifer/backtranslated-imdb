If a comedy movie has a great soundtrack on the back cover, you know you are not dealing with a highly professional film. I rented this movie with your friends expecting to get some chuckles, but in general, to get the majority of our laughing to each other making fun of the film. We could not have chosen a worst film. <br /> <br /> The film can be good with a few changes. Firstly, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly made and posted. Fat kid in the movie made us want to kill yourself, bless him for the scene and the scene of, but he looked like a puppy begging for love. If he had been pulled out of the film it could be moderate. There were some funny jokes, I think one was when a group of boys to steal one of the porn with parents and is a gay porn. But to summarize the best comedy I'll just say the opening gag for fat baby. He wears a shirt stained with vomit and talks about not knowing when something is done. <br /> <br /> In order to finish, the film's editor could save the film by removing the fat child, cutting 20 minutes doing school scenes and an ending that more than thirty seconds of random fights. <br /> <br /> He, incidentally, there are two good elements that the film has. Kadeet Hardison plays his role perfectly and acts as a joke that no one is missed or overlooked. Another redeeming element of the film beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. Her character is ignored most of the film, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time even rent it. He's not talking to me, and I was part of the target audience (18 male).
