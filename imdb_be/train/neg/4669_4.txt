Interestingly, the novel, the story is not the basis for two films. Although the heiress was a good, if not quite accurate, adaptation, Washington Square is a despotic and acted badly, for the part of Dr. Sloper, a film that could be much better, except for. <br /> <br /> attempts directed at creating "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I actually cringed. She does not have one of the understated and simple beauty that film without a plot may be, for example, Onegin. I agree with other comments about the reflection Leah Catherine like an idiot, not naive and shy; she made me despise her not to feel it. <br /> <br /> Catherine transition from children's trusting adult cynicism, the whole point of this story has been mastered, the same as it was in the novel. But we do not have the advantage of the narrative voice, to tell us that in the movie! I think that someone missed adaptation class filmschool. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the attempts of the director to make the moving and beautiful film from heavy text, but it just does not work.
