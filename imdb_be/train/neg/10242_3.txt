This film was made by a bunch of white guys who went to school together. Well, there's nothing wrong with that, except that looks like it was done in a heap of white guys who went to school together. 90 percent of white men acting about the same age. It's almost like watching a bunch of boys, boys camp, which was on the camera itself. The film has no plot. He simply repeats the same action after the blood bath blood bath. There are some funny scenes and comedy bits. But they do not will buy the flat monotony. <br /> <br /> Graphic animated scenes are used to cover material that was clearly beyond their budget or resources to do, and not very good at it. Anything that can not be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood by means of cheap animation. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a piece Tarrentino. Well, the trailer scene as good as they ever get. Ther rest is just repeat the same kind of mundane, silly comedy. It works at times, but it gets boring after the same material comes to you again and again. It's more like a string Satuday Night Live skits than a movie. It's a hit-you-over-the-head-with this kind of comedy. I can see where the story is intriguing idea. But in this film, post apocalyptic America as well as England Medevil. In fact, he says Wheatlry story ideas come from that era. He plans to make part 2. I believe he thinks he Tarrentino or maybe do a parody thing. <br /> <br /> At the opening in Los Angeles, Whitley said he will return largely the same hue in part 2, he asked, more diverse cast of whether it can be considered in the next, and he said, yes, Of course.
