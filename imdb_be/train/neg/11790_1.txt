Deep SH .. more like it! Acne only cartooned for the film. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" responsible "Leviathan". Very tacky. <br /> <br /> A lot of character and attitude development. The so-called "romantic" scenes are very trite and predictable. Interesting idea, but poorly written script and lousy special effects make this a definite must-miss!
