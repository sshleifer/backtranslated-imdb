This show is terrible, awful jokes all and just got worse and worse. I am one of those people who have never been a big fan of Corner Gas, but at least, I liked it at first, until he got into a rut about the second season, all the jokes were played and the characters do not have nothing to do with him. Well, at least, Corner Gas was good at first, Little Mosque on the Prairie are usually terribly soft CBC comedy that had nothing that comes to him from episode 1. Who are the people who watch the show anyway, I have to be honest elderly people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairie? Maybe a joke for them, and they work there? I do not know a single person who loves this show and can not stand alone, totally predictable jokes and characters are even less developed than in the gas Corner. I hope it will not last much longer, because all the successes were the show, I think, will be completely based on the premise of the show being a Muslim, which is different and can / should have led to a great show.
