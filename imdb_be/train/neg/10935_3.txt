I've never been a big fan of Mormon movies. As a Mormon, I have always felt that the humor was too exclusively for the LDS community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive weirdos. I was hoping it would be a breath of fresh air, the film Halestorm I could finally talk with your friends, sun Mormon. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I realized ,, as it was the B-list talent like Clint Howard, Harry Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), it would have to be at least a bit ridiculous. And besides, the church basketball sang with the potential of a large number of funny jokes and the like. But I must say that throughout the film, no one seemed to know what they are doing. Every joke has fallen, and all possibilities for really funny gag were ignored. The dialogue was bland, and the film had some of the worst character development I have ever seen. Each character, but Wilson was less than one-dimensional. Hard to believe that after nine rewrites the film was still as mind numbingly stale as the train wreck I've seen. I can not express in words of anger I felt, sitting through it. My friends and I were more in the final scene of the game, so we went to the premiere in Washington City, Utah. Kurt Hale, the director, was there, and I must say, I avoided contact with him after the show. He was waiting at the door, seemingly ready for feedback. I could not bring myself to tell him that his film is not only frustrated a good hour and a half of my life, but it left a nasty, painful scar that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> Here are some specific issues that I had: There was a little story of love story between a janitor and plump pianist, but these two characters come out of nowhere, and it was impossible to take care of, so that my friends and I were left constantly wondering why we had to take care of these two lame, uninteresting characters. There were a lot podagovorov that popped up every now and then, each promises the audience a chance to laugh, but every one of them have come and gone in a puff of smoke, and the last before you could even start caring. It was pretty much like the whole movie felt. <br /> <br /> This film was a major disappointment, and I feel bad for all those who are waiting for the first real funny movie Mormon. However, this joke is not too exclusive for Mormons. Again, it is difficult to say that this is a joke, and that the loud ringing sensation in the ears. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie. Keep in mind, the fantasy that this film is hilarious. Save yourself the frustration I went through
