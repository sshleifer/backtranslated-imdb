this film is clearly done poorly, and in a hurry. I understand that the financing of any such film is hard to find. However, if the story had any kind of precursor someone would have seen that it has received the necessary funding, it was not so, and films like this are not necessary in themselves and have no meaning in existence. The plot of this film was made, and to do better, I might add, a lot of times. There's no reason to make a movie that has no chance to compete with any other. I was informed by my computer, I need at least ten lines to represent my comment so the following lines just bull, to fill the space. In my opinion, there is no need for anything else to say about this film. what I have said a lot, and if you spend enough time reading this review, than for God's sake, do not spend more time watching this movie. The only exception to this rule is if you're the kind of person who likes to watch bad movies that are playable on WOMENS entertainment network at 2:00 am, in this case to go forward to see what I care about.
