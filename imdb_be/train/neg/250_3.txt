Seeing the three different versions of the same movie, I'm afraid for me it is definitely the weakest, primarily because of the rather dull and leaden performance Scott. His emotion around so fresh, which makes it difficult to participate in the film. Alastair Sim portrayed the role much better. If Scrooge was his vile, you do not get the feeling of Scott says dialogue with great conviction and when it undergoes its metamorphosis it is similarly unconvincing. I can not think of actors in this film, which correspond to the version of the Alistair Sim. Even the musical version (and openly Muppets) take on it is better performed. Very disappointing.
