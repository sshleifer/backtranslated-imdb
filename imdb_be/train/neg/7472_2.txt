This show seemed to be some kind of good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress, and I like a series of police, but somewhere in the production of this program has gone terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the authors should have more suspect than one, you know who did it every time !!!!! This makes it boring. The main character is incredibly annoying, and it is not believable in any way. I know that they wanted it to be tough, but Shes mean, stupid and a bad boss. Crimes uninteresting and fresh, and it's just lame all the way. As mentioned above, I hate .... <br /> <br /> In general, it was a big disappointment and very poor indeed ...
