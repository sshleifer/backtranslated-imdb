I watched it with my girlfriend after a stumble and zaping channels. <br /> <br /> I think we both hoped for some nice happy family Christmas movie, but were very disappointed. <br /> <br /> actor plays a soldier, it seems 0 emotions in general, his face looks as if it had been chopping trees, seeing the girl he loves to be kissed by her boyfriend, and he happily surprised girl he likes, he is terrible actor, and neither did any of the Pont we do nothing but laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is the pretty blonde girl, endowed with the ability to calculate the sliders and deceive her boyfriend, which is a catch! and her ambition in life is to live with their parents and rely more points. <br /> <br /> So that's basically the story of a guy with no emotions or feelings, who falls in love with a guy who count points and cheats on her boyfriend, it's so predictable, how to get it, and really a waste time, you will not get anything, watching it, except for some strange laugh, because it's all so corny. <br /> <br /> I love when her father says that he only eats fries, not French wine, and they all laugh, it is the ratio of the film highlander about, except when my friend's dad had been bossing around me, as I would tell him a thing or not but our army veteran, no, sir, he did not let his boss everyone around. <br /> <br /> in the film is that the first blood would have been if John Rambo were burned, as the biggest wimp in the world.
