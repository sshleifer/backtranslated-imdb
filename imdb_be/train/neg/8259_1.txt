I have seen this film way back when he was prime minister. <br /> <br /> It is based on the idea that autistic children can communicate with typed out messages with someone just helping them and guiding their hands. <br /> <br /> and suddenly these children, many of whom were not even watching the keyboard or screen, if the messages were recruited from (they may be looking at the ceiling in some cases), but their moderators were looking at the keyboard , began to pick up reports of abuse by parents or other persons, sending parents and guardianship authorities in proberbial excitement, left and right. <br /> <br /> This whole thing has been proved the fallacy of the third party submitted a folder, opened it to the child and said: "enter the picture you see," then, as the leading master turned folder, the fold will fall down, opening still another picture. <br /> <br /> Thus, while a child might have seen the dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Every time ,, every lousy time, the name typed picture was that the watching moderator, never what it has been shown that child. <br /> <br /> So who did the typing? Never child. <br /> <br /> This film also took a catastrophic turn to, as shown in the Australian poster, the man who molested a child in the film was in the situation of trying to help the child. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert never put his son in the wrong place, he would not have clung to that said film. It was better under her leadership. <br /> <br /> When I turn the child to your organization for help, and he gets clung instead, do you think I'm going to be interested to listen to anything you have to say after that? It does not look like! I think it's safe to bet that all of these indictments are reports that these children have been printed, this film was based on, they never blame someone for their work as was the case here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I do recall that the film gave very good results from the Gilbert as autistic mother, but other than that, the movie is not really that much. <br /> <br /> The worst was far from child typing on end to Patty Duke, and we hear a mechanical voice to read back what he typed ,. ,,,, "We won!" This child was molested. If you cut my leg, and I take you to court and you are found guilty of harming me, attack anything, it is legal justice, but it does not bring my leg back. <br /> <br /> The best, in my condition, I will consider it as a hollow victory. <br /> <br /> Whatever chance for the child that is perceived as normal with autism alone, except that suffered from the molestation. <br /> <br /> a "normal" child has enough to fight against such practices. <br /> <br /> This is a completely superficial to think that you have to look at every situation and go "we won" if the person is found guilty in court. <br /> <br /> Just bad handling of the situation and the circumstances all the way around here.
