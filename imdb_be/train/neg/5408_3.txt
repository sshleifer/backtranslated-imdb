This review is basically all SPOILERS. If you plan on enjoying this film does not read this review. <br /> <br /> This is a problem with the TV children now. It's all so condescending and patronizing. `Wow, that was fun, was not it? No, it was not. And, unfortunately, it seems, gets into children's films as well. And that is what "Flying Reindeer» is all about. However, I have not seen "Flying Reindeer» for several years, so that I might be vague on some points, but I remember how carefully to hit him at the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, the story behind the teacher, who gave the book for Christmas. Now, the teacher is a respected scholar on the flying habits of some animal. I think it was Bullfrogs. In any case, through this book, master teacher / family man learns that the deer can fly just like Bullfrogs. It seems that this book was written by scientists many centuries ago, which disappeared at the North Pole. Now, if it were me, I'd throw the book out of the nearest window. Flying Bullfrogs is a natural phenomenon, but the flying reindeer is fantastic and completely unrealistic notion. But, Mr. teacher I did not, so I guess that explains why he decided to fly to the North Pole, leaving his wife and child at home, with no idea where he had gone. Of course, things go awry, and before he knows it, a flying deer ran into his private plane and he stranded at the North Pole. <br /> <br /> You're still after that? All right. <br /> <br /> His family, of course, devastated. I would also, I mean, what sucks tacular Christmas. Elsewhere, Mr. teacher is in the hidden city in the North Pole, populated by dwarfs and a tyrannical figure, dressed only in red and white. Instead of immediately running as I would have done, he meets there all with open arms. This hidden civilization of small monsters, and he welcomes them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. It feeds him the story that they are the elves of Santa Claus, and they spend all year round production of toys for children, they have no idea exist. And Mr. teacher takes it all. He even admits that Santa Claus is actually a scientist, who disappeared two hundred years ago or something. There's only one problem - they do not want him to leave. The world may not know the secret of their existence. In the end, before they would know it would not be McDonald's and Starbucks on every street corner. <br /> <br /> Still with me? <br /> <br /> Currently, Mr. nice guy's family found the book and suggest that he had gone to the North Pole. Boy, if they are taken aback when they learned that he just went for a walk? Before the audience knows it, they are streaming to spend Christmas in most of these winter wonders on the planet. At the same time, Mr. speaker ill all arrogant Lilliput and decides to leave. I do not remember exactly, but I remember him holding Santa Claus gun. The fire fight when attacked dwarfs and he manages to escape through the sleigh of Santa Claus. With Santa on his heels and bloodlust in his eyes, Mr. Whatever, through some miraculous coincidence, is to fly close to the plane of his family who is looking for him. Thus, he jumps on them plane planes flying back and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The fact is there are some shocking films made in the name of Christmas for many years, but because they have something festive charm they get along with him. And that's what the charm, which is completely devoid of the "Flying Reindeer» There is not much wrong with it; anything that insults the intelligence of (well, obviously, does not exist, but it is a film of children and, therefore, can get away with such things) or anything particularly annoying, but the problem is that there is nothing special about this right too. He just does not feel festive. And for a movie that's all about Christmas, it's a pretty big drawback. But hey, I do not think that the "Flight of the deer kind of target audience of this? Why would they? They're all so doped on the sedative, they probably can not mean `Christmas' <br /> <br /> I give it three out of ten. If it was a TV movie, I would like to add two more stars on it. We all know how bad they can get.
