We were suspicious, to find that only two minutes to hang up we were the only ones there. Only five were joined by others prior to the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> There's nothing at all to redeem this film. Actions terrible (especially the Hurley). Scenario banal. The consequences we have seen a million times. Directing the worst that we have seen. Meandering and inconsistent. No one laughed, including children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would have been sooner if my wife did not go for a hot dog !!! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this film. If nothing else, to view your movie, then buy some drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and some people watching. You'll have a much more enjoyable time !!! <br /> <br />
