This film is not very good.In fact, it is the worst Elvis movie I have seen.It very little plot, basically, parties, beer drinking and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez wasted. I do not know why they did it movie.You can say Elvis was wasted, and it is much, much better in «Follow That Dream.»
