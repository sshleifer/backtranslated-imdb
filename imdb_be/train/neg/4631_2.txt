Though Misty Ayers (burlesque stripper) is certainly attractive as lead blonde, this film is just an excuse to allow her not to strip to their underwear a few times (no nudity in 1954, when this film was made, not 1965). <, Br /> <br /> The man who hires her to work in a brothel recalls Bud Abbott with Abbott and Costello. Most of the other women are unattractive, and drunken woman is a semi-funny in a horrible way. <br /> <br /> And 2 out of 10. Ms. Ayers has curvacious physique, but you can not judge any artistic talent, because the whole film after duplicate. Some of these "movies exploitation", as a rule, are made later than this, interesting in some ways, but it's really boring festival. Sid Melton (make room DADDY) directed. There are some Samurai face similar expressions and interesting apartments, but really nothing here.
