What a terrible movie. I love monster click, but I could not see even half of hardcore action, cardboard characters and bottomless effects. There's nothing about this film sacrificial. The symbols come either from the endless supply of suicide foolish cannon fodder or are meaningless, sad sock puppets. The plot template, cut and paste, the standard scientific nonsense introductory amok. Even CGI's awful. You know it's bad when you can not even depend on the film to ensure good eye candy. No surprises here, just old same old. This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. Directed by Roger Corman should be suspended with lightpost, so that children can use it as a Pinata.
