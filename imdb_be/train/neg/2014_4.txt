I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was a cool thing that I've seen. This ultra high-tech for its time. This may reflect the enemy's fire, do all sorts of acrobatics in the air, and to remove almost anything his way. Now I go back and look at it today, and I wonder how lousy this show really is. Members threw hardly convincing, there are a lot of bad moments and action scenes look incredibly fake. Almost each end has the same helicopter combat crap to explicitly re-grained low quality footage. Lot of stories is available today from the era of the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has basically the same theme like Knight Rider, with the exception of the fight against crime is a choice of car by helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I was completely bored. However, I love the theme music.
