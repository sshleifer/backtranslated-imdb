My first full Heston movie. The movie, which everyone already knows the ending. A "Sci Fi Thriller". Mannerism factor. Anything goes with this film was put into my head when I shot him in the morning, I watched it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that I was in (not wanting to move. Put your player, hide in blankets). And though I tried to understand what is going to lead to the final, which will be forever ruined pop culture, it simply does not actually do it. It was all over the place, the relationship did not have a spine, the ending did not lead. It was just sort of there in some bizarre way, and the observer has no choice but to leave the partially stunned the end, that he receives, because even though we all know that it is people, it is quick answers, why people do what any serious attempt to enjoy the movie on anything other than nonsense thrown out the window.
