Elephants Dream was supposed to be a flagship project open source. And although it was a very interesting idea in concept, in fact it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful, that's probably the only redemptive factor. A huge problem with them, however, the vast overruse flowering light. It's awful, but I believe it helps to give the film a dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is a terrible voice. While Proog voice actor, at least partially competent, EMO voice actor terrible. I think if you have the budget, which basically boils down to zero, you can not afford to hire a real voice actors. It seems to me that they had hired one of the animators to make your voice. <br /> <br /> In general, the film does not really go anywhere. I think it's more like "see what we can do" kind of film instead of the actual film. The plot does not go anywhere and not really showing any interesting point. The whole movie feels like it was made as a basis to make the look interesting area. <br /> <br /> In general, it may be necessary to quickly download from the official site, but nothing more than pretty graphics are not expected.
