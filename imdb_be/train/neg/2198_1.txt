The scientist and his girlfriend went out behind the wheel when his speeding leads to a car accident. He escapes unharmed, but she was beheaded. He rescues her head and brings him to his house and keeps it alive (!!!!). He then goes on to explore the model and stripper for a perfect body for the head. His crippled assistant monitors the head, which begins to speak and has a telepathic (or telepathetic) link to a deformed monster was kept in the closet .... <br /> <br /> As you can see, it's pretty stupid things, but I had certain attachment thereto. When I was growing up in the late 1970s, a local television channel showed the film 20 times each year (no exaggeration). They have shown, it is always on a Saturday afternoon TV - Uncut. Seeing it on TV then it was great! Obvious blood and blood, together with the terrible monster and sloppy sexploitation - who cares if it was good? Seeing that I now realize how filthy it is in fact. <br /> <br /> To act perfectly miserable, the value of production does not exist, the script is pretty dull and (aside from still pretty disgusting gore) is dull stuff, there is also a soft cat fight between the two women and admittedly big monster at the end. Also, add in the final, which leaves a ton of loose ends. On the one hand, it is an interesting example of 1960s film operation. On the other it is completely rubbish. In any case, this is not a good film, but you need to see (once) to horror and gore fans. <br /> <br /> Also, head laughter is pretty terrible. Pay attention to the end credits which receive the title is wrong (calling him "the chief that would not die")!
