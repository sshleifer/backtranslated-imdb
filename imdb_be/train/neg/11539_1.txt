This is the biggest load of crap I've ever seen for a long time. The last time when I hated the movie so it was a lot while watching "28 Days Later" and "Magnolia." There is absolutely no sense of this film, except to see some really sick and twisted sex / violence, Gillian Anderson, freeing themselves by the roadside, and every sentence of dialogue, which is used «F» word at least a couple of times in it. It has a very cheap, and the current is very low budget. My friend and I eventually ruled the film about half an hour. We tried to give him a chance, but nothing could save the CRUD. DO NOT SEE THIS !!!
