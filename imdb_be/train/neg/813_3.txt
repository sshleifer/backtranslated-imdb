The biggest one, what the hell is an error of me that they say takes Zues Dutch team. But she speaks German with him. These 2 suffers are quite different, it is said "well it takes the French team," and start to speak Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor entirely a detective in the least degree. Role just does not suit him, even if it is correct to be a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many stereotype / predictable things. A typical comment, or treatment. <br /> <br /> If you do not look at these things, I think it might be a good movie to see if it ever on TV. But I would not be suggesting to rent it.
