Despite the fact that this film certainly has the stench of bad film, it is surprisingly watchable on several levels. Firstly, for old movie fans, it's interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger (no relation to Mika). While Jagger later went to a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even won an Oscar in this category for 12 hours High), here his performance is truly unique, because it actually has a full head of hair (I've never seen it this way before), and because he was the worst actor in the film. This movie just goes to show that if the actor can not act in his early films, does not mean that he can not, after all, to learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (silver CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The second reason to see the movie is to shift all his cheesiness. Drafting bad, bad acting and bad effects. For example, if an unnamed Cambodian Jagger and are making their way through the water, it is obvious that they really just walking on the ground and against a background of weak projected behind them. Besides, as soon as they leave the water, they are 100% dry suits !!! Eerie continuity and mindlessly bad dialogue have a lot throughout the film - so it's hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi and George Zucco filming - because they both starred in many films of class-d horror, in many ways it It would be a perfect example for a film class about how NOT to make a film. <br /> <br /> Thus, while giving it a 3, probably a little too generous, it's fun to laugh and short, so it pays to look for the bad moviegoers.
