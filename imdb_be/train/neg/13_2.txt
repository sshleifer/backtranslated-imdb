Weak plot, predictable violence, only half interesting characters. As a writer (and one of the stars?) Was fictionalizing their screw ups and added incredulously imagination drugs and murder, to make it "hot". From a predictable and turnip house soundtrack to family conflicts, he acted badly, stereotypical, and ultimately very sad. Even the name has been done before - IMDb lists five movies of the same name, released in 2007-2008 year !! <br /> <br /> Note: I saw it on Showtime, which lists a synopsis for one of the other films. I was halfway through before I realized that no one was an undercover cop. Even tho another stereotype would have made interesting if it happened.
