I knew it was not gong work between me and D-wars since we met. His first name was too lazy. D War. How to write Dragon was too much for them. Besides ... you really can not be that special with the title, if your Blue Monkey. Blue monkey can do whatever the hell she wants. <br /> <br /> Second sign of the rocky relationship between us was a crazy story progression. Here's a movie, a dreamy guy reporter reports big serpentine paths breaks while he and Dad came, that was the competition for the store in the gremlin and dreamy child reporters box is glowing. Old shop Keep shows some terrible truths. It Bauraki supposedly evil dragon was a fool with his chance to become a god. It tells the child that he is the reincarnation of a warrior, and that somewhere in Los Angeles, is the reincarnation of his lover and gives him the harmful part values. Store hold also shows that, despite its apparent whiteness of it 500-year-old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, the dreamy reporter remembers it well and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl. CGI stick and jokes in the last ten minutes of my brain melts with my nose. Why? Continue on dear reader, if you have the balls. <br /> <br /> so Sarah reincarnation lover, have their own memories. I have the benefit of having an Asian best friend, and in the scene where she begins to worry and make a ton of posters with the characters on them, he tells me that the one who made this film does not have a clue what they are doing. Her Korean legend, and she was reincarnated with Korean princess, but all in Chinese. That same night, her dragon TAT starts to hurt, she calls the police because it looks as if it is a heart attack. See, in this crazy mixed up world they seem to handle heart attacks in different ways, because the next time we see her, she closed on the outside and the nurse asserts in his room with a security guard that she was mad. I have a new phobia now, and that if I was ever in trouble first responders just assume I'm going crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another point of contention with my harsh mistress, Dwar. There is a scene where Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) in the cafe "with an insolent black friend. In the previous scene annoyed Near divinity Bauraki killed an elephant, slid through the suburb and killed a friend of Sarah. See, people were afraid to go out after 9-11 happened, but we need more stringent then retreated coffee and cakes were worth risking our lives for. Business as usual, did a giant snake is not stopping me from getting my caffeine on. When I stay in and fear for their lives, the terrorists win and serpentine deities. <br /> <br /> After the dragon gave satisfactory in the helicopter battle my hard lover Dwar treats me to pi $$ and vinegar-filled stage to end it all with. Bauraki has a castle of his own and his rights in accordance with the LA, I think. They do not really say, but dreamy Reporter Sarah get knocked out in an accident, which would have killed a lesser man and when they wake up, and the Dragon Palace. some retarded dialogue after a good dragon serpent god comes out of nowhere and a snake battle / love regardless. And I'm not joking a good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think I blow it out of proportion, I'm not sure there is no mention of this thing in the movie suddenly ... there! After a few seconds, and become a good dragon dragon god Baurki set on fire, Sarah turns into a ghost and comes with Dragon-god, the dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere credits roll ... thank God, <br /> <br /> Now our relationship as rocky as it had its good times. There was a guy that looks like a chopper with a turtle and saying just as Tuskan Raider from Star Wars. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted when he wanted it just can not be useful. He could walk through a wall in the stage where it was no longer useful. He can go in your dreams, if it is not any good, and it could ignite ten random soldier boys in the fire, but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touch that harmful decoration. I love him, because he was hit by a car twice in the same stage and did fantastic Tuskan raider noise. <br /> <br /> actors, for the most part were great ... great if it meant terrible. Jason Behr, which I thought was strange, I slowly found in Roswell, I can act in only one way, and it's pretentious, spacious and Patrick Dempsey "ish". <br /> <br /> One thing I love about this dirty whore Dwars is its lead actor, Bauraki. It's a giant snake acted his heart. I would dare to say that he plays better CGI snake evil demigod then John Barrymore was playing Richard III or Hamlet. It was emotion in every scene, stealing the thunder from his supporting cast less death. When he had eaten an elephant, I felt that no one in the past, present or future ever eat an elephant with great feeling. He was more than an actor, he was a force of nature, and he put his heart and soul into every second of that damned project. But damn, my favorite actor in this film was a CGI snake. I have the balls to admit that not so? <br /> <br /> Here's to hoping Bauraki get more work done and not gain actor Jason Behr is a range of emotions of others, dreamy stare, and I never have to see the Blue Monkey again. <br /> <br /> Thus, D-War finished. I want my CDs back, and let's be friends
