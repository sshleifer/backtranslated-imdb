I thought before you start with this film, it may be good, but when I started it, I found it really badly. They said that the film is made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film was shot in India. you can see the Indian car production. you can see Lars drinking bisleri (Indian water brand), Hindi, written on the road, you can also see the temples in Afghanistan * haha ​​* it's really funny, and many other things, which proves that it was not shot in Afghanistan. I think we should not waste his / her time watching this movie .. pure waste time .. I would recommend doing something else, instead of watching the movie, or maybe can heart a better idea, but do not look it is a waste of time
