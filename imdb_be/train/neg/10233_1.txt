If you think of captivity, many words come to mind. Among them :. uninteresting, unentertaining, unsuspensful, unsexy, incomprehensible and unwatchable <br /> <br /> I hate these movies from the mid to late nineties, which were mostly stolen from Scream, but these new Saw forgery begin to make these films look like on the classics. They still indulge the same demographic that these other films have been so successful in the execution, but now they have added a new level of degeneration, which make twelve to fourteen year old girls are focused on feeling as if they are hardcore and hip. <, Br /> <br /> This film is boring shit load! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name was not attached to anything good since 1993! Nevertheless, I was still surprised to see that he had nothing to do with something bad it is! I was surprised when someone love interest in the film turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Does anyone knows when they first saw him? Only those who have never before in my life, ever seen another movie!
