Not the best of movies to watch today. I have read many reviews about the brilliant and expected it to be very good. But this film disappointed me. Sound and the environment has been good, but there was no story here. Nor was there a moment of fear. I expect that is a thriller horror film, but there was no not terrified thriller. The only scene where I was afraid to change the head of the scene shows the "environment". There are many pieces I film. Most things remain unexplained with nothing to link it to anything. History does not tell us about women, or other scenes that show. It can be a good movie to watch in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.
