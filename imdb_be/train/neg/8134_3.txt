A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go out to the desert for a picnic on a honeymoon. It seems that he hears a strange noise, and it is broken at the sight of a bat crawling through them a picnic blanket. He wants to go on a tour of the cave, which has something to do with some kind of work he does, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She relents. They go on a trip, but left the group to understand. She falls down the hill, where it is broken by insects. He follows her. Again he hears a strange noise, and seems to know the bat is approaching; one does, and gets in her hair. He fights with him from her, and she attacked him, biting him on the forehead. <br /> <br /> They come out of the cave, but if they are in a gondola at a ski resort, it starts to seizures, in which he has hallucinations or visions bats attack people. He gets angry when this happens. He can not drink alcohol without spitting it. His wife is worried about rabies, and it starts the Pasteur treatment for it, but reacts violently to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people are killed. We see the transformation of the human person at bat. It seems that it is not only in his head. If a bat bite causes these changes is not clear, since it already has some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> While the name seems ironic sense in the end, the same thing happens to other people. Not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of places of the desert, caves, and the ski slopes, and some of the more surprising scenes. I do not think it was as bad as other people do, and I do not think that the 1999 Bat movie was so bad as others think that either (I estimated that one in 5/10).
