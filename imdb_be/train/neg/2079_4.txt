I'm a huge fan of Ivan Reitman's Evolution-I loved and who did not want to Ghostbusters? From the trailer, you already know that the Uma character will get cleared Luke's.So capacity is clearly up to the moment when she unleashes her superpowers to him.But Redemption is simply not throwing there.The shark managed to get a (small) giggle, but then again, it's all it was in the trailer. <br /> <br /> No one does panted just like minds and LL Owen diet it good days.If Sun Riann Wilson, would you sit there with a smile lock until the cheeks are starting cramp.This is a comedy, right? <br /> <br /> It's not terrible, it just sits there like a stale cracker behind fridge.This could be such brilliant promise with Superhero movies and feminism, but not both counts.Let look when Jason Reitman can save name.
