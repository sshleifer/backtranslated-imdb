This video tutorial was a masterpiece of 1995 Nicely done! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have great chemistry on screen, when they talk about what makes the Start button. I'm waiting for Microsoft to release a special DVD edition complete with deleted scenes, commentary, Bill Gates, a documentary about how Windows 95 can be compared with Windows XP and more <br /> <br /> In general: 10/10 (must win by at least a Golden globe)
