Good films original, some leave a message, or touch you in a way, but sometimes you're not in the mood for it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, without thinking just play when I watched it. He started good and was very interesting, so why the bad review. Well, in the end, the film lost that trust. The storyline is not that cheese at all, the effect was not too special, but overall good, acting in order, so that more than enough to meet my needs. But all were drawn destroyed, because everything happened so that it was on top, and he left me with a bad feeling. They should have put a little more effort in the creation of all the concrete and got to 7 in the "do not think just action" category. Thus, in conclusion, if you know you'll get irritated because something happens that seems completely counterintuitive: Do not look! Otherwise, I'd say go ahead ...
