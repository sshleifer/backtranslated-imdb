This series is getting worse and worse. Poorly written and just not funny! The room is fine, but the lack of experience of the writer shines. Trying so hard not to offend anyone, they end up offending everyone. Now in the second season of a desperate throw stopped waving his arms and turned to this condescending, smug, "Oh, you're crazy" style of action that comes with not laugh scenario. They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say, we are not stupid? Is not it funny? Well, no, not really. Gum disease is less painful. Not surprisingly, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians do not avoid Canadian television. Let CBC you suppose that our master station showcasing the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateur mess.
