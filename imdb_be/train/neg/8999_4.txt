Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon and SCTV alumnus together in a sometimes amusing sketch film. <br /> <br /> However, it is very interesting to watch now, in early 2005. Twenty years after the film should take place, look at how much fun they have become exactly: There mock trailer for a movie that, probably was not even clever at the time, something called "pregnant" which came true Arnold Schwarzenegger's silent movie "Junior" There is a commercial fraud, which probably was not even clever at the time, something with the image of Sammy davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called «Celebrity Wrestling», which is now come true with a popular show called «Celebrity boxing" exists mock trailer for a movie that is not even probably was smart at that time, that shows John Candy in a movie about a severed head. Watch this trailer and see how it looks like it's pictures and story are Basket Case Frank Hellenlotter in !! Finally, the ad at the end of the end of the show a documentary about the "dead sleep, only two remained ..." The name of the documentary ... Last Hippie! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecy come true!
