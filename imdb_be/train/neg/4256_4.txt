Ascension is actually a step forward in terms of the fact that the original film was in history and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the Count himself (if you remember it, it was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is funny as Luke, a child who helps the woman he loves, by far Drakuly steal body from the plate. Diane Neal good as the woman who steals the body of Dracula to find medicine for his dying boyfriend, and Stephen Billington big as Dracula himself. Providing better performance than Gerard Butler made the count in the original film. Roy Scheider shots of the other actors in this film, and it does a decent job as a teacher's character Jason Scott Lee. It is the second sequel in the trilogy, and they go to a good start. It's in the air, whether the last film to close the series on a good note.
