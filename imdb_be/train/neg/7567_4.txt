Story: Young-gun girl, whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a psychiatric hospital after she begins to believe that she was actually a cyborg. In the institution she meets Il-sun Park, a young man who develops a relationship with her. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this, you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park. But "I'm A Cyborg ... great departure from the familiar, and (unfortunately) more territory. I'm a big fan of any film or story that is trying to do something else. God knows we all get exposed enough shit in our local theaters. The main thing about the film I have to say that he can not say anything about mental illness, or create characters that you care about. <br /> <br /> This story should be one of the most amazing things I 've seen in years. .. but there are not enough. There's no heart in the movie ... but surrealism and confusion. confusion and, it seems, the main theme of the film. The characters all trying to sort out their own problems, but the Chan-Wook Park, which is the most confused of them all.
