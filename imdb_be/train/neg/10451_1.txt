I'm sick and tired of all the little weenies continues about how the movie "rocked". This is pure CG over the current crap! Nya Send out Slayer, it's much more reasonable to smuggle hundreds of bright, aggressive, venomous snakes on a plane! The only reason why people like this movie, because they feel that they need. It is not "so bad it's good" is so bad, I would like to be poked in the eye with a sharp stick is then subjected to it again. I honestly thought it was going to be like an airplane COMEDY! Parody! I was wrong. It's that whole "it sucks, get it!" Or, Samuel A. Jackson shouts "Snakes on a Plane things !. Well, I'm sorry, I do not understand. It looks like a bunch of wimps film industry gave more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard. If you spend money to watch a movie in the company of one and the same people who bought the disc, William Hung, still lives in his Mom basement and stink of the plastic of the day sweat chair on the computer, playing online games and watching porn then rush to the theater and ask for one (since I doubt that you have a girlfriend) ticket for Snakes on a plane stupid butt. Fuck films as Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 monkeys, clerks, etc. There is no irony in watching good movies. the real decline of Western civilization. Calling this cult film is not an insult to the real classics Cult as a man Repo, or even Orgazmo. I have said enough here.
