This film reminds me of "Irreversible (2002)," another art work with the film is tough and radical approach of human nature. I do not like the movie, but I can not say that this is a bad movie, it's just special. I remind myself, too, "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where a bunch of low-class figures of camp residents on the sea in Belgium. The same description of people who live together, side by side against their will and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match with each other. I also thought about the books by French writer Emile Zola, who was the author of a style that is naturalism. I do not like the movie, and I do not like people who are in it. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One might ask, why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet as a part of a great farce, forced to live against their will. Or you could say: the devil in this world.
