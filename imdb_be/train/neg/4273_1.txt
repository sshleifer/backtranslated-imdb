There's nothing unique about any show or movie. Which is a prequel to the TV show that is not found everywhere in life and entertainment. And to David Lynches disgusting story style, and after. <br /> <br /> Since, when the body is thrown mislead poor girl on the beach. And, being introduced in some of the most mind numbing shadow immoral nature of Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> In order to numb the mind almost pedophilia disgusting the way the film seems to romantic talk about the destruction of human life through some occasional psychedelic effects in the film Twin peaks: Fire Come walk with me. <br /> <br /> I've been watching all this just to make sure I had nothing. I did not. It's just one male explicit sexual fetish extends to a long series of fallow ridiculous overly pornographic film. Save your self the agony of suspense and watch something else, that at least has the ability to tell a story, and then tempt you to some of the mental porn film. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of feedback, rants and raves about how great David Lynch. Due to its ability to determine pain and tragedy and makes it into some beautiful things. This is not life imitating art, as well as some sick, twisted version of the art of doing everything possible to inspire completely meaningless life. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this waste.
