very good story, a good buzz ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? very well done and a good story broken in the last seconds ... sorry to say, but 1 vote ... that's what it deserves, I would think that Chris Shadley could come up with a better ending ... but maybe next time: ) are pointless blood clotted blood for nothing? end will lift this story to close to 10, but this is not the end .... ruined the whole story, I think most people do not lame, and when they go to your movie needs a good ending, even if it's difficult ... but only here the end of the lame excuse ...
