Swing! this is an important film because it is one of the remaining Black-production and the projection of films of the 1930s. Many of these films just deteriorated so badly that they were unwatchable, but this one is in pretty good shape. It's also a good chance to see the many talented black artist only after the period of blossoming of the old Cotton Club -. Once all but forgotten today <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some wonderful performances, this is also a mess. The main plot is very similar to Hollywood musicals era - including the diva who is about to destroy the show unknown and unexpected, which comes out of no where to save the day. However, a letter just a god-awful and a bit cheesy at times - and projects the image of black America that some might find a little humiliating. This is because before the story really gets going, you are treated to non-account bum who lives for his hard working wife (the popular stereotype of the time), and if he is caught with Jose (which, incidentally, is completely overplaying the role) they have a fight, which looks like a scene out of WWE Smackdown! Moreover, a lady wants to cut another lady with a razor - a bad scene actually! Later in the film, when the diva behave disgracefully, her husband slaps her on the face, and all applaud it! It looks like a movie from time to time, he wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator audience PLUS they can not even do it well. - some of the worst acts I've seen in a very long time <br /> <br /> However, if you can look past crappy production in almost every way (with bad characters, bad acting and bad direction and writing form), this one might be worth a look, so you can see the beautiful singing and dancing crane --as well as a glimpse of forgotten black culture. Just do not say I did not warn you about acting - it's very, very bad!
