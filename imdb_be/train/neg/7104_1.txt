The producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for those who die of fear while watching this film. They were offered intensive therapy to those who really enjoyed this bitch. A young couple moved into the house, where a woman who looks like a woman from a pair lived. Very sad and very predictable. In the end, I ended up not caring about who in this film. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs.
