I have seen this film way back in the first theatrical release, it is justified in an empty theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this one still sticks out in my mind is clear, as the worst movie of all time; or, at least, the worst that I have allowed myself to watch. <br /> <br /> The current far below the standards set by any random group of drunken high school students pulled into the street and forced to examine their line in 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while, as each stage hit new lows. But after a while, even that dubious pleasure vanished, and he just has to be very boring.
