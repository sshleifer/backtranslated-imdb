dream art house in Maven. Overrated, overpraised, exaggerated; pretentious m√©lange that not only deserves the best picture of 1951 in the deserts, it outshines the competition from the start. Place in the Sun, a detective story, A Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; You name it, when it came out in 51, it's better than it's arthouse crapola. The final ballet nonsense intellectual crowd, and ridiculous in the wrong movie. Few actors in his time were less able (if existing) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 Worse 51 (I saw 201 films), and among the 5 worst winners Oskara`.
