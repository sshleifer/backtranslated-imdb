You never heard of Taiwanese horror film? Or any Taiwanese film? Propably for a reason. This one was really a sad one, even if it is black magic, including dried children's bodies and people exploding from the inside thousands of acne. <br /> <br /> After reading other peoples thoughts, I look forward to some kind of violence and blood, but there is not much at all. Some vomit blood and other lame things, if you expect the graphics gusset or any terrible effects, you'll be disappointed. They obviously do not use up the explosion and other things to them as powerful <br /> <br /> Almost nothing good about this movie. One sign was completely bland and somewhat OK black magic spells as one eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. Aspect horror does not work at all, the worst was an albino girl (not so bad in fact). This is the worst Asian horror film I have ever seen.
