Oh, it's really really. I've seen movies that I loved the most, due to some reason, but I have never seen a film that simply fails in every aspect of filmmaking. He can not even fail in making the film, in a way Hercules in New York can be told to do. This is not a movie that I like the least, but it is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> To act is the first thing that strikes you. I have never seen a worse film acted beyond pornography. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic films, which acted a damn site better than that. This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, this is terrible. The camera-work is amateurish. Editing is meaningless. I believe that they could not afford a proper sound equipment, and this meant that every scene in the car (and there are many of them) have their driving about three miles per hour and in every scene, the same area of ​​forest set on the outside (and there are many of them, too) is actually dubbed the studio, lending again more bad porn vibe. <br /> <br /> the story is meaningless, as many have already noted. I will protect the vampires to walk in the daytime by the fact that in spite of his popularized Nosferatu, it never was originally an integral part of the vampire mythology. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the vampire myth, the author, apparently reading Carmilla, or at least have seen the vampire lover. I'm not sure how I feel about it, swinging from the strong impression that the film has this pathetic, at least some desire for Gothic novels I loved; or irritable ITS at best reference sledgehammer and in the worst case of complete defilement starting material. At the very least, "General" is an affront to Peter Cushing, though. <br /> <br /> It gets two stars, but only because I can not bring myself to vote one star for the film, which has at least want to have, like vampires and zombies in it. By the way, I looked Lifeforce (another movie that has little vampires and zombies in it) on the same day as it is, and in spite of the fact itself, and the shortcomings of the film, in fact, comes a masterpiece compared to this. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, it's not a film so bad it's good or bad, it is in any event a pleasure, even drunk. It's just a mess, and worth the time no one is watching.
