Even for tired cinema models like nature versus human cycle that has prevailed so largely in the 1970s, the ants fall miserably short to be even more effective (not even enter the entertainment for the reasons). It is sooooo ridiculous. Obviously, these ants that a bulldozer nearby yard eating toxic waste for decades, and now adapted releasing poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites have deadly. Watching an actor of some renown clumsily falls on the background of small black dots hurt funny in a not very good, but very poorly. So many scenes just look ridiculous: a boy is trying to get into the dumpster while the attack, Suzanne Somers, screaming in terror, resting in bed, Foxworthy and Linda George breathing through the pieces of wallpaper, Bernie Casey forgery GAM leg, and the list goes on and on. Danger showed ranges of ants crawling on the leakage to the black line of ants on the wall. The cast for the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors do not seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror. I hope that she has found a good use of money, because it is obvious that the only reason why a woman of her pedigree would be folly. Although it is quite a bad film, it is watchable - a time for me, and really have a lot of these bad qualities seventies film - start studded cast embarrass yourself, that made-for-TV experience, and terrible creatures of nature stinking revenge on humans. At this time, a person should stick your hand into a pile of ants that will be affected. Actually quite horrible.
