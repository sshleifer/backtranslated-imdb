This is the worst rip-off one movie houses that I have ever seen! See Part 1 and two, but do not let anyone say that it is better than the first two! I mean, really, you're not doing the film, then make a sequel with the same characters and the actors, and then make another sequel with different characters and actors! I mean, it would be good if it wan't in the "Home Alone" movies, but they do it Home Alone movies. Culkin was too old, so you suggest to stop the flow! My God, this movie I feel sick! Buy Part 1 and 2.
