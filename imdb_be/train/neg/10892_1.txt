This movie is awful! I do not even know where to start, I was speechless, I can not even describe how horrible it is. Blood fluorescent primarily, and the action is HORRIBLE! The only good part was the biker chick who saves the day. This movie was funny, I do not see how it can even get 1 vote it so bad. It appears that this was done Highschool students.
