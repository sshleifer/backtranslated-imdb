One of the film's distinguishing drunk hackneyed plot and to be a good, working less than an Oscar-caliber. But for me the most terrible drawback was a complete distortion of the jet plane, and especially the 747. Some of the main mistakes: <br /> <br /> No 1 flight engineer (flight engineer station or even 2. Mis-identifying F-16 interceptors like the F -15 (however not resmblance) 3. Download the passengers in the "aft baggage compartment" presumably entrance from the cockpit - .. Even if such a department exists, putting so much weight that would be far from the plane unflyable feed 4.. hollow point bullets, which "do not damage the plane." 5. The whole procedure of landing was so bad I wanted to vomit. 6. SR-7 1 (all planes) with hatch sealing pressure 7. Opening the car door out - the wind - in flight !! <br /> <br /> Oh nuts, it was just a really lousy movie should make a list of the bottom of the '10..
