The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, in any case not a good movie, but I can not say that this is one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the film, as a formidable and sustained action scenes where Cage is looking for a Woman, hallucination, and then the other hallucinations, followed by sequence- dream hallucinations, etc. . But it is just not worth a stop, if we are talking about a film like this. Instead, here are five reasons why you should look for Wicker Man, despite the fact that it is bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It is difficult to deny that it has some really terrible ideas to it, the only problem cheese is unintentionally funny performance. If nothing else, this is a film that can inspire you to watch the original 1973 film, or even read a brief history on which it is based. <br /> <br /> 4. For cheese horror / thriller, it's really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that he was shot on the spot, rather than using a green screen or complex sets, so that we get to see some really great scenery. There are also many beautifully composed shots. This is a very beautiful film. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he was a force of nature. Whether you are a fan of it or not, it seems that it is impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy". There is always a certain eccentricity or nerdiness he brings the characters he plays, and I personally have always been fascinated by watching him in every film he makes. If Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, it always brings a unique energy to the game, and it's never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most beautiful kind of way. <br /> <br /> 2. The student could write a hell of a paper on this film, as it seems to be the strongest Antifeminism film ever made. "See?" You could write, "is what happens when women have the right to manage the company!" In addition, the similarity between this community «Summersisle» and bee colonies is quite interesting and worth noting. <br /> <br /> 1. If you are reading this, it is probably a good chance that you may have seen the YouTube video, which has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" from the film, including Cage runs in a suit bear, and, of course, the infamous «AAGHH !! Bees !! MY EYES !!! "line. These scenes are funny out of context, and they are still pretty fun watching them as a whole. <br /> <br /> I bought a movie DVD in Blockbuster used for about 5 dollars ... if you are working, that is about a dollar for a reason. This is a very good thing <br /> <br />. Note: The unrated version of the film is better to watch, and it's better to watch the theatrical version only for her little added to an epilogue that shows a cameo by James Franco.
