Inept, sad and incoherent supernatural "thriller" in which a college student Cassie (Seyzhmiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can not tell you how bad it is ... nothing any value is never nor ever any real entertainment value. I do not like the cast in this film - all of them, unfortunately, are not convincing (again, their role is not suitable). In order to promote this as a horror movie is a joke. Where scares? There's no point, or the unknown - there are some good songs, but that's about it <br /> <br /> How did this project get the green light.? Writer-director Steve Carpenter does not have a tangible vision or talent that I can feel. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the entire movie pointless. <br /> <br /> alleged "killer" cut, I watched it 86 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> 1/10
