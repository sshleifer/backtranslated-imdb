Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a review of films composed entirely of questions? Maybe it's him? Why an ancient civilization dig artifacts around the world? Why does not this question is not answered? Why is the opening text crawl incoherent? Why a nun (she sure looked good!) The hand more than 20 orphaned children to a madman? I have always been a gold mine in the center of Vancouver? Why one of the output shaft gold mine in the front yard of the orphanage? Why character Tara Reid suddenly appears in the Christian Slater apartment for sex? (Or am I just answered my own question?) Why not open an archaeologist Bach obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why modern computers still show the green network to the era of Tron outlines of objects, complete with small "bleeps"? And movie explosive timers must have digital displays? Why is nothing in this movie makes no sense?
