This shit is like watching paint dry. I was so disappointed because I wanted to see. <br /> <br /> There's just no point to this film. If this has not been done, no one would notice or care. It is bloated out of all the big names in it, but if you do not have to "draw", no one would have given this film is no love. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I was in the place where half-way through the film I would like to look at Vanessa Redgrave and think, "Hurry up and die already!" It's like a «Joy Luck Club» without damn joy either. Neither the "Ocean 13" (nothing but big names plaster) from mother to daughter, and the movie is completely anti-climatic ... oh, until it finally ended. <br /> <br /> I'm sure they are all nominated for an Oscar ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for the film and the ability to convince the great actress to make this stuff.
