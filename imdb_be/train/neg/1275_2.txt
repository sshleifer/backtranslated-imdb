This is a terrible movie. All three stories are bracketed with the hypnotist line psychiatrist who is an unnecessary, and they all are bad. Firstly, about the wild wolves, and some ladies, there are some things that do not make sense, but hypnotism that makes up for this. The second one, with poor Bill Paxton, like a maniac roommate should not be seen by anyone. The latter, unfortunately, the best is almost incomprehensible, which I guess is what makes it better than other debris.
