It follows the same path as most sequels. The first of them was great. Second it was average, and it is one full of bad actions and some silly dialogue and also a lot of suspension of disbelief, the film was weak. <br /> <br /> Too predictable, and I just could not stand that Henry Wrinkler -like boss with this stupid eye, there was much more they could do with it. I liked the first of many. I wish they would have gone down over the lines, rather than what they did here. <br /> <br /> There have been too many unexplained, you need to explain what period of time it was and why, why, why there is an old-fashioned telephone in the room? <br /> <br /> I understand that there is one in the works. <br /> <br /> Blah!
