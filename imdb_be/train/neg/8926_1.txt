I saw "Mayr Brekinrizh" when it first came out in 1970, I was a healthy 20-year-old at the time, who loves the movie and really liked Raquel Welsh. In addition, I read Gore Vidal novel it was based on, and thought it was very funny. I saw the film at a local screwing and about halfway through my strong temptation to turn the engine of my car on the way, perhaps, I would have died from smoke and do not see the rest of the shipwreck of the film, he was not "smart" or "trendy" it was a full and messy. All the actors and director of Hearing had no idea what he was doing. Casting Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in the history of cinema. As one reviewer said here, its role has nothing to do with the movie or book. Her character in the book knocked sexy young stud that would never do for the legendary Ms. West. No, the story is altered so that it hits him sexually, very believable from 77-year-old woman who looks every day of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
