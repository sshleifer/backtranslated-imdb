Two films useful for scaring people to God, and in this «Event Horizon». One has a significant and sharp message, the other one-dimensional, as a religious movie can get. It is a pity that Paul Anderson moved to the damned Resident Evil movie, it really was something going on. <br /> <br /> thief prevents many obvious attributes of independent film (acting, speaking, dialogue and persuasion) and it is obvious that the intention of the film is from the beginning. Christian film industry entirely learned from the failures of this, so we're stuck with Omega Code, backward and other films of the Tribulation. Their main element is that they are so concerned about the sale of their message, "will be saved, people!" With everything else in the audience becomes the second beating on the head with the Bible. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not believe I'm even writing this much about the film is ineffective. Skip it altogether and go back to Sam Neil dolt his eyeballs. 1 of 5.
