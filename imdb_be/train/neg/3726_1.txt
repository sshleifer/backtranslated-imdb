I was forced to watch this whole series of films, as a small child, and I was told that they were in fact! We are talking about child abuse. I would be less frightened of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this nonsense, and who want to indoctrinate their children in the same faith. Besides the obvious problems associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there are also bad actions, bad writing, and BAD "special effects". They just all around terrible, terrible movies. So, it seems (and terrible) with a child, but I can not imagine an adult purchase this shlock. Although, I must say that I would be interested in seeing them now as an adult. They may have a certain north / religious feel to them.
