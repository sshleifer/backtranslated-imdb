As usual, I make a mad dash to see the movies I have not seen even in anticipation of the Oscars. I'm really looking forward to seeing this film, as it seemed right up my alley. I can not for the life of me understand why this movie got the buzz he has. There's no history !! Group of guys meander around Iraq. Once they diffused a bomb here. Tomorrow they tooling around the village itself and at least begin to sniper fire. Many wait here they returned to Baghdad. There is no cohesive story altogether. The three main characters are so extremely characteristic, that they are merely caricatures. I mean, we have a sweet child who is afraid of death. We hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back into security. And then we have a desperate cowboy who does not follow the rules, but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy is trying to sell the DVD soldiers. How do you think will happen ??? Well, what do you think the cowboy soldier who does not follow the rules are going to get sweet baby injured with their rebellious ways ?? Why is it so! Do you think the Iraqi child soldiers that the cowboy has a soft spot for going to kill, and to make him go crazy? Why is it so! There's no story here. Scenario juvenile and predictable! Camera shake around a lot, to make it "pretentious". And for anyone who thinks it is such a big picture of the war, to rent «Full Metal Jacket», «Deerhunter» or "Platoon." Do not waste your time and money on this sad movie!
