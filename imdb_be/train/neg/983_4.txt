If Marlene Dietrich designated box office poison in 1938, one of the few actresses, so these professions work is movies like Garden of Allah. As the film can be so exciting is beautiful to behold and be quite sad without me. In addition, as Marlene when she is trying to expand its range and does not play a sexy woman stayed with the old-fashioned story of me. <br /> <br /> Garden of Allah, one of the first films in the modern novel tehnitsvetome was established at the turn of the last century, Robert Hitchens, who then worked on the game adaptation of Mary Anderson, who ran for 241 performances in 1911-12. Then he received two silent screen adaptation. The story of the monk who runs away from the convent from France to Tunisia to see some of what he missed in the world. It works in the same sheltered woman who was unmarried, and spent her prime years caring sick father. She is now traveling through the desert and the two meet on a train. <br /> <br /> The woman, of course, Marlene and fugitive monk Charles Boyer. I'm not sure what was in the form of Selznick in the filming of this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman would make it acceptable for the audience. But you can bet that movie publicity in 1936 when they plunked their money for a ticket, they expect to see Marlene as a modern day Salome, not a saint of the same name. The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino, and you can bet that it was some sort of desert romance and seduction, what they expected. <br /> <br /> As for the monks, you should remember that they are self-supporting in their monasteries, and this is especially a bottle of special wine of which Boyer happens one with a secret. The monastery will have to reconsider this economy, when Boyer leaves. Monks are sincerely pious group, and a man's head down on the Charles Waldron, they have the right to be a little concerned with some self-interest. <br /> <br /> In any case, many religious platitudes here get told by a pair of wires, which are in fact not suitable for details. Especially Marlene Dietrich. I would like to see this movie with an eye on the special color of the desert cinema and forget the plot.
