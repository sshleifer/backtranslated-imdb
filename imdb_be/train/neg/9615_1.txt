It seems clear from this adaptation, which he did not. Not only that, it will leave a portion of the back, he made his own! The fact that he decided to leave in such a ridiculously unbelievable that I was happy that he decided to withdraw from some of the most important parts of the novel. The site was vague, inconsistent and choppy to say the least. I do not want to say anything vile about the actors, but they can not act! Dickens was hard, of course, but it is pathetic! Micawber was no more than the mid-nineteenth century, Kramer, and talk less about Betsey Trotwood, the better! If you want to see a real Copperfield, watch the excellent 1999 BBC adaptation. As for the writer, I think that he had read the notes on Cliff!
