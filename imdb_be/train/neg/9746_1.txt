I remember this film exhibition in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, during the week. Although it may seem incredible, and I can not offer any explanation for this, this film was an exhibit in the theater, dedicated to art and cinema ... great quality (that is, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bunuel, and. .. projected Man). Few people saw it (Luckly people, no doubt), and no mention of this very boring film SF can be found in Peter Nichols science fiction Encyclopidie or about the author of the original novel. Very revealing. I remember about it, after all these years, nya-story, a lot of special effects, which seem ridiculous effects in fact, and nothing more. It seems that in some countries working time is 90 mm. and anothers 77 min. Well, this means that only a little more pain.
