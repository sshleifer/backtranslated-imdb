I'm kind of a supporter of the work of Miyazaki. I say "partially" because the majority of his films are divided into two categories: brilliant and sad. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the category later. <br /> <br /> This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as the recent film Miyazaki's "Howl's Moving Castle." An intriguing premise installed, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some inexplicable events, which serve only to confuse the plot and explain. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film shows the post -apocalyptic world history is set, and actually looks like a very interesting story about to unfold. Since then, things go down hill. The middle part of the film is mainly composed of thinly veiled environmental propaganda, and the ending is much marred by depending on the type impermeable spiritualism, which destroys a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> in general, the film feels as if someone has pulled every other page of the script, before handing it to the animators. What is left is that visually stunning (although unfortunately the version I saw was a copy of the Nth generation, with poor color - that leads to a common myth that Nausicaa is showing her naked back during the flight), but that makes little sense in ultimately left me confused.
