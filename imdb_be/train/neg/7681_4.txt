Sean, you know, I think you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can not thank you for it. Comedy just is not your strong point. <br /> <br /> However, this is not your fault. Some things are just too difficult to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to wonder where the lines came from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... I'm sorry.
