Muscular men with a monkey in the jungles of Africa opportunistic hunting expedition team; pretty daughter of the leader of the first team finds it. A lot of hype-tale version of Tarzan is OK production, but paralyzed in the worst direction alone the film that I have ever seen. John Derek deprived of the inspiration for the cheese action shots and slow motion pryatok-Boo glimpses of nudity wife Derek B; it has about the same talent behind the camera Ed Wood. Mocking attempt to sexuality, the Dereks lacks finesse, vibrant time and taste. They have a sense of self-parodies and hilarious failures (they throw caution to the wind), but after a promising opening it all goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (which may have been a marble in his mouth constantly) has a major role, but plays third fiddle ego of John Derek and feelings After Derek conceit. * From ****
