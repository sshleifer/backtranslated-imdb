I read the book several times, and this film is not necessary, just as it should be. I could let this slide, after the film. However, I have serious problems with the installation of the film. No one seemed to be saying that the film and the book it is based on based on real events that occurred in the state of Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city that the film should be based. First of all, the "small" city, who spoke about how the establishment, is the third largest city in the state. With a population of about 50 thousand. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Secondly scenery for the film is not so. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River. What is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me a mind to see my hometown, being treated so badly. It was a real event. Large sections of the city were destroyed. In the book, they talk about the bike ride from the island of Mormon Fonner Park. I think you could, if you do not mind 15 Mile chase each way. For those who wants to know what really happened here go http://www.theindependent.com/twisters/
