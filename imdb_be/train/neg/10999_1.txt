Imagine the worst scenes from Saturday Night Live, and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie. Now imagine that all the humor in those bad parody removed and replaced with stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Got it? <br /> <br /> Okay, now go look Underground Comedy Movie. This vision you just would seem that the funniest thing ever. UCM is only the worst movie I have ever seen. There were a few cheap laughs ... very little. But it was inaccurate. Even if the aim of the film was to be inaccurate, it was too imprecise to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I do not mind for wasting your time watching it was someone else, I know it was bought. He wasted his money. Vince Offer is not written or sent anything else, and it's no wonder why.
