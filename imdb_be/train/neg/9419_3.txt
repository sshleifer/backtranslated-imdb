I've never heard of it, it turned out that a person with a fatal lens that I have heard, but not seen. Connery presence forced me to buy it, and it's not good. He wants to be a kind of cross between Dr. Streynzhlav and Mash, but it's just not so funny if you do not find the name of General Wombat (?) Is ridiculous. He does not come across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes, when he comes back to life. There are many, many flat stages in Whitehouse between the president and his assistants, who do not work. It's almost as if the original cut was too long, and the first half was edited down to get to all of the atomic bomb plot and sacrificial suicide attacks, which I think is to play for fun, but then again, are not that's ridiculous. Location shooting is fine, but the studio stuff looks like a cheap TV. I could not believe that the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did. Only laughter: Connery throws his wig before putting on his helmet and jumps out of the plane. It does not say never again look like a genius.
