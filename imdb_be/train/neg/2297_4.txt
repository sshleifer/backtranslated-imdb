I turn on the 700 Club once in awhile and just agree with some statements made- I'm one of many believers, which is considered by most liberal Christians and conservative majority of non-Christians. I vote your mind, and it is usually not the rep. or dem. - I do not believe the 700 Club tells people that believe, but it is a lot of old Christian, who grew up in a very conservative layers. I think many people do not understand what they say on the 700 Club. it bums me to hear the name of the call in either direction. I think that the 700 clubs people really love Jesus, but so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively, that they forget to show love for certain people and promote peace, as Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus by the ignorant people who believe in Him, and let us also not be ignorant with our comments about them. Why are people so mean to each other?
