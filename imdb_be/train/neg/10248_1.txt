end of the world looks like a good movie on the cover of the box, but keep in mind it bad.being a big fan of the mega star actor Christopher Lee, I was misled. Tentacles (77) good shot does not mean that it will be a good start film.the looks promising, then it turns into boredom, many of the film is too dark to see what was going on.the rest of the cast is shown briefly like Lew Eayrs Dean Jagger and Macdonald Carey as a guard.i security would expect better from Charles groups that have made a good funny movie, as re Animater and dolls.i heard Christopher Lee was tricked into making this film.he stories were his colleagues will be the star Jose Ferrer John carridine, and Dean Jagger Dean Jagger.well there, but d e others did (lucky them), if you make a film about the end of the world to use a bigger budget and better storyline.dean Jagger went on to make two good movies later, alligator (80) and the game of death (79) Sue Lyon (Lolita) is also in the film minus its lollipop.if you're a masochist, I dare say you then watch the end of the world wake up throughout the movie.1 10.
