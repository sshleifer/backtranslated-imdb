All day now I watch a dinosaur, and all day they had the same fundamental problem. <br /> <br /> They do not believe in guns. They just do not seem to have been _told_ about them or something. Bullets _bounce_ from dinosaurs! Maybe it's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder, and the laws of physics are simply different then ... Ahh, no. Come on. If they are close enough to chemically act today, they would have to be vulnerable to fast (even subsonic) lead projectiles. It's so simple. <br /> <br /> Look what a tough rind reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, is completely vulnerable to fire the main gun. They are nothing magical. You can shoot a pistol round through the heavy scales on the back. They do not take the armor-piercing bullets or anything special. Small bullet to penetrate them, they just do not kill them. Several (but not very) large bullets are preferred, since the call (as with most games) to kill an animal with one shot, so that it does not work. (Hunters consider immoral to allow production to run and die unharvested.) <br /> <br /> Most of the animals, including predators, easily repelled by gunfire. Between the noise and pain, even immortal injured, most will run away. The exceptions are large bears, who so fearlessly that they simply enrage fatal wounds. Cape buffalo are considered very dangerous because they are well known to charge at wound. We have already seen a video of large bulls in a herd of buffalo to save a calf from all pride of lions. Big cat will work, if possible, but if it can not it will be charged as a final act of desperation. If T.Rex fit in this spectrum is unknown. Their behavior is simply not observed. With these large animals, safe hunting becomes a matter of application appropriately large and powerful projectile and / or the use of some of them quickly enough to resist his power. With T.Rex, of course, this can be a serious problem. I saw a skull T.REX (they have one in Museum Center) and shotgun quite a large bust, which can be impractical. Chewing neck off with a lot of smaller fire can be a more effective approach. Small bullet still _penetrate_ them, they will not just bounce just because an animal is too large to easily kill! <br /> <br /> So, here we are Cortez and his men (this _before_ famous Mexican company, apparently), captured by American natives and planned to sacrifice the pyramids. It turns out that all these human sacrifices were for the repose of a pair of Bloodthirst T.Rexes, who terrorized the continent in the day. Instead of just having their hearts cut out and fed the lizard, Cortes and others say the Aztecs in allowing them to hunt and kill them. Well, maybe they do not have M-16s, as the guys in "carnosaurs" series, but they have _do_ flint guns, crossbows, sharpened sticks (large, made of wood) and swords. Maybe it's a little smaller than the rough squads of soldiers with a full car, but they have a couple of guys, and I was quickly on their bet during the dinosaur. Oh wait, there _cannon_, about 4-inch. That is just the ticket to ruin skull tyrannosaurs! So they were in a trap, with a group of people, gun, pointed stick in a ravine, and lure the first T.REX it using a pretty brown girl as bait. Cortese indicates that they will not have time to recharge, so it will have to close range, as they can not be sure of their purpose. T.Rex completely ignores them volley fire flint, and we see how the crossbow bolt gun _and_ _bounce_ the ball away! Forget it. End of confidence. Crossbow bolt win Cortes' torso armor, and 4 "Cannonballs can penetrate into the body of a wooden ship! It will also _certainly_ go through leather, chest, or the skull of any animal ever to walk this planet. (You think _whale_ can stand 4 "cannon ball?) And T.REX, still stands, not even bleeding. So Cortes luring him into a ravine, where it falls on the pointy sticks that (I judge by magic) penetrated him and kill him. Yaaay, pointy stick! <br /> <br /> Dinos are not completely immune to fire - they contrive to gouge out the eyes of the second one with a gun. This triggers it, so that it is not the average as a bear or a buffalo, at least in film <br /> <br /> They clog second dinosaur bomb. - made of pumpkin filled with gunpowder, and precious stones. My money would be on the gun. This function engineering powder concentrate all the energy in one direction - toward a target. The bomb is much more diffused use of force. _Real_ bomb (not pumpkin bomb) has a steel housing containing explosions to extremely high pressure. (Think:. Bomb against fireworks) Heap of gunpowder burned just go poof. (Believe me, that one.)
