Different nudity scene, said other reviewers poorly done, and double body was apparently used. When Ms. flour did not want to do the scene herself, maybe she should have reduced the role of the proposal. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the film is not worse than that of other typical Canadian films. As other reviewers have noted, Canadian films are usually poorly written and does not have the entertainment value, which is what most observers expect to get movies. Perhaps the Canadian film producers deliberately trying to "de-commercialize" their films, but they forgot a very important thing - the films are by definition a commercial thing ....
