The film is basically a sad thread horrible cliches that do not offer a real cross-cultural understanding. Middle East leg of the journey described in a particularly annoying way: there is, obviously, mud brick villages, dirt roads in the middle of the desert, the women dressed in black robes and dancers. Interestingly, as the camels and date palm are missing from the picture. The identity of the two main characters is very clumsily painted, and many situations, it is hardly trustworthy. <br /> <br /> original idea may have been interesting, but at the end of the day, when you are looking for a cultural intuition, you should skip this movie.
