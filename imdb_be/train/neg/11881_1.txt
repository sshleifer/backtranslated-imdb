This film has nothing to do with "Office Space", except for premises. Office Space was hilarious. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, as I laughed more than once throughout the film. self-indulgent tirades g Cornbluth quickly become more irritable than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to see this movie, use the free rental or see it in someone else's home, so that you can leave if necessary.
