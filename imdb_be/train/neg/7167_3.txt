I saw the trailer for this on another video, and decided to withdraw, when he came out. Boy, was I disappointed! The story is very sad, action (aside from Christopher Walken) is bad, and I could not care less about the characters, apart from the really want to see the husband of Nora get thrashed. The role of Christopher Walken is a throw to the side, than to tease!
