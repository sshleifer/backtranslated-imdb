Ironically this movie has some redeeming quality in him when he moves to its end. For the other part of the film to be very bad, and the lame one, with a small budget, insulting poorly written script and all that goes with it. <br /> <br /> This is nonsense, that all the money going around in Christian circles, they never seem to get enough money to make a decent movie with. I'm not religious, so I could not care less, but in fact the film industry makes some as a good tool to reach a new audience to the churches and to make people more interested and curious in reading the Bible, for example. In this regard, the movies always seem like a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Low budget does not really hurt the film and bring it down. This makes the movie funny look with its consequences, and it just gives a general mannerisms video B-movie like feel. <br /> <br /> But what hurt more than this film is its writing. The material, which is just what happens in this movie is simply an insult to the intellect, and then I did not complain or talk about the religious aspects of the story. A way to promote the movie is so incredible, and the people in this film are doing is very unlikely that it is insulting to its audience. <br /> <br /> I hated how the film was going to be like a soap opera at times, it seemed to me that they just barely turning it into a full-length film, and they have added some characters and dramatic events just to fill things. I just could not care less about actually from time to time. <br /> <br /> However, it must be said that the film is more durable and resistant to an end when his story is more focused on its core. Nevertheless, it remains predictable all, but it prevented the film is not a complete wreck and see how this type of films are concerned, there are far worser one look there, although I do not think this film would win any new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
