Tattooed Stranger Edward Montagne, presumably play as a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed for flavor. Instead, he acted badly, brainless gaze on a low budget and uninspired filmmaking. The plot is absurd and painfully stiff and amateurish acting. John Miles, who was quite thin resume in the industry, smiles and laughter throughout, and all others acting with the same enthusiasm as the characters from the government about the safety of the driver the movie. The film is waiting for shows like "Leave it to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best" in unnaturally wholesome view of New York in 1950. Why the audience did not get to see anyone light a cigarette, while some slender women interviewed in a rooming house midway through the movie. The only thing the film has going for it (except its brevity) is a great place arrows coordinated William Steiner. The low-budget film works for the benefit of the operator, as the audience is well entertained framing shots interior New York and expansive exterior. If you do not want to enjoy the movie to select the settings and angles, I suggest to watch virtually any other film.
