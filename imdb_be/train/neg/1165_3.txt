I'll keep this short as I know, there is no need to say much. <br /> <br /> «Live» strange little movie, which obviously appeals to some, but I found it to be surprisingly mild from almost the very beginning. The film did very little to make any of the characters in the story is nice and sometimes it becomes so confusing that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know that others enjoyed it, but I found the "Live" to be anything but Kitamura - lame, very boring drama in the guise of reflection action sci-fi film. I felt like I was tricked into watching this film, based on his intrigues and uber-exciting artwork. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Give it a much more enjoyable Kitamura freshman effort "against" his 2004 rebellion. "Godzilla: Final War» <br /> <br /> ... And do not get me wrong, I'm always up for a good movie thinking person, but this is certainly not it. There was a time not a drop, I actually cared about a single event, taking place in this overly preachy dialogue heavy film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about irritation.
