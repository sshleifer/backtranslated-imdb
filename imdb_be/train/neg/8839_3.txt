Nice try and good ideas (buying prostitutes, human beings, helping each other, ...), but a bad result ... The director is clearly trying to emulate its French counterpart, Tran Anh Hung, recreating the atmosphere, which provides to reflect Vietnam ... the only problem is that it is Vietnam for a long time has passed, and when "the scent of green papaya" was a historical background ... trying to project this kind of atmosphere (muffled sounds and the slow pace of life. ..) in the modern days left feeling fake. In addition, he quickly creates a feeling of sadness and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume, the action takes place in Saigon and Da Nang, because this is where Harvey Keitel, a former Marine in the film, probably stationed during the war ... But no one in South Vietnam or very few people speak with an accent clip shown by the actors of the North ... Seriously odd to poor Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old poet leprosy ... very doubtful (non-disease for people of his condition), a peasant girl who knows how to read and write to develop the Vietnamese poetry, ... more doubtful ... <br /> <br />
