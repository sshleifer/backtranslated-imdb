Råzone a terrible movie! It's so simple. It seems that they were trying to make a film to show the life of the drum. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But, unfortunately, Denmark does not have enough good young actors. Leon are many more little girl in "On July krummernes», and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the film, she plays with the soul, and it destroys the film! <br /> <br /> While I believe that the movie you must see. I do not agree that young people behave like this, but I think he can show how it may end, if you let your child down. It is also important to support Danish cinema and new companies, such as "movie folket»! <br /> <br /> on the whole I think people need to see Råzone. Not because it's a great film, but because it is a movie that deals with important topics. I also believe that it is important to note that there are some scenes of violence there, and it really is in these scenes, Laura works best. - as the final, where she holds the gun!
