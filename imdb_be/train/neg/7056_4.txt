This film is an excellent example of how even some very funny jokes can go wrong. I really was expecting at least something from this film after watching the superstructure, which was funny as hell, but the film was not half as good. <br /> <br /> The strange part is that the joke is really funny that a parody of the smoking ban, Jo Bole ... etc, really good jokes, but I do not know who to blame this movie flop on <br /> <br /> Prime candidates might be: -. 1) hammers (actors) and hammeresses (actresses) not even funny view 2) Director 3) A person who threw the cast and / or director Anyway, if you are really very sad, and I mean really look at this film, or to obtain a copy of each ad, or teaser of the film and laugh your butt, because those will be much funnier than the movie. <br /> <br /> ps only saving grace of this film Mahesh Manzhrikara and funny chappu Bhai
