It was not well done Western. You got this nut riding around in the hot sun in a wheelchair with an umbrella over it, killing people for their own reasons. Do you have the same person who sits in a snow cave during a snow storm, cutting off pieces of his body that were frostbitten. Then you have a woman in the house in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that do not exist. What is the point of this movie? Bruce Dern could not find something better to do? It was a waste of film.
