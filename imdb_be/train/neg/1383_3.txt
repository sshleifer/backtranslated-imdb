Lame, clich√©d superhero blockbuster nonsense. I had high hopes for this film, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that I do not despise, but very rarely do I see the story as corny and silly, as this one was. This would be forgivable, as always happens in these films, when the action compensates for, unfortunately, it is not. Action really has to Surreality trademark and over the top nature of HK action, but it is not very involving, obscenely mountains, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to the re-editing for the American release, it shows signs of than a place of patchwork). I was very disappointed.
