Do not even bother with this film, it is bad, if judged by its own merits, but compared to the original from 1972 (which is a classic) is down right terrible. And by the way, someone noticed that the 1972 movie is bad in comparison with the book. This is stupid, the movie should never be judged by the books, they are taken from. They are 2 completely different art forms (as if it is necessary to note, but apparently it does). If you have used this criterion for all the movies, then "2001" will suck and so will "Forrest Gump" and "The Silence of the Lambs."
