After «Rugrats» »falls to the category of good and funny animated series to mediocrity and even directly terrible rate for two year olds in the last three or four years, it is obvious, the tyrant in Klasky-Csupo to be out of ideas. After the dumbing down of all the characters, adding even more stupid than the new, replacing some voices (although I like Nancy Cartwright, it is not Chuckie Finster!), And who do not have any sense of continuity (eg:. In the episode Kimi I looked the other day, Tommy and Chuckie everyone got a new puppy, but the next episode, the aforementioned dog never are), you might think that the creators could kill a show of mercy. But Noooo. <br /> <br /> All I will say about this special is that it sucks! Although not as bad as Kimi episodes still stupider than they were, including my grandfather (my God! He used to be the best character on the show, but now he has no real purpose). The ending is nothing fluffy, and the only thing different from this and other bad new episodes ('98 -01) is the fact that children can interact with adults. Wow, what fun! <br /> <br /> no stars at all for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please destroy this show before it gets worse.
