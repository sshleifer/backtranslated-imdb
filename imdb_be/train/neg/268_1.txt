1 How is it that everyone can understand each other without devices such as universal translators or translator microbes? Perhaps the creators of the show know that the people who were taken from different parts of the earth, in different time frames (Attilla Gong were not contemporary preliterate Hellenic culture, nor were the Vikings contemporary builders of the pyramids) speak different languages ​​and can never develop as language similar to the modern day English (for flexion they "do not" use, except), who was under the influence of Latin, Greek, Danish and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences can not be overcome so easily, trust must be won, but all the team arrives they encounter without any suspicion and start ordering people around, they appointed their leaders.

The small town theater group probably has the best props. <br /> <br /> 4 boring! Another lame production Canadian who inexplicably ran for ten years. As children show it can make the grade, but everyone who has a little knowledge of human behavior and language could not even see the first twelve episodes of Season 1, as I just did. I really wanted to believe that I have found a decent sci-fi show, otherwise I would have closed it off and cleaned my computer of the shelter after the first five minutes!
