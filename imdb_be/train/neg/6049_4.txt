First, the one who thinks that this is the continuation of William Friedkin in «The French Connection», surpasses most definitely completely insane or an imbecile, or both. The problem with the review of this film is that, as well.) This is the continuation of a brilliant film, which always makes it is difficult to look objectively, and b.) It is directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors ever, so I I wanted to like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct the film about drug trafficking in splits the city of New York, because of its documentary-like approach to the action and history, Frankenhimer on the other hand, is one of the most stylish directors ever, that is, "The Manchurian candidate "and" second, "and with his" French Connection 2 "it feels like someone is trying to be too rigid and not having a true understanding, to pull it out. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel Himself Gene Hackman really says a lot about the meaning of the original Hackman in the movie too. It is well known Hackman hated Friedkin on the set, and vowed never to work with him again, he also knew that he had imagined the character to be a one-dimensional, weight loss and trying to play with it as direct. it shows you Hackman, despite the great actor had not the faintest idea who to make the film and the plot is excellent. Case story Doyle becomes a drug addict is interesting, but does not guarantee the rest of the film. Unsuccessful lowest point in Frankenhimer Filmography.
