I can not believe that those praising this film here, not thinking about some other movie. I was prepared for the fact that it would be terrible, but the script (or lack thereof) does for the film, which is also meaningless. On the positive side, the overall level of craft from the actors and technical crew is fully competent, but if you have a pig's ear, to work with you can not make a silk purse. Ben G fans have to follow just about any other film he was in. Dorothy S fans should follow Galaxina. Peter B fans to follow Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking, he should follow the strange terrible book by Peter B, killing a unicorn.
