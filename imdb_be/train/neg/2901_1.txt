The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in real life at IMDb just makes me understand that their feast employees work hard, trying to get people to watch it quite a terrible film. <br /> <br /> I have no words, I have no idea where not begin to describe a truly awful film that I spent last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I feel something for his character and enjoy the dialogue, but, like other posters, I felt embarrassed and ashamed for the actors. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so far-fetched, the family had it stenciled Walton family and the film has been so many times before that I was shocked someone thought that it was the original idea. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terribly bad movie and Don 't believe everything you read on IMDb, as the first comments were clearly written by people sitting in another theater to watch a good movie.
