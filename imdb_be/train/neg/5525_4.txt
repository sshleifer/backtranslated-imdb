The problem with the family drama is that outside of TV movies on channels like the Lifetime, most people do not want to watch them. And those who receive signed, as a rule, and sensations of the current or actual problems or issues in the news (or breaking news). Films that explain or explore the human condition is not popular. Especially with a young crowd, which will be Fans of Miss Lohan or younger crowd that tends to make films not just popular but financially successful for the studio. <br /> <br /> The particular problems that I had with this film is cartoonishness with some of the characteristics. It was a little more to blame all the characters in Lohan's acting out (wrecking car, drug use, etc.) that her stepfather had done to her. Although it is possible that this is just too much to expect the audience to swallow. In addition, other aspects such as it gives young boy Morman, oral sex, or that it would actually make a good assistant veterinarian who coincidentally happens to have a thing for her mother, and so on, all these elements are simply not exactly help this film together. He put back in the cell situation comedy that tries to one of their "special dramatic episodes," that he has done for fully implemented, well-written feature film. <br /> <br /> If you are watching a DVD and listen to the commentary, in particular, for a variety of alternate endings, you can really see all that sharp focus.
