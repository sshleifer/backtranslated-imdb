Well, where we start with this little gem? Mutant slugs begin to take on a small New England (?) City. Only one person can stop them ... and that man ... Mike Brady! Now that it was not funny enough, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> The pictures of snails is that known as footage. No matter who the bullet attack or where they are the same shot of piles of snail oozing everywhere indicated. Keep in mind, this feature takes shot at least half of the film. <br /> <br /> To act in the film was a knock-down, pull, steal a purse, punching your girlfriend to kill your dog, BAD. I'm sure even worse, but you'll be hard pressed to find it. The only jewel was ... you guessed it .... MIKE BRADY! He must have done some night classes at the YMCA because he was the best in the heap. <br /> <br /> As for the fear? This film is not worth taking seriously. There is no fear! They are calling loudly for snails. All the growth effects could be avoided with a salt shaker or two. Just watch this movie MST3K type environment, otherwise I could see some serious brain damage.
