I watched a lot of cartoons and animated films, because I have a girl who loves to watch TV. I started to watch the movie to see if I would like my little to watch it ... and no. In the beginning I thought it was such a nice film, as the film Bambi, but as it was as insinuating ducky was a homosexual. The information says that they made fun of him because he was not good at sports, but it was not so. It just seems that the film is for children to learn how to be good to be gay. It was very sad, how darling daddy and all. I do not know, I think if you're gay you want, but I do not think I'll watch it again with my baby.
