When the crew of "Zombie Chronicles" ever read it, here are some tips, guys: <br /> <br /> 1. The «Twist Ending» -type movie, it's not a good idea to insert a close-up of each death in the film in the opening credits. It tends to spoil the twist, y'know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know you made it on a shoestring, and - to be fair - you have worked wonders to your budget, but please hire people who can actually act. Or, at least, to walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I look at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you are going to set the film in the past, only do this if you have props and costumes of the time. <br /> <br /> 4. Twist the end should be a surprise. Of course, we do not want twists that make no sense, but the road signs and signals "open" as soon as you enter the character? It's not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the guys for trying to, but frankly, I'd rather they were not ... <br /> <br /> Only zombies Completists.
