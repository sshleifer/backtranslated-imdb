And that comes from someone that will stand up to almost any view. Action and the sound is awesome. It can claim to be "so bad it's good" point of merit ,,, for some. However, I accept my horror movies seriously, and it's just a shit-it's just soooo cheap, I think that's my main complaint. Dialogue often paddle-note, how many times, "You scared me," are used. "Child" serious actress god awful-I pray to her acting career ended here..her line "donut! I HATE donuts "worth repeated viewing however.
