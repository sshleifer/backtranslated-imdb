Hollywood's attempt to turn the life of Jack London's "Jack London" Adventure is not a bad idea; Of course, he has led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, the wind is flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (in London) has some speech Londonesque; and it's nice to see him get a bearded Jack "Call of the Wild", having spent some time alone in the snowy mountains, with his dog, "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very beautiful. The film depicts the unfortunate "yellow threat", a parallel between the life of London and World War II, which are both stressful and abusive. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) ~ Alfred Santelli Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
