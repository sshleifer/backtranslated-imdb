Spoilers. <br /> <br /> In the first place, in fact, nothing has happened in this movie, but the woman bleeding inexplicable. Secondly, it was not terrible. Third, it was the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me elaborate. The sound was edited or Beavis and Butthead ?? I'm not sure, so let's just go with Beavis. The film is gradually becoming more and more relaxed, and people muttering and mumbling, forcing you to increase the volume (I watched it at home). Beavis and then explodes some really loud noises from the supposedly scary / shocking images, making quickly reduce the volume again. This happens a lot of times so far, fortunately, the film ends. I can imagine Beavis vulgar laugh because two-way mirror, watching the test group frantically reaching remote every time. If you have kids and prefer to watch horror movies after they go to sleep, this is one big mistake. But this is a big mistake in any case. Here's a thought ?? if you're going to do a horror film, at least, to add gratuitous decapitation, and the 19-year-old blonde who screams at the top of her lungs just before she could remove her sweater, a shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive only range of the camera, the cat throw the camera to scare the audience, some freak blizzard with maniacal laughter, or a monster that looks like a stage hand, covered with aluminum foil (a-in TV Lost in space). These people do not even try to scare me. They just wanted to touch my ears.
