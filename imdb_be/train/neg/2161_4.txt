Ira Levin Broadway smash comes to the screen with little meat on his bones, a mystery story with a few tricks and turns, but no one is taking care of. Frustrated writer Michael Kane plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it as their own; his cunning plan may include the murder of a talented child who is good for nothing husband Cain in his hands. The first act, in which you enter all died painfully, with Caine does its best actor, to keep step. Dyan Cannon as his miscast wife (she's too smart and sensible yourself to be passed as the Dietz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the film) is very uncomfortable in the role of a better writer. These three characters, and an annoying neighbor Irene Worth is so uncertain that occurs after setting registers just until well after the second act has not begun. Direction Sidney Lumet is unnatural and inaccurate set of design unconvincing and bad light, and the finale is a complete failure. Actors fight to give the script a substance, but with such a thin material all that we see in their time-consuming efforts. * 1/2 ****
