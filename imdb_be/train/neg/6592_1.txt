Brief Summary: This film degrades all contact. This means that you are. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that I do not purists, and it might be funny for a few minutes. The reincarnation is not bad. But in general it's just boring and painfully funny. A few simple jokes are repeated again and again. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this movie exists only to squeeze the last few dollars from the current commodity Laurel and Hardy. Manufacturers can not have a real respect for their place in the history of cinema, or their talents. . That's what hurt me the most <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I also failure as a parent;)
