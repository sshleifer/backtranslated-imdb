There are some movies that you just know they're going to be the frame of a bad one. Even if you are not paying attention to the work of Ed Wood, one look at the commentator of "Plan 9 from outer space", and you just know that you're not going to see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just like that, when I saw the first Uwe shot boxes masterpiece "House of the Dead", with the guy sitting in front of the house, since its introduction while desperately trying to appear that he had just arrived from Sin City, I knew I m during the trip too <br /> <br /> Thus, the film begins like this -. first the protagonist says that it is still going to die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he begins implementing the remaining characters with lines like «Karma..thinks she Foxy Brown» or «Alicia..my ex .. we broke up recently .. I had to learn, and she had to fence." No, I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this bunch of 20-something who could not act his way out of a wet paper bag going into the «Rave Age", trapped in question be several tents, port-a-potty and a bad stage located on a small island in the middle of the Pacific ocean. Our gang missed a couple, but fortunately will find a way to get there, the way to be a catcher boat ran Kirk (CPT Kirk? Get it? The man who wrote this script is genius) and his sidekick, that bastard child Simpsons Cpt McAlister and that killer hook, who knows what you did last summer. <br /> <br /> to make a long story short, the gang gets to the island, it does not find anyone there, except for some bloody T-shirts, and then decide to run away from there. No, wait, they do not, they actually get all happy and like because it is the free booze. <br /> <br /> With this scene the film hits rock bottom, and then against all odds incomes go further down the slope. Some guys in rubber suits are starting to run, there are some screams and gunfire, our gang goes to a house, to meet up with some other band, they go out of the house, meet CPT Kirk and some police woman (that is, about 500 pounds between them weapons), and then decided to go back into the house. Somewhere along the line, they become S.W.A.T. Command, enter the matrix, rubber suit, guys start to multiply like bacteria, and I start to cry, because I actually paid to see it. To add insult to injury, every few minutes there is footage from the video game based on this shit is pretty on top of the game cut-scene for several characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. He did not even fit in this category of the famous "So bad it's good." It's just bad. The script is bad, horrible zombies, there is no voltage, the line is bad, the actors are bad .. the list goes on. <br /> <br /> You will probably want to see this movie only because of his reputation for being awful. Nia. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.
