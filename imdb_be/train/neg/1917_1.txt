This film, although it is not entirely bad, should have been removed, where the actual events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska, was destroyed at least seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located in the almost treeless, flat Platte River Valley in County Hall. The creators of this film was shot in the wooded hills of Ontario and moved the whole event in a nonexistent town called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived that terrible night only to be forgotten because of poorly made movie.
