Life in the future fascist or near fascist state, which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurring theme in contemporary literature and film makers. Such work to send us a warning of adverse trends in our society, to observe; but, to be effective, they must be interesting. Unfortunately, most of the books are likely to be more effective in placing warnings than in entertaining us enough to become a truly readable; while the problem with films is usually the other way around. The first such work to become really well known, probably George Orwell's "1984" (first published in 1948), and it is still readily available in book form and as a film. <br /> <br /> Watch or read it, and then when you feel a little overwhelmed by man's inhumanity to man, to achieve a Cinderella 2000. This feather light low-budget comedy film based on the same theme, which provides an easy, but ungrateful view; and as the 1984 calendar is now gone beyond its former period. Much of the comedy is laid with a spatula, although there are only a few really funny moments. In order to carry out his mind in the long intervals between these, you can focus it on the question of whether this film will get a new extension of life, being released as a DVD, or whether it will eventually disappear into oblivion, as the existing film copies to deteriorate past repayment. There are a lot worse movies appear in the DVD, these days, and frankly, I do not care much what happens in either case. <br /> <br /> By far the best of the films of this genre was probably "maid fairy tale", but I'd happily swap them all for a well made film rise of Jack London's novel "The Iron Heel". Ambitious as it would be, it still seems unlikely that any modern director has not yet dared to try to do it (IMDb only lists B / W silent version, made in Russia in 1919).
