Falling in love with "Paris, I love you", I awaited this film, and I admit that I came with high expectations, but was very disappointed for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I did not expect to re-brand "Paris" in New York, I was expecting the same structure. What I liked about "Paris" was the collapse of the surrounding area. Do you have a sense of each style of Directors and the story they wanted to tell. In the "New York", there is no clear separation of stories, at different points in the film, the characters from different stories collide with each other, which made me confused, I looked, and what is happening. In addition, the direction switch was obvious, but confusing, since there was no flow. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I liked in the film "Paris" had a different take on love. It was not all romantic. Was the love between parents and their children, unrequited love, lonely, melancholy middle-aged woman for love, and so on, he explored so many layers of complexity of love between people. "New York", it seemed only a sharp, in-the-top sexuality. There were some shorts redeemed (the older couple spending a lifetime together, Julie Christie short), but the film as a whole the'NY »does not cause any emotions for me. I did not connect with any of the characters, like I did with "Paris". I remember watching "Paris" and a deep sense of sadness, loneliness, longing, hope, surprise ... it was just so much soul. not a soul in the «NY» film was not for me. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I went into it without "Paris" is looming in the back of my brain than the movie may have caused a more favorable response, but as a self-titled retake with "Paris, je I love you, "I was very disappointed.
