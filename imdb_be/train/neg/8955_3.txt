As far as the movie goes, it's OK sci-fi film. It has a lot of interesting things in it, and some quality scenes. However, it is not so good and some things are pretty far-fetched ... <br /> <br /> As for the call is another cube-film full and complete Bullsh! T. This definition of milking large and inventive original film itself ... All feel to it may be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of human / android as part of the "team" of the very few stretch cube ... <br / > <br /> I gave it 3 *** because of the change of the original. This one had to be kept sterile in many parts of the movie, there is no room or time to mention them all ... <br /> <br /> watchable for those who have not seen Kubik & hypercube, but is not recommended for fans of the series. ..
