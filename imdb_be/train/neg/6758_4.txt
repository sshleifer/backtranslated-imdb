Quite possibly, the kindest woman in show business, and the most sexy, Debbie gives another excellent job here. Although her work at the American nightmare was significantly higher, it is still worth a look in this film. <br /> <br /> In roles filled with typical species of Melrose Place, slender features and seductive curves, which I had never seen before, Except Debbie Laura Nativo she was the only actress I've seen before, in the same Delta Delta Die. <br /> <br /> The plot centers around a group of Californian arrogants, which started poor naive Debbie Rochon their thoughts. They tell her that they have a murder club, and that she must kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people, so that it quickly kills a man, and now the team must decide what to do with her after she fell on them jokes <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE :. $ $$$$ (! Abundant Debbie Rochon sometimes has blood splattered all over it, and all the murder scenes made in your face gore hounds will love.!) <br /> <br /> Nudity: $$$$$! (Rich and Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes, it makes a lot of no-name actors and actresses party pool seem like just an excuse to get naked .. all men and women, as well as Julie Strain has topless cameo, but it The symbol will disappear after the first five minutes) <br /> <br /> History: .. $$ (could get a higher voice, because the story was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a filler between a nude scene, which I I understand that B-Ranking films used nudity often, but it's borderline excessive) <br / > <br /> RESPONSIBILITIES:. .. $ (Valid sub standard to say the least, Rochon, always Ryasnyi, easily the best B-Rate actress in the business today, but her character in American Nightmare was higher Denis Wolske does an excellent job in Debbie as an object of lust, but the other actors had nothing to write).
