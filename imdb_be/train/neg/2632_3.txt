It saddens me to appreciate the film with a lot of my favorite actors, locations and genres, that is, Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC, and a political thriller, and "Sentinel" really hits a low. It's like they had a great idea Front signed the right throw and had some great shots of the city and then took leave giving the remaining crew to improvise the rest. And I'd like to blame it on another soft performance from Besinzher (I do not just feel that she is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I'm still hot for more than ten years later, she was the only one, and, of course, only bad actor in a film to win acting Oscar for "LA Confidential.") But she was not the only problem. Sutherland, which I love, as Jack Bauer on "24" plays again ?? Jack. I miss my old "Time to Kill" and "A Few Good Men" days. Douglas, of course, took a break from the action and called it in Plot :. Someone, some Secret Service traitor wants President dead and Douglas (haphazardly) tripped. Will anyone believe him? In fact, no spoiler here: as fast as they came up with that story halfway through, it's not over before you know it. And why someone (s) wants the president dead? Is that open up in the future? Too many plot holes, too many doors opened and never closed, and too predictable "Guardian" is. If you see only one film a year, you can not know who the mole, but anyone who is familiar with these types of movies or even just saw an episode of «Law & Order» you'll know within the first few frames. Was it scary? Not really, the cinematography was good, and despite the Sutherland plays Jack again, he's still got it.
