I'm a real fan of the original series Cracker, and have them all on DVD. Cracker tended to be over-the-top about, but Robbie Coltrane and other actors, as well as writers, always seemed to bear, in spite of themselves. I think the original Cracker among big Brit TV crime series of the time, and there's some stiff competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Sherlock Homes Jeremy Brett, as well as many others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> What does the "new terrorism" all sad ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a very pale imitation of the former glory of the cracker. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing, making sure that it might not actually be a bad thing, and that some of the spark, eventually ignited. I was wrong, it was bad from the beginning to the end <br /> <br /> A few critical remarks :. First of all, just to get any potential bias to the front at once: I was offended by the anti-American, anti-war screed that droned on and on for most of the show. Plant: the killing of two American is innocent of any crime, and the British Junkie, according to Fitz, "understandable but not justified," I thought. "I crept within two hours of crap just to hear that disgusting little nonsense" Thus, in? I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / US tons brought on their beliefs ... out of politics, I had the distinct feeling that it was only a Cracker support for the promotion, and it really helped to explode the already very weak script. < br /> <br /> Secondly, as far as the essential parts with made Robbie Coltrane get? Fitz was almost a bit player in this, as if it was a secondary connected to some stories written without any thought about the role of Fitz. Coltrane could carry the show on his own broad and still properly sagging shoulders, but the writer seems to think about other things, and missed his chance, and by a wide margin <br /> <br /> third. What Abysmal SCENARIO! There was some spark, and a couple of bits of factual development (son of Fitz in talk that Fitz could not stay in his home when he missed his plane in A Australia, Detective, who liked to beat his poor-performer behind their heads, and some of the old spark between Fitsami and true), but not enough to carry the tedious storyline. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? Now it would be interesting ... It was Manchester in the end, and 10 years that it will be in the ranks. Another missed opportunity (? Or, perhaps, the actress is not interesting) <br /> <br /> Well, there's a lot more (this is bad) to say, but I will close with a curiosity: at the end of the show (as it appears on BBCA) if the advertisement said that the "Director's Cut" to be available on the BBC on-Demand, I thought, AH-HA! Cut the director, who, presumably, one has to pay, can make all the sweets I had expected to see tonight, but never did as a coherent, interesting story. Unfortunately, after convincing himself sit awful free version of the "new terrorism" with the hope to see something, anything worth watching, only to be disappointed, I do not expect the left to motivate me to actually pay for a second, potentially more and more tedious version. In addition, it made me angry to think that BBCA diced, and killed the show times to accommodate the infinite (every ten minutes or so) stream of commercials, and then turned around and asked me to pay for something that probably should have been version of the air tonight. <br /> <br /> In order to close, and I quote the first paragraph of the review a variety of "new terrorism": he really says it all: "The initial excitement about Robbie Coltrane reprising his role as the BBC's vices, etc. ' yanstva, corruption criminal psychologist littered with heavy hand publicist statements Jimmy McGovern is determined to deliver within this revival vidpic Shaking on the ground in its communication -. namely, that the Americans are a bunch of whining namby-pambies, does not care an iota about terrorism before it collapsed on our threshold - McGovern chest clearing rant overwhelms the narrative and muffles the pleasure of seeing Fitz back on the case.
