The film "! Gung Ho ': The Story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 to raise the morale of the American people during the Second World War. This indicates a better way that the film may be a propagation body. The value of this film and there is only a collection of art. The propaganda film is useless to judge the direction and actor. See this movie if you are interested to learn how to function in the promotion of the movie, or if you are a big fun of Robert Mitchum, who has a small role in the film. If you want to watch a movie in the Second World War, they were there much better and objective. I rated it 4/10.
