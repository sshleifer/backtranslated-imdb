I do not know if it's one of the original films SyFy Channel, but that's exactly what it feels like. Cheap, low-budget action film, which was probably very soon, it contains ridiculous effects, lame dialogue, and a dimly lost a star to give some recognition of the brand name on it (funny how many child with 90210 makes cheap TV movies right now) . <br /> <br /> Ziering plays Cortes, who we know from history, as a researcher, which destroyed the entire population of native people, while the conquest of North America. Here, he did not play as a hero or even sympathy, but how slippery opportunist; his character will probably be killed if it were not loosely based on the historical figure. In this story, Cortes on a short geodesic mission, trying to find something valuable to prove that he is worthy of funding for further exploration of America. He and his men found a small tribe of Aztecs suffering from dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The actual hero of the story is Lt. Rios, which is noble, wise and resourceful. He knows what to do in any situation that puts him in opposition to the Cortes, as well as young, ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, my dear girl, that must marry stubborn intriguante shaman falls to Rios, promoting their anger against the Spanish outsiders. So it's all pretty cliche. Dinosaurs are dispatched with relative ease. In spite of the events taking place in an area that seems to be wide open, the story largely takes place either in the forest or the Aztec village of 95% of the time, so it's not visually exciting ever. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and convincing accent, and somehow he disappeared into it. He does not look or sound spanish for a second, however, making the choice of casting wrong in all respects. If this film was released theatrically, he would have been allocated for the Razzie, no question. <br /> <br /> In general, forgotten.
