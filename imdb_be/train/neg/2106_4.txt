Bela Lugosi as big as usual, but the film is nothing compared with Dracula. He is perhaps the only one who played the perfect role in this film, but even a legend like Lugosi can save harmful ideas of the film, and unlike most of the film does not set the mood unspenseful old horror movies very well. Even in the worst case, all of the films of Bela just mediocre, though.
