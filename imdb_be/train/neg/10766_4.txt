Anyone who has seen the child Tammuz Eaters knows that this is a filmmaker who can do better. Let's hope that is not the case, too many hands in the pot (Telefilm anyone?) And that was the case of a second aspect of fear. Symbols used and more one-dimensional. The scenery is stunning, however, and showcases the beautiful Pacific Northwest. <br /> <br /> great cinematography. Shot almost entirely on the outside, the image clear and beautiful. . You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves <br /> <br /> Technically this film as sound as they come - it's just not enough heart.
