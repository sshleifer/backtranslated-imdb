The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc., as kings B. Because people in Crown International were so crucial, they were raised, they richly deserve to status. The film, like the van now may seem placed a piece of Drive-in esoteria, but it was a significant hit when it was released (not to mention the subsequent re-release as a double feature with another Crown hits). <br /> <br /> van was excellent example hit strategy Crown capture movie-goers from mood at the time of manufacture of photographic film. Here it was sex, drugs, rock and roll and a short horse "Custom Van". As already noted, it is ironic that the "hit" song in the film refers to the Chevy, Dodge when the name of the car in the film. I was a city where I have a municipal government was at that time even declare these vans to be a "den of sin on wheels!" The perfect advertisement for the film line! <br /> <br /> There is the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscle heads and low-brow jokes (including support for little Danny DeVito). In many ways, this is not much different from the old beach party movies 60s, but now dressed with nudity and use of drugs. Clearly, what is being done on a limited budget and limited schedule, the film is coasting along nicely enough fresh charm that compensates for some, by today's standards, of course, the views of non-PC women. <br /> <br /> Klassicheskima touch toaster for Bobby den of sin on wheels. So, toaster! Hey, you've got to have something hot for the Munchies! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
