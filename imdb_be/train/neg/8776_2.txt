Michael Keaton never really was not a good actor; in the films of Tim Burton's Batman, he always gets in the shadow of his great villains. Here, he plays as a widowed husband who picks up radio frequencies, which seem as dead people who are trying to establish contact with a live ... <br /> <br /> Well, it should be pretty shocking thriller, but he misses about each location has shocked you. Because there are too many things that ultimately inexplicable, undiscovered and uninteresting. So where is the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad a movie made in the first place, that the WHITE NOISE making a fool of yourself? Really bad actions and hit edited this film is nothing to look at. Michael Keaton is trying to make a thriller comeback, but ultimately did not have enough goals more than ever.
