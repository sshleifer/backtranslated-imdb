In general, I like to watch movies Burt Lancaster - especially when you need to go crazy with his imposing presence on the screen as in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, he visited and his greatest weakness, he rarely, if ever, nothing overlooked. And it is this lack of refinement that actually prevents Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was supposed to be born showman, but as Katharine Hepburn may fall under his spell quite inexplicable. It has to be smart, but do not think that if flattery Lancaster thrown around the screen! In addition to this, the story is perhaps one of the most promising unnatural films I've ever seen, and it's too obvious that this is a film based on the game. It looks like it was mostly filmed in a sound stage, not in the big wide open West, as it should be. <br /> <br /> In general, it is very overrated film.
