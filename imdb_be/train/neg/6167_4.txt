Like most people, I was designed to purchase this film because of the picture of a powerful Bolo Yeung plastered all over the box, and assumptions (of the above paintings and the film's title), this film is all about the Beast of the East with his feet for 90 minutes . <br /> <br /> However, to my disappointment, the Chinese Hercules Bolo Yeung is that there is NO Retreat Surrender was not Jean-Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger was not ... um, Bolo Yeung - maximum impact on the video box, the minimum actual screen time! Oh, good! <br /> <br /> The storyline is pretty basic stuff, but it was well done - the peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Ming) accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight. He runs off to work as a laborer on the pier, where it affects their employees with his heavy sack lifting prowess, causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter (not quite sure how this works, but do not mind). At the same time, the corrupt boss of the pier makes a deal with the bandits, giving them exclusive use of the berth. As a result, workers are thrown out on your ear and forced to live on the beach, where they unite against their boss, gangster boss and his bumbling henchman Bolo Yenga. <br /> <br /> While the film is completely watchable (mainly through waiting for the next glimpse Bolo), I had a few problems with it - first, the bad dubbing, but, of course, the reality in the old kung- fu movies. But also, the film tend to drag between the various fight scenes. And as for the fight scenes themselves, I found that they were too long, poorly choreographed (Jackie Chan apparently!), Bad shot, and sometimes by people who do not seem to have any combat capabilities of art .... in fact, most of the fighting in this film was not "fighting" at all, just people being beaten, without offering any resistance <br /> <br /> in the end, the hero - played Chen Hui Ming. I've never seen any other movies from this guy, but at any point, I was rooting for him. Not only that, it looks like the fainthearted and on the verge of tears at all times, but I found it not persistent fighting rabies! I understand his reasoning, but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had made earlier that we all knew that he was going to do, after all, and fight! The great mystery is why this whole community of people were pinning their hopes on the guys, they've never even seen the fight! <br /> <br /> In fact, a great saving grace of this film was the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only that, he is huge and hard, as always, it has some great, funny lines and gives the rest of the acting master class on how to fight on the film. The guy exudes the presence of the screen, and you can easily see how he became a star. The guy scares the life out of me, but I'm sure I was not the only person who watched this movie, which was rooting for Bolo all through the end of battle! <br /> <br /> In general, it is lower than the average of kung fu film picked up some huge expressions of you-know-who. I've never met anyone who did not think Bolo Yeung was great. Man legend !!
