With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I expected that the film will be at least bearable. It was not. After the first half hour I watched the rest with the help of the remote control in my hand so fast forward was ready. So banal, so the standard one knows what will happen in each scene. You can even predict the dialogue verbatim. This is one of those films that makes one scratch one's head and say: "How is this movie ever made" in an attempt to say something positive, I will add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects, but, in general, if you have already. We saw 5 Sci / fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
