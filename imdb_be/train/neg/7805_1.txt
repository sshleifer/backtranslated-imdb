the first film actor, is usually something you can afford to miss - it's common that first job, where the lack of film experience to all participants actually on display, and this film is no exception <br /> <br /> But the worst. that even by 1982 standards, it's so bad it's hysterically funny. Filmed entirely in Chicago obviously low budget, most of the action throughout the plaster stiff, wooden, and the cartoon - a cross between a high school game and bad amateur theater. The noise from the nearby traffic often drowns out dialogue and dialogue is really bad, it is a declarative way that comes off as a necessary and appropriate, rather than natural and organic. Scenes can not be contrived and gusty, and even if the characters are in for a number of years, both children and adults at all ages. <br /> <br /> I believe that it is possible to make a Christian film that is appetizing to large secular public, but all too often the creators of these movies are so focused on «The Message» or in this case, their own autobiographical connection to the project that the production value of a good film discarded. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as a producer / director / editor - and cast member.) <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and believable - to look in his subsequent films. His career is certainly not based on movies such as this.
