"What happens when you give $ 100,000 homeless?" It's like asking the question, they are somehow morally exempt from what eventually happens. The creators of "Reversal of Fortune" are trying to get their voyeuristic giggles, hiding their antics as a kind of responsible social experiment. <br /> <br /> They take Ted homeless in Pasadena, and give him $ 100 000 to see if he will turn his life. Then, and only the most cursory guidance and counseling, they let him go on his merry way. <br /> <br /> What are they trying to say? "Money can not buy you happiness?" "Homeless homeless, because they deserve to be?" Or how about, "Raise people up - it's more fun to watch as it falls from a greater height." They took a man with nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then watched as he lose all in vain. This is supposed to be fun? They dress it sows some gloomy music and dramatic camera booms, but in the end it has all the moral superiority of the car crash video - only this time they designed a car accident and asked, "What happens when you take down a stop sign? "
