As a writer, I find it's a bad movie that makes it into production a complete slap in the face. Speech about the insult. I have written a better story than that in the 8th grade. Bad action, bad writing, bad governance and by adding together the result is a complete and utter failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing that this film can not perform this deceiving unsuspecting consumer to spend their time. Who would have the green light to something so poorly written? This is not an artistic, intelligent, reasonable, anxious, mysterious, scary, dramatic, nothing. <br /> <br /> characters are flat and boring, without development. Portion as reworked in an aluminum can. They somehow managed to throw a few very familiar actors who all have to be pretty desperate for work, or in the hope one of these low-budget independent films will be able to become the next «Pulp Fiction». This scenario should be used to line the bird cage, not the movie. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, the 5'2 105 pound woman, of course, is able to kill the men and women twice her size without a fight and with one blow. <br /> <br /> In order to avoid the bomb, he will infect you an STD.
