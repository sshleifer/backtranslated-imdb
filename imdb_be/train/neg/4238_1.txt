This movie is terrible. At the end of this you will find that a few hours have been stolen from your life that you can not get back. "Twist" ending is very unnatural. Character development, leading to this final, is not consistent with the actions of their end at the conclusion. Ninety minutes preparation-- with the premise that Rob Lowe character dies on Christmas Eve-- will be explained just ninety seconds, "No, we're just tricking you." Then Rob Lowe did not figure to worry about! "I forgive you if you forgive me," how upset he gets if someone took a few weeks to convince me I was going to die, and then he said. "No, sorry, just lying to you," I would raise some serious hell. I do not feel bad giving a spoiler because I might be able to keep some of you from viewing. please save yourself and do not watch this movie.
