I clearly see now why Robin Hood quickly flopped. The first episode of this is probably the worst ever that the BBC broadcast. Opening scenes were just as intense, intelligent and smart as two monkeys fighting, Robin Hood had no character, and a sword fight was ridiculous. The worst part of the episode Robin Hood kissed a cow wearing makeup at the beginning of the episode - how many people are wearing eyeliner in the 12th century? Nobody. The series can be significantly improved since then, but this is the first episode quickly put down people's expectations, and in fact the hill cr * p. Great Britain was the hero of shame. <br /> <br /> Â«Will You Tolerate This?" I will not, that's for sure, when the BBC does not begin to understand that it is a wise investment. 3/10
