I just watched this film in high-definition television format. I'm in a wheelchair due to neuromuscular disorders and how to watch several films made for those with disabilities. <br /> <br /> In the first I found the main character more noble and interesting. His message about the disabled and the lifetime he spent fighting, that persons with disabilities are recognized and integrated into the labor market of mainstream society is great. And my problem is not a real person who has done these things. He was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposite of the message he preached, I found it insulting. <br /> <br /> First of all, they did not throw anybody in the title role with a real physical disability, of course, they were literate actors, but it seems very real di≈ü preach about the employment of disabled persons, and then actually NOT DISABLED hiring for anything in the film. Further compounded by the fact that at one stage in the middle of the way through the film, the man walked to the podium on crutches, as having only one leg. But CGI in this scene is so obvious that it is a shame. What? They could not find a real Amputee somewhere in the movie? 5 second shot he was more financially to make the CGI effects than hiring actual amputees? At this point in the film, I found it was so fraudulent and completely against the message he is trying to convey that I have come here to whine and complain about how miserable I am a cripple. <br /> <br /> Picture this.
