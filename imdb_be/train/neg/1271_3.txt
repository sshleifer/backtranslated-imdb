This film could be as long as 15 minutes, if it was not for all the quarrels between father and son. Very predictable. Both Men "stars" need a good slap in the face! Do you want cheese with that "whine?" Two giggling ... and headache. I can understand why her mother left her husband after 47 years ... I do not know how it lasted so long! The first 5 minutes I wanted to make a film with wishing that I never paid $ 3.99 to watch it! The film did not flow well and painfully slow. I continued to watch my time clock hoping to fly faster ... That's not true. The script was so much repetition, it had to be easy for the writer to fill the space. On a positive note ... pretty scenery, fall to be my favorite season. Car 40 Ford was also very nice. The film receives a rating D-, who is close to F
