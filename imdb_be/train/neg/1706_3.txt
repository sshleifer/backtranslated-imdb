Wow, this was a very bad film ... how to read other comments that the film has no plot, no character development, they may have had some kind of scenario, but it's hard to say, based on the actual outcome. <br /> <br /> editing of this film does not really exist, it has a tendency to move from one scene to another without any connection or anything to help the viewer in determining what is actually happening. <br /> <br /> overall it is just a low-budget zombie movie that was not well thought out at all, there is a bad action, bad dialogue, bad everything. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this film from 1 or 2 is a gore factor, I think it should be there, where they spent all the money that they had to try to justify to do so. <br /> <br /> If you do not (like me), designed to search for and view all the zombies clicks you can find, not look it. Period.
