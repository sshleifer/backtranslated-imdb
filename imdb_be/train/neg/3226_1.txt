We have reached a ceiling of implausibility with this film. Basically, the dinosaurs on board this ship, piloted by a strange old fart named Neweyes (which I needed after I watched this film). Apparently, Neweyes hears the desires of children worldwide, and decides that he has to provide the desire of children to be brought Dinosaurs in our time, to be seen all over the shameless exploitation. Dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter (is a pity that the writers are not). By the way, it seems strange that of all the wishes of the children in the world, Neweyes gives the desire to bring the dinosaur in our time? Why not give children the desire to stop the famine? Disease? The war? I mean come on! Nha Neweyes nothing better to do with all that power he has ??? Finally, when the dinosaurs get to our time, they begin to sing, dance and wrecking chaos (mostly kind of thing you might see on a bad LSD, I mean, where else can you see the T-Rex, playing golf and jumping on a hot air balloon Spider-man?). They end up in the circus and Neweyes brother Screweyes (???) makes children befriended dinosaurs to sign a blank contract. Why? Why children to sign a blank contract ??? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs ... take a "brain drain" that he would let the children go. Dinosaurs instead of tearing to pieces the evil Screweyes surrender and agree to its terms and conditions. What? That's stupid! They could have simply threatened him, forced him to withdraw from the contract, ate it and then went with the kids. I think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad, it's a moot point when, finally, the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop Screweyes and apparently completely eat it. Oh yeah, it's not violent at all! We have you back ensu, it is not fun, it's stupid, it's stupid, poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film. Even for a small film ... it's not.
