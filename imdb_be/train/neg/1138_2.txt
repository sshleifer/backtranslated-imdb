It was a complete disappointment. Acting is not bad, but the production was so bad that sometimes I felt that I need to stop it, but unfortunately I made it through and was able to finish it a bit confused all bad film. it is suitable if you come with cheese moral areas and do not mind watching a movie, which greatly distorts Whitman. If you want a cheesy fictional story to go for it.
