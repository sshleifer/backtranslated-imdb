I think my favorite part of this movie, one that exemplifies the apparent senseless stupidity and senselessness of the proceedings, comes to the climax of the film. DOCTOR Ted Nelson and his unmarried friend of the sheriff finally monopolized Melting People landing a few steps in the electric generator set. Keep in mind that Nelson was looking for MM for most of the film, and that MM had killed and eaten a few people at this time (including his boss), and Nelson is well known that much of MM crazy and hungry for human flesh and blood. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff shotgun pointed at the MM that and I give the movie and Rick Baker props for that, the most hideous and dreadful object in human form that we have ever seen. And he yells a very important question of Dr. Ted Nelson: "What do we do now?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The cuts camera with Dr. Ted Nelson, and it is obvious that Ted has no idea what to do on. Apparently, Ted was so engrossed in the problem of finding the Melting Man, he never thought to bring along some restraints, lasso or a strait, or network, or some tranquillizer darts, or perhaps tape New Age of of Vangelis, to soothe the savage beast . <br /> <br /> So the Sheriff panics and shoots melting Man goes in a frenzy, and hilarity ensues. <br /> <br /> Maybe this explains why NASA's screwing around with the Space Shuttle program in the sub-month space over the last 30 years instead of going to the moon or to Mars, they know everything they need to be It does. I do not know. <br /> <br /> In any case, this kind of lousy, lazy writing forms and directions undercut every aspect of the film. It's hard to say how good the actors really, because the film has a total contempt for their characters <br /> <br /> Two other incredibly painful sequences also crawl stupidity analysis :. There is a scene depicting lumpiest old couple in the world is trying to steal a lemon grove with only the mercy of melting Man. This scene is in the lower 70s movie. I can guarantee that you have never seen a more pointless and annoying setup with a strange look people in your life. And attack melting man to a woman who lives in the house, where they keep a horse that urinating on the walls defies every attempt to treat it. (By the way, I think that the famous director Demme has extras in this scene, that redneck husband, who does not walk in the first to check out the house and never comes out again). The only thing that keeps the actress literally chewing the scenery that, as I said, their horses, apparently, was to urinate on him. And we are forced to watch her hysteria, at least two minutes longer than any sane director will conduct a survey. <br /> <br /> Berry Debenning should beat the crap out of the director and photographer in the IMM. I remember it from the old Columbo episode where he looked much better than he is here - nobody on the idea of ​​a leading man, but solid and unobtrusive. But no one could be unattractive in real life, as his director makes it look here. <br /> <br /> All the other comes off a little better for the old, with the exception of (and be quiet, I know what they are playing for fun, but I did not laugh!), but not so much. <br /> <br /> It is definitely falls into «So Bad You can not watch Away» category Film disasters. Nevertheless, I would watch it again before I watch a lot of other 70's and 80 miscarriages ( "Track The Moonbeast» and «He lives at night" come to mind), and MST reach of a lot of fun, so if you You get a chance to see the version MST.
