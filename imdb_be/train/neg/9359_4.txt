This film is probably pro-Muslimization. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing this? The protagonist is a Muslim father and Christian mother. He lived his first 20 years in the Christian village. At the end of the movie, he seems to be a Muslim because of his hat, he kept its charm and its overall clothing. He is a child of six years old, who wears the same hat and so, probably, a Muslim, although her mother is Christian. Thus, the protagonist chooses, apparently, to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. None of the other male protagonists, who are Christians, it seems to breed children. There are more Muslims in the world of the film at the end of it, it seems so.
