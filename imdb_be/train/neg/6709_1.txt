I'm easily entertained. I enjoyed "the Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and its many sequels, even when most people find them intolerable. I even managed to enjoy most of the Pauly Shore movie. There is only one film that I have seen, I can honestly say that it was bad ... and that was it. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "This is a silent film. Why do I see it? "It's honestly the only film I can not recommend.
