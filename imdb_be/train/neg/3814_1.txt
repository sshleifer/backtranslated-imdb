I can see the little girls to enjoy this show, but to call it a family show funny. I'm surprised by how well remember it after all these years. This is an extremely unfunny and stupid show about a widowed father of three, who lives with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and the other as the seasons go on. All the story lines tend to be really stupid lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry with someone else, and each episode they make and ends on a light unfunny joke. As for the actors, I do not like them either. Bob Saget was painfully unfunny as a father and mother duties. Dave Coulier is one note jokes 30-something years old, which makes animated voices and acts like a child, and he was the opposite. John Stamos was the most moderate character, but he was so formulaic it was hard to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, the show was really bad actress and showed no emotion ever. The average girl Stephanie was too formulaic as annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed that bad actresses Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they switch them. Storylines too many subplots were so stupid it is unrealistic to crawl worthy. This "family" shows that tried to replace any substance with a good wit and love, and even the ones that are needed for a show about family, they overdid it too much. It will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80s and 90s <br /> <br /> My rating :. Terrible show. HRG for 30 minutes.
