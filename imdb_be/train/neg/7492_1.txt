Apparently, most of the audience does not know anything about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Hitler and Stalin Era. Nuremberg (and a lot of forgotten trials throughout Europe) was revenge and injustice winners. What do you think, why did not the US, British, French or Soviet defendants after World War II? There was no American, British, etc. war crimes? There was no Hiroshima or Nagasaki, either in Tokyo or Dresden or Hamburg or Berlin, or the Katyn and so on? The Germans were war crimes too, but in Nuremberg justice is not a real factor. The main thing was: Vae Victis! Germany must die! (This was also the title of the book in America, 1941) <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible, vile American brainwashing tool, full of errors, lies, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. And above all: complete hypocrisy. But it is not surprising ... Why was not quite himself Nuremberg Trials? This film is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and the hatred and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacre in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very clever. Even Stalin would envy him ...
