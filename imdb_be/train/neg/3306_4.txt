Very "direct" nice old lady who desperately needs money to save her house and property grows "pot" in her home, sprinkle it with a few old friends, Biddy, and then sells it. This is a story for this low-key comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation, and some of the humor brings heavy. For most of the film, it works. Humor is not a variety of laugh out loud, but it's to keep you entertained for an hour-and-a- half, so I believe it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments and interesting to watch Blethyn in the title role. But the ending is really messed up, "cute" movie with offensive-bad messages that only ultra-liberals of the world would like to see a movie. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I would like a happy ending, too, but it should not be all warm and fuzzy for those who violates the law. There is also typical (1) children out of wedlock, but this poses no problem, and it is considered in the order; (2) Priests depicted as mentally weak people; and (3) even a doctor who gets beat, too! <br /> <br /> Hello? And reviewers are bang Hollywood? It demonstrates how a secular society has lowered standards in the UK and Europe as a whole. Hey, people, at least, there are traces of morality, and nothing but, "If it feels good, do it" message Timothy Leary.
