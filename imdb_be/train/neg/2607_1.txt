I watched a movie recently, and it's bad reminiscent of the book is based. I blame it on the bad script and direction. Some parts have been forcibly imposed (gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. I actually read the book after seeing the movie and about 20 years or so after reading it for the first time. I found it difficult to read and a little clumsy. Too many disparate ideas imposed for any good at all ... except for the sensational details of the time. As it covers the material that has been recognized as "sensitive", to put it mildly, during communism, I can see this passion made at the time. This is not the case anymore, though it may be, I see things differently now, or a little of both. The film tries too much to cover many aspects of the book, resulting in a brew of scenes that might make some sense for those who read this book. Even so it is a film that is difficult to observe, and perhaps should never have been made.
