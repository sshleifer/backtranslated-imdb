Quiet night, Mr. Tom begins to incredible gourmet village in the south of England, where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have a lot of ideas about the period we hear radio ads Declaration of the Second World War. Soon the train blowing clouds of steam brings a child refugee from London, and when William is housed shy reluctant, gruff old Tom (you just know, you get to have a heart of gold) starts our story. <br /> <br /> And that sentimental nonsense load it. In fact it is just an old odd couple to each formula. there are no new stories written? <br /> <br /> As I have suggested, there is hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London, except for the odd old ambulances roaring around. And, of course, not a hint of Blitz horror as the citizens of London not to give polite in bomb shelters. Even if a local schoolteacher husband declared missing presumed dead, he later came back to life. <br /> <br /> I found `Goodnight Mister Tom" formulaic and clearly, and the emphasis of John Thaw in the imagination a picture of Ronnie Barker in the two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth, making it `hick accent. <br /> <br /> By the way, my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I did not like it and looking at the colleague-IMDB reviewers, I seem to be in the minority. <br /> <br />
