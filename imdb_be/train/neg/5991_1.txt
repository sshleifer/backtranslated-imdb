ba ba ba ...... sadly it is next to the land battle in science fiction slumberness. Gene Francis (aka General Hospital Laura) has a small role as a reporter, and that in itself should tell you that the film must be bad .... there is Ben Kingsley (Academy Award-winning actor) in such a bitch and some other decent actors. You have to wonder what made them decide to make this horrible film. Music dramatically goes up and down as it is the main dramatic story. Even if you pay attention to the plot can not be traced. The effects are mediocre, and also, it seems, really dated. All the actors say monotonous voice and has no realism to their dialogue. I could go on and on about how it's a bad film. At least, with Battlefield Earth is so bad that it's funny, but it is only to a p i n g Avoid if you do not want to be a lull.
