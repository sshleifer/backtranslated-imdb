WOW! <br /> <br /> I just got this film with my friend who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and he felt that he was! It is boring for most scenes filmed in front of a green screen acting somewhat improvised, almost as if they did not have a script. Martians are CGI, which look like they were made for beginners or fans of film production. I can not stress enough how bad the DVD is actually <br /> <br /> Example: In one scene, the Martians plagued local female prisoner. She is the woman in front of a green screen, a CGI copies of this woman. The change is quite noticeable, and if she is killed, you can see that it is a computer figure, looking like something out of the game in 1990! <br /> <br /> If it's at all possible, avoid this film like the plague! You can download two trailers from their website and see how god-awful it really is!
