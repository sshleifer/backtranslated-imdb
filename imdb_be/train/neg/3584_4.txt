Interestingly, this is the eyes and mouth, Rene Russo - Buddy is not in Gorilla's--, emerging as the focal point «Buddy», production of Jim Henson Pictures by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. Anyway, countless large Russo's face slipped passed in the post-production stage, and it literally fills the screen as many times poor monkey upstaged. Involuntarily funny true story taken from Gertrude "Labor" memoirs Davies Lint in a rich doctor's wife, who turns their mansion in the menagerie of pets and wild life. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it's positively dripping with genuine sincerity. The film never shines kind of "family film" magic, it is necessary, and before too long as people and animals seem to be well programmed (nothing here seems real). About ten minutes in two chimpanzees goofing around in the kitchen and start throwing Rousseau butcher knife back and forth (it skips Alan Cumming head in inches); Nevertheless, no eyebrows do not rise, because it is all in a day of fun. However, if the full-grown gorilla Buddy gets mad during a thunderstorm, the police are called - and everyone looks at Buddy through the window, when he busts up the living room furniture. Furniture should be less than someone else's trouble in this flabbergasting, benefactor failure. But at least we know, Rousseau was in good hands: every time the director Caroline Thompson needed a good pick-up shot, it gives unstartled Rene other extreme close-up. Interestingly, the budget lipstick was in this picture? ** from ****
