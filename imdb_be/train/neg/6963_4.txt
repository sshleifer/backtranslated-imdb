The Japanese have always been incredible ambition of their fantasy films. They have always been willing to destroy the city from the huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is that they have never had the money to succeed in creating a convincing special effects. The film, released in France under the name Les envahisseurs de l'Espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three things from the giant octopus to a giant lobster tries to have the upper hand over the people. It is very uncomfortable and funny, but also very nice, too. In the end, we do like these creatures, and these films in the end, is not it?
