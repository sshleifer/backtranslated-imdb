Unfortunate sequel. Part 1 was a lot of funny moments -.! Part 2 is just bad (in a sad way) and, obviously, made to squeeze money from the fans <br /> <br /> Shame, Otto Waalkes <br /> <br /> only a little funny moment in the film, Helge Schneider, who apparently it seems pis * ed on other characters. It is fairly easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The script sloppy / non-existent. The director shall make every favor and quit his job immediately. Actions worse than second class school games. <br /> <br /> Technically the film badly as well, but who can blame cinematographer / sound of the guys who had to work with such a mediocre director?
