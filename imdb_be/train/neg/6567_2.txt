I went into this film hoping for the best. I love musicals war in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did a good job with their roles; However, the authors gave them the sad dialogue. Love interest between the two of them had not been given any real growth; just all of a sudden he was there. I do not think that most of the music; best room was the code snippet we heard Spike Jones with Â«Face Der Fuhrer's". One full number, Spike Jones was made a little of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff, even a monkey. Bert Lahr comedy skits were endless <br /> <br /> There were pieces to enjoy :. Lucille Ball was rather viewer, and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserve more time on the screen.
