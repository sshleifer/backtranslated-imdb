... but it is certainly not without merit. Already written and directed by Preston Sturges experimenting with unusual cinematic effects to tell their stories, creating a whole has not taken out the decals and the situation, and write a clever and sometimes surprisingly wise and compassionate dialogue. (. Not surprisingly, the next film the Coen brothers would not be a tribute Sturges) <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the plot is not all the way there yet; it lacks surprise, unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fate, that keep the viewer guessing. Coffee slogan lousy thing to hang on the plot, and the ending is completely predictable. Frank Capra does this kind of thing much better. <br /> <br /> If you are new to Preston Sturges, check «The Lady Eve» or "Sullivan's Travels" or "Miracle of Morgan's Creek" in the first place. If you have seen this already then go ahead and watch it.
