I totally agree with the other comments someone has to do what is Tiger Lily with this film. <br /> <br /> It should be one of the worst French films that I've seen in a long time (in fact, together with Brotherwood wolves, 2 terrible films in too short a period of time). <br /> <br /> This is really sad, because the actors really interesting and original idea of ​​a kind of pleasure. Antoine DeCaunes, in particular, and Jean Rochefort being among my favorites, I was bitterly disappointed to see them threatened in a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is very bad, as usual, that is, to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you to the movies, but they do not always give you talent. <br /> <br /> avoid this movie if you want to laugh look in Allen Shaban instead of, or a good period piece full of fun, as the LA FILLE DE D'Artagnan.
