Whether it is a movie ??? This is what the Indians are trying to show ?? I think this is yet another attempt by the Director of the sick-minded to turn down the Pakistani soldiers and indeed the country .... but the fact that we in Pakistan know that we are always ahead of India in every part of our lives ... not only in the military counters. <br /> <br /> Well ... it's bad shot, as the border in early 1997 ... and the director and the writer just trying to overcome the shame of defeat in Kargil by Pakistani armed forces, by creating a movie like this .. <br /> <br /> One thing is very clear ... Every time would be a clash between Pakistan and India .... we win .... !!! Therefore, Mr. Datta try to make some good movies, not nonsense movies like this
