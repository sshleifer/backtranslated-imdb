Ugh, what can I say other than, ugh. I made this film because it was designated as a continuation of the original vampires. This movie could not be any lamer. Lacking not only in the story, but the game is disgusting actors. When combined with some obvious holes story makes this film very difficult one to watch. Many times I asked my own health for the continuation of a long time to watch a movie after the story jumped the shark. Here's a sampling of the lamer aspects ... <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Professional «Slayer» insists on sleeping outdoors at night myself. He wakes up crying woman, is not sitting no more than 3 feet away in the middle of nowhere. He immediately goes to comfort her, not questioning her sudden appearance. She goes from crying to seduce him, and he lets it happen, with obvious results ... <br /> <br /> One of the main characters of Zoe, bitten by a vampire, but as long as it takes these "experimental pill" she received in Mexico, she is well, though her body temperature below room temperature ... <br /> <br /> Guard outside the monastery, where the hero is killed by vampires overnight, the hero goes to the next day, he then returned the next day only to be surprised, vampires attacked the monastery during the night after he left ... <br /> <br /> ... to avoid this and film.
