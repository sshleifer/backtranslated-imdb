CARRY ON Matrona was released in 1972, and it is clear that the number has reached a natural end with the best records as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING be from the mid to late 60s <br /> <br /> itself Matrone is not in any way is not bad, it's just that we've seen it all before with a thin plot (a bunch of spivs trying to break into the hospital to steal a supply of birth control pills, which they plan to sell in the third world), surrounded by gags with a bit of fun, although inexperienced character. I think that's where the problem is - Gag is not all that fun with inexperienced nature starts to show its age. Perhaps we need another film that uses a man dressed as a woman to lead the plot? Perhaps worst critic, I can do what I've seen CARRY ON Matron afternoon, less than twelve hours, and I have the problem of trying to remember a very funny line. This is a serious problem for comedy
