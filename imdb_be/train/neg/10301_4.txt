This fact probably describes the Norwegian race relations in general. . - Nevertheless <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - just a brief introductory description: <br /> <br /> Buddy reflects four young people living in the apartment, the share in Oslo. The protagonist of two young people who are unable to direct his life in any serious fashion, and one could say that the film can be indecision and evade responsibility - a kind of fear of growing up. The narrative plays on typical dreams and fantasies of teenagers and lifestyle role models. It is a clich√©. Although the story is mildly funny, action is good and as a "young man" can be sort of identification with the characters `crazy 'situation and the complicated affairs of love, I do not find a story or character very believable. For polished and lacks depth. This film uses all the classic audience pleasant techniques to make an entertaining film that has so much intellectual depth as `Friends' (so that the show is on TV). <br /> <br /> It has a Norwegian film has finally found its identity:? Audience pleasers in the well-known American style. <br /> <br /> How about watching Tillsammans Lukas Moodysson (compatible).
