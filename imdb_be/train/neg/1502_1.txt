The Ballad of Django is a twisty mess movie! This spaghetti western is just a collection of scenes from the other (and much better!) The film is allegedly linked "Django" with one another, saying it led to a variety of criminals. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) brings nothing to the role of Django. Skip this if you simply must have every Django movie made, and even that may not be a good enough reason to see this !!
