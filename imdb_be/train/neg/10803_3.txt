SO refreshing after watching this movie, and spend an hour and the number of minutes of my life here is a basic resume: Genie out of the ghetto boombox, give this child with shaggy hair 3 wishes, the child spends their wishes on I forgot that, Shaq sucks tapping, and I believe that this is so. <br /> <br /> so basically I laughed, I cried ...... but mostly I was laughing at the shear comedy that came from the finest actors of the NBA player / rapper and a boy with shaggy hair. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film for college kids sat and drank a few beers with his close friends and in serious need of a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it a 3 out of 10 only b / c of the film is based on the three magic wishes. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes could erase that awful movie and for all, to make it appear as Hollywood does not spend money to create it.
