`The Matrix 'was an exciting summer blockbuster, which was visually fantastic, but curiously thoughtful in` Twilight Zone'-ish way. General rule applies here- and this extension is not the same as its predecessor. Worse, it does not even compare with it. <br /> <br /> 'Reloaded »explodes on the screen in the most professional fashion-nya. In the first few seconds of the first impression on the whole is good, as the Trinity was withdrawn in December Immediately thereafter, the film nose dives. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, it is gaining momentum as they enter the Matrix and Fight Agent Smith occur. But it loses all speed, when it reaches a 14-minute car chase sequence, and gets even worse on a big groan worthy twist at the end. Worst of all is `overlong scene Zion Rave». Not only that, it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it is also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> Bullet time aspect `The Matrix» was a nice addition, but `« Reloaded »they abuse, to make it seem sad. The first of these were interesting plot turns, but here too linear to be remotely interesting. The film is basically just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us to understand how empty it actually is. It works on a wrong principle, the more the better. It turns out that `The Matrix» franchise quickly descended into the special effects-drenched misfire that other benefits, such as `Star Wars saga is. <br /> <br /> Standard Poor acting, for the most part. The best character is, of course, goes to Hugo Weaving in 'Agent Smith'- the only one to be a little interesting. Keanu Reeves is the ultimate Neo, but in all the special effects, there is little room to make much of an impact. Academy Award Nominees Laurence Fishburne are reduced to monotonous teacher with bad dialogue. part of Carrie-Anne Moss as chicken action could have been done much better than any other actress. <br /> <br /> poor thrown-together film `The Matrix Reloaded» is a disappointment. Those who do not like the first one, it is unlikely to flock to it. It's one that's just the die-hard fans. Even in the film's own subgenre special effects bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix, etc.) it is still pretty poor. My Rating IMDb: 4,5 / tenth
