I work as a concierge in Washington, DC, and take my word for it, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. # 1 FOX-we just do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater and $ 100 bills! # 2 If I ever allow anyone to use the premises for some time "day of delight," I would have been fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has a well-defined standards of ethics and conduct, which we take seriously. # 3 In the same way it was unfair term, at the end of the film, with Doug simply removing the gold key emblem and give it to some other employee- we earn those keys, and a sign of respect and knowledge to be able to wear them. There is a whole application and verification process of accession to the organization. <br /> <br /> This film does nothing to dispel the wrong perception Concierge as nothing more than a mercenary, clearing money. In short, he does a disservice to our organization. I welcome any comments.
