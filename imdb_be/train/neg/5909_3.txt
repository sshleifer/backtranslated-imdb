On the opening 5 minutes, gave me hope. Meyers then proved that he had only one good idea for the rest of the film. The absolute lowest common denominator of humor. Sick view. Full sick. Written no doubt less than a week, as well as the first. Give Meyers hook and lock him in a cage with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let him until he developed a decent script for something, anything. He has it in him. These Austin Powers things just a shame. <br /> <br /> Let Goldmember sink without a trace.
