While casting for this film was excellent, especially Diane Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, writing quality was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason we have seen the entire movie, it was like a train wreck, and it was almost impossible to look away. Maybe we "hoped" that the message will eventually make itself evident, and that we could borrow some meaning from these efforts. Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the audience may have been able to "sense" the tangled story to understand the absurd credit the ingenuity of the human brain. The authors, however, did nothing to alleviate this innate need we seem to find meaning. <br /> <br /> It was apparent that the participants were just going through the motions of their ships, and that any inner passion for the characters or the story was a secondary or non-existent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, because of the TV films, it seemed to pass over many years. At the time of transmission to the audience may have been a major interest of writers in the past, today's writers and producers seem to be lenient to his audience, focusing primarily on the manipulation of us to "stay tuned" through incessant advertising, which seems to be the sole cause of such films like Surrender, Dorothy made.
