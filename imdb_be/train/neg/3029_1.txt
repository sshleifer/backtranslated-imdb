From the first moment, this "thing" just awful sequence of very short cuts blurry camera work. While the overall story is well positioned for a thriller, the plot is so bad to say that I was not able to buy it. From the middle of the film, the characters actions makes no sense to me. . Stop reading now to avoid spoilers <br /> <br /> For example, the idea of ​​Ed, Edna to make coffee for them after being blown off his son's hand significantly below its presumed expertise; it's just a very stupid idea. Domino without compromising fragmentary orders questioned it receives from Claremont Williams through the phone connection to the breaking just escapes me; whether it should not be long suspicious that Williams turning them into? These FBI agents seem to have minds, showing up only one helicopter to something they have every reason to believe the big mafia shootout. In addition, they make the content and information leak to Cigliutti largely incitement to murder; it seems to me as a farewell to justice if they are doing an investigation the FBI. In fact, they have messed up the case of repairs, if they acted like it. We will see in a car accident, which will generally have at least seriously injure, if not kill most of the passengers, but miraculously leaves all of them just a few strokes. Quite the contrary, the accident immediately followed by Domino makes the love of Choco, which from the point of view of Domino is in no way based on previous events, but only being drugged to the eyeballs. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence of scenes beginning with the phone call Claremont Williams seems to me just as he wants-to-be dramatic spree. This coupled with a terrible, difficult camera work simply makes a piece of hard for me to name the movie. I apologize for the effort the main actors whose talent can be no question.
