Excellent opportunity for Indy and the director to make an entertaining film about a rock musician on the border of Fame. This could be a decent movie, if dealt with a traumatic past John Livien and it hurts his psyche. Instead, it's ridiculous attempt to determine the life of John Livien with John Lennon. John Livien hero Suicida mother was John Lennon, and she wanted to make it more powerful and prolific Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on the musical brilliance of John Lennon and his wonderful ability to expose themselves for others to learn something about his own life, he showed the legacy of Lennon, to be so confused addict soul, which must be seen as God instead of man . I'm a huge fan of John Lennon and the film reminded me of another "crazy" man possessed by Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of that? John Lennon has given so much to the world with his music and honesty, and I was thrown back to see another broken man as the main character in this film get Lennon, not to show his excellent contribution in the world. Yoko Ono kindly paid tribute to John Lennon, making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans the opportunity to honor and remember John. Instead, the director of this movie decided to use this site to the killer attempts to commit suicide. I found it so disturbing and disrespectful to the memory of Lennon. He was a man of peace, who died tough senseless death, and to see such violence near the site felt revises terrible wound for any fan of Lennon. He completely destroyed the film for me. This could be a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in the mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and will not resemble his vicious murder of irresponsible film.
