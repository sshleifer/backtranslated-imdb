I usually do not feel a lot of stimulus to comment on the movies I do not like it, but in such a case as this, I just have to say something. This movie is terrible, illogical and foolish. There are so many flaws in speaking, I did not even feel obliged to clarify, because it's time for me to move on from this experience. The most annoying point is, however, that at no point in the film someone explain whether the motives of the madness of the character associated with Bacon power trip or physiological response to his condition. <br /> <br /> Of course the special effects are impressive, and the last Paul Verhoeven did some good things (cut uncut on DVD Robocop large). However, this film is a fool and do not come to an explanation point or a technical aspect of the subject, and instead settles predictable effect without any pleasure. <br /> <br /> In short, like many other reviews here say (sorry, I've read them to ...) - Stay away from this film!
