I gave this loooooooooooong film "2" because of the attractive actors and sex-sex love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read as a reader speed you'll never get through subtitles that are trying to go to speak up with the Spanish rate! And what the hell is going on in the story, if you can not read subtitles. Endless looks and Loch eye and permanent failure. Just boring after an hour or so. Some good cinematography, but also some so-DARK you think your screen is burned. As it won all that I will never understand. It is difficult to talk about the "act" as leading actors, it seems, simply look and look with love for each other, if they are not pushing each other. Herald character is so attractive that it is hard to believe that someone can push him. And what about his mother? I just did not understand most of the time, except that there were three that everyone seems to have had a history with each other .... but did not understand who whose «EX».
