It seems that more attention has gone to the IMDb reviews of this movie than go to the source <br /> <br /> Here is a review without claims :. <br /> <br /> Just when you think that nothing is going to happen, it is not. <br /> <br /> Put it any way you like, it's a dull film full unengaging characters makes very little interest. <br /> <br /> One to put if you want to make sure vulnerable emo chick you like, so deep, man. <br /> <br /> not to look for fun, though. <br /> <br /> when. <, Br /> <br /> you. <br /> <br /> Pretentious.
