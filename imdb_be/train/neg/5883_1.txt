This film contains no humor for those who live with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too graphically from my own life experience. This film was one of a man with a "Mom Dearest.Â» It reflects both graphically and accurately in the life of many children of a mentally ill parent passes. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me that it was interesting. In any case, I will not tell! Sick humor at best. <br /> <br /> The film is so intense and depressing, my son, and I had to leave the room. It is best to use for this movie for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe that we really are a family living through.
