what kind of sh * t it? Power Rangers vs. Freddy? It was watchable and is as good as the first film in the beginning, but from the part where the protagonists are superhuman in their dreams, he started to become a child. This shit has been evaluated PG or PG-13, rather than R. I expect to see some very mature things, but it was only 1/3 of the film. The rest for small children. Plus, it's too much emphasis on Christianity. I know that Freddie was a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways of dealing with demons. Why should he always be a Christian? This is a general Orientalism and is filled with the superiority of white people / Westerners in. Nya "look at it, show it to young children who love Powerful Rangers.
