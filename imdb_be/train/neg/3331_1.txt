Dreck about three beautiful women in California who are going to cover a festival (or something). All hotels are booked, so they have to spend the night in a terrible old house. What they do not know that there is a terrible resident there who likes to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawn. Boring, meaningless, totally stupid "horror" film. Bach and two of her friends, of course, beautiful, but the film itself is dull dull Dull! Bach and her friends are not NO actresses - they face an empty all the way through. The final "discovery" is ridiculously predictable and there is no blood or gore to keep you interested along the way. There are several expected gratuitous female poverty, but this is not enough to save it. Boring, meaningless and it is not known (for good reason). A 1 all the way.
