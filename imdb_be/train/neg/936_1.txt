I do not understand people. Why is it that this film gets 8.3 !!!!!! ???? I had high hopes for this film, but when I was about half an hour it I just wanted to leave the theater. In the vast majority of reviews on this site of people say that this is one of the best action movies they had seen (or summer, year, etc.) They say that it is a great conclusion. WTF !!!!!!!!! ?????? What has been concluded (except for the fact that Bourne can ride a motorcycle, shoot and fight better than anyone else, he comes across)? What did you learn about the character of Bourne in the film ????????? Absolutely nothing F ****** !!!!!!! Well, there's a lot of action, but what's so cool about the action in this film ?? I do not like movies and movie editing. Shaky camera effect and rapidly changing images have been used too much, and they age rapidly (I'm not against them in Supremacy, because it was still easy to follow and has not been used in excess) and made me dizzy already. I quickly regretting that I saved my $$$ else. <br /> <br /> This film has no plot. All this movie is 115 minutes saw Chase. Born, you know absolutely nothing about in the entire 115 minutes of the film, a perfectionist in everything he tries. There is absolutely no development of character in this film, you do not know anything about anyone, and there is a wide range of new characters that are introduced in this game. Some people say that this movie has incredible writing and suspense. ??????????? !!!!!!!! That writing ???? What is unknown ??? There's no stress. Bourne is so perfect at doing what he does, I do not think he has nothing to worry about. If this is the best film of 2007, I can just quit watching movies completely !!!! <br /> <br /> A lot of people also said that the performance of Matt Damon in the film one of the best (if not the best) in his career. That performance ?? How many lines it is in this movie ??? I have respect for Damon, because he was in the films that I like and play different kinds of characters, but a good actor is someone that you can only distinguish from one film to another, who choose different types of roles. Not someone who plays the same role over and over again (that Damon does not, but the example of someone who does this Vin Diesel). <br /> <br /> In any case, the film was a big disappointment for me. I do not recommend this movie, but I recommend the first two (The Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy), and I definitely recommend reading the three books (which are very different then the movie).
