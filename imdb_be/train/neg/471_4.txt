Stale "losers-to-army" saga, which is half-hearted attempt to be both surreal (foreign subtitles) and vulgar (flatulence gag), but in the end it is a mixture of different types of humor, nor with their very successfully followed. Barbara Bach, Bond Girl in "The Spy who loved me", there are only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
