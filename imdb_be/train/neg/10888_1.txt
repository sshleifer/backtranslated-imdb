This movie is absolutely horrible. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story is almost non-existent, the characters are full of stereotypes and special FX only make you laugh. The only remarkable thing about this film is the guest appearance of rapper Coolio as a kind of police officer. <br /> <br /> If this film was supposed to be a comedy, I do not quite understand the point. If you want to watch this film: please yourself drunk first, and then prepare for some good laughs ... especially when the first Special-FX will appear on the screen <br /> <br /> But if you like trash films are made. on the cheap: this film is a must-see for you.
