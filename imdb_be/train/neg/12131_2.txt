Kevin Spacey is very talented, but, unfortunately, the direction is not his forte. I had great expectations for the film before I took it, and maybe that's why I did not like it so much. I admire the attempt Spacey in making the film, which occurs mainly in a small place, but it does not attempt that counts. I found the film dull, boring, and stretched. Act was not anything spectacular. Sinise has done much better, especially since it is in the minds and in most of his films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but it was one of the first of his films (I enjoy being young and plump the cry star look). The only thing that struck me about this film was one shot out of the car wreck on top. The axial line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera is moved along the line and in the past the wreck. However, the shot was very "suspicious" ish and I think Spacey got the idea from an earlier film of his (it is a very good mind you). If you want to see a fantastic film that takes place in a small place, watch Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT. Maybe Spacey should watch it to shoot it.
