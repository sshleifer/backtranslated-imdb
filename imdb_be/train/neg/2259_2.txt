For the life of me, I can not get why they would like to make a film about the "Jerry Springer Show». It's so bad incrediably. Some ways, unfortunately, it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to recognize that we have seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw it in the US in recent years. This is very bad. I admit that. Jerry does a terrible job, I think he was referring to how to proceed. Or something like that. Jaime Pressly in it. She plays herself mostly. All she had to be her lover, Kid Rock. It would be ideal then. So I would recommend to miss the "arena." Just watch the "Jerry Springer Show». It's more enjoyable than that. <br /> <br /> 2/10
