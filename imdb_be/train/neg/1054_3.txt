Rural family drama - perhaps with a nod to the "ordinary people" - for the younger boy, who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in the shooting failure. Despite the pessimistic object (considering ruthlessly oppressive treatment directed by Christopher Cain), there is a certain dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. Unfortunately, an isolated farming atmosphere and adult characters reluctance to take responsibility for the situation render obsolete the film experience. What's wrong with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Brimley in a cast, the film is almost a small-scale reunion «The Natural». It is a pity that this project has not received the necessary talent behind the camera to really drag out an exciting, memorable picture. * 1/2 ****
