I remember watching the pilot BSG. I can describe this night really. I remember that the chair I was sitting. This show was magical. He revived. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed parts of the third year, even, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, exactly in great hopes that it will somehow turn around. Well, it's not. <br /> <br /> I watched the pilot of Caprica and was captured. There was a hope for something good here. Then I started watching regular episodes, and they are becoming more and more boring. <br /> <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of a great political correctness of his last unsuccessful show, virtuality. <br /> <br /> Most of his line of work on DS9 was good. When he focused on the BSG organized, it was good. This was especially true in the early stages, when they are more or less followed the pattern of episodes, established the first BSG series. When they moved away from that after meeting with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, it all went down the drain. It was, as he wrote the rest of the show, not knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe, it will improve. Maybe it was only a few weak initial episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
