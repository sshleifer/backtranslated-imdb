I try to be very objective when I review the film low budget. I also use a lower weight of independent and low-budget production compared with a big budget production. I expect perfection from about big budget productions and studios. Therefore, I apply more stringent criteria for major releases of the studio. But this film was a dud. Period. The room was awful. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), it was unbelievable how the applicant with an unquenchable desire to solve a crime. There was not enough depth in its character or action that draw you into their world. In addition, to make the film more mysterious lighting in some scenes did not set the mood, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Once again another disappointing film that I could give only three points.
