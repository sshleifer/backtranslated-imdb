Up until the last minutes of the movie, I would give the film score 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is so scary and «Hollywoodized», which completely undermines the first 80% of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the submarine and the possibility that they had received orders to fire their nuclear missiles, Captain, Gene Hackman, all to run, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, in favor of the confirmation of the launch orders first. The problem is to run both the captain and the first officer should use both launch keys. Hackman and Washington intends to launch firmly, yet in the end, it does not lead to an armed uprising on board the sub. In the end, an error is detected, and missiles are not launched. Cool. However, here comes the part that simply does not ring true. After they returned to the ground and go to the Supervisory Board, Washington and Hackman (who had just spent half the film trying to kill each other), shake hands, and all buddy buddy! Yes! Too corny ending to make a movie is worth to me.
