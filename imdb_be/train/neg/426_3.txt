Do not get me wrong, the film is beautiful, the shots are stunning and dramatic material. Nevertheless, it was a big disappointment, and I actually left very angry at what he had done Disney. <br /> <br /> BBC Planet Earth has been getting higher and higher. It was thin. It was the general sense of balance and showed the full circle of life and death. Was a tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. They were balanced. <br /> <br /> edit Disney Earth is not none of it. They tried to do this film we Americans will be talking about. They did it dramatically. They fall on the top of the score there to scare us. They are predators evil. They did evil walrus. They showed each meeting as negative. He tried to be suspenseful and out, but due to the balance of the lesson. The film was an hour and a half of negative coverage, and only about 10 minutes positive. <br /> <br /> I'm all for preventing global warning, but it was at the highest political and environmental stuff. <br /> <br /> This is one more thing, I went to see him on the big screen, but was disappointed in the quality of the image. She looked better on home TVs. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, to go out and buy, rent, or take a series of BBC-Planet Earth. It is better lessons, better sound, and (if you have a Blu-Ray) better image quality.
