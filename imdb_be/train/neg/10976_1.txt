Scary movie, which should be an independent one. This must be some dependence on something. <br /> <br /> it is absolutely miserable film deals with interactions among the Irish people. Were they trying to imitate the great film «Crash?» If yes, then this film is completely broken. <br /> <br /> There is too much going on here at the culmination of a small apron running around and throwing stones at buses and cars, which obviously cause chaos. <br /> <br /> the film is just too choppy to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister thwarted suitor. This leads to the former sister become bitter vetch and walking in the clothes, do not believe it. The older sister is also becoming embittered, but soon finds romance. <br /> <br /> Then, we have 3 losers who buy a mask to rob a bank. Obviously, the robbery goes awry, but it does not seem to be any punishment for criminals. Perhaps the punishment should be the authors of the failure to create a cohesive film.
