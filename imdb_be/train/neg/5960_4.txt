My friends and I rented it for «Bad Movie Night» with high hopes, but the brain was something of a disappointment. The brain itself is great that looks goofy, but it's basically just sits on his little platform. Who would have thought that it would be great that the brain receives only chew on the three people within 94 minutes delayed? This film has a number of things going for it in the first, including Estevez-counterfeiting lead plays a rebellious genius (we were told that his great intelligence laid out with its complex of arbitrariness and school tricks, which include put Krazy Glue on something a chair). It also has some great lines, funny out of shape and out of breath protege, who barely manages to be everywhere, and, yes, some of the chicken is exposed. Nevertheless, the director desperately needs in the school in promoting the arts. Over the past one and a half things are just starting to reach and at least 3 or 4 meaningless, boring chase scenes that make up the middle third of the site. Scenes inside the complex PRI is particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this film are the people running up and down the same stairs. I could fix the script to these things twice, cheese, chas- more gore, more poverty, more action on the brain. If you are going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cool to look at, while my superego excluded. Perhaps the director is really trying to lead the audience in his film, I started to feel like one of the Zombified inhabitants by the end of crapfest.
