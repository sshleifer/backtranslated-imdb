After viewing many «Next Action Star» reality show EPS TiVo taped this Gawd-awful scar for me. For some strange reason - and I have only myself to blame - I looked at it, in the hope that there will be something unique * in the whole film. After so much hype about Joel Silver «Midas Touch» with a click action, he might want to make sure that it is a bone in his alchemy. <br /> <br /> In the first place, only a credit to the film Billy Zane, and even he could not raise scrawling a toilet. Having said that, the performance of Zane hovering around 2 / 3rds the way to the end, since it does not even seem to know what else to do except to look smug. <br /> <br /> I can not blame him there, though. Drawing up, frankly, sucks. Let's idea of ​​"Rat Race," "Enemy of the State", "Terminator", "Sever the Run" and any bad gambling movie you can think of and just rehashing it. And who was a brilliant idea to have two bridges chase sequence in the ROW? <br /> <br /> Sean Carrigan, «people per hour" in «The Next Action Star» shows the strengths and weaknesses of the casting director has for the entire run of the series. One-note Johnny, Sean plays dumb well promising athletes are very good, but is struggling with a shoulder weight of the film. To be honest, we never really seem to care whether he lives or dies about halfway through, as Carrigan can not give occasion for the audience even like him. His dumb, but careless routine bored as there's really nothing about the nature of hurt. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan dream compared to wooden, stiff Karin Van Ryck de Groot. Is Howard Fine exactly tell her to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the film? I do not think so. I kept waiting for her to quote Arnie. Her "performance" character can only be compared with the dramatic depth «Freddy Got Fingered," although not as well developed. The camera loves her in the dark, shady limousines, but in broad daylight its behavior sucks up all the energy on the screen. Joan Bauer has shown a more natural life in its five-minute cameo than Corinne shown in any part of its screen time. <br /> <br /> In the end, Sean cut good looks, to ensure good governance in the ensemble cast, but should not have been left to make this one solo. It was just too big a task for him. "Next Action Star» colleague Jared Elliot may or may not be more fortunate with some more dynamic response, but it's hard to say, given a lame screenplay by Jeff Welch. Someone has to take the iMac Welch from him before he hurts himself or anyone else. Finally, Van Ryck de Groot was just superior and out of her reach, even for full shlock, like this. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
