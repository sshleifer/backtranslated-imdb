With Knightley and O'Toole, how to lead, the film had a good opportunity, and McCallum as the bad guy after Knightley, there may be some tension. But they threw all those away on the evening of silly frills, and then later with tearfulness military remnants. It was, of course, quite superficial, a great English country and the sea or not.The number one mistake was dumping Knight's so early in the film, when she could easily make someone a few years older, and not to choose someone older to play the role for ten years. They missed a good chance to have a big conflict between the cast, and instead of stupidly pulled an easy and inexpensive strings of the soul elements.
