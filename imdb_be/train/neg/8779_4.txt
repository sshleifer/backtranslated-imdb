As a fan of the movie White Noise was a complete disappointment, as the director of the cinema was pretty good, good light, good camera work, a reasonable direction. But as the film is simply sewn as predictable as all other "so-called" horror, that the market in recent years with the dressing. Despite the fact that really was a bit of a "chill factor" of the whole concept (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did'not EVO seem plausible. The film does not explain the reasoning for some cases, but went ahead with them. Action was far from terrible main character did not reflect any emotion, like many recent thriller / horror movies. <br /> <br /> Definitely not a film I'm going to buy on DVD and would not recommend anyone jumps to see him,
