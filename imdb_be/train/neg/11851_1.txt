It was disappointing - not a single nuance of the original. The Brits just seem to be able to make a truly disturbing film with none of the over-the-top theatrics American version. Original series combined both horror stories and subtlety of execution with great attention to lighting and settings. I've watched the series several times, and I still love it. <br /> <br /> Another weak adaptation along the lines of a terrible adaptation of "cracker". Sit down with BBC America and BBC Canada and observe such inventions as the waking dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John notary. See the original touching evil, then look for the "Electricity in the blood" to more accurately refined, elegant design Robson Green. Hollywood should take a look at this actor!
