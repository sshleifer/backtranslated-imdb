This film is so bad, it just defies reality. Filming of the material are elementary school, at best, miserable and acting director must always driven from any form of film. So bad, that can not even be seen as a comedy, something along the lines of Showgirls. The only thing that this DVD has it will cover for her. <br /> <br /> All that I can write for those of you who have not had the misfortune to witness this please do yourself a well-deserved benefits in advance and do not waste your time and money on this piece of garbage. If you want to see the movie for the comedy aspects, there are many other more worthy in this area than this garbage.
