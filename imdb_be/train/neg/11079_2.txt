For several years, looking half decent movies to rent for my children, I have developed a sixth sense for spotting really cheesy, straight to the efforts of the videos that really hurts to sit through (for those over the age of eight). I dropped the ball on this, and the children spent half the movie asked me "what did she say that?" And "why he did it?" And my eye began to hurt from rolling them every minute or so, as the characters have done a very poor job to introduce the seemingly random changes in the plot. And the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with the ball just "what realism" to the film, please run them with a dull knife oil. "Prehysteria!" He was head and shoulders above this. Arrgh.
