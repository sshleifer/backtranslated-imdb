It was not noticeable enough to be truly awful, it was just incredibly lame. The story was not half bad, but the execution was just awful. <br /> <br /> To start with, he was moving too fast to get involved emotionally with what is happening to us. He just went bad. The dialogue was so utterly non-sparkling, just flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, Cripes almightly, they did Deadpool sad. How the hell are you doing Deadpool boring? He was not even funny. He was not crazy. It was just annoying guy with a couple of balls, he does not even know how to use. <br /> <br /> The gambit was boring. And from that time when he had to make a card telekenisis just float and fly around, or super-strength to jump hundreds of feet in the air? And what the hell was with all the stupid traffic helicopters? I mean, we know that they are mutants, but they still exist in the field of physics. Round staff for not a helicopter blade, you can not fly pricks super-duper fast. That gambit could have done in any case. As Deadpool, especially when used as a replacement for a real fight choreography. <br /> <br /> And this film stands as proof that the wires work should only be used to combat coordinators who know WTH they are doing, and know better than to use it in each. single. shot. as a replacement for a real fight choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical fighters in the Marvel Comics (Logan, Credo, and Wilson), and some of the worst fighting choreography I have ever seen in a recent film. It was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged and left it all to the special effects guys. <br /> <br /> And then there was a break with, with all of these mutants, who did nothing. Even mutants which were shown in their cages, to have the power (nice to see the nod Quicksilver), and F-all, when they came out. Only Emma really lame-for-this-movie-Frost and Cyclops have done something. <br /> <br /> And so, when Logan was so beautiful? And stupid, "a bullet takes away his memory." Do not you think you and Xavier X-Men have noticed the big hole fucking bullet in his skull adamant when they X-ray it in the X1? I felt sorry for Lee Schrieber man, in fact he brought a good saber-toothed examination script. He made one of the more simple Marvel supervillains feel real. But he could not save the film from his own epic lameness. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it was the «Daredevil» level of suck. Decent story, good actors, very terrible execution.
