the film begins with the usual funeral ... and he insisted so hard on it in the usual funereal feel that I lost interest in within 5 minutes of viewing, and began skipping scenes. I think whoever did this film suffers to the extent stuck in a constant painful trance, unable to contemplate nothing but death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark children from Southpark, I want a movie that for 10 minutes gets me in a good interesting story, I will not sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparing for the funeral of my grandmother .. her last years was fascinated by the funeral, perhaps she might enjoy this "film".
