Having lived through it inaccurate movies, I admit that this is a modern retelling of the story than the previous version. However, it is inaccurate and has been done so politically correct that it made me mad after viewing. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented, Billy Bob, who I thought would probably have been better cast as Sam Houston gave both men the love of eloquence. I think self-centered Dennis Quaid (actual Texas) Crockett would be perfect, and it would certainly come into his starved sense of self-worship. As a Texan and a true believer in the mindset Texas I feel like Davy Crockett was a quintessential Texan, even if not born here. Our unofficial motto is "Do not braggin ', if it is a fact" was made for Crockett. And the last scene in Alamo, Crockett where the last survivor to be the biggest insult Davy Crockett ever made. To even suggest that this giant and an experienced fighter would have allowed himself to be taken alive laughable. Three different accounts of eye witnesses to the place of his death in a dozen or more bodies of dead Mexican soldiers after, of course, hard hand to hand combat. Finally, that the chrome end of the film, presumably depicting the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual fight against Texicans 600 700 Mexican soldiers, when in fact it was closer to 1,500 well-trained Mexican regulars. Every Texas student, drew attention in his first Texas history class knows the battle was suddenly the Mexican army during the siesta and the Mexican army was so confused that they can not form ranks and fled because they were not trained to fight hand to hand in the border style.
