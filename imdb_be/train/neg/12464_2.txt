This film is supposed to be a thriller, was about five sub-sections, which were developed at the same time the climax at the end, but it ended up being more like a mockery. <br /> <br /> The writing was trite, the pace was slow and disjointed, and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he has to get to the gym, Matt Damon hammed it and others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film is that it has been carefully designed to be politically correct and, therefore, ultimately saying nothing at all about big business, oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentaries provide more excitement. Look, only if there is absolutely nothing to do.
