Only redemptive quality of this film is that it was bad enough to be comical. Everything in this film looks like the porn industry to fall. In fact, I've seen better acting in low budget porn. I though I actually rented a gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: See Note ass you see your (together): I will not leave you <br /> <br /> The first sequence shows how! awful the production, but it is really funny: The good guys have guns transformer! In one scene, they all have counterfeit HK MP5 sub-machine guns. The next scene, AK-47 replicas! And then, to top it all, they're doing a swap weapons between scenes with a couple of M-16 !! I think they had a budget deficit of weapons, not enough to go around between the good and bad guys. The fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake, like all hell. You must remove the pin / spoon grenade to explode yourself. You can not fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while driving inside the helicopter. Weapons that you throw not suddenly reappears. If the gun out of bullets, throw is still pretty silly. If you do not have any idea about how to recharge them .. Large trucks moves slow in first gear to make the uncomfortable scene. I really can not believe that films like this are actually produced. This film would be hilarious to nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk.
