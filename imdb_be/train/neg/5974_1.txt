Let me start by saying that it does not sound or feel like a movie. It looks like just another TV show on the popular girls and boys who do not have the language on top of the actual film back it up. <br /> <br /> The camera angles so straight forward that the story is told in the simplest way never does the public to join him. This film takes us to the place where there is a movie that I've seen done before: in the area where the movie theater becomes a warm environment gives the public every element of interpretation. Too obvious. Big screen movie are used only as an extension of the TV, from which we can see, each attribute of the female is larger than life in this way. <br /> <br /> In recent years it seems that the young directors jeopardizes the film art of making sales. It's very scary. Industrial port of art in cinema. We must educate ourselves and our children that cinema and its language is really about. Not only sales and entertainment, but also a way to communicate feelings, passions, and even culture. Not as a launching pad for young divas and jockeys.
