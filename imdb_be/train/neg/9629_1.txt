I saw it for free, thankfully, and it is a pity that it was better than it was, but it's actually the same old stuff that the studio seems to sell us for the past ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston play a couple are opposites- and yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If the storyline does not take you by surprise and excite you, the film will not be either. <, Br /> <br /> A lot of gags and fart jokes. In the middle of the film, I began to realize that Ben Stiller is not really funny, but he tries very hard. And Aniston is actually not so beautiful, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman must have paid a lot of money to be made in the form of an average ho-hum movie, I have come to expect from them. <br /> <br /> What is interesting was that I saw it after I saw American Splendor, which is really funny and original film and I compared the two in my head and found myself wanting to movie executives They will be forced to sit through the two films back to the backgrounds that may have to knock some sense into them, and <br /> <br /> they will do the best films from the unknown, not this formulaic material that plays better on airplanes.
