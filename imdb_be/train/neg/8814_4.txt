This film is not that interesting in the first ten minutes, with the exception of. The pace and editing are the perfect introduction to ensemble piece, even better than, say, Gosford Park. He then inexplicably slows down, it loses focus and begins to resemble a traditional French film only to restore focus to the end with a love affair between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cecile (Deneuve). In the middle of too many side and the loose ends in the story, several themes have not ended. <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS AHEAD The main story of the relationship between Antoine and CÃ©cile. He was loyal to her after his relationship with her many years ago, in spite of her remarriage and the creation of a house in Morocco. As a builder now he restores his life and restore her marriage Cecil took the mask. In doing this, he was buried after the accident (literally), and getting into a coma. He wakes up only after she burned his old picture as a sign that they have made peace with the past and may well start your life together again. ******* spoiler end <br /> <br /> it is not clear that the vision of the director wants to see us, because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to go to Europe, there are frequent radio broadcasts on state coup of the former Iraqi regime. Child Cecile bisexual and bites dog (fidelity), as soon as he meets his friend, while the girl he lives seems sick (of what?). Her sister traditional Islamic and enters into a relationship with her husband Cecil. It reflects Morocco as unnecessary ago, despite all the building has a wonderful colonial vision shines, almost glorifying the past. He paints Islam as backward and prone to extremism, which can sometimes be true, but certainly not as a whole. In the end, all of this can be described as adding some Couleur locale and l'art Pour l'art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu large. With this material they are so familiar that they are able to weave something extra in each stage: raising an eyebrow, body language that exudes honor clumsy behavior. The film itself is a disappointment, and only confirming the limited role of the French cinema in the world today. With some exceptions, of course.
