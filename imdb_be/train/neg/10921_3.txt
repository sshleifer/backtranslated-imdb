I make a point of watching bad movies often, and the sci-fi channel original movies, as a rule, one of the best sources for these films that you can find. So I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw the sands of oblivion. The action was uncharacteristically subpar, unlike the sadly infamous display of fantasy usually has in store for us. There are a few cameos from people you would probably recognize, though you may not know their names by heart. The CGI special effects are minimal, and as such, one of the largest sources of comedy in particular, science fiction is not enough. Of course, there are some funny moments, like when a guy gets cut down by a bulldozer, or when the protagonist leaves his friend to die in order to save the girl, he is known for a few days, but in general, it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor laughing, and I believe that the biggest disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I were rating it on a scale of 10 stars made specifically to judge the made for TV movie, I'd probably give it a 4, maybe even 5 real shame that I, You may have to wait "until the next fantastic original film to get a good laugh, and I very much hope that this film is not part of a general improvement of quality in science -fi original films.
