This film will reach what I would call emotional abuse at the viewer. The film is supposedly a sensation among critics at Cannes, but for me the final scene was a pathetic attempt to novice director to himself noticed. A little voice in the debate on violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for that matter). <br /> <br /> metamorphosis of the protagonist from the well, but the restless boy vicious rapist is virtually absent, while the rape scene (being more or pulled, exaggerated version of a scene of rape from "A Clockwork Orange") is unbearable, and I refuse to comment on their aesthetic values. There are some things that the artist should not do to try to reach his / her goal. . At least in my mind <br /> <br /> To wrap it up: shockingly brutal, disgusting and not worth your time. See "A Clockwork Orange" or "Le pianist" instead.
