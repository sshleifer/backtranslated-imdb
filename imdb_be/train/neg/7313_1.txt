I spent 5.75 to see this crappy movie, so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What's the dog's sense of split in half at the beginning of the film, the disease has nothing to do with the split in half. <br /> <br /> What's the point to pull the Karen in the barn, it is already fully infected her room, they could just shut it where it would be safer. <, Br /> <br /> Why Hermit run through the woods asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his cousin, hog lady to take him to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why didn "t any of the characters have worked to go to town to get help, when things started to go bad, they are really that lazy? <br /> <br /> Even if Paul threatened the guy w / shotgun for spying on his wife, Paul could have just sent Jeff Burt or back to the house to ask for help. the girl he loves is getting worse. <br /> <br /> What's the point of the box? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after he left, when everyone else is infected when he was such a big leap to go out in the first place would not he just come home? <br /> <br /> When the police went to the difficulties of collecting children and burning them in the fire pit, why they throw Paul halfway into the river, it was not even necessary for the story, because the water has already been polluted. <br /> <br /> Who makes lemonade from river water that shit there is dirt and leaves an error in it. Why not have two children only use tap water, she was infected too, so it's silly to the end will work.
