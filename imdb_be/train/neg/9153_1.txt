I have never written a review before, but I had to do it for this film! This film is so bad, I found that trying to justify how bad it is, trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. But this is not the case. It's really, nya-bashfully BAD. This is a serious attempt that flops nicely. Other observers have noted many shortcomings of the film, so I'll try not to repeat them, but I urge you to see this film. Throughout all this, I was a speechless, literally gasping with disbelief, or rolling on the floor in hysterics. I have not had so much fun watching a movie in recent years. In fact, I'm going to try to get all my friends to see it, because it is a film that should be common <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: -. When Arthur plays have to go -iset boy (his dance of incredibly) - gratuitous nudity (director / lead actor just had to get a shot in the nude) - preacher's office, with its cardboard and fine execution of Christ - of course, the famous wedding scene with palm trees and forgotten rings (?!? any descriptive function makes this game) - the fight against match ex-wife to Ben, to take possession of the pistol - detailed sequence in which Arthur kills the preacher; he seems to burn it with this incredible void match - Yes, gay religious fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WEHO fashion - and, my favorite, the use of Joplin «The Entertainer» as the soundtrack of discovery and «Canon Pachebel in D Major" as the soundtrack of closing! - the list goes on and on - a must see !!!
