Terrible movie. About the old cover artist who hangs around with the young girl. Sad. Tatum O'Neal is going through the motions in part, and has some of the corniest lines in movie history. Richard Burton looks close to death in this film, and we must believe that he looks "Good for sixty." It acts badly as the plot. Terrible characters as the story. It's really hard to feel for those in the film, except for Larry Ewashen, which plays a guy in a porn theater, which falls on Tatum, it's ridiculous. This film is really a waste of time. If you are a fan of Tatum, I - that's why I take it in the first place - please do not watch this movie. It is very bad in it, and you'll wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was an accident. It was not because of the bad news Medvedev and pets LITTLE is known, it can work well, but so far, entirely rented this film. And if you're a fan of the Burton, rent something if it looks good, and not fossil.
