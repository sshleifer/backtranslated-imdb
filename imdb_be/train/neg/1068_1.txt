My wife and I just finished this film, and I came to the IMDb to sympathize with the reviewers who found the film in less than satisfactory. However, with 10 pages of reviews, only a few negative. I feel that this film is a great concept went horribly awry, and I want to warn those who want to watch a movie in the future. <br /> <br /> I'll admit, I'm more inspired to write reviews if I do not like the movie, what, how, when I do, so my handful of reviews are negative. However, this does not mean that I'm biased to the Sun movie, but I often find a more eloquent comments about movies I enjoy. <br /> <br /> Paris Je t'aime most ambitious movie I've seen in years. Using "intelligent" concept and applying some great talents in a pair of the way to a lot of short stories, the film ends with the worst of all worlds. This is art for art's sake, but something that the 2-year-old could come up and do. Giving free reign Director 5 minutes of screen time proving why there is division of labor, even in the field of entertainment. Directors can not write, the authors can not direct. (I would also throw in that Clint Eastwood is overstated, but it is because he the director of one actor of all {that rarely works, or}). <br /> <br /> What ultimately appears distorted mess of short stories that make no sense, have not been completed within 5 minutes, and a total ruin of Paris for me. Why call it Paris Je t'aime, if more appropriate to name the cluster f * ck? There are only a couple of stories that are watchable in the first place a piece of Alfonso Cuar√≥n, but everything else will fall into the unknown. Coen brothers short passable, but can you name the movie in them that does not contain a scene with a guitar pick? It's as if all the leaders decided to do whatever they want to do, and chose Paris as the place to do it. As we all love Paris, this company is included, we are blinded by the fact that this film sucks. In fact, I think they put the names of the directors of each of cowards, because directors have seen how poor this film and decided to make sure that they were accused only of 5 minutes. Seriously. Seriously. <br /> <br /> People Natalie Portman is not a very good actress. It is not pixie dream girl waiting to be yours. And Maggie Zhillenhol why?!? There are people you or just spew performances from other films? I look at you, Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria full of grace) <br /> <br /> One final comment on the action :. I give kudos to Nick Nolte twice for existing and looks more human than you have in ages, or perhaps ever will be again. Find it short on YouTube, as it is 5 minutes, thoroughly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult, and only a few authors have got it right. I mean, Ernest Hemingway, Raymond Carver, by F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, just to name a few. It is much more difficult than writing a full novel, and only truly talented can achieve this. The same can be said of the short films. It turns out that only one director will live in the annals of history. <br /> <br /> If you maintain Paris as a gem to be discovered and displayed through your own lens with your own history, you can not expect to enjoy this movie at all. Director either did not care or were too lazy. In any case, by the time you are reading this means that you have rented it. Praise, if you do not pay $ 10 per head to the theaters to him.
