Oh, it's a movie - I think I was expecting too long to take the dog ... I can not believe that I was looking at all this. I believe that I am optimistic expect that it will be better. Horribly rambling dialogue, helpless steps, and some incredible events. As a mom Toby hanging in the time it takes Col on the second floor and back to go in the room with the ceiling 24 'and no chairs, shelves or anything around her still hanging body that it could possibly climb to make himself . the little girl who played the last was the daughter of the family the best actor in the whole film, and the puppy first pair was a close friend. The storyline has potential and a good script and director can be seriously creepy flick, but this version, unfortunately it is not. I get more scared when I open your electric bill each month.
