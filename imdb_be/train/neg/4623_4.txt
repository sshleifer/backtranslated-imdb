If you have not seen the show gong show, then you will not like this film a lot at all, not knowing that the number of makes it a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 5 out of 10, because it is something to do this kind of fun to help replenish its obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) This is a funny picture of the era it was made, the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get a lot of amusing cameos people you've seen on the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (host) if he does not make into the air TV personality. 4) You get to see a lot of strange people who do all sorts of strange just like you see on TV shows. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things, because there are many, but here are some of the most famous. <br /> <br /> 1) Gong Show Movie has a lot of the actual TV show clips that tired at length of the film. 2) The story line of the film outside of the clip segments is very weak and is mainly composed of only one section of pixels. 3) Chuck is actually a decent half-way, as an actor, but most of the rest of the cast does a typical path over the top of the 1970-plane. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch if you do not have one and a half hours you want to see everything at once. Hours 20 minutes at a time, and it's not so bad. But even then it's not so good either. ;)
