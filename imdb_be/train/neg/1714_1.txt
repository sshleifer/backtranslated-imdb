Once again a classic film was converted from aimlessly predictably disastrous results. Name false as everything about this film. Period is not persuasively, and the conclusions seem to be too young and too bland even criminals. Arthur Penn was the style, humor, perspective, and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version did not exist it would still be an unnecessary film. Version 1967 has deviated from the facts presented hidden version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was interesting and innovative for 1967, and he had some outstanding performances, which enabled you to take care of. This 1992 remake seems taken from the original movie, not the truth, as we know, and the actors in this version inexperienced, unsightly, and not at all interesting. All means skip this and I hope that the 2010 version would be better. It could be worse?
