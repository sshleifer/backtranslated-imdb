Gwoemul (The Host) - Due to the pollution in the river Han mutated beast goes on the rampage. The youngest member of the family Park grabbed the beast, and it is up to the rest of his family to find her before she would be the last meal of the beast <br /> <br /> First of all, I love the movie monster .: Mutated Bears oversized alligators packages predatory Komodo dragons, the whole lot. Features creatures my favorite horror movie. So I really wanted to love the owner, but it was not to be. <br /> <br /> There were three major problems with this: <br /> <br /> First, you can see a quick look at this IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Too many damned genres. It took itself too seriously, to be a comedy, and yet was too light-hearted to have a real message (although it seems to be trying to make some statements. Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). Drama ridiculous and mixed in a tangled mess of all other styles. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after the original monster attack, nothing happens for most of the film. Central family to wander looking for one of their own while the Government of Korea and the United States, appears to do nothing. And that's all they are just wandering around, sometimes hitting each other, presumably some relief comedy. This omission has made my mind wander, and, apparently, he did the same thing for the director, as the whole plot strands remain (mystery swine invented by evil Americans had forgotten about and never solved). <br /> <br /> And finally, the film clumsily political. He paints the American as a stupid and evil, but does not give us American characters with more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the obvious stupid Americans against the wise Korean moment. With Korean morgue assistant asks his boss, coroner, Sun pour chemicals into the Han River. American pathologist, all but laughs maniacally as he bids to continue the assistant. As well as racism, he lazily filmmaking, and there is no excuse for this. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the monster well, like a relic of the mixture and Deep Rising. Some of the effects of the movement is pretty cool, and original monster chase through the park a lot of fun. There are also some good shots in the film. Some of them remind me, strangely enough, in the direction of Firefly was filmed (trembling camera, the focus frames, etc) .There is also a good scene at the end where the hero and a little boy, he had amassed sit in the family cell food stalls. It is night and the snow falls, street lamp, which produces cold light, but the food stall has a warm light coming from it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was very disappointed with this film. I look forward to being a decent flick, and instead I get some pseudo-political, horror-comedy lightweight. Looking I can not comment on the IMDb does not think that if it was manufactured in the USA it would be scheduled. Just because it's a foreign film does not mean anything good. There have been some great movies from South Korea in recent years (Revenge Trilogy and brotherhood, for example), but it is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> This time I am in favor of a remake. Tighten directing, improve scripts, and it might be a good movie. As it is not worth a few hours of one's time.
