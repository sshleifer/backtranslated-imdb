I do not know what you guys are breathing, but please stop. This movie was a complete waste. <br /> <br /> Culkin Kevin McCallister was a nice, cute, sweet, loving, and very interesting to watch. He was innocent, but at the same time, he was strong as well. <br /> <br /> This new kid, Alex? Annoying as all hell! Just a plagiarist when trying to match the charm and grace of Calkin, in failing at it. <br /> <br /> villains shit. Harry and Marv, they were so entertaining team on the screen. They were comedies, they are humorous, and just made you really want to cheer for more Culkin, that is what a good villain is suppose to do. These guys are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely perfect for this role. On the other hand, 3, we have 4 new idiots who only fight and again, trying to capitalize on the charisma and charm of the duo of the first villains. Not to mention that they were terrible, but they do not remember or even really that interesting. More on the template side actually. <br /> <br /> Then we got a real movie. Part 1 and 2, classical. Memorable. The perfect look for Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and produces so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story, and to care about the characters. Simple, memorable and close to the masterpieces. Part 3? A masterpiece of shit. Enough said. <br /> <br /> All and all, I do not know why people love it. I think that people really do not know what a good movie anymore. His Freestuff continued plagiarism with more traps unrealistic and silly new small main character, who I want to be robbers, at least, beat the crap out. <br /> <br /> run, run away from this garbage. And let's not even start with part 4!
