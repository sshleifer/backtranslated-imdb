To be honest as I possibly can, Devil's Plaything (or blood veil or Vampire Ecstasy or Curse of the Black sisters or ????) is a complete bore. The film has a good premise for him ?? resurrection from the dead through the descendant of a long vampire body through the assistance and support groups of women dressed in black ?? but the execution is terrible. There are large, long moments of screen time when nothing happens literally. The characters just stand there and do nothing. There is no mystery, wholly unknown, and there is no plot points to care about. Actions just boring. Most of the action involves a group of below average looking women dance naked, looking at camera. They do this several times. And what little plot there is, it seems, is to get more of these less attractive naked women, so that they can join the dance. Although it is not so bad, pointless, like dancing or story in a kind of orgy of the dead, he is coming.
