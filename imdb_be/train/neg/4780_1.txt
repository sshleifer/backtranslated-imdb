I think that this cartoon is a cartoon of the worst I have ever seen. I would recommend this cartoon man under 5. I loved the show when I was 4 and 5, I still looked only when there was nothing about. Now I have another 5, and I would like to do your homework, than watching. Cartoon used to be a bit ridiculous, but they were not enough to make me laugh. Now I'm older I'm interested in the show witches are not charged us. I started watching Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and The Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I am interested in what to do with Doctor Who because I'm not interested in the 5-year-old cartoons. This cartoon is not very long time it was only 6 seasons, it was canceled because it was not enough viewers, but some people say that this happened because the authors run out of ideas, but also for most other shows that they have at least 8 seasons.
