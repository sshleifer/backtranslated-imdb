Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came, there was a lot of talk about the revival of the film industry in Hong Kong. Do not believe it. People are now making movies in HK to give new meaning to the word of rough. Time exhaustion 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name of a draw here, but he spends most of the movie just grinned idiotically and coin. He flips the coin again and again and again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a cop who is chasing coin flipping handsome. But once again: who knows why? There's a pretty actress in the lead female role, which controls some of the company and must pay a ransom or something, but it basically just looks like it is, rather, at the spa or a shopping mall than in front of the camera. Nothing has any meaning. There's no action. There's no sex. There's no comedy. All have this name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? What is the difference?
