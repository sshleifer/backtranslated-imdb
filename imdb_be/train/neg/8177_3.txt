90 minutes ... Mindy Mindy is a tease to a boyfriend ... Bill Mindy reared in high school dance ... Mindy hitchhiking in Big Sur, shoplifts loaf "bread shepherd," Mindy almost get raped ... Ah, the joy of Crown International Drive especially. You have to remember that these films were never intended to watch from start to finish on a DVD-player. They were made in the atmosphere for 90 minutes so the teenagers with 70s will have a sound track, how they got it into their Pintos and quotes. Lack of stimulation and structures does not matter to the original audience - they probably just tuned in, when T & A on the screen corresponds to the fact that they were before, in the parking lot. The film is really annoying when viewed as history. It's much more fun to talk about it than to watch. My favorite inanities: 1) Bill and his friend escorted teachers to find Mindy. In the absence of luggage or change clothes, they spend 2 nights sharing a motel with a teacher, just like in real life. 2) After having been abducted and raped almost depraved bikers, and after them innocent one "Lord" would be severely beaten, Mindy and her friend found unattended motorcycle on the road. Mindy immediately brightens and chirps, "I'm going" in Big Sur !! "But then again, it's much more fun to speak / read about than to sit.
