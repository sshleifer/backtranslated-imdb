If you view a movie-goer, who uses original content and intellectual uncertainty ... then look elsewhere, little children, because Lunatics really suck. I tend to be more eloquent than this, but ... wow ... it was bad. I especially love when Charles offers Tanya trip home, she refuses, and then he saw on the way home. Where his car ?? Anyway, just do not see it, people. I really want to be more accurate, but the words escape me. Cats jump on people. A guy getting stabbed corn. Cheesey built notorious «WAZOO». Just do not see. Wait, I take that back! See it on the cameo of the writer Stephen King as the guy who owns the cemetery. He's actually pretty good. Even guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, the king gives a better movie performance. But apart from that ... wow ... BAD.
