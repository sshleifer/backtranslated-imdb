Not surprisingly, it was released straight to DVD here in Australia, but did not buy is not available, what so ever. The dialogue was a fake, acting, terrible and the script sucked !! Anyone who thought that it would be a good idea to make a sequel or follow a far superior film Bedem, Wargames with 80s, and they were on it, because it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good at it, like candy / love interest of the eye, while Matt Lanter was good as the other main lead that is about it. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to someone, check the hacker or original Wargames film and better than that piece of shit !!
