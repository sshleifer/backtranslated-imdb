I walked through the AFI list of the top 100 comedies, and I must say that this is really one of the worst. Not only with 90 films on the list I have seen, but from any movie I've ever seen. Drunks sometimes funny, Dudley does not. Lisa almost made it worth it, but unfortunately ... just go and watch Arrested Development, if you want to see it into something good. Seriously, Dudley laugh and drink to be funny? I highly recommend almost any other film in the top 100 AFI comedies for more laughs than this. If you want to see the funnier "drunk", try the Thin Man. Funny movies in general, any movie the Marx Brothers would kill (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).
