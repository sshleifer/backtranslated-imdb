CQ was the worst film I've seen this year. Almost every movie I choose to see in the theater, at least entertaining, or have something to say. This film looks like it was sent to the students of the film for its introduction. to the class of filmmaking. His father makes great movies. His sister made good. But Brother Roman? NO! One critic had the audacity to compare this film Godard's Le Mépris (Contempt). While Coppola, Jr. made to take the same idea, the film of the film, he tried too hard to make himself seem European, elaborate and ingenious, if this is all really just kitsch. The lead actor has the same expression throughout the film as it is either in awe or shocked by this film is going on around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to pull his role as a brilliant director. Depardieu is in order. One scene, which has a real movie parody humor at all is, surprisingly, not scenes B-movie, and one that takes place in Italy; a montage of images of several different characters inside a very small car, running around picking up and dropping random people. It was the only thing that reminds me of a movie I believe he is trying to replace. Or plagiarism. Or both. The documentary with leading talk into the camera and shoot various objects played out, the ending has been marked on for the sake of "twist" or artistic value ... I think that the funniest thing in the movie was the movie itself, rather than the way it is conceived . It is not surprising that the film was sent back after the screening of the festival it will not be edited or re-shot or something that makes me wonder how bad it was before. I can not believe that it could be worse than that. If you want to see a good parody of the movie Austin Powers movies check. Any of them. The opening of a third more interesting and more ingenious than this entire film. Lil »Romi, for a movie, please go back to directing music videos of your cousin. Leave godparents dad.
