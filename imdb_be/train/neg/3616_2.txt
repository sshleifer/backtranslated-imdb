If you simply look at the cover of this film, it's cool. DO NOT. The film put me to sleep. It was a slow pace, had minimal violence and poor use of suspense. The action was a bottom feeder of the material and the plot, while it would be great for another film, it was poorly shown here. They even kill the only likeable character in the whole film! I give it a 2 out of 10, because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end. Additionally, you can save yourself from this rubbish film.
