I went to see this movie with pretty low expectations, believing that it will be a good piece of fluff. Unfortunately, it was not even that. I could hardly sit through the film, not wanting to get out. I went with my two children (aged 10 to 13 years), and they even kept asking, "How many more?" After last until the end, I thought, who would have approved of this scenario. Even reliable Fred Willard could not save the hackneyed dialogue, national jokes, and hackneyed plot. I would suggest that the one who wrote and directed the film (I use the term loosely) should take online screen writing classes or drop their local college for a film class. At least, there are many books on directing and screen writing and film production that will teach them something about the structure, plot, dialogue and stimulation.
