haha! You should just smile and smile when you actually made it all the way through the film. it has something to say about myself I think. the film itself has been created, I think, to some psychological test, or as a kind of drug, to take you to a place you've never been before. If Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical figure tractacus (sp?), He said that it is pointless and useless, but if you're reading this, after you have done, it will take you to the next level as a ladder, and then you You could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding. this film is the same, I think. <br /> <br /> The film is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in a long long time in such a unique way. First of all, it snipes. I loved watching this guy kick ass in different films. I suffered through a few weak. However, even though you know that the movie might suck, you would never have suspected that it could be as bad as it was in reality. that the pleasure of it. I mean it's snipe. You know, it might be good, but it will be all right, is not it? smile. <br /> <br /> so this thing on every level of pure nostalgia, pure real. a reference to the professional and died, and it is obvious, but so poorly done to be funny. there is not a single character in this movie, interestingly, not in the slightest degree. and make it all the more surreal, they have a sound, something sounds like part of the Bourne films to different personality types, but not quite right. In fact, though, seems to be close to the action movie background music, it just so happens, it is done in a way that will grate on you fabulously. <br /> <br /> Then, all the scenes in the general field of black, which is fair because the characters are so flat, you do not really care about what's going to happen, but no matter, once it occurs, and someone is killed, you just say to yourself, I had to see that? what else? What about the scenes with dazzling inverse flashing strobe in pace, for a period that is too long to wear. Sure, let's throw that in. how bout it though. If you are straining your eyes and can not cope with it anymore, do some more of them in the darkness kills where you really do not see what happened. and on top of that, lets face it do not care. You have been in the past a bored way from the beginning. <br /> <br /> so I drifted in and out a couple of times, but I caught almost all of the film. and it becomes something that you can see, not what engages your mind at any level, so it becomes something you can effectively share with and start thinking about his life, where he is, where he was that we as a people. <br /> <br /> ... and that there is the real magic of this film.
