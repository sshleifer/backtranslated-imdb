"I just viewed the movie last night, and I do not think it ever will be thinking the same thing about any of the persons involved, because this movie will follow in the back of my mind.» <br /> < br /> The above statement can be seen as a good or bad thing. I mean, every time I see Tom Cruise and Demi Moore in the movie, I think of "A Few Good Men," which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman and Kristy Swanson, I will think of «Tinseltown», which is very bad. <br /> <br /> I chose it, thinking that it might be something intellectual or, at least, I giggle and Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought it was, at least, there was no I am bad. We can say that the film was made on a budget of roll size, Indiana (Where? Right.) But maybe they were using every dollar to make a good film. Wrong. <br /> <br /> This film is not funny or entertaining in any sense of the word. It is just there, and lasts for 84 minutes painfully slow. <br /> <br /> Symbols paper thin. You take care of almost NONE of characters, as well as the two leading Hollywood screenwriter struggling with sleep, which all two writers struggling with sleep, who wrote this need for you to know about them. Well, two real writers know all about it on-screen version of itself, so they believe that in this way makes the audience. They do not even think about the development of your character, for it to link back to the story of "Gilligan's Island" except. <br /> <br /> The plot is unoriginal. Two guys live in a storage center, where one of them retains the bed, and about twenty other people living there. The rest of the story is far-fetched and silly. Have you seen the "Chosen One Deadly Sins National Comedian"? The second story with Joe Mantegna on a television writer who can not find a good story to make a TV movie about, so it creates one. Now I put a television writer for the writer, morphing Mantegna in to irritating actor half her age, and take a comedy and you've got this film. <br /> <br /> The actors try. Kristy Swanson in the film, maybe 10 minutes, and still gives the best performance in the film. It's still hot, but it would help if it will actually appear in the movie, instead of constantly doing cameos. As for the rest, I do not think it's the actors fault because they have a BAD stuff <br /> <br /> Go watch the movie National Lampoon, but stay away from this movie.
