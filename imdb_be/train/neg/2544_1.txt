Gung Ho was a good idea, but it's a lot to ask American audiences to understand the dynamics of US jobs and foreign competition.In this film the protagonist Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and urges the Japanese automobile company in America to come and help his dying city ​​Pennslyvania. Two things come to you.First why Japanese company come to America to make cars, when they do it, and so good at this? Secondly one can understand that the American companies of all kinds are in a third world country that their products, in order to avoid the cost of American labor? This makes the film room, that's number one car manufacturer in the world will go to one of its main competitors (except for Germany) and put the plant there is unreal. Keaton was still in his comedy mode until now. But it offers reliable operation of all as well as he could prove that he can go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds, and still does not bother himself, but director Ron Howard could not keep it to become a TV movie he ends up in any case, because they have to give the story a happy ending is unlikely policy and problems of Japanese and American relations do not stand up. Gung Ho is Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel to it, as manufacturers of both television shows made the film, and then made a television version of the film, and that gives the film its light feel.The Japanese manager receives loves him and feels American workers that he and other Japanese people can learnfrom Americans.His No.2 Sites people who supposedly does not like an American, all that much does not think so would prefer all Japanese characters were both sites than soft Goofball characters they made with the Japanese to be.It would make the film more interesting.
