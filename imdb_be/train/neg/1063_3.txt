The idea is good. Bringing so many stars in one film is large. But .... too many stories, too short and do not really make any sense. There is no connection between the scenes. There have been some brilliant 3-4 stories ... but they were out of 18. Ram reminded me of "All the Invisible Children" - a film that I liked a lot. Compared with this, however, «Paris Je t'aime» lacks intriguing short story that develops - starts and has its end. And it lacks a theme that connects all of these - the children. I do not find enough topics to Paris to connect 18 short sketches together.Perhaps for people who know Paris is interesting. Otherwise, I would not recommend it ...
