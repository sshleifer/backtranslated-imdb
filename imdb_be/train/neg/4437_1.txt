"Triumph of Love" is not something to celebrate. This hard working, heavy, 4:00 torture. In fact, it has long been less than 2 hours, it just seemed so much more. It hurts me to even think of amateur performances of great actors like Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Supporting players are not so bad. Maybe they're trying to be so over the top, to be a clown, but if so, I do not see it that way. Mira Sorvino is not the impression one way or another. She (he) 's just there. My guess, the game of the same name, written by Marivaux about 270 or so years ago, much better. It could not be worse. Clare ashes, writer and director of this film was inspired by the recent production of the play. I do not know what she was thinking when she created the bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe, it all got lost in translation.
