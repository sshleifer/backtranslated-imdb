Under the dense green glop of computer graphics there shone amazing art and skill Ichikawa Somegoro. Alas, he lost all the mucus. Scenes of old Edo - a courtesan, drifting on the Sumida, rehearsing and acting in Nakamura-Where - were all exciting and interesting, taking you to an interesting and rich era. Action on the Kabuki stage, which stands Somegoro and exciting, there were more enriching than any of the absurd high fun that followed. Skill, the energy in the audience, color sets, it was much more fun than all the stupid things that have made the story and performance. What missed opportunities! One of the best actors of Kabuki alive, and he is lost in dreck.
