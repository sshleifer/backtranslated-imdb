Sometimes a movie is so full it's terrible has a devastating effect on your morale. You begin to really ask yourself, what does this mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect that we will tolerate this much clich√©s and still have fun? <br /> <br /> Of course, this is still a bastion of Hollywood make Fluff the main character, a plot device, and the source of all conflict resolution and in the movies. Character need a gun. He gets a gun. I can not do that, because he has a gun. He puts his gun first. OH MY GOD What do we do? He's got a gun! Waving it around, acting meaner than real human beings ever do. He pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of any conclusion to be comforting sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> This is a real challenge to make this tired, battered formula work again; the film must be very clever and well executed. This one is neither. She has no life, no person, and he will suck these components from YOU. it will make you feel worse about life in space and time that you are doing. Really, who needs that? So yes, I would say: I think it may well be the worst movie I have ever seen. Anyone who has participated in the creation of this sub-mediocre soul murder debris should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they have done for all of us.
