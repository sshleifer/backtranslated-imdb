Well, "enjoy" a pretty relative term, but the flexibility is OK if you are dealing with film director James Glickenhaus caliber. <br /> <br /> McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous, over the fighters I've ever seen, with no nasty edges exterminator. Other reviews have commented on the suspension of disbelief with regard to the average age of the heroic commando movie, but how about making a film in the Philippines, which is set in Colombia? All additional services are Filipino. In fact, the only character who looks remotely good old Hispanic Victor Argo as a convicted "El Presidente"! Oh yes, we have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting, as crazy as the leader of the rebels. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this fun ode to the glory of American imperialism.
