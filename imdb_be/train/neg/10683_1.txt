Some guy gets exhausted. In full view of the other guy shoots him. He has several bodyguards, and they are defective killer, but the reporter gets interesting. She goes to the hospital where they took the guy that got whacked. She walks and corners one bodyguard, but he does not feel like talking. I can not understand why. It's not like anyone else is interested. She is the only reporter there. Anyway, its editor discourage her from working on this lame story. But wait, it does anyway. She goes to her sister's killers & mom. A few minutes after she leaves they get exhausted big time-- who blow their trailer-- huge fireball. It then searches for a bodyguard out of the hospital. She finds his hangover on his boat, but a moment later they were both under water sucking on the bottle 'cause three guys trying to hit them (and blown boat big time-- huge fireball). Reporter and bodyguard broken two of the guys who are trying to hit them. <br /> <br /> During the next hour, the other guy gets hit crossing the street, there is a skirmish with some Stiffs on the stock, which drives the machine with rubble and death, fake suicides, etc. etc. Lotsa stiffs, all kindsa slaughter. <br /> <br /> Great stuff, but what a reporter and a bodyguard can not understand why in hell the original guy got whacked. What is the motivation? Of course, it might help us to understand why the reporter even interesting. After almost all of it is the only reporter on the story. No one in the media cares. Not even all the major race cars and dead bodies. However, the original guy that got beat not quite a celebrity. His work was a bit boring. He was president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent. <br /> <br /> Is that a spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. For there is no camera, no other print reporters, Sun blogger ... just another one of those police blotter crimes ... <br /> <br /> So the spoiler? <br /> <br /> I think Lem ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! Spoiler that his wife did it! Yes ... The First Lady. She was p --- ed, because the president was fooling around. And she goes with him. It is very sharp, so? But how the hell can anyone understand this? Why would anyone bother? In the end, only one reporter even interesting. <br /> <br /> I give this step "1". It was so stupid, I just had to keep watching. And it just got dumber! This is a real spoiler! But despite the fact that I told you, you have to see it to believe it!
