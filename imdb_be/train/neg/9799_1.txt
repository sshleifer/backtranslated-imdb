Power Rangers, totally terrible kid show with 1990s still continues to disturb young children with his full cheesiness, and terrible settings. <br /> <br /> This show was fun, it was an occasion to teach children violence show children how to deal with each other in order to resolve their differences. <br /> <br /> toys were further evidence to contribute to violent television shows and such. <br /> <br /> I've never been able to figure out what ever was the purpose of this completely ridiculous show. <br /> <br /> So, it remains one of the worst children's shows ever made.
