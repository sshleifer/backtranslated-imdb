So Angela grew up and received treatment and surgery to transform it into a real-life daughter, not a son, that she was born, and now is working as a - wait for it - a camp counselor! As is the way, right? I know that I love him. Anyway, the first sequel Sleepaway Camp franchise is subject to all the rules of horror sequels - more blood, more creative murder (which are not shaped, but to an even greater degree than the original), more nudity, more complex plot, and even worse than the original . <br /> <br /> He entertains the same way as the original was, in fact, that the characters and wardrobes so dumb and so exactly 80 that you can not help to get a good laugh. At some point, a guy asks Angela, and she says: "I'll call you," and then goes out quickly. The guy says to himself? "How could she call me I have no phone," And then he sniffs his armpits, wondering what it turned out (it's the hair, dude !!) <br /> <br /> It is well-known. the fact that in the '80s slasher films, murdered teens were more likely not to punish their killers for a bad behavior, usually for being too diverse. When I first started getting into horror movies, and saw on Friday 13 movies in the first right in the middle '90s, I did not understand it. I learned about it in class a film in a year or two later, and was urazha us that there were some method to the madness. I was very impressed that not only were the films on some message, albeit a painful one, but that there was actually some thought put into it. <br /> < ! br /> But in this film at some point, just before Angela kills one of his victims, she says: "Let this be a lesson to you. Say No to Drugs! "The actual writing out there, folks, fine screen. On the other hand, the dialogue is most interesting that in the film. Angela (who, by the way, went through all this treatment and these operations, and all of these problems to clear its past and reinvent itself as a normal and well-developed people, and then changed its name from Angela, uh, Angela), says in one place "I do not like when the wicked witch of the west, but I know what happens when things get out of control." (The people start getting killed ... me! HA!) <br /> <br /> later, it requires that one of the councilors, Mare, to apologize, to which she replies, "I'd rather die! "Unfortunately, Mare, but you really got into that one ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago I was a camp counselor in the sleeping camp similar to the one depicted in the film (with the exception of the camp, which I have taught in more than three children under 15 or 20 councilors, and it was also rules that one in the film). It made me notice a lot of inaccuracies in the film which camp life is really like. <br /> <br /> It's okay, though, it is hardly possible to make a film like this with a lot of 9-year-old running around, although there were some 10 or 11 year olds who were killed in this movie. I have not seen this kind of thing much earlier. <br /> <br /> Definitely bad taste, even for the 80th cheesy slasher film ....
