Well, if you are looking for more Bastketball Diaries, the film is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> I do revolves around two brothers. Max, the youngest, has a large cocaine addiction. Adam, a senior doctor. This film suggests to show to throw from the reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible. This, however, does not. This demonstrates that the cocaine may be interested, no matter what the situation happens to be present. Much of the focus of the film on Max and his parting ways. After all, Adam, can not take the stress of work and begins to use, as well as (perscription drugs). <br /> <br /> This film has almost no climax. Nha down that cocaine does make for you, there are low-budget and sad scenes, and acting on his older brother, Adam, is terrible. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this film managed to transmit and receive a reward, it is not the heart wencher. If you want a clear and accurate story of the film in the extreme world of drugs- rent if not buy "The Basketball Diaries." And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this film, but if you think you will enjoy. Try it and see for yourself ...
