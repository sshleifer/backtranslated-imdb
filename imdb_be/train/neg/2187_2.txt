I bought this movie on DVD, so I could get an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fortunately, Mike, Crow, and Tom Servo is watchable because the film itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story can be followed, and a few actors who can act, there is nothing else. The film was so boring, I said firmly that I would never see him again without Tom, Who and Mike. As noted above, however, it was better than the film featured in the episode that preceded it MST3K; Mitchell.
