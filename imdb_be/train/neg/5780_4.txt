I really wanted to love this movie and watched all the way through, thinking that it was better. Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst film ever, but it never justifies its potential. The room is good, a great cast (I was especially pumped to witness the return of David Naughton), and God loves them, you can say all tried. He just does not hold out again and again. «Brutal Massacre» should serve as a constant reminder that only Christopher Guest filmmakers can make films Christopher Guest, and despite the fact that he makes it look easy, you should probably just forget trying to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran fantastic in this, and they should be considered more often ... they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me. If you are going to have a «Spinal Tap» horror I suspect that you might want a guy who has made «Spinal Tap», Helm to it ... just thinking out loud there.
