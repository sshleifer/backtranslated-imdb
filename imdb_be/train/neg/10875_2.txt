I saw this "film" in recent years, and I must say that it was the worst attempt at making a movie I have ever had the misfortune to see. What the hell is going on with Coolio? Completely unprovoked firing on people in trouble. It is uninvolving, slowly, it is difficult i detached. Worse Spawn. long live "Evil Dead IIÂ».
