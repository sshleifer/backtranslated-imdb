OK, maybe 13 years, I was a bit old for this film. His cherish this rat who lives in the palace. Then sewer rat flushes it down the toilet! He ends up in this city rat and the rat met this girl, who has a jewel greedy toad wants. He would do anything for this gem, it sends an entire army after the two rats.He plans to take a stone and flood the city rat! The cool part about this movie slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noise, his strange, it is also quite funny. OK the bottom line, it is aimed at 7-year-olds. Other wise, a great movie to take the youngest member of the family to see. I do not think that the animation was a real art DreamWorks, although more Wallace and Gromit. thinkthey I slacked a little about it. The film was just decent, not worth spending $ 9.50 for though, sorry.
