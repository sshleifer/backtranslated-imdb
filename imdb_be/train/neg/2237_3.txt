I got this DVD from a friend who got it from someone else (and it probably keeps happening ..) Even on the DVD cover looks cheap, as the entire film. Booms and fist fights with advanced sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple story, it made me smeyatsyatill my stomach hurt! With very little financial resources, I have to admit that it looked quite professional. Saw in the movie, he was one of 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta click nobody's expecting. So if you're tired and want a cheap laugh, see this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
