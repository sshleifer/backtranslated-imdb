Mary Pickford becomes chieftain Scottish clan after the death of her father, and then has an affair. As said the official commentator Snow Leopard, the film is quite episodic start. Some of them are funny, such as Pickford whipping her compatriots in the church, while some are just there. In general, the story is weak, especially processed, contrived romance plot-line and its culmination. The transfer is so dark, it is difficult to estimate the scenery, but even so, it does not seem like the best work of director Maurice Tourneur in. Pickford and Tourneur worked together again in a few more affordable "poor Rich Girl," Valais Pickford as a child character.
