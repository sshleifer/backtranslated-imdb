To make a movie about the alleged end of the world, must have some facts and realism 1. We are never told why these people think it is. 2.Location this New Year in Toronto, Canada. YES land anyone tell me why the then SHINING midnight and why (based on the costumes) DID it looks like September <br /> <br /> 3. The action was that neo-au-natural style, which is needed director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. parts of the story were all sick and without any purpose. I could go on, but I do not want to make it as sad as the film. <br /> <br /> * Evaluation 1/2 (4) 2 on IMDB scale <br /> <br /> I thank you as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
