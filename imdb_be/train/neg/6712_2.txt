I think you have to give some points for the great courage to write a musical about the history lesson, but how about some decent music? <br /> <br /> Is a cartoon action DeSilva Howard meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded kids? <br /> <br /> William Daniels mannered modern (for the time) acting style meant to appeal to a demographic 1960s / 70s? <br /> <br /> We have to do everything "in-jokes" on the New York and New Jersey? (I can hear the blue haircut Broadway audience laughter on cue.) <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think the whole piece of the boring and the current is too harsh for the screen
