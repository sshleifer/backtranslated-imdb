My favorite part was when the credits began to roll. I would like to give him 0.0000000000001 out of 10. I really wish I was in that hour and thirty minutes ago. Do not waste your money and time on it. I really could have watched the grass grow, and felt better after wards. <br /> <br /> Nagy was very beautiful, and I hope that the film does not destroy her career. But she chose to be in it. <br /> <br /> In general, sucking more than any other film I sucked. More Kazaam and shine together. It says something. <br /> <br /> HN <br /> <br /> In <br /> <br /> them !!!!
