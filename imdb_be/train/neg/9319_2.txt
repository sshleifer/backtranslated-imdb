I do not know what you guys are talking about, for the first time I watched this movie with two of my friends could not stop crying. This is one of the funniest fucking I've ever seen. This remark about porn is so specifically, though Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes, this film is actually worse, but it did bring tears to my eyes because of the false heroes, bad dialogue and action. Not to mention the expensive cameras, which they used to take it off? It looks like one of those movies of my drivers ed. class. Props look like they came out of high school drama shows. Music sounds like it's from the original Nintendo gaming system. The only thing that even came close to scaring me about this film was that it was a killer clown that is, who have not crawled out of fat hiding clown? hahaha, if someone ever look at it, though, they need to look at the actors verbal errors as lisping in words and some of their facial expressions. I died hahaha. <br /> <br /> Susan
