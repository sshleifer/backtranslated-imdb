Jean-Claude Van Damme plays twin brothers Alex and Chad, and which is a martial arts expert, team up to take down the bandit responsible for the murder of their parents in that empty head of a martial arts action movie that does not have a plot, which would make better to use a trick to have two, Jean-Claude Van Dammes. Some okay actionscenes, but this is not one of the best Van Damme.
