::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, really nice guy, Arnie, but after the incident with the war on the helicopter and some disobedience of orders, he sent to jail (or, rather, what labor camp) . He runs away, but after a while he again caught. At this time, it ends in a bizarre reality show, in which he has to work for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes, and eventually dies. But we all know, Arnie, and we all know that he is tougher than even the toughest tough guys. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, as Arnie fan and all. Nevertheless, the "Running Man" has too many shortcomings that really annoy the crap out of me. such as reconstruction of the fight Arnie inside the helicopter, which shocked the audience has shown an overview of the incident, complete with 5-10 different angles. This means that a military helicopter, wherein Arnie almost flew equipped cameras 10 photograph the crew members, one of which _inside_ eyes of a member of the crew Arnie punches. <br /> <br /> There are other disadvantages as well, and the story, which in theory seems very interesting and innovative works for a while, it kind of creates a pool of stupidness and unreality in which he drowns. <br /> <br /> Act can not really possible to say that something is better than a sub-par, with Arnie in the title role, making the average performance Arnie. The rest of the cast get without being particularly good or bad <br /> <br /> The special effects are okay without being spectacular <br /> <br /> RATING: .. 3/10
