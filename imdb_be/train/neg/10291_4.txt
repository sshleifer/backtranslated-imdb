80 minutes, and it was twice as long! Brief Crossing Sun short enough. Indeed, the first 50 minutes or so almost entirely of dialogue (a monologue, actually) a woman approaching middle age, tedious mumbling about "men", frustration, sex, aging, and its recent collapse of French teenager she I met in the ship's dining room. <br /> <br /> A boring monologue continues as they go to the duty free shop and a bar, where finally it yourself involved recitation pushes him away. "History" can not end there, of course, and she convinces him to listen to her drone on more, it leads him to his cabin. <br /> <br /> With a little bit of romance, sex, or for that matter, anything at all this film has, besides the bitter conversation is hardly enough to justify the price, if you are not one of those who likes drama where there is nothing interesting at all. Yes, the ending is very nicely done, but it is a poor reward, to expose himself to what is turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with narcissistic whiners. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people like it. I could be wrong.
