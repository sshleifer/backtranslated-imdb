I was very unhappy with this move. Everything was terrible from the start. Comedy was unhumorous, overdone action, tuneless song. Even the plot was weightless. From the writer who wrote the successful scenario, as the Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations. Actors worked too hard and did not help the film at all. Of course, Kareena rocked the screen in a bikini, but within two seconds. I think the stunt director of Hindi should investigate how action movies are performed. They tend to exaggerate too much. In Chinese films, this way of working, because it is their signature piece. But the signature Hindi movie songs is. A good action movie should not last no more than two hours and can not seem unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure these fighters will get much sharper. Also worth noting: comedy and action movies do not mix, if not done properly. Success next time.
