It falls into the category of the film "Way too out of place in the dialogue and the executive agencies to be taken seriously." Whereas Well, a scary movie or back my friend know that they are bad, Stuffed not. Evil Dead set such a high standard of comedy horror genre on the budget that the Scarecrow is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Suspicion immediately inexperience in the game, because there is no hint of noise or vibration in the body and the cockpit of the flying plane. Reruns picture 3 people just yelling for the arc of history, but it does not work. Despite the fact that men, obviously frightened, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> Knowing this film is not too serious for his own good can generate some smiles. I do not remember when Joe Bob Briggs never reads Scarecrow, but I believe that he would not stoop this low. Nevertheless, with a rating of IMDb for more than 6, there are many people who do not agree.
