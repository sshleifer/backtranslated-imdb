Given the limits of this movie (entire movie in one setting - music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors) it should have been done much better. If you have these restrictions in making the film, as if the lighting is so bad? And the actors were horrible, hair below said acting clerk, except that it was a nice movie, it did not matter. Well, he tried, but really can not. <br /> <br /> She makes an attempt to be self-referencing a couple of parts, but the lines were delivered so bad actors it was just bad. And the main character Neil guy that pathetic looser. Clearly, like 10 people to do this "film", and they all knew each other, and it was probably a real rock band, which they had, but unfortuntly these people really have no idea on how to awful all around. This was done in 2005, but they all look so naieve it just smacks of pre-grunge era. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I did not pay to see it (Starz on demand allows more time!), but it was under the name of "Devils" is not Studio 666, it does not matter what you do in the title he can not help it. It could be much better made film - not a reason for this bad film if you have obvious limitations parameters filmmakers had when they made it, working within these limits, you should do the things you can control and things you can work with as much as possible. Instead they realized mediocrity is good enough. This is a music video, wow, that was bad, I quickly fowarded through it. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is true, if you are in a whole b-movie shit I believe you will go and see it,
