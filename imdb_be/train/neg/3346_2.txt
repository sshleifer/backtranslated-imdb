Cheezy thriller starring Lundgren. Lungren it once a military man, who then retreated to a teaching job. But the changes in the area and students have left him frustrated and he decides he? It is going to hang him. Things become risky, if while browsing through a bunch of students detained some robbers take over the school as a basis for work on the armor robbery. His Dolph vs. villains in the struggle with death. Jaw dropping a throw back to the exploitation films of the late Grindhouse era where the bad guys dressed as punks and some of the women had a bad day hair blush. What a fool movie. Watchable in I? Believe people have done this kind of way, it's an action film, which was probably doomed from the get-go to a low budget, fake sets and broke the bad course of action was even a twinkle in the eyes of manufacturers. Look, at the end of the film, how to drive the car through the school (Don? T Ask) are cut into the safety of the tower (don t ask, because it's more like a prison and then a secondary school) and break it difficult to build the form from each other (this It does not look like it was in the previous frame). That has gods bad movies forged? In fact, I? M were surprised, as it was sent (?) Sidney J. Furie, a really good director who made such films as The Boys in Company C. It has the ability failed him, or it was hopeless from the get go, and he did not even bother? This? Turkey. One watchable, but not less than turkey.
