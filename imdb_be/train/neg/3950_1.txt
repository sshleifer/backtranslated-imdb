I did not know before, that in the early 1990s, DeVry University (or is it ITT Tech?) Add a movie he has a wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs. Well, this movie should be a product class valedictorian. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman my Netflix and the film was on the back side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this film. Awful awful awful. <br /> <br /> filmmaker adds 2 main character, a woman and her physician. She was having dreams about Boogeyman and his victim from the first film. More than 50% of the film stock from the original film. The rest of the film's main character, who has bad dreams, and her therapist drones on the narrator. These scenes are removed through the filter so thick a symbol of light. They would look like Angela Lansbury 25 years. Thus, again, awful. Do not watch this movie.
