My wife and I both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever. Of course, in the top ten of those who I have watched all the way through. At least, «Plan 9" was enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I really like "Christine", "The Dead Zone," "Firestarter," "Carrie," and some of his films. I do not care much for "Cujo" (because the sound was so bad in the versions I've seen, and I often could not tell what people said), and "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)». <, Br /> <br /> But this confusion was a common mistake in every possible way. These "creatures" he seemed designed 9-year-old. (No offense to 9 years of age). <br /> <br /> Even the "jokes" will make us groan and were not remotely funny.
