I just saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was really underimpressed. Despite all the buzz of an Oscar, it's nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed with this film never bothered to see any of these films classical music. for a great musical and dramatic performance of Eddie Murphy In addition, Dreamgirls just glorified TV movie, with no style or sense of smell. Just a bunch of amateurs singing alone! <br /> <br /> Now, the first half an hour was good, but I was annoyed as stunning performance raveup Eddie Murphy was truncated and interrupted installation. They were easily the best song and the best performances in the film. And "rise to the top" of the film was only a part of the film, which had a consistent point of view or any momentum. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, chaotic mess that was neither realistic nor sufficiently fantastic to be interesting. He was also visually dull and include too much noise, so the melody. <br /> <br /> Condon Sun attempted to turn any of the tunes in the large pieces of the show, as I expected them to be. Every room in the 2nd half was only one major plan for other people "singing" at each other. And they shot Hudson big "love me" room was the culprit! Condon just shot her stomping across the stage - no drama at all! God it sucked <br /> <br /> And to the attention of all participants - that "sing saying dialogue" material can work on the stage, but it does not work in the movie (see confused Evita and Phantom of failures). All that "I teeeell youuuu the EFFF-ieeee!" shit should have been left on the cutting room floor. This is not a "song." <br /> <br /> Again, the film - for an amazing performance of Eddie Murphy, with the exception - nothing more than a glorified TV movie. There must be a megabucks behind PR-work for this film! I wonder how much money was spent to give him a pre-release "one hit" Oscar buzz? Overall, this movie was, Eddie, except with nowhere near the caliber of film Oscar! (With the exception of Eddie), I would rate it right up there with Grease 2. big disappointment, especially after all the (very expen $ I) Fraud!
