Ironically, the studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with a completely new cast and expect it to swim. Of course, they used a different actor for Batman, but in this case was a classic Batman character, before any of the actor put on his coat. In this case, you have a classic character in the whitish head of horn-rimmed glasses wearing Ralphy, who like Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas ... Somehow we have to forget it and take another little boy who did not share any similarity with the original. .. If I did not know that it was a sequel, I would not have guessed from the actors ... except, of course Grodin as seeks to imitate Darrin McGavin, that your are constantly reminded of the fact that the original was much better ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it could have a job if they left the movie better. They should seek to look likes or simply ignored the original and did not try to copy it looks. This one just a cheap imitation. Ralphy does not cause any sympathy only desire to seem his character to shoot his eye or die.
