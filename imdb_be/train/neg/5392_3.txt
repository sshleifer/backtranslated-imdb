Most of all running wear these white mask tied to them nose and mouth, a thin gum. Initially, this four meets a desperate father, Frank (Meloni with "runaway bride"), and his cute little daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka from "Lost"), blocking the highway one SUV. Brian Frank turns around when he tries to watch for them, but in the process, the oil pan in the Mercedes breaks them, and they are wound around the leg. Reluctant they ride with Frank Jody after sealing the rear of the SUV. She wears a mask over the nose and mouth, and it is covered with blood. Frank heard that doctors treat fragile people in the hospital, and they are sent to him. Unfortunately, someone lied to Frank. The attending physician provides the last couple of children some Kool-Aid, that instead of suffering. The treatment did not improve their condition. Everyone else in the city is dead. Kate tries unsuccessfully to get a dial tone on each phone. Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter, and it allows you to assign a heroic quartet of his SUV and take off. <br /> <br /> In fact, the "carrier" qualifies as a relentlessly depressing film about the impact of a pandemic on the four sympathetic people who degenerate into deadly killer, to protect themselves.

Bobby, she makes a tragic mistake, to sympathize with the dying little girl and pay a terrible price. It is a testament to Pine performance that it can change its character points to put themselves in front of others. In fact, Pine has a role that gives him a chance to pull out a one-eighty from the carefree guy with a heartless guy. <br /> <br /> Both directors are Spanish brothers, and they never interfere with the flag pulse. Since there is no relief in sight, "Carriers" are drowning in predictability. "Irreversible" cinematographer Benoit Debbie does a fantastic job with its widescreen lensing and is questionable how this road trip becomes, DEBIE makes him look like a dynamic film. Besides the lack of a happy ending or closing in every sense of the word "media" is suffering because it's so terribly cynical. The scene where the German Shepherd attack Denis brings more uncertainty, but even that could be improved. Unfortunately, brothers Pastor entirely to frighten or strong tension or unknown. According to fade, you do not really care what happens to anyone.
