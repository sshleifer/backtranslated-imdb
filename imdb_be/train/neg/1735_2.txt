I get the feeling that the producers of this mess was to make the most painful, funny western ever made. "Painful" is the best word I can think to describe it. <br /> <br /> On the side you have good color photographs and a beautiful and well spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy to Jacques Aubuchon (played cripple), which operated well enough annoying part is written so badly that no one actor can give a pleasant performance. Production values ​​were pretty good, only served to emphasize the horror story and the script <br /> <br /> What I hated :. Stewart Granger looked a little like the western figure that with his British accent trim Tailored meetings and stupid always immaculate white handkerchief tied around his neck. It was tedious, as the townspeople and his son constantly fiery and insulting Granger, and he never spoke up and answered back. I know that we have to suspend disbelief and to estimate the Westerns as a symbol of morality plays, but this one broke the spell with him ridiculously unrealistic and predictable scenes, the worst thing in the end, where Granger miraculously, quickly and alone dynamite plants around the canyon pass, that big cattle bad guy will take place, and then Granger plant yourself in an ideal position so that he could shoot the dynamite with a very far distance, to create a rockfall buried and unnerving cattle and bad guys seemingly destroying ny of them all, with the exception of the two main bad guys. Next worst is all about the plot, which is loaded with a soap opera scene. Nothing in the film did not seem plausible: I could not believe that all the conflict was about. The bad guy was driving his herd after the market and would like cows chewing grass along the path; I do not see why something could not be developed. You need a land dispute ownership of it? Do not bother to see it.
