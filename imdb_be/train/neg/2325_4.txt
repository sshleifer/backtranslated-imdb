the first scanners can not be a great movie, but at least it was not original.there there is no news that the current one.The worse, in my view, and the story goes slower, and nothing special.i also not as dialogue. and the special effects are no better than in the movie original.this inferior to the first, only one other about it at all ways.the, that is loud and chaotic to times.But that doesn 't make a good movie.if they did something better history and made it interesting, it might be a decent movie.i really could not get through it all without fast-forward, etc. it.to with me is forgettable movie, and not so much more.despite all that is worse movies.being in generous mood, I'll scanner 2a 4/10.
