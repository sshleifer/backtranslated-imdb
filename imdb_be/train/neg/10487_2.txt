OMG! The only reason I give this film 2 instead of 1, because it's Tom Hanks ridiculous Elvis-in-a-box. Also, how did it halfway decent cast to sign to make such a lame movie ?? Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time ... There's no laughing words, stereotypes are helpless, wasted cast, the direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, much of the blame probably lies with director Joel Zwick. It does not produce anything but flat performances of all participants. Do not waste your time, as I do; but then, I love a good train wreck. Geez, is now the system says I need more lines-- here I go: This film should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now that was funnier than anything in the movie ...
