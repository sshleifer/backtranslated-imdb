The film was «OK». Not bad, not good, just OK. If anything else in the theater it will be skipped away. Unfortunately, Fast and the Furious 2, and smelly, but I'd rather see that than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for Harrison Ford or another young punk, it would be "cute" movie for you. Personally, I would expect HBO or Blockbuster.
