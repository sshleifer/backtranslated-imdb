As if the story line is not depressing enough, this film shows a cow to be scolded graphic slaughterhouse for all of five minutes, until the protagonist describes her early life of a butcher. Weird stuff. Then there's the basic premise of a hero / heroine who goes and cuts his penis off, because it makes you stupid-ten at work said he would go with him if he was a girl. Is this person crazy, a masochist, a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what a traumatic childhood he had? Only the fact that he did not get accepted and had to live with the nuns, who first loved and then hated him because he was unruly. He tries to explain to us why he did what he did, but it's actually really so difficult to empathize. Such a sad and unusual self-destruct. Was it supposed to be funny? What is it all about, really?
