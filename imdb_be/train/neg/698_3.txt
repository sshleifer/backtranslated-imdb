Uninteresting addition to stalk n slash cycle that has dominated the horror genre in the 1980s. It was filmed as Pranks but released as a hostel it was dripping blood, which is evident by the stolen 1970 horror anthology The house that dripped blood. Zuniga is the only known person in the cast, and it was her first horror film (she also appeared in the initiation and The Fly II).
