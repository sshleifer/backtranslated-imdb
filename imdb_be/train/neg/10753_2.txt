Del - «You stupid smartest person I've ever met» <br /> <br /> Calvin- «Well, I had a brain, but they lost it in a rewrite." <br /> <br /> I think what I find most egregious about this bastardization work Asimov was how to draw the character of Susan Calvin. In the books, it was actually one of the first strong female protagonist, able to think your way through a problem. Here she is just a girl in trouble, waiting to be rescued by Smith. <br /> <br /> There is a passing reference to the laws of robotics Asimov, but they are secondary to the CGI and action onstage. <br /> <br /> Smith cute as it in most of his movies, but to be honest, the story is not so good. YOu find out long before these brilliant characters makes.
