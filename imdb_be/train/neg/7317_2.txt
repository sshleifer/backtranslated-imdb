After reading the other comments on this film, I wanted to share my opinion that this is one tough movie to see if you're not a total Brooksophile. I do not. <br /> <br /> When looked at purely objective observer, the film is a single-ended story, which gives us more undistilled neuroses than can be absorbed in one sitting. It's pretty hard to watch. Character Brooks (Robert Cole) so stale and unpleasant, it is difficult to relate to it --- not to mention the root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional contemplation of the situation to the next. And he must never do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man could have a lot of open foliage and suggest how to turn the baby Kathryn Harrold ---- unless, of course, it is not Albert Brooks Albert Brooks controlled production. <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" has its funny moments ----- but they are fragmentary and often. Most of all, I felt as if I was on a closed track with thoroughly dislikable person and wishing that it will end. This confirms the problems that can develop if too much control of the film contains only one person --- someone who lacks self-discipline to be able to move away from it and see what happens. <br /> <br /> As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, as with utnastsi that he portrayed. Six years later, he left Albert Brooks in the highly successful «Broadcast News.» James showed us how Albert could generate significant and entertaining comic performance. Albert has allowed us to see James (as a rule, not cast as an actor) make a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Supporters «Modern Romance» will now be moved to the next glorious comment about it. I say to you ----- have enough pain in the world without having to find it in the film, intended as entertainment.
