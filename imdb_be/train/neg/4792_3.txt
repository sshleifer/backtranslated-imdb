Phantom .... Class. Phantom II ..... strange. Phantasm III ..... ..... mmm scared. <br /> <br /> While I would like to stand up for this movie, I simply can not. The film seems to be "sold." First the bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something that the other does not). In addition, too much meaningless symbols, simple examples of a child (who is the shooter, funny initially but soon you want him to die), a woman who uses a carat to hit the balls (ERM will not work, or rather not must) and flourished zombies (what the hell they're doing out there, there are no references to them in other Phatasms). In addition, there is an acute shortage of midgets running around. <br /> <br /> The only good bits are cracking start and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (possible SPOILER invent) <br /> <br /> For me, this film, It appears as a filler between the II and IV as additional characters leave just the end so can proceed with the base 4 in IV. <br /> <br /> as a whole is very, very disappointing. 3/10
