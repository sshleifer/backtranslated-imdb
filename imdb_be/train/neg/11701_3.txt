Just another example of why the book Stepehn the king should not be made into a movie. (Even of Carrie, one of the best, broken in the adaptation of the book to the screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, which "accidentally" kills the old gypsy. In court, the judge and with the help of the local police chief, he gets off, even if the accident was kind of his fault, because he was not paying attention, as he was driving. Father dead gypsy curses to 3, with our main character, Billy (lawyer) is becoming thinner and thinner every day. Although the film is preserved in the book, for the most part, and has a typical King of the end, the action was stilted and felt compelled. We went from one scene to another without much of anything in between, such as reading instruments in the game. The king himself made a cameo in the film (such as the Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that the authors must remain just that: the authors. Leave the acting to the actors. Not that anyone was great in this movie. I have seen the main characters in the film, where they were much better.
