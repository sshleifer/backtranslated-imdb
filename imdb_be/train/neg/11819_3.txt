Although, unfortunately, the thought itself to be (a) intellectual, (b) important and (c) is interesting, fortunately, this film is more mercifully quickly. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of ​​sado-masochistic relationship between the two protagonists surprisingly banal, and John Lydon shows us all in the space of one film, why he never should have let himself out of the music. His speech on one note and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing we can say that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant will show how much good the actors can act, but fortunately his work here is restrained.
