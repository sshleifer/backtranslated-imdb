Peeew it stinks! As everyone knows, it is based on some insurance commercials Geico; that no one knows why? These videos were funny at first viewing, at best; hardly fodder for the series. (Who says the Geico gecko - it's a different story now that would make for an intriguing series.!) And why on earth and ABC - have been reported in the press - actually agree to buy Cavemen right sign with Geico for this? In the end, the idea of ​​the cave which is struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to the television; Phil Hartman was a recurring Saturday Night Live role unfrozen Caveman Lawyer for more than ten years ago. And that's how this concept, as it works best - as a casual party. But the regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (Series 1960 under the title "It About Time» is also used in the cave in the modern world concept. It lasted one season.) <br /> <br /> One of the directors of the show, which was also responsible for advertising Geico commercials, it was recently quoted as saying: "we were so excited when we did our commercials, because we felt that we had something that was very unique and we had a great story to tell." Wrong. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad TV, it is destined to take its place alongside the 1972's "I and the Chimpanzee" as one of the all time worst. Lead actor in an awkward Chimp fiasco actually went in shame by association ran after he was abruptly canceled. Without a doubt, our Cavemen friends do not follow suit.
