Five or so really good westerns that Mann did not comparable as an ensemble in Hollywood. Even John Ford never made that many with such quality. It is interesting that all of them as they are uneven. Ford's My Darling Clementine costs about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The real hero of them, except Mann and Stuart Chase. Chase to be responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote to a distant country, a bend of the river, and probably some others. But none of them did not complete as My Darling Clementine, but very few films, Western or otherwise have. <br /> <br /> Each of the five films Mann have huge gaps, or is it six, let's see. Bend, Far, West, man, fury, Winchester '73, and let, six, Naked Spur. Everyone has a great scene after beautiful scene with a rather egregious blunders. However, as Red River, which is still the largest Western ever made. Since perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But the far edge of a big, huge hole. It's sentimental, and really comes to life only when Stewart and Mc A fix horns. The rest is pretty pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. Camera Mann is one man, of course, in the film. We are talking about how good eye, as anyone who has ever received a strip of film moving. He almost never in the wrong place, ever. <br /> <br /> far country has one strange moment. And, as it usually happens by Stewart. No one in the history of cinema has never received physical punishment from the authority of the man. He is quite strange to look at him in Bend, of Far, Winchester, and the man with the Laramie to Bend was beaten and hung by a thread, so plausible and so boiling hatred he looks like someone is forced out of Dachau, in a far away he pulled the raft with such force, it looks so convincingly that you start, and, of course, when he pulled through the fire in the man, and you find yourself looking for burn marks. Which actor. Not to mention a point in Winchester, when he knocked out early in a hotel room, as well as anyone else doing it. <br /> <br /> But this area manna: look at Harry Cooper fights with Jack Lord in the Western man. As painful as any fight scene ever recorded. Cooper is not being as convincing as Stuart, however, once it equally looking exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, no one, but no one, but no one ever showed a person being in a pinch, and Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> <br /> See it every Western ever made. They are his true monuments, even if all scetchy. But so what. If he gets roaring with its big stage, they are as good as any, including Ford. And six of his westerns as an ensemble of the best ever made by anyone, period. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Anthony.
