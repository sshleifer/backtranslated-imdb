Well, apart from psychedelic background images, the information provided here was good. The music that I could do without (not that it was bad music, she just does not fit the film in general). <br /> <br /> As for the content of the film, the director brings up often -lacking pagan view of the existence of Christ and the strange comparison of actions and events of Christ's life against life mythological figures / deities, such as Mitra and Dionyses. Then he picks up the chronology of the origins of Christianity and is an "OK" business, but not one that blew me away. <br /> <br /> If the director stuck to the facts, and went with them, the film would have been good. However, at this point in the film, he falls into the group personally Otradnyi attack on the "Passion of the Christ" by Mel Gibson and Christian private school, the director attended in his youth. During an interview with his old principal (which is in the process, it comes to light that the director created under false pretenses), I felt that the director was acting kind of childish. He asked good questions, but, like the film itself, interviews were scattered in the attack on the rules of this particular private school, not Christianity. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are just interested in some information, watch the first 30 minutes or so, and then disable it.
