Yes, he still has gaps in logic than I to describe here and can tax the patience of people - like me, I have to admit - who tend to throw things on TV about, but this is ridiculous, at least. Just because it is not always intentional funny, there's no need to let it get you down <br /> <br /> However, if you read the book. - or any of the other books Brookmyre - then you are probably best avoided. I read them all, and when I first watched this movie, I despised him. I defeated it in detail and at great length on another site, actually.

Watch it, then read the book and then do your comparisons and to provide their views.
