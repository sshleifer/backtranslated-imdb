There's really not much you need to start this review with a small plot synopsis. I mean, it's Shakespeare's Hamlet for God's sake ?? probably one of the most famous plays ever written. I'm not ashamed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet, as most people have at IMDb ?? by Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the show may not be the best place to use to judge the film, in this case, I can not imagine trying to watch it without the comic quips. In short, this German made-for-TV version of Hamlet sick. 152 minutes? No way! It's too dark and upsetting to be all that I want to spend almost three hours. I told him any number of times, but it's fun for me. And it is far from Sawyers wrist entertainment. I do, however, give him a pair of glasses for what I felt was some good enough to act. 3/10 sounds about right to me. <br /> <br /> How much I like MST3K, their comments do not help to make Hamlet any more acceptable. There are some good riffs here and there, but overall, Hamlet simply wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare too Talky, to allow the comedy to have any rhythm or flow. As much as it pains me, I have to give my Hamlet 1/5 scale MST3K estimates.
