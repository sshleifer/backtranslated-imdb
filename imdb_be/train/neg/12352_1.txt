<br /> <br /> How does this movie ever got 6 star average for me. The script is so banal, and openly insult whomevers life he founded. Cinematography comes straight from the world of advertising spots and talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, does not show None surprise, participating in the film, when one looks at the tracklist. In general, a "high concept" style of film that even Don Simpson would be a shame.
