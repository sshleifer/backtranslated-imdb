While I recently gave OPERATING Petticoat positive feedback, I really did not like this film, despite the fact that there was so much in common. Both were made just a few years apart, both starring Cary Grant and both were WWII comedy. Nevertheless, the overall tone and style of the films have been very different. Kiss her for me, as a whole, but it seemed cheaper film - with bad writing, little energy and some very broad performance - even in comparison with OPERATION Petticoat. I think that at least a large part of the blame for this lies in the foundry Jayne Mansfield. The combination of its broad capabilities and the limited capacity of the current actually did it the A-budget film look like it came from the studio of the 3rd year. In addition, there was a lot of chemistry and energy, combined it with Cary Grant - the actor generally liked his sophistication and class. It's like pairing Sir Laurence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
