If you have seen the previous films Rodney Dangerfield and in presentation, you will learn some of the jokes in this amazing part of dreck. Written as a comedy, this movie can not hit any kind of nice chord in all of the self-care physician, played by sexy-aways like chopped liver Molly Shannon to the "I'm fat, and so funny," John Lynette.
