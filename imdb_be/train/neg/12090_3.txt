Despite the fact that I can see a potentially life-saving qualities in the film through this affair, I definitely thought that painfully slow nature in how the structure of a scene played out was too much to ask for most viewers. Huge holes in the script, such as never explained, "your father died today," a comment on his mother made it even harder to try to understand the meaning of these signs. <br /> <br /> It took first place in Cannes in 2001, which is a shock considering. Perhaps the French were starved of film noir in this year and in desperate need of something as sadistic as this film. I realized long scene as a tool to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but when compared with the inability to touch the main character, he had gone too far for me and kept me at arm's length from the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and the one who does not expect a kick out of watching a movie, when it ends. I loved movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which were much more anxious, but at least, gave the audience something in the way of editing and pacing. To watch this teacher a slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so excessive that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to like this movie at every turn.
