I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I have ever seen, as it was one or two decent chances, but I can easily say that this is the most transparent film that I have ever seen. Never subject the device to present itself without me guessing this 10+ minutes in advance. There was no subtlety to what a film made entirely clear intelligence at all behind the scenes. The intention of every spoken or typed Line was so obvious that it was impossible to "get" in the film. <br /> <br /> I found myself laughing at badly-crafted storyline, and clumsily tries to regain the audience, far more often than I found enjoying the movie.
