As a student of physics, I became aware of many idiot professors and other so-called experts in the field. As I continue to study, I learn more and more about the actual physical experiments take place, and about the people who are doing things right. <br /> <br /> Then, my friends tell me about this "physics movie" they want to see. . Without knowing anything about it, I am very happy, in the hope that this information will be well <br /> <br /> I have to make a real quantum mechanics; it was not so. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the basic assumption that everything that happens in the subatomic particles can, and will happen to you if you just open your eyes. Let's think about that for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are made up of somewhere around 10 ~ 30 of these subatomic particles. That is a million billion billion billion particles! The more "mysterious" quantum effects only two particles can have a 50% probability cancel each other completely. As you add more and more particles in the mixture it becomes almost impossible to have a high quantum net result. To let us believe that this is a correct assumption, no rationality behind it ... it's just nonsense. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine, and in physics, and I counted 3 facts in the course of the film, but they were presented in the most misleading I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not say as much for the nervous part of the movie, since I did not have any medical training. It seemed that perhaps it was a little more truth to it, remembering his days in biology, but I can not say, <br /> <br /> At the very least, this movie was a redemptive quality :. Dancing peptides (or whatever they were really) scene. Do not ruin a priceless story that manages this film, but the main character is going to the wedding, where she sees all the different types of personalities "slave" of peptides *, and then the film cuts to the dance floor where we splice between people dancing, sometimes surrounded peptides CG and a fully CG scenes, filled with dancing peptides. The film, at the time, was trying to tell us how we are "addicted emotions", so we were treated to the full songs of this smash hit «Addicted Love.» <br /> <br /> This scene was redemptive, because someone who could pass through this scene and still take this film seriously ... well, you are the ones who need to "open the eyes".
