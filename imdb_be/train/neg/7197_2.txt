GOOD. I think that TV shows like cute and always has some kind of lesson that is involved. So, if my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to fifth. I would like to stay at home and watched TV show instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is stupid and unoriginal is the least of the problems associated with this film. The site is next to non-existent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and, worst of all, the gadget does not bear any lesson at all. It turns out that Disney took all the things that make Inspector Gadget works on television and threw them all. To be fair, my youngest child (8 years old) liked the film, but the older (10 years) left thinking it was silly (he was too old for the youth of humor, but too young for any adult humor). <, Br /> <br /> In general, I love Disney movies, but this one misses by a mile. It is normal for a very narrow age group (for example, from 7 to 9), but it should skip all the rest.
