As an impressive 10-year-old, I liked it, "love conquers all" philosophy of the 70s sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie." I did not understand the dispute, which was about a romantic complications between the Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and Irish teacher Catholic school (Meredith baxter) and both sets of parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald parents Bernie, Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have to interfaith marriage problems. <br /> <br /> Looking for a young couple on the show now with years of personal experience of life, I am surprised that the show was a success, even to each other, though, appreciated the season. Created by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade, who a few years after the show's cancellation will write a successful game «Same Time, Next Year», «Bridget loves Bernie" was very mild, superficial comedy that collapsed under its own weight of the air. <, Br /> <br /> There was no doubt, in real life chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But in subsequent years, as the actors have shown that they are the best actors in other projects (Birney in his brief role in «St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in the "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here they try to breathe life into the show, it took a lot of Gritter comic edge that might, given the complications more depth very controversial issue. <br /> <br /> show aired on Saturday nights between the two heavyweights of the CBS: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both these shows were smart, funny and had enough edge (especially on the ground that the latter), who kept my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget loves Bernie" was not very smart and just had some occasional laughter. <br /> <br /> This was another example it shows that in fact it was not as good as I remembered.
