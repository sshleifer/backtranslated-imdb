My first thoughts on this film was, of course, bad.I expect terrible, bad actions, bad entertainment, funny special effects movie.What I really was not that bad.The effects were absolutely awful, but I found the movie very pretty interesting, and the script was actually very good and decent.The action is not so bad, and in general, I had the pleasure of watching a bad movie is still quite this movie.It, but it is not as useless as I thought it would I am glad to know that this film has managed to wow me, even if it was not what good.Overall, it elm, which should be avoided, but it was not so bad for me, as I expected it to be.
