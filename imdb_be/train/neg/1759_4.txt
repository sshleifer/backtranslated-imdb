This job was as attractive a TV movie ... I do not remember it ever released in cinemas ... If this is the case, then, must have died a quick death. Watching the DVD, from the comfort of our bedrooms, it was obvious that this film was meant not much more ... Ed Lauter art avidly strip? What a fun twist, it must have been ... I have not seen since Ed «The Longest Yard» ... All the rest is largely operated by the numbers, led by Baldwin, with the exception of Pompey ... She had zero charisma, seemed to be sleepwalking through most of the pictures ... the daughter of Pompeo had one measurement ... she played each scene as an attractive little puppy ... slow delivery line every 3 years I've seen yet ... <br /> <br /> chase scene gave my wife and I have headaches ... too fast and sharp angle bashing ... If you are going to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you can once WIDE shots and use the beauty of your background, is not it? The whole story was a rather implausible and far-fetched, but hey, we liked it better than «The Life Aquatic ...»
