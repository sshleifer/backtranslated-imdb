This series would be much better if they just did one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead Name Code: wood. Diamond Head character needed someone who could handle the role of a cute rascal, McShane proved that he could do with a series Lovejoy. Roy Thinnes, the actual Diamond Head, is really the only way in this role. McShane is not so good as the bad guy of the tree. character France Nuyen, in Tso-Tsinghua, do not seem to mind, so be it poor or rigid and ready to fight a woman. She really earned her paycheck at the end, when she was supposed to play the role of a lover in the Diamond Head. After watching an episode or two, I end up not caring about what happened to someone else. Wood gives us a lot to hate him, but Diamond Head does not give us anything like it. Unfortunately, the spy genre in the 1970s was not exactly as it was in the 1960s.
