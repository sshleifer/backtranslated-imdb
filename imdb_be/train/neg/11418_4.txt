Joel Schumaker directs a script he co-wrote, and has a group of cities of Georgetown faced with adult situations. The storyline of the scrambled mess, but some scenes are really good. There is a lot of wasted talent and time here. The cast is more impressive than the movie. Showing Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Estevez, and Eli Sheedy Uinningaya. The most notable of which are McCarthy and Moore. Lowe rather unpleasant. Coming of age is not so damn easy.
