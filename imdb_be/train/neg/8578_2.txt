One of the silliest films of the 1940s, unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring Kay Kyser. Corinthians, the leader of the orchestra and the radio star (and eternal college fraternity sucker-off), was born the predecessor of Spike Jones, hamming it for their guests and are willing reserved his merry troupe of musicians. He was hired to play at a birthday party in a gloomy mansion, the kind where the poison darts, imported from Africa in a frame and hang on the wall. Shindig encounter with the terrible judges, a professor of scary, sinister to you, a lot of females Giggly and enough bad jokes to fill three pictures of Bob Hope. Lyrics (Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) is nothing to brag about is, and no self-confidence Kyser, yukking it with an elbow in the rib material, which turns back in 1940 for ten years. * From ****
