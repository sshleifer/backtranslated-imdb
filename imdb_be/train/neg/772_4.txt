This film is not as good as all the movies of Christ I have ever seen. And I am very surprised that this story Pilate wants to end when Jesus Scripture (and other films) state otherwise. It is also not a very important question: Resurrection .. None of the other films do not miss this very important role: the belief of all of us Christians, it is in this case. As Paul says in one of his letters: "If Christ has not been raised from the dead, our faith is in vain." Very impressive scene for me in this film seen on the streets of the remains of palm trees, which were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> And, finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus is not a myth. Indeed, he was a Jew. There are many documents (relgious and secular), which prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or I said, God became a man) who has really changed mankind. I highly recommend it (given that it is the historian) to read about Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish commentator 1. Century.
