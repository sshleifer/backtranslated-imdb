Group models looking for an apartment to live in, and shows a local real estate agent. Unknown model and agent, however, is that the "threshold of hell" in the apartment and at the intersection, the demon «Dethman» is designed to kill all those who are on their way. Tell Sam Bishop, a journalist who was charged with murder. <br /> <br /> Although I have a low budget wrestler, microbudget and independent films, I can not praise this film. The creators are proud of their 24-hour shooting schedule and at least one actor can boast a DVD of his acting, but I can not wrap my head around it. Why make a movie for 24 hours, if the additional one or two hours of editing will make all the difference? And why after himself on the fact that the current poor, senseless and leads to poor delivery of a few lines? <br /> <br /> A large part of the film, the model indicates the apartment on the real estate agent. Dialogue is clearly an ad hoc libbed because the writer could not come up with such a blank diction. The agent is also apparently did not know anything about a house ... it focuses on aspects of the house, so no one could take care of incorrectly explains a source of heat (radiator, she does not see?) And he says that evil problem will be solved when they call " terminator ". Please, write a script - some variation in the order, but it was a mess <br /> <br /> And why the girl went to the models.? Their careers did not make sense in the story, and it seems a forced situation. At some point, the actress breaks character and says something to the effect of, "Dude, they're going to be (upset)," which sounds more natural than any other line, although ridiculous because of one bad dialogue. <, Br /> <br /> Demon it does not make sense. I appreciated the attempt to explain how "the threshold of hell" jumps to a random place in the world (including multi fireplaces), but why not explain where the demon came? His background includes a person whose love kills another person. How does it make you a demon? (Also, why do we need all these Victorian flashbacks with no dialogue and looked across the field? It was an exaggeration.) <br /> <br /> The dramatic pause between the lines were terrible. The character of Sam Bishop was the worst of the interviewers are not far behind. Does each question, pause, funny face and answer ... and then pause, funny face and back? I was so upset. For me, the only point was to drag a timeout ... but I would have preferred to thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour a terrible delivery (and the more time wasted by rolling through the same credit twice). <, Br /> <br /> Who was the hero of Sam Bishop, anyway? Allegedly he "saw" all this and was charged with the murder of a girl, but not yet at no point was he ever in that part of the story with the girls. So how does he see them? And if he did not, he knew, Dethman killed them? And if he had not seen Dethman, he knows, Dethman spirit Apostoles? I was so lost ... there's even an outline of the story, when it was written? <br /> <br /> The only part I found enjoyable in this movie was the scene of one of the models in the bathroom. Not that it was really important or anything, but it was the only break from the boredom I got. It is interesting that the director thinks Felix Diaz. His music is very good (see DVD behind the scenes of their improvised games), but I wonder about his filmmaking skills. Although, of course, the best part of the DVD was a trailer for his «Superhero Excelsior" (trailer alone is better than all this waste of time). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I have to be so hard ,, I'd like to think that this film was a test that can be done within 24 hours, or maybe just an experiment for fun and idea It did not make a quality film. But if «Superhero Excelsior» is an indicator, Diaz can make the quality ... so why he chose to avoid this here? Perhaps the world will never know.
