Supernatural, the vengeful cop returned to a third party, this time acting as a guardian angel for the wrongfully accused a female police officer. Standard stalk and slash picture, but well-acted and directed, thus making it a surprisingly entertaining and watchable, although violence is not for the faint of heart (especially the section director, who was originally given Â«NC-17" rating). <, Br /> <br /> * 1/2 to ****
