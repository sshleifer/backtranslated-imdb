This is one of those films that I could barely sit through again. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors were good. The problem was in the script, dialogue, direction, editing, sets and special effects. Of course, it was 1933, but it actually squeaked. Part of the problem lies in the fact that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper,, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not known (there crying face recognition that it was not). The film just stick together, without a clutch. Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and no continuity. What a pity! It is such a big book. I would recommend one thousand nine hundred fifty-one version of Disney.
