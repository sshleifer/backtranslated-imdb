A film about the Vixen (Erica Gavin), which has a husband Mountie, who she loves ... but she loves sex too! In the film, she gets a few men in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also a (tame) lesbian sequence. <br /> <br /> This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I believe) the first critics X rated film ever. It was a big hit when it came out. Unfortunately, this is not a good date. <br /> <br /> It is accurate and Erica Gavin just fine (what happened to her), and it was very colorful ... but by today's standards it is extremely tame, I am surprised that he has an NC-17 rating now - nOT hardcore sex and has only topless female and male nudity at all. In addition, it is (unfortunately) quite dull and the addition at the end of the policy is confusing (and rather silly). It is worth while to catch sees as very shocking in 1968. Allegedly, I saw a version of Cut (which is rated R), but I only heard a few seconds here and there are no. <br /> <br /> next film Meier "Beyond the Valley of dolls," is much better, and the timing is very good. Catch that instead.
