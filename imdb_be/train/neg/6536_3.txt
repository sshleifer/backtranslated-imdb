This DVD, seems to be focused on who will just put it and play it in an endless loop in the background. It organized a series of music videos Grand Canyon set of different parts of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TD Music sad, and the transition to DVD looks pretty blurry and dim. DVD's too expensive for what it is.
