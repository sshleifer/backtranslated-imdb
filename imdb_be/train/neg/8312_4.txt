Idea Thumb not the winner of the second time around. ThumbTanic was not as good as the Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. First of all, I think, Mr. Oedekerk was much less work in Titanic joke. Unlike Star Wars, the film Titanic (yet?) Become a cultural myth and there are far fewer links to be made to resonate with the audience. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled with one-time jokes that do not really seem connected to anything. For example, the insinuation of the hero, the heroine is not clean during the "jump off the end of the ship," the scene - it's not funny. Most likely, you just think about yourself, "Did I miss something in the original film?". There were too many of these types of jokes unfounded (cf. arachnids). <br /> <br /> Unlike sending a designer insinuating vessels have significance and it was funny. In addition, a very funny guy was the promise of a plan in the movie, who wanted to go "faster" like a maniac running around demanding * all * be "faster", including the sinking of the ship, and themselves being the first to die. It's kind of a joke meant something in the context of the Titanic and gave digit humor Thumbtanic. <br /> <br /> The thumb "media" face and voice, still fun. Props and sets and CG animation commendable. In general, though ThumbTanic proves that one quirkiness will not work, it filmette still keeps you distracted and laughing until the end.
