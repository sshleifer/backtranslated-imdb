This film has a TV stink all over him. Although it started with great intentions, showing great looking scenery and authentic props and costumes. The film quickly degenerated into a terrible dialogue on the nose of the cheese, and ran TV juicy melodramatic action. The characters were so juicy that at times I thought they were going to degenerate into bile puddle of slime, and the action was so confusing and poorly cut, it looked as soldiers just stood around and took turns to shoot one by one, the Germans were so improbably portrayed what was painful to watch. The only thing that German officers were just talking about how great the Americans. Please take my word for it. I'm a big fan of the military genre, and this film is shit. However, this DVD has an excellent additional feature, covering letters from the line of the First World War front, making this rental is not a complete waste of my time.
