Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: mainly Fulci but Fregasso and Bruno Mattei <br /> <br /> Starring: Octavian Dellacqua, Massimo Wani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafina < br /> <br /> Overview: <br /> <br /> in order to see this film and get a good background on this, I have to start from the beginning. It really started to George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. If Breaking Dawn was released in 79, Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to him and called him a zombie 2. This film is the one that we know as a regular ole zombies. You know, the one in which a zombie fights a shark! So, after this film (called Zombies 2 in Italy) went out and did a huge chunk of cash, the Italians decided to hell. It allows you to make a few more zombies clicks! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombies 3 was born. Confused? The history of this is really just a rehash of stories that we have seen in many American zombies clicks that we've seen before, the best comparison that comes to mind is The Return of the Living Dead. Let's see ... there is a government that experiments with a specific toxic gas that turns people into zombies. The canister is released into the general population and a den! We get loads of zombies hungry for human flesh. A lot of people start running away from zombies and eventually in an old abandoned hotel. They have to fight with the zombies in order to survive. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First of all, the favorite Fulci godfather of gore from Italy was ill. Thus, he could not finish the film in such a way that he wanted. The film is then transferred into two smaller Directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Fregasso (Zombies 4). They did everything possible to revive the film, which was not so good. Do you see yourself entirely Fulci really his heart and soul to this film. He was disappointed in her. He gave Flick to producers and basically said, "Do whatever the hell you want with it," And God loves them, they do <br /> <br /> And this is why ladies and gentlemen, we have such a crappy zombie movie. with great Fulci credited as "director". the main problem, in my opinion, is that it is a meaningless hole! There's no substance to it at all! After the first few minutes, in which some terrorists steal a toxic gas and accidentally released it, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters without any sort t m any person does not work on zombies. Now in some cases it can be fun when the # 1 zombie makeup and zombie action is really good fun, and # 2 have a lot of gore and guts part. <br /> <br /> Here we do not get any! well, there are some inspired moments there, as, for example, when some eagles infected with the gas, and they begin to attack people. It was cool. there's also a scene involving a flying zombie head (which, incidentally challenges all logic and explanation) and the scene with zombies coming out of the abandoned hotel pool and chewed on the baa Noah girl's legs. But other than that ... the rest of the clicks just falls flat on his ass. <br /> <br /> The endless endless scenes that did not make socket to move the site no longer exists along. That was my main gripe with this movement. Set looks incomplete and art direction are almost nonexistent. I hate it when it looks so damn unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this one time to actually go even lower! It closer to the level of g-click, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Zombie make up? Pure crap. Zombies are all Asian actors (the film was shot in the Philippines), so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombie. But this is not a big problem, as they are the film was set in phillipine islands anyway. Its external appearance of zombies, which really sucks! They all died with the same clothes for several reasons. And that goes for the zombies here make up a bunch of black make-up (more like spots) on their faces. One or two zombies were a little harder to do, but it still was not good enough to impress. It's just a bunch of goo splashed aimlessly on the actors' faces. So it's not just a film develops slowly, but the zombie looks like crap. They must be dead people! Anyhows, for those who are waiting for the usual cool in a wave of Fulci does not come here waiting for him cause it's basically someone film. And those two are involved (Mattei and Fragasso) does not actually put there heart and soul into it. In fact, if you see the extras on the DVD you will see that if Fragasso asked about his memories and his feelings on this flick here, he did not even need to take it seriously. You can say that he is ashamed of it, and in many cases, he says, that they "just do their job, and they did it." And that my friends, is the final nail in the film. There is no love, and no heart is not put into the making of this film. Thus, you get a half assed, crappy zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Only for people or completed, or who want to see every zombie movie ever made. Everyone else, do not even bother! Rating: 1 out of 5
