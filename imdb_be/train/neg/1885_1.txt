If you are looking for a movie to show the existence pointless and sad life of the middle class caught in the web without communication and false ideals, then this movie is for you. If you also that the film will be interesting and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere. There are many movies that do it much better. For example, try some of the dark Bergman films. Filmmaker believes that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, it should expose the viewer to a painfully boring and idle incident other until the film finally comes to its tortuous and miserable end. If you value your time, there are much better ways to spend two hours ago cleaning your home, for example.
