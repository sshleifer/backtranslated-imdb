Although it is odd to crack a good joke, humor is usually fairly dry with team members often refer to the coupler or coarse language and are waiting on the crowd to applaud enough lame jokes. <br /> <br /> Unlike other comment which says that I do not think this is the best RTE ever done, its really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, there are some really funny smart jokes that would make you really laugh out loud. People seem to have convinced comedians are well-known names, and not judge the quality of the gags that are not so good. In general, his mediocre with some good laughs to be had, but often it can be quite mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens things. I find Benny Hill funnier.
