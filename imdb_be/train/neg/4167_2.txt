I really wanted to see "Mr. Fix It», because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. What I got, though, was 1-1 / 2 o'clock nap. The room seemed pleasant: Boreanaz Lance Valenteen, a business owner called «Mr. Fix It », where the men dumped enlist his help to get their friends to take them back <br /> <br /> Among the problems associated with it. film are editing, screenplay and acting. Although I found Boreanaz beautiful in his other film roles (except for the film "The Raven", he did), it was a disappointment. From time to time, his character was interesting and the other flat. The supporting cast has reminded me of the soap opera of the day the players. I understand that it was not a big-budget film, but some of the cut scenes and the music just does not seem right <br /> <br /> My advice :. Watch at your own risk.
