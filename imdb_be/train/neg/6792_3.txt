Here is a film with a good cast and a nice looking place of work, but it's just not him. Directed by Richard Brooks was a bit tired at this stage of the game; How much better it was THE PROFESSIONALS! Horses and other actions seemed to be in slow motion, even in non-slow scenes. This film need to be speeded-up, if anything. This horse soap sure looked terribly out of tune to me and clear tire tracks in the desert improvement moments- just lazy. sloppy job. Too bad. The actors have done well, but of course, I've seen all of them better. Ben Johnson is always a joy, though. I saw this movie for the first time almost 30 years ago; Then I was disappointed and remained so after the second show after 30 years.
