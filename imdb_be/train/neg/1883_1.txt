I do not think it can be done, but something has come and replace the low-budget open house horror of someone killed by the high price of real estate- as the worst film I've ever seen in my short, but otherwise a sweet life. <br /> <br /> He was touted as the best film in the last Film Festival in Montreal, which leads me to believe that any other record should consist of the blank walls of the shots are accompanied by grim reading poetry. <, Br /> <br /> Watching this film was like a little piece of hell. It is from Austria and he is trying to hobble the footsteps of Short Cuts and blue Velvet- scenes of different characters, who live in a suburban area with a dark underbelly. There's a fat dog owner and his fat wife's maid, striptease for him, lean divorced wife who still lives with him in the house, which includes a pristine room of her dead child, the uber-annoying fellow traveler who reads ten best lists ... The list goes on. Forever. As well as two hours, plus I spent in the theater. <br /> <br /> Thus, characters interact with each other, but not in a reasonable or interesting or even appropriately. I could not tell if they were not, like the actors, since, according to the subtitle, they got the lines that were the Austrian equivalent of "You are so lame!" Of course, they do not have to learn a lot, as each repeated its the same line, at least three times on stage. <br /> <br /> This is not Gummo, or any of the aforementioned films. There is no art to find, and there is nothing to stop on then, except you follow, may be whether or not you change your "never get out while watching the movie" politicians (which was quite a lot of older couples at random orgy scene- and if it sounds appetizing, it's not as if you're one of the few who does not find the idea of ​​your parents, who are on the ground floor and with several of the local pair of middle-aged, with a disgusting boot). <br /> <br /> this film was offensive to me. Nha loose nudity and do not crawl cause soundtrack, entirely unstressed the scene with a gun. I was offended that someone actually spent the money to do it, if there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding. I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if it was the best we could find Montrealers. Most of all, I was offended that, one way or another, the people participating in the festival fool everyone, believing that the emperor was a brilliant and fascinating new outfit, if it it was painfully obvious that he was naked, as the fat maid wife p beat striptease. <br /> <br />
