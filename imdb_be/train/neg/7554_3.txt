I have never seen in 1973, a senior version of the highly acclaimed. I am a supporter of Nicolas Cage (by the way, perfectly valid as usual). This film probably took all of five minutes, to forge the whole story (I can see that this is done on a napkin at dinner), if you can not figure out the ending of the saliva within the first thirty minutes, you will probably find this film interesting. This is the last time a terrible rut that Hollywood seems to dig itself out of a horror / mystery / thriller genre, is not able to give the audience enough credit and write fresh, clever and tantalizing scenario, they dish with some eerie music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little bit, and then send the final print to a local theater. At least he did not have the syndrome shaking his hand-held camera.
