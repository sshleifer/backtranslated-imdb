I could not find too much in a recent biography of Alec Guinness to Paris with love. I am sure that Guinness made the film to get a free trip to Paris with him. The film did not have any other reason to exist. <br /> <br /> Paris, of course, beautifully photographed this remarkable discovery Guinness and his son rode on the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it goes down from there. <br /> <br /> There's just no chemistry at all between Guinness and a young girl who he had a brief affair with Paris. According to a recent biography of Guinness Piers Paul Read, Guinness positively disliked the girl, found her unprofessional conduct. With regard to the fact that the thought of her roles Odile Vernois, the record is not available. They have so much chemistry as two neutered cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness does have a good point in the film, which was straight out of one of his comedies, Ealing, he climbs a tree, trying to get a badminton shuttlecock. But I would not expect in a film for him. <br /> <br /> At least, Alec was a trip to Paris from the transaction.
