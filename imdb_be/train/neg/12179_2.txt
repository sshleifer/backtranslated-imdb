You should not even watch this tacky spoiler ruining all about "Annie." Characters seems almost cheap in a poorly written story line, and they are low quality feeling to the production. It was very well done for television, but if I found it on my TV, I'd pour it right over. The children in the film to make the work Alright, but adults are incredible, and therefore the film may not exactly attract you. This film is not enough number of music / Thats dancing made the original brilliant and whether or not to take the shine Ani we all love. Johnson, Annie sometimes annoying and more acted..you can not convince myself that it really is Annie. Differences in the character's appearance continued to annoy me throughout the film. It is sad to say that this sequel was a total failure.
