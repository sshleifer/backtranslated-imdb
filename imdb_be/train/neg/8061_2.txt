Can I start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor, and I have great respect for his work. I want him to be in a film that showcased his talent. With that said, emerging from shower was very, very bad film. Too bad. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that I'm lying almost all the blame on the poor script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had an excellent performance in American Beauty, Seyzhmiller did well, and Dushku is now a girl in Hollywood. I do not think that any of the actors really got into the script, and I understand why. To say that this film belongs to the genre of horror exaggeration. It also has twists and turns one would expect, but they just do not lead anywhere ... except more confusion. I just found the ending very anti-climatic, because it just does not seem to make any sense, or really answer any of the questions I had about the storyline. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a good review, but I can not. Honestly, the only thing I think you will find scary about this film is that you paid for it.
