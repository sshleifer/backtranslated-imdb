I had high expectations for the next "My Beautiful Laundrette", "Bend It Like Beckham", and (to a lesser extent), "East is East". History of British Asians fit into their adopted homes were a lot of good tracks on the big screen, as well as a number of prominent TV and radio series (Perfection father, etc.). This one falls flat. Despite a good start, he quickly went downhill. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was awful typical BBC effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky for the actions of the characters, "those were the days" soundtrack, and a lot of "issues" in an attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I found myself cringing at many points during this film. Drafting predictable. A variety of clichés and dragged ether. In fact, I have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural / cross generations of devices that could be used that were not. The characters were thin and formulaic: the eccentric non-conformist servant; well-meaning but ultimately racist old; overweight, overbearing aunt; that crafty Indian parents; working class neighbor; "Wise" deep old woman; motorcycle riding gunman. The script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with a clear racist dialogue of two dimensional racist white characters combined. And why he had to be set in the 70's (with the exception of the necessary foundation for the '70s soundtrack) is a mystery. Perhaps it makes incredible characters a little more believable to people born after 1979, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Even those things aside, a good game actors could carry it into respectable obscurity. Instead, the usual "comedy BBC» suspects have been rolled out to ham it. "Bend It Like Beckham" was much better than the comic action (and serious action, in fact) than it is with the largely unknown cast. <br /> <br /> In general, lazy formulaic script, I acted in over a dull predictable plot. Give it a miss. <br /> <br />
