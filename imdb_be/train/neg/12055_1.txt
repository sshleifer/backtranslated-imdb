Do not waste your money or time on this miserable piece of the film under the guise cinematography.When every third word is dedicated to foul language and there is no real plot, as well as a replica of the old actors who are still giving the same speech dated from the past and did not evolve in his car 'EASURES, leaves much to be said. I was expecting something better from winning actor Benicio del Toro. Seeing that others may have to be permanently distorted Puertorricans such trash as Maldeamores. Foul word at this point in the film can be used to emphasize this point of view and may even be funny or sad, depending on the context (see the movie Elsa and Fred, for example), but it does not permeate the story. The film is a common awkwardness and there was absolutely nothing funny or cute about this movie.
