It was the first Ewan McGregor film I've ever seen outside of Star Wars. Since then I have become a very big fan of Ewan McGregor, but I still can not bring himself to the mere existence of this film. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a big fan of Jane Austen and because of this, I have been subjected to a variety of classics, Emma is one of them. I have always considered them annoying, stupid and boring. However, after watching this horrible execution, I had to admit that the original Emma is beautiful and magical. Ewan McGregor just serve the purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow funny to have a funny character and the rest of the film is not remarkable and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation for anyone who remotely interested in the British period drama ... to see original source. If you are a fan of Ewan McGregor ... trust me, letting the movie, you have nothing but five minutes of his team in a silly hat and a bad haircut is not missed.
