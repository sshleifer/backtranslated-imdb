Although some aspects of Seven Pounds is a tough and interesting in some of his narrative style, Muccino project is pretty mediocre. The film is becoming more and more juicy and manipulative as the movement to the end: the heart of the human and emotional, physical and metaphorical eye. Seven pounds more than an amateur imitation Gonzalez Inarritu in Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with lots and lots of flashbacks. The problem is that the story is predictable from the very easy on through the movie. That's too bad, because seven pounds can be as specific "good" when Ben and Emily were put in the right hands.
