Ok so here's the basic plot. It's 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, 168-year-old Chinese man who lives long enough. The film begins with his birth, where he says, by drinking a special elixir that (even the film never mentions) prolongs its life. Well, on this occasion of the elixir he fell awkwardly assistant (Kato, if you remember the movie Pink Panther), and he orders his henchmen to then find 6 rare items to make the elixir. This creates a global man hunt in which his supporters eventually rob the diamond museum and going into London to meet with nemisis Dr. Fu, a retired Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith, also plays Sellers, who is trying to stop him that assume to be witty comedic adventure. <br /> <br /> This Apparantly Sellers last full-length film, which he did before he died. Terrible tragedy that he was in it. Sellers who are such a talented comedian and had memorable "funny" roles in Panther and particualrly in the film «The Party», it is nothing; but in this film. This film was an absolute torture to sit through, and I could not even finish. It is equipped with DEATH, and I kept cringing, watching the work of sellers. After the arrival of the big work "Being There," a year ago, as I mean, how can he do this and how to get this thing even made ??? As one person mentioned the first 10..15 minutes normally, but then it is all DOWNHILL ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Evaluation 1 of 10.
