I admit it. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman in the world, and made it a mission to see every movie she was in (unfortunately, includes the terrible movies Batman and Robin, The Avengers) and this one. <br /> <br /> this is the case as the worst movie I have ever seen. (Yes, it takes even less than the Avengers). All looks lost in it, and this incoherent beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Even if you think, is the goddess of Reason, as I do, please, please do not put yourself under this film. you will hate yourself in the morning for him.
