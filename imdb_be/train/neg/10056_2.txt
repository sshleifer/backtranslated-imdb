So ... we get so see the added footage Brando ... interesting, but not exactly Oscar worthy material. Susannah York is hardly a slouch. New scene where Lois learns Clark Superman a little unbelievable that he does not notice that there are gaps that come out of the gun instead of real bullets. Real bullet penetrated his clothes, and then jumped from it to the floor, but forget that ... let's listen to ridicule the Donner version of Leicester, who has made more logical sense. President speaks about Zod "spoiling" a monument in Washington, DC, where it was originally Mount Rushmore. Adjusting the scene made this line is quite absurd. "Freedom of the press" Superman line sounded stupid compared to Â«..Care go beyond", which was raised better and had a decent connection to the early stage of Clark truck stop. Then there's the ending to the effect of "turning back the world to go back in time." He turned everything in the whole film, and made you wonder exactly where the missile is designed for Hackensack, N.J. The ever gone, because it does not release Zod and the company more.
