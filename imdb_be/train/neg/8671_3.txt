I watched this movie on 21 March this year.Must says disappointment.But much better than «Tridev» .Plot is hackneyed.Tells of Prabhat, who lives with his father, his wife and young brother.The film opens, if it rescues the bride. Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad making a plot to kill his young brother.He plan makes sending multiple man.They come to school, I pretended Prabhats friends.Kill that kid.His father throws him house.Then .He later returned and Aakash to go to Kenya to find him.Sunny gives good performance, chunky irritating at best, Naseerdun wasted.Divya is done well, Sonam wasted Jyotsna nothing, but looked cute.The child who played SunnyS brother in the film was cute.Too sad he was to receive his character killed.The girl was pretty, but was annoying.The other child did good.Alok made good .Kiran was adequate.Amrish and Gulshan did good.The beautiful cinematography in India and Kenya.Script weak, but has some good dialogs.Also pulls .The music was showing alright.I film like only one song «Saat Samundar» the lyrics of this song was good.The other songs were forgettable.Don't look at it. Rating 3/10
