Wretched word. Bad actions, pathetic scenario, cheezy music and fashion dialogue and hip-hop ... what the hell is this? Directer this film acts as bad as the movie he made. If someone took the time and effort to recycle all of this possible, from a chance. Bet studios are still trying to figure out how they could mess up so bad. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... Asian chicken was not too bad either. These girls also carry the entire film. If it was not for them I would have destroyed my copy of this film. <br /> <br /> If any of those who have not seen it yet and had no idea so do not waste your time ... you'll only regret it later.
