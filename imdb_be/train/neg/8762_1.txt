Scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) figuring out how to bring back the dead to life. However, they come back with those of marble. Ultimately, all this leads to disaster. <br /> <br /> Boring, 1940 entirely predictable outing. This scared me silly when I was a kid, but just bothers me now. I had to fight to stay up! With one exception, terrible acting. Such fuzzy boring actors! . Hopeless <br /> <br /> There are some good things about it: Carradine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance. And there are a few mildly horrific moments associated ghost dog to walk through walls. There's also one of the worst promising a knockout in the history of cinema. However, none of this is not enough fun to sit through it. Avoid.
