Absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen! Action, dialogue, manuscript, sound, lighting, storyline. I really can not say anything positive about it, although I love Swedish films. The fight scenes are so funny that you can not take it seriously. And if the main character just happens to lose his shirt, while dodging bullets in a strip bar, I'm not sure that it must be a joke if someone really thinks that these ingredients a good movie? Regina Lund shutter only half actor, but it disappears in the flow and improbable ridiculous pronunciations reaction. This leaves you terrified that somebody is actually spent time and money on something like this ...
