I would not be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say that this can be a good show show..This only good if you do not know what "talentÂ» is..I will not even tell you how offensive it (I know, it may be offensive to many people), because it is not really what bothers me about the show .. I am concerned that people look and think it funny..It it makes me feel as our generation gets to silly, and I actually fear that it will one day be working for the people who look g Eta garbage .. <br /> <br /> basically simple..it story goes on the offensive, self centered, spoiled woman (Sarah Silvermen) getting through everyday life .. <br /> <br /> Thats it. .Like, that times..In million was made in fact almost every joke ever been done or racist .. <br /> <br /> Sarah also likes sing..I her voice..thats it..not in lyrics..The lyrics dreadful..which she likes to sing a lot of things .. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a hot woman put everything else down and th em feel like shit at the same time , while farting and talk shit about each race, then r etae show for you ..
