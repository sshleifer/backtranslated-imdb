I look forward to meeting Amanda Peet in another good role after recent lease "Whole Nine Yards" - easily worth a rental, by the way. - but it was not his <br /> <br /> I thought that the trailer "Whipped" and there were a few funny story about three hypersexuality New Yorker twenty-something all the incident and have manipulated the divine Ms. Pete's worth a shot. So I convinced two friends one day to come watch this movie with me. This review May penance. <br /> <br /> In the first act we have three lead pins, listing his conquests in the diner. What was supposed to be funny, or at least eloquent, it comes pretty pathetic. It was the sacrifice the quality of the three men and their meetings that we had to get out of this? <br /> <br /> [And while I do not mind movies that are fun vulgar, I do not wonder why no one in the diner turned as thorns to speak loudly about the sexual and scatalogical details. They do this every week, at the same diner? Do you think that someone will complain. Oh wait, I forgot: two other diners notice in one scene. But this is only for the installation of pointe shoes. Everyone else in the diner blank.] <br /> <br /> The second act has three pins all falling at Mia, and then develop rot the brain is not able to ask each other, or her about what's really going on between the four of them, and I kept asking myself, how to keep the studs themselves, as they were, that the sacrifice quality she sees them follow up with them more than one date? Does it start with rot the brain? I continued to hope for the character of Erik, married boyfriend to become something more than just annoying punching bag in this act. Its role is clearly dispense advice on marriage. But why do they even bother to talk to him, if they do not communicate with each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third act determines that the story is there, but so far I have looked at the clock. My friends told me that they are still waiting for something really funny that it happened and I had to agree. The scene that explains everything was adequate and failed to explain all questions and enigmatic dialogue bits throughout the film, but we just had to check their list. ( "Oh, good, because Brad, what happened, and Jonathan said that it ...Â») <br /> <br /> What laughs we made were because of the story of nonsense than anything funny . Even the outtakes during the credits was not very funny. In the end I was left with nothing but the desire to warn people away from this movie <br /> <br /> Rating :. 3
