I get to the cinema every week or so, and regularly check this site, but never before have I felt compelled to comment on the film <br /> <br /> In my permanent list of awful bad movies -. The last man standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - now I can add the nonsense that was "InvisibleÂ» <br /> <br /> a terrible opening credits. - funny over the long run of the cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti - to offensive finals - a world record number of stamps and some of the most absurd dialogue and action that ever made it into a movie - this movie is negligible, and only an impressive computer graphics to keep you going long before. end <br /> <br /> This is not just my opinion - it was that of my friends, and all around us. If large portions of the audience laugh and groan during and after a serious thriller, it is clear that the film is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that he was sick, too. The director took action not only beyond the realistic tariff for strong film, and in the upper Excessive blood impregnated with a B-movie. It's hard not to imagine the director, like some dirty old man, because the degree of raids invisible man out of the lab and into the world around us extends only on two attempts, which have a feeling some chest. Perhaps sex could well be the first thing on your mind Man, if we make the invisible, but aside from aesthetic pleasure gives associated with this unlikely to make an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> [spoilers follow] <br /> <br /> Get past films patient's appearance, and still worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job operating more twisted as "Invisible," the rest of them - perhaps for people with disabilities the hardest scenario - do even better to be hollow cast. A long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker invisible man, "he finally snapped," shrugs a colleague without a hint of emotion. It is in the nature of things, and swing team Laboratory between pure fear and indifference at such a rate that you wonder how they got into acting. They puff their way through the hallway laboratory scared, gun-balanced, but a few seconds later, one of the crew members jumping happily down the hall to get the blood to the offended colleague. Lead woman contemplates the invisible people with courtesy and good humor, even after he insulted and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to his advances, even after he drowned head of the Pentagon, "He drowned in his pool last night, "according to the same woman, effectively entirely able to put two and two together. <br /> <br /> script replete with this sort of bad acting pedestrian dialogue, and the rest simply AZ film cliches, which are thicker and fuck on. faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and entertainment at the end <br /> <br /> moment of "Eureka" on the computer, woman undressing at the window, safety Loop video - list really is infinite - ignoring the predictable strength in numbers, not the solution score two top stars, but just put them in the place of probable imminent death and leave them to their devices almost dead good guy appears out of nothing, to save the woman, the bomb and the ubiquitous COUN timer tdown, fireball explosion that just burns up achieving heroes falling elevator, spa nyaetstsa only to hit them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy. <br /> <br /> An invisible man with a piece of burned makeshift flamethrower, electric current hit around the head with a rod, which has just cut right through one of the smaller actors, then, seems to have survived the explosion, a fireball and complete destruction of laboratories, has more than enough life remaining to climb up through the ball of fire in the last pop heroes in movies - at what stage the audience cringing in disbelief, looking at his watch <br /> <br /> what is an extremely bad movie actually did it. incredible movie. Even the title of the film is so hopeless, like the film itself, and not even spectacular special effects come anywhere near to save one, which should be avoided at all costs.
