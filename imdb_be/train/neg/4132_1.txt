The peculiarity of the early cinema of the 21st century allows it to various evil creatures and the bad guys against each other. We did not see things like this, because of Godzilla, King Kong, and the like. Always sounds good on paper, and if you are merging in a fog of good things you have an inspired idea and see all played out in front of you, like a symphony. Then you came to write. Great ideas, like all female vampires. Ergo hot, seductive mortal, but the way I want to die their family the way. And all the men of zombies. Well, that's what men like a woman, but after Shes been dumped or cheated right? So it all looks good to actually do it. Then it begins to rot in. Mosters fight. Not much is happening. Another battle. Philosophical noodling and banging beat. Eureka, we found how to win. Big fight over and over. Sounds appealing, does not it? When this was done the indie company would be great. But this is Hollywood with an eye to the Bucks: gloss instead of what they want the fans. All this might be blood-soaked beautiful.
