Two days later, after they see this thing, I'm still in agony over what it saw. It's so bad, you have to wonder, how could someone to write this tripe, much less that it can be free from the general public. Bombastic action, leading a man who looks like he is a lunatic, and Alison Eastwood embarrassing yourself. Action indicate a low level of acceptance of the film budget, which means that it hurts bad. The plot? Well, if you were 6 years old, you could write this movie. Simplistic, idealistic, and just lame.
