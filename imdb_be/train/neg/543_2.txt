as well as one school to spend time only reason for the large stellar cast ..I think all I can see is a bunch of talent to waste your time on the big screen with some pathetic humor that will appeal to, I do not know who? some soulful songs that will be heard, anyone? some pathetically zags who justified? a race against time? and is a departure from the time? Ok so the first port of your child, you teach him a lesson wow, we are so ignorant of this fact, who said that his brilliant new concept, perhaps, some other non-human species are well okay, let me come to comment, as people make the film has a nice a message that will be given, but it may well be given to a stranger sitting besides you on the bus, rather than you going in such a lavish film to know that Hindi films have proved it a lot already, and I can not waste my time writing about growing Ata in any case!
