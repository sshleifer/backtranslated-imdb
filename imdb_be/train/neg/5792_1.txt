Another made-for-TV piece of junk! It is an insult to war films (I use the word in the film is the most common form is possible!) I thought that career Savalas had a meltdown when he did the voice over on this visit Birmingham, video, as shown in Tarrant on TV on the floor on a regular basis, but then I forgot what was in it! I tried to push it into my subconscious memory, but cable television brought the memory feet and screaming from me !! <br /> <br /> I like a bit (laughs sarcastically!) in the movie, who claims to be the scene of Liverpool in the forties, but this is clearly a shot from Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties. In addition, it is time to train the commandos on trains shows JZ (Jugoslavia Å¾eleznice or Yugoslav State Railways) logo is on the side of the locomotive is quite clear, although manufacturers have tried them black. Why not just shoot in the UK if this is where most of the film takes place? <br /> <br /> cheapest garbage and waste of celluloid!
