This "film" is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern cinema. needless slow motion, unnecessary Serve / jumping / tumbling, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue .... basically unnecessary. (The fact that a word? Well, it's just been invented I, Robot). <br /> <br /> What happened to practicality? (That is, the garage, the skin spray) is the only tool that shows a combination of the futuristic and realistic features swipe card at the buffet. <br /> <br /> What's the matter, showing respect for women? (Ie the nature of the blacksmith does nothing but worsen the doctor for most of the film, and yet she "wants" it. Where there is tension? I'll tell you where good looks and not worship or common ground) <br /> <br /> What happened to the detective that detects? Smith did not do anything but sit around and feel sorry for yourself, complain about other people, and when they said something that provoked thought it was off. it's such a lame way to get the story from the point of B-C-D-etc ... it was OK once, but several times in a row. (We are talking about a few times in a row, which was "I'm not listening to the snoring and you kidding? Twice in one scene?) <br /> <br /> What's wrong with a small part in the movie, although a number of significant and not just a tool for promote rescue scene? Shia LaBeouf (child) in the film a total of two scenes, we know that well-he humiliates a woman, and the B-he knows Smith ....... so of course, we have to take care of and it really does not come to harm him, <br /> <br /> what happened to the hero? let's just forget that there are people, women and children around the world and rymlivats attacked by robots and selfishly save only person plaits my opinion is that I have an acquaintance with. and why it should crawl your bike through the air, showing, while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a few seconds walk . <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm all for spectacles. but I'm also all for a piece of realism and meaning. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I have never laughed so hard in a very I n the film for a long time. so thank you Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the progress of the social pendulum back to a more simple method, simple stories and easier everything else in the movie ...... but basically simpler methods. <br /> <br /> The big budget film Action, "so you have to die"
