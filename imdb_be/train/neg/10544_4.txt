If childhood memory tells you that it was a terrible film; this hair is worth to come back to him. Anyway, I remembered the terrible scene with the participation of homeless and cool villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> «First power" is not a very good movie, unfortunately. This is one of those overcrowded police cliches and very bad scenario with holes truck can pass through (along with countless comfortable "twists" that help the story to work together). A Diamond Phillips is assertiveness bad ass cop who sends serial killer villain Kober in the gas chamber only to find out that he was the darling of Satan, and now has the power of the resurrection, along with the power of ownership, each weak minded man, he comes across. Through the mix very poorly understood psychic who helps the cause. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's garbage. But it's nice, as such, especially if you have fond memories of him. It scared me as a child, and that the scene with the homeless is still pretty good. As with any kind of logic here; forget, almost every scenario thrown in for good measure, and you end up with a cross between Steven Seagal action flick and 70s demonic Flick. And who on earth thought it was a good idea to throw Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead here? Needless to say, it is not convincing at all, but he is doing his best, and I've never had a problem with the guy, so many reviewers here seem to have. As for Tracy Griffith, as the psychic, the less said, the better. But Kober pretty good as a murderer; always liked the actor. <br /> <br /> «first force" may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and the "brain exception" is necessary. Beer is likely to improve the viewing experience and I'll definitely have it load the next time I give this film a spin. In general; is good movie, but some schadenfreude for nostalgic fans who are easily frightened, like children. "See you later, buddy boy!"
