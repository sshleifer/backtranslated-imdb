In many movies I've seen, Warren Oates, I came to a conclusion, that a talented person. I first saw Mr. Oates so in the television series of the 1960s under the name Stone Burke. Since then, I have closely followed his career, and he felt that he was destined for bigger roles. It happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him top billing in a movie called "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. Of course, his biggest claim to fame was his great role in« The Wild Bunch ». I always thought that it is fully able to bring any sign, some magic, that is, until I saw it in a flop. the film is called "Chandler", a tribute to iron detectives fist from 1950 created by Raymond Chandler. Because synopsis said that it is about the hard nose Private Eye, I was immediately interested. However, I patiently sat through the entire elm and found it to be boring, dis-interested, slow paced, twisted, confusing saga that when she was a theme or plot should be left on some dark back room myself. Collectively and with some of the best support of Hollywood stars, such as Alex Dreyer, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this film has enough strength to reach Mach five, however, he did not come down from the race on Launchpad and went no where. As a result, one of my favorite actor stuck in poorly made car that never got off the ground. **
