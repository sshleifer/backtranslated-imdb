I read all the rave reviews here and I'm impressed with the performance of those who love this film. I can not say that I found a lot to recommend it. Soundtrack Leonard Cohen is not only extremely powerful, but sickening beyond measure. The film looks real enough, but something needs to happen for it to work, and nothing much does not: a brief story (not a problem for me), not much character development, personal thematically. It's just slogs together. Problematic as it is, "Heaven's Gate" Cimino there are some moments of genuine surprise and I'd rather watch a movie again. For brilliant reconception of the West, on the HBO "Deadwood" vastly superior "McCabe."
