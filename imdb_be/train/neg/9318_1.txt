This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Again, I made the mistake of buying the movie, because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (after buying it and the film «Malevolence», which I reviewed here, as well, I've learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on the farm. It supposedly takes place in the Texas woods, but was probably shot in the backyard of the director. Production was probably the worst I've ever seen. Actors were absolutely worse. History has nothing to do with the fact that said rear cover. I even tried to sell it F.Y.E and some other "mom and pop" store that buys used DVD-ROMs and will not take it. How terrible it is a poor accident for the film it was. I've seen some bad movies before (Troll 2, for example), but it certainly takes the cake. I do not think that was worse than the movie "Troll 2". Boy, I was wrong! Do not buy this movie, if someone does not send it to you for free, but even than your stuck with it, if you do not throw, which is what I'm going to do !!!!
