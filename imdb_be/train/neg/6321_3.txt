I can not imagine who would ever in a million years want to watch this movie. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (it was not), but mostly because it is about 20 years, and so on with the mainstream. I was trying to figure out where I've seen an actor before, and it slipped. So, yes, the child ceases to play little league, because he does not like nuclear weapons, it causes a lot of media attention and a quick solution to the Cold War. End. Fantasy, to be sure, but one would be so foolish John Lennon blush. As terrorism has replaced communism as the changes that scares the hell out of us, this movie really does not matter, except (innaccurate) look back at those times. Letters, actions, and the film craft are just as underdeveloped. So I appreciated it as high as I did because I watched this movie about 50 times, while I was 5-6 years old and still have a little place in my heart for her, but now I realize that this not quite cut the mustard. Thus, if the law of large numbers is valid and someone finally does decide to check out this film, you realize that there are much better ways to spend time, but also significantly worse. (I will refrain from John Q. tirade at the moment.)
