Strangely, almost all reviewers are very positive about this film. Is this because since 1975 and has a Chamberlain and Curtis in it, and therefore just a temporary effect is very poor, and children's ways of telling stories? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because some people get sentimental about this film because they read this book? (I have not read the book, but I do not think that this is a problem, the filmmakers never assume that the audience read the book). <br /> <br /> Or is it because I subconsciously irritated by the fact that the actors speak English try to behave like their French counterparts?
