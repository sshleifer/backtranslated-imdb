Why do movie makers always come against the work of the author? I mean, yes, things have to be compressed to interest the viewer, but look at the Anne of Green Gables. They have done an excellent job of combining the important events in a single unit, which was just fine. I can not believe that they have decided to join together three novels Anne Avonlea in such a terrible mess. Look at all that they have lost by doing this. ,, Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widow, Windy Poplars. ,, And the student, Anne, for God's sake !!! Would not it be great to meet Aquila and all the rest of the gang Redmond? Kevin Sullivan had to take things one film at a time, instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events, as he did. This film was good, if you leave the novels with it !! But beautiful work rm Montgomery is something that should not be denied. This film was a let down after seeing the successful path it Brough Anne of Green Gables life.
