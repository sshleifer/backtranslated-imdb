"The Feast of All Saints?" Where is ...? If ...? <br /> <br /> It was the feast of All Saints and the theme of the story are cut? <br /> <br /> What a waste of a great title! There's never anything in history that has the remote connection with the "Feast of All Saints." And there is nothing in the history of the "Day of All Souls," which the term refers. Why use this name if you never intend to including any storyline or theme of "All Souls' Day" or "All Saints Day"? <br /> <br /> Embarrassly bad script & Amateur Writing <br /> <br /> As they attract a lot of talent to this clunker? Drawing up such an amateur - the characters who have known each other all their lives to go to a big long speech about the history of their lives for the sake of the audience. It's not the way people communicate with each other. <br /> <br /> As the director of Thinking? <br /> <br /> Direction equally bad! Forced and too deliberate style feels amateurish. In one scene, a character shouting "Hands off me," and no one touching it! Most heavily directed the scene, however, it is incredibly over-the-top battle scene early in the film. <br /> <br /> Excessive Gore in a very fictitious, Silly battle scene <br /> <br /> There are so many dead people in the fake battle scene. It looks like a live scene Saturday Night !! You can see the extras waiting for their cue to go on camera. Each plays his death scene, as the 4th grade boys - exaggerating every little gasp and twitch. Blood on the victims of the battle is so excessive and careless use, it seems, someone used the ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines on a red dress. <br /> <br /> This whole battle scene comes off as really cheesy parody of war films. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride a horse and deliver the climax. <br /> <br /> Who in real life when something like this?! <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous bit of writing, directing and casting is actually in the center of the scene: <br /> <br /> The little girl standing under the hanging corpse of her parents - who are terribly mutilated, and literally dripping form their gaping wounds. Even an idiot would know that he is dead! However, it is - very monotonous - repeated again and again: "Daddy, Daddy ..." looking for someone with the screen. She freed him about as much credibility and passion, as you might expect from a non-actor child who was repeating the line for the cameras throughout the day. <br /> <br /> Even if the poor child had any acting skills, the scene is absolutely incredible. The little girl is not even in the middle of the battle after hours of slaughter - surrounded by hundreds of corpses, while she stands still there !! Natural instincts of a baby crying and frightened, fleeing from the bloody carnage! <br /> <br /> And we suppose to be horrified or Laugh ...?! <br /> <br /> One of the most stupid detail that gives the scene in the tone of SNL satire, hanging his father, with a huge hook through the mouth and cheeks. It looks like a fish on a hook! The unintentionally funny parts to the whole scene came across as fake and stupid. <br /> <br /> In Fantasy La-La-Land, Mother and Daughters of the same age! <br /> <br /> Another funny detail is that you can see the central character - the little girl's mother - at the end of the scene and the next scene, which takes place 20+ years later, it looks exactly the same! She is still young and beautiful, and now the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I just turned on the film right there, since the direction and the letter was obviously awful - but I tried to stick to it, because I wanted to see the Louisiana setting, and I like all the actors. I do not know what these wonderful actors were thinking when they took these roles! <br /> <br /> Who is the target audience? <br /> <br /> an excessive amount of blood and bad acting in the opening scenes of violence are successful from the spot with soap opera narrates in a tone that is worth. This is also a strange way to start a film that, at other times, it seems focused on the romance of reading women. Strange discrepancy on our toes!
