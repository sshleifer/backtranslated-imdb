Wow. Just awful. I was a fan of the original film, and jealous hatched parts 2, 3, and there was an improvement. 4.5 and Dead Freddie was pretty bad. But nothing as bad as Freddy's Nightmares. Freddy serves as host Rod Serlingesq this anthology series. <br /> <br /> I can accept as Freddy became a culmination of the others, but, at least in the movies Freddy treatment carried movies, but here they were so badly done, they were like a high school production of the horror series . The poor actors, if you really want to call yourself that after this show, it was obvious that they pay. I'm pretty sure that it was a stopping point for the two types of actors. Some are just starting on the Hollywood ladder, a brand new ready to take any part that would put them to believe that porn job they were offered last week, or experienced actors, on their way down the Hollywood ladder ready to take any part of that accommodate them in order to take this job porn they were offered last week. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that Dan Plato guest star, but she was already dead by the time it was in production. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase a line in the original Nancy Elm St, Â«What would you try not to fall asleep watching it."
