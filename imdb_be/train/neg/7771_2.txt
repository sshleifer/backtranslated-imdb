This is one awesome hacked together a film, you get the feeling that the company connection had to come to this, I'm not surprised there are no credits for it, who would like to be associated with this film. Acting all participants terribly stilted and the plot jumps around, all this makes very little sense. As I said earlier, it seems, the company relationship had come, because it seems there was a lot of footage that has not been shot, which was supposed to be, and all the music was very ill-fitting music library (cheap i think). Very, very strange. I could actually buy a DVD it, though, if he could let me out, what the hell is going on, and what happened with this film.
