I just can not understand why all these relics of the Ceausescu era refusing to let go. You can clearly see how frustrated they were during Commie censorship, banning them so many things to show his films, and now they themselves did not know that a great deal of freedom pretentious-Fartsy so filled the screen with people defecating, urinating, vomiting, oath and any other conceivable outrage. This is not cinema, friends and neighbors! It's just a visual distortion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, a David Lynch, of Forman and neorealism and films from other manufacturers that have been able to work with the aesthetics of ugliness. These people have mastered the job - well, do not! We favor, all you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus Margineanus and other obsolete old-timers, and leave us alone! Its a bit of time to see some Romanian movie on the screen, quite immature terribilisms! You are not directors, you illiterate !!!
