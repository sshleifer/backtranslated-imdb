This movie was absolutely horrible! I can not understand how this film has made its production. Nothing against the cast of the film, of course, it's not all wine writers team. You take the old middle story - let's dance our way to be poor and marginalized - or STEP in this case. But this one does not have any semblance of a true story - or at least one that someone else will take care of. With the Canadian actor who speak what is supposed to be the American system - the film provides a very flat. On a positive note, the direction was pretty good and the cinema was pretty decent as well. It seems that the production budget was very generous as well. My only request is that this team is to leave the post in peace and to find real writers to help them bring the words alive on film. Net result - the way she moves she sucks.
