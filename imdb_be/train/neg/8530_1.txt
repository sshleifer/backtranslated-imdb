"Her Cardboard Lover» is the latest film Norma Shearer. She left the movies, and I think, became a member of the Board of Directors of MGM. It was a good move on her part. "Her Cardboard Lover» was Talky and boring in parts. It was obvious, it was only a few actors with speaking parts, so they had a lot of dialogue, to talk, to keep the turkey afloat. <br /> <br /> The story was a good idea about the rich woman (Norma Shearer) hiring human (Robert Taylor), to make it a darling playboy (George Sanders) jealous. I am surprised that the director, George Cukor, Sun cut a lot of scenes Talky between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Cukor served Mrs. Shearer in "The Women", but not in this movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance in the film was given to Robert Taylor. During career, Mr. Taylor, he got his best comedic roles in this film and "When Ladies Meet" in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best performance in a comedy, "Her Cardboard Lover", and before that, his best dramatic performance in it was a busy year, "Johnny Eager.". I think that of all the actors on the MGM, Mr. Taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses for many. In addition, MGM gave Mr. Taylor all kinds of movies to make - the majority of them have been successful. That's why MGM kept it for 25 years. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was very good, as a secular heel. Eight years later, he played the same role in "All About Eve", for which he won an Oscar for the role. As for Ms. Shearer, it was one of her worst performances, it was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy. Surprisingly, she did a great comedy in 1939, "Women," and gave her best performance. It was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading man in "Her Cardboard lover." In addition, it did not help that some of her clothes were terrible. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that she and Mr. Taylor sun to make another dramatic film, their last film together, beautiful «Escape». The same comments about the film can be said about another film, "personal property" that Mr. Taylor did in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too Talky, boring, and the actress looked old. Ms. Harlow looked sick throughout the film, and no one noticed in Hollywood, to tell her to see a doctor, so that she died in 1937 at the age of 26 What a waste! It was to be a good actress and get the best roles.
