It 'Federation of British Industry "starring Reed Hadley, with an all-star cast! The film begins with a random (conveniently?) Kidnapping, which leads to one and the other - that in fact does not indicate the main story, which is the «Big House, USA" prison break story. The story is very unlikely, to say the least. It's like a TV show, only more "violent" (at the time) <br /> <br /> Emergency. - Cast a journey! Picture this: Ralph Meeker sent to prison; his cellmates criminals following: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (read "Muscle" magazine!), and Telman (read "Detective" magazine!). Honestly! You should know that early scene shows what happens to the "absence" of a boy answering the end of the "sound". If you do not want to have that hanging, do not miss the opening scene between «Iceman» and boys (Peter Votrian does well as a quick asthmatics). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
