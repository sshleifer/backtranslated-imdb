Ever since the movie love the world met a guy by the name of George A. Romero, the word "zombie" automatically gets associated with horror the images of bloody and non-stop acting sequences. It is safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" zombie film is formed, as we know it today. However, in the early years of cinema, the premise of reanimated corpses just used to the slow, almost to the actions of less psychological thrillers. Jacques Tourneur "I walked with a zombie" is a perfect example, and so "White Zombie," starring Bela Lugosi. This is the "Rise of the zombies" could be another example, but unfortunately, it is a failure all along the line and is easily one of the saddest movies I've ever seen. Scary action, very poorly written script and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes, and yet the first half hour is completely wasted on stupid love story of intrigue and uninteresting monologue. Installing the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor, of course, could lead to more exciting stories, but all we ever see is the interior shots. Leading Actress (Dorothy Stone, textbook blond with curly hair and an ugly nose) irritated me enormously, and I continued to hope that the predatory undead suddenly appear out of nowhere to engulf her. ?? unlucky again. If you manage to fight on their own 60 minutes of sleeping pills, you will be rewarded with a decent enough finish. However, it is too little to give this film a positive assessment, not to mention the recommendations. Avoid! This type of film that you should only see if you've seen everything else.
