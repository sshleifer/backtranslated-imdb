After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Â«Fantastic Mr. Fox" is an adaptation of the beloved children's classic, drawing the story of a smooth, smooth main character Mr. Fox (or "Foxy"), as he tries one "last" robbery to steal from wrong Boggins, bonsai and Bean. That's right, one short, one fat, one thin, or how it happens. <br /> <br /> I do not even know where to start with my criticism. <br /> <br /> Well, I m in my late teens and have never been a supporter of Roald Dahl, but I like his stuff quite well, having read some of his books as a kid, and saw Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and again again. This film, however, struggled for an audience. Whether it is directed at children? Adults I'm still not sure! Many of the "joke" would give birth to a child, especially if Mr. Fox visited a lawyer, for example, or complains of poverty. In addition, the audience (I assume) the children are expected to empathize with the character, steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but you almost see Mr. Fox bites down on the neck! Of course, it's too much? Also, the story ... well, it's kind of sad. I was left only with the hope that is getting better, but instead I just got more and more annoyed at Mr. Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> humor, meanwhile, falls flat. I laughed only once or twice, even though I specifically acknowledged attempts jokes. I think part of this is that the voice is incredibly flat and monotoned. The voice actors do not have a sense of comic timing, and not to seek the subtleties of humor, which only works with certain media. George Clooney seeks to portray Mr. Fox as charming and smooth, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep does not show any emotions, I do not understand, Bill Murray role until the end of the loan, and Ash, twelve years in fox years, it seems that it is about 30. <br /> <br /> I love the animation, particularly stop movement, but the visual style really creeped me a bit. Symbols tall, spindly, and the absence of any heat design. They move with very little turnover, and often choppy animation and strange. There is also a special "mixed environment" feel like a 2D components are added to sporadically and unsuccessfully. Characters look directly into the camera and said; it was very uncomfortable. I had one or two moments when Kylie looked directly into the camera did not move and was a bitch on his eyeballs. It really freaked me out. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Many people still seem to like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it's just not for me.
