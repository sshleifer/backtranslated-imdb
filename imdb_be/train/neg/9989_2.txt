I had the misfortune to watch this garbage on Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just garbage. This one is even worse: it is one of the most stupid pieces of shit I've ever seen in my life. a horror film? Yes, there are terrible things in it: acting, script and special effects - Gosh, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a film for 90 minutes. In fact, if it were a comic movie, I would give it 5. Do not you even think about renting this if you do not want to make fun of manufacturers <br /> <br /> Vote :. 2 of 10 - did not vote, because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
