It's not nya-common to see the US patent re brand of foreign films that fall flat on their faces, but the flip side !!! It's awful remake of US film «Wide Awake» British! <br /> <br /> «Wide Awake» surprising, but interesting and funny! "Liam," on the other hand, is simply amazing. I must pay tribute to the «Liam» for one thing, and making it clear that I made the right choice in changing their religion!
