Look ... Peter Sellers was one of the most talented actors were amazing there. But his choice of films, for example, after 1964, was very unfortunate. He did not seem to understand how to use their talents. He would have been better to work with a lot of Kubricks the world of cinema, than people who did it. In his later films, only "optimists Nine Elms" and "Be There" struck me with one of those that I've seen. <br /> <br /> However, Boultings and sellers have made several movies before that hardly sounds so bad - I have not seen "Carlton Brown" and "the sky above!" - at least in terms of the use of good sellers to a certain extent. But, "There's a girl in my soup" is actually a bad movie and persistent choice of the Seller in terms of character. In his films from 1955-64, as a rule, you can expect at least some very ingenious twist and always mysterious belief in his role. Here you have a Peter Sellers is trying to play a typical romantic lead. It's almost Sellers playing ham Nivnoe without fun. He, of course, is not convincing, however hard they tried, or to create an interesting character. He had to leave these parts for courtesy masters such as Cary Grant, and focused on the intriguing dramatic and comedic roles, he was famous <br /> <br /> Hawn and sellers do not set any real chemistry. It's not just how brilliant romance perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy. This is a very artificial imaginary, all the way through - I know that it is part of the Danvers character that he will dry pimp, but he really does not change from that, in a way that convinces. Sellers are very slatted way to play "charm" and ... this character really has no depth, and in fact does not receive sympathy or interest in the viewer. Sellers goes through the motions so as not to think, perhaps remembering the greatness of his career, Iconoclastic performance in "Lolita." <br /> <br /> There's really nothing to say about the story, direction, or symbols, as sincerely, they leave little or no experience. This is truly one of the most anemic, self-righteous, misguided and slightly turbid films I've ever seen. . Insignificance a "vehicle" for the undeniable talent Sellers <br /> <br /> Rating: - 1/2 * / *****
