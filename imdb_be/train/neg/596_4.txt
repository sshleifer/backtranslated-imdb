Basically what we have here is a little more than a remake of the 1970 classic hilarious kitsch «Death Line» horror, which, ironically, was a shoemaker, and partially filmed in an abandoned Aldwych Underground Station. <br /> <br /> The effective use of the now out of use Jubilee Line platforms at Charing Cross, and above the Aldwych, this film contains basically the same story - a fancy that kills rabid zombies in tunnels, preying on lost passengers have missed the last train - originality is not strong point of this film. <br /> <br /> Really strong point, unfortunately, not enough. Mountains range from poor to unnecessary excessive mountains while crazy sub-Gollum never really fully explained, it seems a little more than in a developed plot device. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente has little to do with the thin script, than run into a lot of tunnels and cry so often, in fact it was like almost everyone else in the movie, due operated small dogs and a pack of tame rats. <br /> <br /> If the creeping movies set on the London Underground your bag, or you just want to play "tube placement," they take it on DVD, when he gets into the hopper of the transaction. If you are looking for a classic horror, go and dig up the line of death (aka raw meat). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for quality well written and acted in the film, you will need to change .....
