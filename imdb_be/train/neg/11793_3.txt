Deep Shock plays out as a TV movie: a commercial-quality cast of actors being poorly designed to be the "bad guy", and the script, which is more technical, political jargon and importance than he knows what to do with. <br /> <br /> I checked the film of the creatures (I love to see that filmmakers have in mind for their projects in this cheap with video), and immediately, I am disappointed, because being on the field was not one in the film. Actors I expected because of the type of film it is (actually a very general nature and is not thought past a certain point). The music was typical, entirely conceived actions of symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computers and technical equipment, as well as with the development of the mini-sub. The film even proceeded very well, with the guide screen letting you know what you are looking at a set of plot unfolds. But there is so much history here anyway. <br /> <br /> This film gets 3/10 IMO stars. Sad search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and the creatures that protect it ... kinda lame. Even lamer is indicated on the love between the two characters that you do not see coming. Chalk this up to a film that tries to pursue an acting career off the bench and in the video. Do not disturb.
