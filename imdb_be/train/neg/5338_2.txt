Elvis Presley plays a "half-breed" Native Americans ( "Indian"), which must defend its reservation from the opposite business tycoons. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight and make a baby. Fight, fight, and "punching" of each other to replace the stereotypical hand raised expression "how"? <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he does have a make-up, it's obvious, Elvis healthier than he appeared in previous films; perhaps he was preparing for his famous "return". It could not be, because the script of this film was nothing to admire. Joan Blondel tries to seduce Elvis, and Burgess Meredith in the "war paint" should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> «Stay Away» The best songs (in fact, "Greensleeves" with different texts). The most embarrassing song Elvis love song to the bull "Dominic." There are some surreal scenes, but he never will trippy enough to succeed in this genre, though, "stay away, Joe" may give some laughs when you are in the right "mood» <br /> <br /> otherwise, steer clear <br.. /> <br /> ** Stay away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondel
