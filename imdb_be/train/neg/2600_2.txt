Here we have a movie that fails pretty much all that is possible for the film to fail. Scary scenario, lousy action amateur directing, laughable special effects ... it's just completely awful film. Not to mention the fact that if you reach the end you will understand all this does not make a lick of sense. Having spent the whole movie wondering what in the world is going on here, when everyone finally explained, you know, history has been built on a foundation that is ridiculously impossible. In one of these abominable 'villain explains the whole movie "sequence, we were told that our thief did something that simply can not be done, and that makes absolutely no sense. Yes, and then we see that there also seems to be some kind of monster jelly-involved. I am sure that Drew Barrymore would very much like to pretend that this film has never been. If for some reason the godless you ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie, I have to offer, instead of taking the time to bang your head against the wall for 104 minutes. It would be far more enjoyable experience than sitting through this garbage.
