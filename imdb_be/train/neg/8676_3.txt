Avoid US version. This is the United States with the addition of staff and the worst dubbing you ever heard, probably made in the New York fans. Duplication is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think that the black guy from the Bronx makes voice Chiba. I could not watch the whole movie it was so bad. Instead, the Americanized version watch other great Chiba as The Streetfighter or karate warriors.
