This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. However, the little slave, Alice and Jared Harris Christopher Walken imitation of what makes this film interesting. Alice smoking, drinking and supernatural way to show, when her name is called weird and interesting. I must applaud Jared for his imitation of Christopher Walken, Christopher Walken, and for what it will be in the film.
