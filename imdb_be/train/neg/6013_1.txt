I have read all the books on the date in the left behind series, and the film is unlikely any of them justice. Of course, I've seen worse movies, but it was incredibly disappointing. This film would make a good episode of MST3K. The script was terrible adaptation of the book, and she felt like the actors read their lines, but in fact they were told. Symbols were tough and unsympathetic. The effects were cheesy, and looked awful fake. The ending was terrible. First of all, it's not even go all the way to the end of the first book. Secondly, it does not make any sense. If you have not read the book, he would not have any idea about what is happening. This was to be the cheese, film student, as the end I've ever seen in a movie. I'm upset that I actually paid money for this film. If by some miracle, is to get a wide release, they need to completely rebuild it and let Hollywood take on. These two wannabe film producers, and director imitators have to leave the film industry to the professionals.
