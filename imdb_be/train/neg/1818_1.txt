Hoffman horse is very nice and attractive topless at times. <br /> <br /> That's it, guys. The only reason, even taking into account in order to watch this film or not. <br /> <br /> These 70s sexploitation period pieces sometimes entertaining, by their datedness (flared pants, big hair, Zapata mustache, etc.). This one is not. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, bad acting, bad directing, and the idea of ​​having a romantic leading man senior citizen exceptionally bad. <br /> <br /> name, alluding to sex-comedy, very deceptive. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend that you avoid this one like the plague.
