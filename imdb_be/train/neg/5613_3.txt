On my view, this film does not put forward any new ideas. It seems to me like a spear to spear, not looking away! the director seems to have an agenda! Duh! I believe that no rational him there seems to be no room for an alternative point of view. For example, I tend to be on the side of the vote against it, but this film is not credible, because it depends on the observations fantastic man / woman on the street. really now, if you want a reliable alternative cr5eate doctrine held for 2000+ years, you have to make more effort, allowing the other side to express their beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film, she felt as an attack on Cristian faith, I, for example, who do not believe, but let the beliefs of others, and do not want to, without any ridicule them, but try to understand and tolerate.
