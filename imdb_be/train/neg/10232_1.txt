This is one of those dramas that are so bad that it almost gets to the point to be very funny, the script is absolutely pathetic, direction terrible lighting purely anchor, the only thing letting it down from the true so bad that it is a good feeling that the sound design only very bad; it does not add to the intrigue of the story, though struggling, but at least destroy any speech. There's also the problem of the continuity of the seasons boom doors everywhere. And finally, last but not least, the current appalling. For the professional production of this very looks Media University project you have to feel sorry for the miserable people who had to put their names on it.
