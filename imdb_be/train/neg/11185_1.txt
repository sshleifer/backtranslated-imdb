Yes, MTV does have a way to sell Daria. What began as a clever teenage angst- «comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their teenage life Sucky» sitcom now mutated into a "you have to deal with your problems» -charade. I watched Daria constantly and loved it. Now, I am sitting here, after viewing the so-called "film" I can only wonder what the point was all. Daria tells us how to lead the life of the college? Excuse me? Daria did not point each episode, what you want to do is fine as long as it is not normal, with themselves, no matter what the rest of the patient's boring the world thinks about it? The whole thing reminded me of a scene in "Reality Bites" channel documentry film shows for the first time.
