Now, I hired this film because Brad Dourif was in it. He's a great actor, BRILLIANT at all ... except for this film. And I think that just because he realized how stupid it was a movie, and do not bother with a good performance. This film is an unintentional comedy. Some of the lines just cracks me up. And they have a few lines that make no sense, and it looks like Toba Hooper just throw line without thinking about the story. Oh! By the way the plot BAD! But this is one of those films that is TAHT BAD, that it is actually painful to watch. I recommend it only for BIG Dourif supporters or fans of any of the other actors because the plot is pitiful.
