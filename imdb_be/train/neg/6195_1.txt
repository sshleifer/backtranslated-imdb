This is not good. Scary action and the end of the director was unable to hold out of nowhere, the film was not frankly nothing but dull. . It is strange that this film is considered a prize at a film festival in Gijon film <br /> <br /> Everyone who came out of the theater was the same as I was - what was the point of even making the movie? Links to Iraq were a country, or simply not thought through properly. I am surprised that this film has been given a release - a very, very frustrating and a waste of my time. Unfortunately, very negative review, but hopefully it will deter some people from making the same mistake. It is a pity that we did not have a Q & A at the end of the movie - now that would be interesting.
