This must be the worst film I've ever seen. I bought the DVD, and it does not work, well, DVD worked fine, it's just a movie did not, in fact, it is so bad that I do not think the actors worked well (or before judging from the action). There's no real plot to speak and no real horror. production values ​​stuff even for a low-budget movie with some external scenes to be difficult to hear because of the wind on the microphone. <br /> <br /> In general, it was so bad, the film that the audience might think that this will turn into porn when they are better (that was an improvement) do not know. There in the film only two lines, funny, both of which revolve around a transvestite prostitute. (Despite the fact that they hardly merit playing all 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> As for the marketing of DVD I feel completely cheated. I mean reading back, I expected it to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapon. He chose his victims. He picked his nose. He turned into a girl! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be funny. In addition, in the case of states that digitally re-mastered, I would like to see it in advance, so grainy print, you can use it as sandpaper. The case also says that it is absolutely disgusting film, how? Poor production, acting. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with his welcome for the first five minutes (if you are considering buying this, I would say buy a `bad taste", instead it is much better than the movie, and funny, and he has Peter Jackson LOTR director in it.) <br /> <br /> By the way, if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done so, please write here I would like to know, just to see if there is worse than the movie there or if anyone in this film never bothered to learn how to act
