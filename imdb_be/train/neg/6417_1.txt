How to comments like the one that was heading to school girls even do it on this site, it was a stupid movie I've ever seen, it was funny, how can any moron sit back and say that just because the movie makes you jumping is a good movie that could be the most idiotic thing I have ever heard, I could sneak up behind you and go «Boo», and it will make you jump, but it does not mean that I am qualified to write or send movies, not to mention "they tied everything together in the end" is not a good reason for the film to be yts well received. Which movie would be, if not tie everything together, I think that would make it half of the film, not the film. So basically this idiot girl adds them to finish a movie, and I love how the youth of today to keep the media and production companies to such a high standard. Not surprisingly, the political system of this country can get away with what they want, we do not have idiots like that goes in our country, what would happen if the girl actually end up leading something ever that this is a terrible idea. Get a life and go see a real movie ever, try Shawshank Redemption or the embankment, or something like that, and comments that it was "boring" after you can see, just use what little brain God gave you analyze it a bit.
