When I decided to see the barbarians, in the title role of twins bodybuilder, Peter and David Paul, I thought it might not be so bad, because the film was directed by Deodato, who has a reputation for creating a sloppy movie, but well done carelessly films. Well, the barbarians remarkably bad action / adventure, who wants to be a friend CONAN barbarians, and at every level. Appearance of the film all correctly. Some scenes are well shot, but the tone and schintzy, sticky "disco" look of hair and clothing of people decorated simply does not make any sense at all, even for the low-budget wave like this. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch appears as an old woman with this funny haircut and a suit. It must be threatening, but he comes across as a clown. And it's fun to see Eva Larue Callahan, one of the stars of all my children, it is in his first film, going to the poor furs bikini. I'm sure she wants this dreck disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbaric twins well as muscle bound heroes, but it is almost impossible to construct a proper criticism of their actions, because of their role, like everything else in this mess, really ill-conceived. The only way, the film tries to distinguish one twin from another, if one twin has to wear a loincloth, which covers his ass, and a loincloth other twin barely enough muscle his example. I'm not kidding! Do not ask me who is who, though. <br /> <br /> Deodato was really desperate to agree to make this film. His despair is reflected perfectly in this crappy movie. It's just bad.
