My complaint here relate to pace of the film and the material at hand. When using archival films and writing gives the film a fresh and interesting perspective, all too often the material chosen to highlight just not very interesting (for example, when Goebbels complains of a particular disease, and DC., Or ads on edge frames his small German native city). In addition, the film is crawling with hipsters. 1920-1939, and then soar through the war years. In general, the film is a little better than the History Channel documentary, with the exception that the director has a bit more sensitive than your average documentary editor History Channel and thus can be more artfully arrange the details of the life of Joseph Goebbels. However, I found that she wants.
