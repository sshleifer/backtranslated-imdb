Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating, this is a terrible movie. badly enough that I feel obligated to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the last period of rule, during the struggle for Indian independence. What stands in a funny plot just fills me with suspicion. What the characters are doing and how they behave just does not convince me that the characters exist in that epoch. <br /> <br /> So, for example, is a young married Indian maid with the local village is dealing with a married Englishman to Master Master, knowing full well that the opening of the case, is likely to mean utter social and shame can be very different if not the death penalty? It is unlikely, but still possible. Nevertheless, it would be the same young Indian maid, in a conservative society of the era of India lead as half-naked Britney Spears in the heat, to take part in a hot outdoor sex in the daytime in the open view, where they can be detected at any time? It's not only the bloody unlikely that this backward land line. <br /> <br /> Such stupidity, combined with a poor actor forced me to go to the movies hour movie, so I did not watch the second half of the movie. One can only hope that the end of more intelligence than what I saw in the first half.
