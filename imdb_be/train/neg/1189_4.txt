The show asked "bubbling" sound effect that is used to put me to sleep. Very soothing sight. I think I could have slept for a part where there was a danger or hazard. I also heard that some footage designed to display on the sponge divers was shot in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I would suggest, Lloyd Bridges never dived there. I just remember the show in the repetition and although he never had an edge-of-seat exciting, we have made our own underwater scenes in the lake at my grandmother's house ... Introducing echo Bubbling sounds and tells the story of our adventures in our heads, I thought that the "flipper" was better than the underwater action. Of course, he had the advantage of its natural environment.
