Sorry. Someone has to say it. It really is / was a dull movie. Worthy can be, but nonetheless sad. I almost did not cry out of boredom, if you look. Actions pretty boring, drawn out story and predictable, evaluation and cameras are absolutely standard and uninteresting. This is one of those movies that you are not allowed to hate (Becase is about disabled people), but hates, I suspect that almost everyone does. Interestingly, the critics have been so kind to this film. I believe that they also can not be objective. This was done to win the award - I remember it properly done. But it was neither interesting nor exciting. I have not seen play so can not compare.
