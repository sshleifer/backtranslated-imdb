SPLIT SECOND, may have been a good film. The story of "road rage" murder, has a very young Clive Owen gives a very good performance; But ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers undercut their own movie with idiotic Camcorder works and indeed most editing. The camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt (I guess) to reflect the stress of Owen out of business, family and traffic. What this actually does is to give the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> Since the filmmakers did not care anything about a good movie, but only to impress each other with their stupid pictures, one should not waste time on this travesty,
