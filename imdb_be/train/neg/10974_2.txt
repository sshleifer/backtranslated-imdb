I'm Irish and I have lived in Denmark for a while, so I'm looking forward to return home last week, so I could see the intermission. And I'll go on record as saying: <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible <br /> <br /> It is not so bad that something like "the most fertile man in Ireland", but it is definitely. not standing there with other Irish films such as commitment, I went down and Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some of the aspects of the film, is actually quite funny, such as Koly Meaneys American style Garda. But the film itself is removed completely wrong. Bouncing around the chamber and continuous zoom, distanced tries to give the film a sharp look, as if it were sand drama. But this is not the case. This Irish castle, money and Two Smoking Barrels, and he should be shot like this. It should have a smooth movement from one frame to another. The film looks messy and thrown together. <br /> <br /> The performances well, given a terrible scenario. A friend of mine told me how it was, they were just walking around Dublin Colin Farrell during the week. It gives a decent display as Dublin Dirtbag, but it can in no way be compared with his performances in Minority Report, Tigerland and Phone Booth. The best performance was by Dierdre OKeyna that plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who had just been dumped on her bank manager husband for a younger woman. I think that she must leave her god-awful standing and to focus more on his acting. <br /> <br /> In general, it is in no way live up to the expectations imposed on him the Irish press or even deserve to be regarded as one of the best Irish film ever. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for the backlash from those comments, because most of the people I spoke to said it was great. But before you answer, ask yourself, thinking that would be so much this film, if it was set in England or the United States?
