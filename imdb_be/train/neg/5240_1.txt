Once it gets to the screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms around! But on behalf of the manufacturers I have to say, that does not fall into any known category of the film, it warrants an entirely new name of its own! This "Neurological drama"! It saddens and depresses each neuron in the human brain. <br /> <br /> it's the closest one will ever get to a stroke actually does not suffer alone. It brings you the gift of speech, all you members of numb, my mouth drops open, and remains so, and the strangest symptom of all is that you are not wanting to go blind and deaf. <br /> <br /> Many small feat for such a kind of "cinema". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to mind just finished my test this disgrace !!!!!!
