This film was bad beyond belief. I saw him during the film festival in San Francisco in 2004. Before he started the owner of the theater he stood up and told us that half the audience left the theater the night before that happened, his "world premiere". I do not think anyone in the theater knew how bad the movie was supposed to be at this point. We all fully understand. <br /> <br /> This is not a documentary, but it sort of is sold as a single unit. Dark Angel was a bad biography and tribute erroneous Bettie Paige, in which half of the film is really just remakes of old Bettie Page movie. The film lasts only 90 minutes, and the contents of these 90 minutes of sub-par to say the least. The scene will start walking, then someone will say "wow you are so great Bettie, why not make another movie." This will be followed by 5 minutes remake Bettie Paige, who was almost as funny as (or even more than a boring) normal part of the film. by the end of the movie people laughed each time another Bettie Paige film remake invented. it was something that ridiculous. I hear a lot of laughter in the theater, but people do not laugh at the movie-maker, they laughed at the film and its poor content and structure. It was easy to say, as part of which will receive most of the laughs were the ones who were supposed to be serious or revelatory. <br /> <br /> I know that movies are expensive. I saw a lot of cheaply made independent films, but somehow the cinematography and the quality of this film makes it different from anything I've ever seen. The film looks like it was made for $ 12. Incisions, graininess and lack of sense of the plot made it a memorable experience. This film makes "Dude, Where's My Car?" Look Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> My friends and I left the theater feeling like we had just paid $ 8 to torture. Only redeeming part of the experience that we have to laugh at the fact that someone actually did this movie and thought it was good. Apparently, last night, in the night, "the world premiere of" director / writer / producer was in the audience and was witnessed people laugh and get to his film. Betty Paige films were destroyed. They have to destroy this film, too.
