I also love Defoe as an actor, but I spent a few hours of my life actually watch this movie, I still can not believe that I could see it in its entirety. Were there really a point in the film? And the ending, well, I'm glad I did not pay to see that awful meaningless piece of helpless excuse movie! <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that without the facts of hunting but Defoe married or seeing a terrible actress in this film, in real life, if it was his attempt to push start your career? If so, I'm afraid must have failed .. <br /> <br /> I have this post in hopes that I can actually put someone to watch this movie, even if one person takes heed of my comments and decides that they will be much better to watch paint drying I feel I have done some good in the world if only I had the same advice ...
