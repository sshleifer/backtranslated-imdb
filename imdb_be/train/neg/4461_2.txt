After quite a long part of the pixel nude scene in the shower, we're off to the races for this -esquire horror film "The Blair Witch Project" three friends going into a deserted cabin in the deep woods to get away from your hectic life for a girl 'weekend, and smoke pot. They meet two guys who seem friendly enough, so that they do not drink and tell stories about ghosts, until the end of the film, some of them are removed. <br /> <br /> This film is quite slow, with too stretched "suspense" scene, bad acting can not take a lot of scenes where nothing happens, but meaningless banter, and the film as a whole hopeless deathly boring dud in this . Absolutely nothing happens until the last half hour, and when I did, to numb really care <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ashley Totin shows T & A ;. Evi Lutzky gets topless short and Jennifer Hart shows her tit right <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
