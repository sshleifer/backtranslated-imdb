It was on the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing saddles, the most brilliant, but not this. Nowhere have I seen the name of Mel Brook here, and I can imagine why he got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot. My Gawd, who would have found it funny. Of course, the race can be a problem, but it's just not funny for me, because it's just not funny. It's like the authors did not even try to be funny, just to cash in on being tied with Blazing saddles. Perhaps they expect the show to go on for several seasons, when they did this pilot? Flat, they do not care. It was a quick cash cow, which, thank God, not cash. I believe that it is useful for historical purposes, or just to show how stupid and boring Hollywood writers can be.
