Much worse than the original. It was actually * painful to sit through, and he barely held his six-year old's interest. <br /> <br /> The introduction of some new Pokemon slightly interesting, but the plot is extra-thin, the dialogue is still bad, and mediocre music. Watch TV shows instead - it's much better.
