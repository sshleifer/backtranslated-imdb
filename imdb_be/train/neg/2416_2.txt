2 stars and I'm being generous. (Minor spoilers) Look, this is a low budget zombie film is set in the gangster Oakland. As the story goes, a scientist wants his dead brother back to life after he was killed in a drive-by <br /> <br /> The main problem with this film :. That zombies? All the "zombie" to make it growl (which does not sound even remotely scary) and dig a fake red blood out of his mouth! A lot of scary eyes, not decomposed flesh, just a bunch of people to growl deeply and run like idiots. HN <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the whole film, so it's not like all the "hood" suffers a zombie or anything, it's just a few, and is contained in the shortest possible time. <br /> <br /> action really so bad that it's fun. No one may speak at all in the movie (except, perhaps, one of the gang members), and it does seem like a bunch of friends got together, we decided to give up his family, and made a film one weekend. <br /> <br /> Final note: since when did doctors wear tracksuits? Skip this, please!
