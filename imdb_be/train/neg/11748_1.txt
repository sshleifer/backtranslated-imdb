This film has got to be one of the worst I've ever seen it done on DVD !!! The storyline may have clicked, when a movie has had more funds and writers who could cut the nonsense and painful scenes that I really warn parents .... But the story line as the Loose Cannon. If there is such a thing as a drive through the movie maker is the one to have arisen from that.It reminded me a lot of substandard films, which were introduced in the 1960 year, bad scripting and filming. <br /> <br /> The only sensible heroes the whole movie was a bartender and beaver. The rest of the film could be easily made by schoolchildren medium. I give this movie 1 rating, as it really badly and left his family with a feeling of being cheated. My advice-tion watch it !!!
