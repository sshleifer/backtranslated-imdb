This film does not deserve the next few minutes I will criticize it, but I know a lot of people like me hope to IMDb.com, to help address the issue of the films. The only reason I'm writing this. <br /> <br /> «Living Stream" as the Asian version of one thousand nine hundred seventy-six «The Incredible Torture Show» (also known as "Blood Sucking Freaks») http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 /. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism ... of course, it's all here, along with a third-class script, miserable and immoral actions of failing in the black comedy. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in China, but everyone speaks in English. There are many the girls in the movie that terrified dog butchering in the market, but sexually excited about entering a porn shop. One girl who is disgusted by the sewage in the toilet stall point in through is still there, with him and his friends boyfriend (he even got there can only be interesting, that in all this film.) The movie is absolutely horrible, even B-movie. Even if you were to download it for free it would be an insult to the hard disk.
