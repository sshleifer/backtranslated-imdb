When I go to the movies about zombies, I did not expect OSCAR performance caliber, or write at the level of the Godfather, but I'm waiting for the actors, at least not like they bother to read their cribs and dialogue that does not sound like he printed for 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the chamber. This film was just awful, I actually got up and left for about 25 minutes and went there and looked Cold Creek Manor, which was not very good, too, but it seemed, Citizen Kane compared to this bunch of crap. On the positive side, the girls were very beautiful, it's probably the only thing that kept me in the chair longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I left a hot one was killed, there was nothing to hold my interest after that.
