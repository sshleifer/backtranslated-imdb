I admit that I liked the first one, and really look forward to continuing. <br /> <br /> I was let down. Of course, the special effects were technically weird - but they were not plausible. It was more like a caricature. Okay, I admit, like 80% of the chase scene - but the struggle with all of Mr. Smith? It was too obvious, animated. <br /> <br /> I can take it all. What I can not accept that part of the non-action were crap. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew that for a speech that has gone forever, and did not say anything. <br /> <br /> I was also a little disappointed with the plot, which really exists. That this film did tell us that there was no truth in the first film (with the exception of the existence of the matrix). This film was a bit like seeing an episode of Dallas, where did you hear that all the previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Phew! I want my $ 7.00 back!
