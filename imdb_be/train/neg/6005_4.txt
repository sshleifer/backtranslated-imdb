This is a classic bitch with a big name plaster, mostly older people who were well past their prime, and before going to sleep in it. <br /> <br /> it's pretty boring movie if you think about it. Stay on the ground, and you will be confronted with the disease and, ultimately, your death. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance. It is a pity that the film does not focus more on that. Maureen Stapleton, looking haggard, still displayed the steps to the "Queen of Stardust Ballroom," a lot more down to earth from 10 years earlier. <br /> <br /> I just hope that this film does not encourage older people to commit mass suicide at Jim Jones. How can someone be enough idiocy like this and say that it will help you to think? <br /> <br /> Why Don Ameche won an Oscar for this crap? <br /> <br /> If high school students are doing such a wonderful thing in the end, why Tiny it is recommended to go on a boat? Why Steve Guttenberg jump ship, huh? Eventually, he found his favorite. <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie, if high school students only managed to find a fountain of youth on the ground and stay there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Brimley, with leaves, Vernon, Guilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy Cronyn and God knows who else were all asleep. The authors had to take the script and set it with this group as well.
