The only thing worse than surfers without any waves movie about a surfer without waves. For viewers who love surfing, this film will be a huge disappointment, as the total number of minutes of surfing footage from the best to achieve the three. <br /> <br /> The life story of a piece of discarded surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave, but also for any waves at all. J.C. (Pertwee) is the aging super surfer who flirts with the commitment with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he was going to find happiness grew with the woman he loves, three old friends surfing turn, and persuade him to hit the beach in search of waves of monsters in the Bone Yard. The problem is that there are no waves until the very end of the film, so that a large part of the history dissipates itself in the winding sequence of disconnected beach events. <br /> <br /> action mostly mediocre. Pertwee has several funny moments, but mostly it was the action of the ordinary. Ewan McGregor was decent as a drug wild man, by far the most interesting and unique character of the bunch. Probably the most fun performance was transformed into St. Petersburg Anna Terry, who made his stout body into a permanent supervisory gag. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character does not have enough meat for her to show a lot of acting ability. <br /> <br /> There really is not much here, where comments. I rated it 3/10. It's a real bummer beach.
