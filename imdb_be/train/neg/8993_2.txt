Back in the 70s, when I first saw it, I was in high school. It was great then. Now, as an adult, I look at him and I say myself..yeah law. What was so funny? It has its moments, but they are few and far between. It is so dated that jokes do not get up. Show it to a younger crowd, and they will be completely lost. If you like this kind of humor you can stick Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon women from the moon. Tunnel Vision and Groove tube is too dated for today's show.
