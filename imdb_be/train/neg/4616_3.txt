This film does not age. Maybe it's just the influence and cunning characteristic of the acting and the direction that we have seen with the Sopranos, but I just consider honor Prioy family for the first time on DVD, alone. <br /> <br /> experience of viewing it with the audience 24 years ago, must have been very different, but I have to say I was blown away by the ending. Not only is violence, but the idea that somehow this would be a fun ending. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a good shocker, but it seemed so out of character ... In addition, if this step should be set? The cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s, and still towers of the World Trade Center completed in 1973 {} are clearly visible in many scenes cityscape. <br /> <br /> Another way in which the film is bad at the age of the idea that a passenger can travel coast to coast with a knife on his face. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the mid-1980s, the audience found the film fascinating and fun. Mid-eighties, there are late oughts: only you can live.
