Billed as a sort of continuation of The Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield, this film is a fake. <br /> <br /> As someone who was born in Sheffield, and still with reference to the city, I was very disappointed with this film. Somebody said that it could be found in Oklahoma, and it's just about sums it up for me. It looked like a romantic view of the north of England made for the American market. Probably, many Americans - and many southern English people - do not understand that Sheffield is a large city of about half a million inhabitants, with a sophisticated urban culture. Among the giants it was shown how boring dead-end semi-rural small town, where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub, and where the idea of ​​the People's Party was a dance line in some village hall to look like. It was a small close-knit community, rather than the capital city. <br /> <br /> Sheffield working class people were completely unlike their real-world counterparts, which are usually silent and communicate with each other in grunts and dry remarks. They do not talk, and they certainly do not sing in the choir. <br /> <br /> Even the rural setting, presumably in the Peak District, looked alien to me. I found a few places where I used to go camping, but some of the aerial shots of the pylons that stretch over the bleak landscape reminded me more of Wales. Indeed, in the credits at the end of the day, I saw a link to Gwynedd, Wales. Peak District, in the summer, is teeming with pedestrians and tourists in cars. It is located between two large cities. This is not some kind of desert. <br /> <br /> As for the notion that a young woman can fall in love and lust, Pete Postlethwaite, who was ludicrous, and can only be a dream man. Its causes to become his mistress, they were not apparent. None of the men has been shown as having a partner or a family; they exist in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a film about unemployed Sheffielders be misleading. This Sheffield exists only in the minds of his middle-class writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a giant fake! <br /> <br />
