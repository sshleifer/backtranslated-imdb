When I saw the preview of this movie, I thought it may be dull, but it is at least funny. Well, I was wrong. Even if somewhere deep down, manufacturers had an interesting message to convey to the parents left alone and re-evaluate their lives as they tried to convey this message was awful. The first fifty times something stupid happened pair was relatively funny. But in the end, I could almost predict that stupid incident happens next. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue, and everything else is mediocre at best, which is still more than I can say for most of the film.
