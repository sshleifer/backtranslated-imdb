Whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly understood. As already mentioned, the film shows the local people in Iran who speak Arabic, not Persian. This is enough to lose the trust of those who have the least knowledge of the area or country. The landscape could not be more different from the actual <br /> <br /> Other factual errors :. The train is shown operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan has no railways. Turkish ambassador dressed in Fez (red hat), while Fez was banned by Turkey long before the time in which the film is set. Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I believe that the filmmakers intended to show an exotic woman, and the sari was that they decided to make it exotic.
