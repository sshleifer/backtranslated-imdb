I'll keep this short, as a movie, as it does not deserve a full review. <br /> <br /> Given the setup, this film could be something really special. This could be another "28 Days Later" or <br /> <br «Blair Witch Project» /> The first 20 minutes or so of the film, I was very happy, directer did a decent job with the cinema and suspense, even though I do not think that he was able to capture the true horror of the empty London underground. <br /> <br /> The characters had a great pulled. Our "hero" in this film is a useless piece of shit, and you really do not care if she's dead or not. As many people have said before, I was rooting for the homeless and a black guy who was able to give me a giggle or two (intentional or not writers). <br /> <br /> the main villain, kept in the dark for the first half of the film, but when he showed, I was very disappointed. I will not spoil it, but lets just say that my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> In general, it's just another mediocre horror film, which falls into the trap of following the simple formula of Hollywood. This film has a lot of potential, but really could not hit the target. <br /> <br /> Just to emphasize how lame this movie was, the characters in this film at least five times to finish and kill the main villain, rather than run away.
