Worst film I've seen, as ginger ale Adler. I believe that is a horror / comedy. I'm pretty much predicted every scene in this movie. The special effects were not so special. I believe that I could think of as the good effects from the fact that I was lying around the house. I would like to have something good to say about this movie, but I'm afraid I have not. Even Coolio should be ashamed to appear in a turkey. I am, after a little thought, there is one good to say about this movie - it ended.
