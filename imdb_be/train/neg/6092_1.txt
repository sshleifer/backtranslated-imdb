Someone had seriously kidding when they made this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is absolutely impossible that this film was made in 1993, the fashion and the music dictate that this is serious 80. I think it sat on the shelf for a long time before some crazy distributor picked it up and released it to the incredulous world. <br /> <br /> There is a story. View. Strange loner meets casual man with a beard, who tells him that if he is meditating, singing his favorite song, he can turn into anyone he chooses. At this point, I feel obliged to note that the favorite song of a loner is London Bridge is falling down. Why is his favorite song? Because he's an idiot. We are only a minute into the film and the film has reached monumental levels of stupidity. This becomes even more absurd. <br /> <br /> loner is a collector's nostrils. I can only assume, as there are two scenes in the film, where he had seen picking his nose. This clarifies the name. He decides to change the girl, so he can get closer to the other girls. And kill them. It's more or less it. <br /> <br /> action universally awful. Each performance in this movie sucks. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the acting standard pornographic film. It really is that bad. nostril collector appears before the audience as a collector's nostrils. Characters in the movie and see it the girl that he was through singing London Bridge is falling down. Man, I feel like an idiot, even typing this. Anyway, it's kind of strange to see middle-aged pervert hanging of schoolgirls. And not in a good way. There is even an extended montage scenes where the collector head-to-school girls and the song plays over the top. This is very possibly the worst song ever recorded. I will not even describe. You'll know it when you hear it. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes of violence, of course. And there is a sequence of style Benny Hill chase involving transsexuals. There is even a little bit immortal dialogue, which may or may not be taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the collector nostril says prostitute, "I have money, if you have a deep wound." Fine, I'm sure you'll agree. <br /> <br /> utter nonsense.
