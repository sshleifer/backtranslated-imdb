This US soap opera "Silent wharf" has all the entertainment value trapped in an elevator. Each episode contains sites such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, it is not very different from the stories of other theatrical shows time. As for the actors, I have seen best actor in the cereal box. from the mid to late '90s, the repetition of "nodes" stinking up the UK-Gold, like a mountain mildewing diapers. I regret to inform you that I had to suffer it as my mother was a big fan of the show and will watch it religiously. Although since the re-runs were few and far between (let's hope that stays that way). The only positive thing we can say about the "knots" is a catchy melody saxophone signature, then used as the title music for ITV comedy, "up". Most of the inheritance, eh?
