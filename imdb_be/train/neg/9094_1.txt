Well, let me break it down for you guys ... it's awful! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble made a bizarre first job Cruel, why he did such a poor job on this issue. I'm sorry, but this film is dull, however, can be improved, if the series was ever aired, but let's be realistic ... this film is a crock! Many bad actions Note * Shower * «Kissing Cousins» scene ?????? What line is that? «Slipery wet" ?????????? Can we say, SPIRIT-M! This film had an effort, I'll give you that, but it was too silly! They even tried to make it fun by giving dull yard accents that really is not funny .... ,! It was pathetic. Not to mention the fact that they have done everything in this one look totally different from the original hue. It is as if they made them look different on purpose or something! I love to watch when I really overboard, which happens sometimes. For those of you who did it, how it is ... Well, what did you think? You could not have chosen this film for the other, who had a great acting and fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? The film is gold, if it is Sarah Michelle Gellar in it SPIRIT! But this film does not take offense Amy Adams. Oh, yes, yes and when Sebastain a heart ????? UGH!
