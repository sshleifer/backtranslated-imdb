What a great actor, that in such terrible stories ... <br /> <br /> The film and its production, however, is pretty good, even if set in London, but with the exterior in Bristol. No matter ?? seen one cathedral you've seen them all, sort of. <br /> <br /> The story but ... about a man born with the power to sow death and destruction to anyone and anything, if he so wishes. With just a passing reference to these cases of telekinesis life, building a descriptive image of a man wrongly underestimated and, as a boy, a teenager, and finally, as a man; so much so in fact that it will charge at the request of vengeance, literally. Over time, he came to the conclusion that the whole world is moving in the wrong direction, and therefore, sets out to destroy a lot ?? just thinking about it! <br /> <br /> Problems with descriptive, however, is that he is trying to mix the real scientific evidence about the strange mental abilities and combine it all with a quasi-religious nonsense to make a hodgepodge theory about this. Mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works ?? and I'm afraid that Richard Burton had to overact terribly in some cases when trying to sound convincing. His very best scene, however, when he gave his wife and her lover verbal pasting as they left their home: a sharp, witty dialogue and deadly, delivered as only Burton could <br /> <br /> Good supporting cast. helps to make things look and sound much better, though, starting with Lino Ventura, whom I had last seen in the Garde A Vu (1981) as Inspector Brunel; Harry Andrews as an assistant to the Commissioner; significantly undervalued Lee Remick as Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as the publisher, Towney, and several other well-known character actor. <br /> <br /> I like the way the story was presented as a flashback and in flashbacks to fill in the background and thus to solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of Morlar (Richard Burton), a writer with a murderous disposition. Up to this point, it was a good piece of visual detective work by Brunel and his British sidekick. However, it was very predictable as it quickly became very apparent to me the identity of a potential killer. <br /> <br /> They then went and spoiled it all in the last fifteen minutes. If you want a clue as to what it seems, Samson and Delilah (1949), from a noble DeMille, and Samson got the bad guys in the end. And the last scene just stupid. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways that obsessed Morlar, they could be stopped completely. <br /> <br /> A shame, really, because it could have been much better, history and cinema. I believe that Burton really need the money. <br /> <br /> If you Burton fan, and then take the time to see this scene, I mentioned above. Otherwise, do not worry.
