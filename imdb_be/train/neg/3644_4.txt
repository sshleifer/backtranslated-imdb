This film is very poor. Acting pitiful and completely forced. In addition, when shooting film as a docudrama does not necessarily make it more believable, you can not get out of it that easily, Mr. Dir. Do not let a comment fool you, however, I would recommend you see this movie, as it shed some light on the psychology of psychology or nonexistent for perpetrators of such crimes. However, the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish! There's no other way to put it! It is purely and simply failed to capture any sense of atmosphere! What is happening does not translate to me any feelings of despair, panic, fear, and the fear that one will surely be tested in such terrible circumstances. Many instead, it leaves you with a jaw-dropping, "was it?" Spilling from the language, and in no way you pursued these boys action. Most likely you will simply feel embarrassed for another film, which began with the potential, but end up falling flat on his face in the most crucial day point.Zero actually .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
