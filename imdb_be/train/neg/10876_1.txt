What the hell with D-Movie was? Bad action, bad special effects and the worst dialogue / storyline I've ever encountered. The only cool thing was here Coolio, which was nice cameo as a nervous cop. However, the rest of the movie is terrible and sad. It is not even so bad, you can laugh at it. Simply crap. And anyone who compares it to the Evil Dead series could also compare Tomb Raider Raiders (well, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 in 10
