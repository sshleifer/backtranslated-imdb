The premise of the film is revealed on the DVD box. Textile worker develops a miracle fabric that does not degrade. But the film can not be obtained with it. Instead, he pads for 45 minutes, noodling around preamble, before he makes a great discovery. Because the audience does not get a lot of viewing a child prodigy figuring out things, it's a strange choice of film was successfully prevented from participating any topic. Once the tissue is found that the film too quickly establishes that both branches of the cones and blue-collar employees want squelched invention, resulting in a film with only two flimsy movements; invent chemical and operates from oppressors. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why anyone would describe it as a comedy. The tone is not funny or ridiculous. It's more like a serious social criticism of the day: that capitalism deforms both the supply and production chain. That, in turn, prevents innovation by achievement and improve the world. Yes, that's probably true, but without playing with the attitude to the fact that the film is just a serious argument. You will need a very broad definition of comedy, to find some here. <br /> <br /> It's more like the British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
