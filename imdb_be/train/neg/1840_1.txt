This should be the most rigid unfunny "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Christopher Walken as a crazy homeless person can not make me laugh? Something must be wrong with this picture. It's the only movie I've ever experienced, leaving. I used the free passes, and still felt like I wanted to get my money back. I can honestly say that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this was the HOUSE OF THE DEAD. . ONLY. worse. cinema. I laughed very little in the carousel circular stage, and that's all. After spending 2 hours is exposed as a comedy, you should get more than a laugh, is not it? I do not know, I think the filmmakers thought "flan" was a funny word, or something. And another joke really beats a dead horse - literally.
