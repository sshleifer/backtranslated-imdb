Despite its shortcomings, I enjoyed «Cigarette Burns» John Carpenter Season One episode in the series Masters of Horror. Yes, the story seemed a cross between a cheap in the mouth madness and 8MM, but it was still pretty good for a budget and time restrictions imposed on him. With the «Pro-Life", however, a low budget and time constraints, of course, reveal more than anything else. There is a rigid direction as always with Carpenter still have the quality in writing and himself all the production that gives a sense that this was done in a general and complete break. The scenario is not always clear, the message is inaccurate, and history is full of plot holes, as soon as you look at them. Maybe that Carpenter re-wrote the script, he could be a useful episode. On the contrary, it's a mess that only the hardcore supporters Carpenter will find pleasure in the slightest. Carpenter defined the worst ever made. 2/10
