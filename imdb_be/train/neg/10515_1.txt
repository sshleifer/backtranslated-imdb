Well, this is a typical "straight to the toilet" slasher. <br /> <br /> In short, a lot of teenagers / young people becoming stranded in the middle of the horrific forest and hacked down naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> In this film there is a good reason for this shredder Fromage: <br /> <br /> -Naked women, -teens or young people who have dropped in somewhere frightening, -gory death scene, -The the last survivor being a well-built young woman who will always show off her stomach, but never less than a bra, -a horrible, crazy person who knows about the evil, -lesbian kiss scene, -sex be a killer-not plot <br /> <br /> Even for cheesy slasher, it was really scary. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, not even the sexually explicit scenes and poverty, it was enough to keep a man and a lesbian female audience interested. Watching it felt being watched the other head cork or unpleasant cold. <br /> <br /> Give demonic ..... 0/10.
