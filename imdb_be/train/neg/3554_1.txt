I rented it back in the 80s, and to be honest, I can not remember anything specific about the film - only that it is the worst movie I have ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad that it was interesting." It's not one of those "it was so bloody, it leaves you with a bad feeling" movies. He was not even one of those "what it was ? "movies. I can not remember the acting, but it was a bad shooting, the story has been scattered, and he did not have a defining style. When it was over, I was angry that I wasted time. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of films that I do not understand, because of unfamiliar cultures, styles, and / or the story, but it was clear that these movies were some of these properties. Incubus has not. <br /> <br /> I'm really not supposed to be making a comment on this "part", for fear that someone might see him out of curiosity, but I have to warn all those who appreciate a film to miss this movie,
