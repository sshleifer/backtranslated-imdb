this movie was fantastic great movie all through scary as hell. I mean, that freaked me out as well as pulse and IT and foreshadowing, etc., but with a great movie comes shit end is not it? RIGHT! this movie ending was pathetic stuff. I mean, the ghost turned while in the house chickens and I think that now I've done that this means that I can call her and PPL to be at the right time, because she thinks it is. is not it? wrong. my ass! I do not care if the ghost of Satan, it just does not happen. his film is, but violent movies or praised films like this are meant to understand, but it is not. he just showed us what I just said, and people do not think anything about it. can someone please tell me why you did not notice that the pathetic part. film for me has ended in a hospital, and that's all. check number 3 it much more Kick Ass
