I am Puerto Rican, and it is one of the worst documentary I have ever seen of any type. You can see that the people on it are ignorant. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They argue that Puerto Rico, because they are from Puerto Rico offspring, but they probably know less than others who are not there. You can see, while they say that they contradict themselves. If you want to see real and I mean real, real documentary from Puerto Rico, you should see "Mi Puerto Rico". This is a serious, real documentary. I do not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez on the basis of the documentary itself. I thought it was suppose to be about Puerto Ricans. They continue to repeat, I do not know. Well, that's the only thing they got right on this so-called documentary. I do not want to see such a piece of garbage is done by using the name of the island. He brings down standards.
