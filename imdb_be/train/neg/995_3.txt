Rosary Dawson stars as a girl who date raped, and then begins a decent into darkness until it gave a chance for revenge. While it is clear why Dawson took over the role of his chance to show his acting chops and make a small independent, strongly nya-Hollywood film, it is also clear that aside from the stunning appearance, Dawson seems out of place in this role. Sorry, I just could not find it. That's not a bug, that's how I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes, I know that it is on the screen, but even if I spent the better part of two hours, looking at her, she did not leave the impression that it always me. I blame for this scenario, since in addition to the final, not a heck of a lot of what happened on the screen seemed to be no real meaning. People seemed to be more poses than real, and what's going on, it does not seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague, but nothing in this film, except the end (which I would like to talk about, but can not cause it to spoil it), and the image of Rosario Dawson, as nothing more than the image that has stayed with me I can .chto to say that it can push you, he can not, for me this time, I can not go back. For fans of Rosario Dawson only, although keep in mind that there are some real reasons why this NC17. (And Rosario- please you better actress, to choose the best scenario)
