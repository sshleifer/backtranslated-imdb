It was a great cast with famous stars such as Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a lot less, but know the names with shorter roles. He was also the Technicolor, one of the few films made with it in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ....... unfortunately I can not say much for the positive stories. He portrayed the boy James in a very positive light .... Hollywood made so far. Why do these criminals have always stated that the "good guys" for me. This film is attractive and they made their enemy - the railway people - evil people. The latter was exaggerated because it was inappropriate. Well, that's the world of cinema for you: the evil is good; good bad <br /> <br /> Hey, Hollywood: news flash here - James Boys were criminals.! In fact - look it up!
