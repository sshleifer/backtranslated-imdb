Wow, you guys are too good !!! Corny, corny, corny That's how I feel film.It started well with a good idea, man (Edward Asner) escapes from prison dressed as Santa, a bunch of kids find it and believes his real Santa is why Fake Santa recruit child to help him find a bag stolen deneg.Kollektiva film as a Christmas version of "whistle down the wind." to start the movie, but gradually becomes Cheesier Cheesier and to the fact that in the end, it becomes ridiculous, and you just can not take this film sur 'ozna. for example, you will get the type of a character named Scrooge will crush (Rene Auberjonois), whose total Douchebag, who refers to his young son as a pile of junk, he treated his son so badly that he did not even buy him decent clothes, the poor child wears jeans with holes! A 45 second scene with fake Santa visits Sumner and the end of the movie you get a guy is happy to sing Christmas Carol and giving his neglected son of a hug ... but that's how trite it ... I feel good for the film, especially at Christmas time, and I'm a big fan of seasonal television movie, but this a way too over for me, it's a shame because he started well, but the second half of the film trowing supernatural element in a film that simply does not match the rest of this. It's not really bad, there are some tough action, especially in children, but there are many better around Christmas movie.
