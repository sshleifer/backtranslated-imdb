OH MY GOD .. worst SH * T I have never seen -this main thing that came to my mind immediately after viewing the film. And I did one with the opposite myth do not understand. Although, perhaps, the idea was good, but the effect is miserable. I particularly have in mind the role of H. Graham. What was that ??? In my opinion, it has destroyed all the positive intentions of producers. The character played in the affected and irritating manner. Every time it is that reminds you watched the film and destroy the spirit, then the whole movie, because most of the time, you can see that it has a silly face with a silly attempts to create emotions. TERRIBLE, do not waste your time.
