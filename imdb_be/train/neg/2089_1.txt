Of course, I watched BG. I loved the S1, I liked season 2 season 3 was in order, and he loved the final. Yay, there is a spin-off show! I did not know about it at all, one of my friends told me about it. I was very happy. <br /> <br /> I've watched the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of garbage! Teenage girl drama festival. There's no science fiction ... Well, hardly. At the end of each episode, we can catch a glimpse of Cylon. That's all. Who takes care of it? Perhaps they decided that women will next show the target audience under the age of 18? Sad to say religious delirium, moaning, whining ... and some others. <br /> <br /> It's just sad that there is nothing there at the moment to watch. Stargate ruined, BG over ...
