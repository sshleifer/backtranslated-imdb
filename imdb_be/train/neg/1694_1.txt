This film may seem scary on advertising, but the film itself was a cause of vomiting. This is below the lower middle (even lower than), and does not plot. I mean, every home can make you feel terrible and sure to scare the dead Japanese food from you, but what? Make a movie that would appeal to the observers, and not just to show images of frightened people, and some hair (dead Japanese). You can say "terrible rip-off from Samara (The Ring)Â»? Do not get me started with the "dead child". Even not so bad! So what? He has a cat, and he can do it, the big freaking deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save a few lives that have the potential to be harmed in Grudge! 1/10! Ugh! >. <
