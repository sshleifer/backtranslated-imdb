I'm the guy who usually keeps thinking for myself, but I have just returned from this movie, and I felt that I had to express their opinions. Let me say that I'm a big fan of horror. But what makes a horror film? I'm sure he would like to see even a little bit of good development of the script and the character. I know that they often lack in horror movies, but looked like Prom Night, he did not even put forth any effort in this department. Further, we all love the unknown. The fact that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. So, Prom Night, there was nothing of the sort! Of course, we, as a terrible killer. Prom Night is what? No, he has a pretty boy with a knife cute Lil ». And if all else fails ... at least, the horror is guilty pleasure, to make it as enjoyable as gore gore gore and sometimes nude scene! Yeah, well, if you have a horror movie rated PG-13, like prom night, they leave this stuff too. Thus, all of these elements are missing, I ask .... does this is still considered a horror movie? No. I would call it a comedy. People in my theater were (Thats, which also sucked, but it's another story!) Laugh more on this, then they were when I saw «Semi-Pro», which was supposed to be really a comedy. I think I just have to give up new terror. All good horror movies good old days were converted into the garbage so the studio can make money. The people I went to see it did not even know it was a remake! What made me mad! I wonder what will happen if there is no more films to remake ??? Where it will go next horror ???
