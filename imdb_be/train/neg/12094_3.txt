This film pretends to study the nature of perversion. Some observers were to cheat on the assumption that because of the distortion shown, the film psychologically deep; in fact, given the obscene material, it is surprisingly difficult and shallow, without the motivational material. Why the main character, as it is? You do not learn from the script. For better treatment of the same theme (and more entertaining film), try Bunuel Belle de Jour.
