Oh, my God, I'm disappointed. When I first heard the news about the remake of the 1963 Robert Wise film "Ghost", I had a fear that it will be destroyed wealth summer movie size visuals. But, deep down, I had faith. Of course, with such a talented cast intact ... De Bont and the company will not spoil the film, which was originally a fantastic and frightening film that understand the subtle art of subtlety. Well, thinness, where are you now !! ?? My fears were ... promising film went wrong. So, Eugenio Zannetti production design is terrific; beautifully photographed film; and composer Jerry Goldsmith could never ever do wrong. However, the script contains this wonderful actors to deliver their test..asking unnatural kind of dialogue, which speaks only in the movies. In the end, always perfectly Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with dignity ... and that's just a little bit. But the crime of all crimes is that the horror show us. We can not use our imagination to feel that awful fear of fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to show us that we have to fear ... and you know what? How wonderful to see how they ... visual effects come off as kind of stupid. And the climax is phantasmogoric mess ... but it all went horribly wrong long before that. <br /> <br /> All in Ghosts exaggerated and blown out of proportion. I am afraid that there is no real thrill or creaks in the old haunted house ugliness ... only groaned. Check out the original instead. <br /> <br />
