zombie uprising has no redeeming features. I'm tired of people saying that this is not so bad, and that the consequences must be packed more punch in 1936, I suspect that it is not: it is not as IQ-x has increased dramatically in the last 7 years. The average viewer in 1936, probably just as tired of this stuff as the average viewer today. Why? Just try to watch the first scene, and count the pause between things happening, terrible choice if cut close-up, the careless editing seems to include two additional seconds for each shot in the area since the work. Pay attention at all to reserve a dialogue: "I'm going to make tea / output / read my book now." "You?" "Yes." This kind of exchange takes place several times. Usually, I would like that, being a big fan of bad movies, but were watching the actor muttering his banal and boring lines, and any desire to laugh at the film slowly fades away. This kind of selfless, time waster boiling pot worse than energetic, creative mind-blowers as Plan Nine from Outer Space or Santa Claus punished Martians. Those who claim that it is "better" than the more interesting films are backward idea of ​​entertainment. This film is not bad in the sense that your jaw hanging open in surprise: it's bad in the sense that your eyes close slowly bore. What is much worse.
