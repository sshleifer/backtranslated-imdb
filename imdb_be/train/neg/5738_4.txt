"Darkness" was interesting to some extent, but it never seemed to have a site lacks one more than the other films that have been accused of this damage; ie "Bad Taste". It started very well, with her husband working on something. It was very scary for the first few minutes, but after a while the movie just became entertainment to the level of gore, it was difficult to see in some places due to poor lighting and terrible quality of the recording in any way. The film is hard to believe because of the juvenile actions that most of the time, it seemed like some members speak with a video camera, making the line, they are gone. This, with the lack of any plot at all, did it look like film has been launched without, and ended without the script of any kind. As mentioned earlier, the blood was only drawing point of this film, which is most of the time it was hard to make out.
