The Earth is doomed to be no more thanks to his father Pergado and a bunch of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said that he has been cheated, to appear in it its producers, who told him a lot of great actors were involved) Father Pergado and can do his usual serious and terrible procedure. The cast is not too bad, although most of them are now retired from acting. The film has a scary sound effects (mostly created by pressing a key on your old computer, it seems), and funny sometimes wondered - showing scenes of the sky, for example, for what feels like hours at a time. Despite this rather humorous story of the world-is-doomed the way and production is adequate. Interestingly one scene contains Albert Band and his wife Jackie; Honey range; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and assistant Charles Band Bennah Burton. Despite the nature of perseverance I really wanted to see how it all works, and so very much.
