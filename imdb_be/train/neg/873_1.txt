Executive, very successful in their professional life, but could not quite in his usual life, meets a boy with Down syndrome, had escaped from the residence. Both characters feel very lonely, and appears to be less intelligent one will show executive beauty of small things in life ... With this argument, the Amelie-like atmosphere and sentimental music, I did not expect, but moralistic disgusting film. In any case, since there were some interesting scenes (boy sometimes pretty tough guy), and the interpretation of the two actors, Auteuil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to go to watch a movie. French cinema in general, has an opportunity to show what seems to be quite a lot of life, opposed to the stereotypical American cinema. But, due to the fact that much more disappointing to see after the end of the absurd, impossible with the boy's death, magic tons, happiness executive family, cheap moral unbearable laughter daughters, boy waving from heaven as Michael Landon .. . Indeed the opposite, in my humble opinion.
