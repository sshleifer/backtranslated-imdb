Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee kidnapped terrible dudes while shopping one day and brought back to the secluded island that women are reluctant to tell the thugs that the last time they visited when they were ten years old, and that luck is on. Everything that is largely bookend the film, which is largely one long memories of the first visit to the island girl and the subsequent anti-cannibal family. <br /> <br /> This is one very badly acted by all the participants to the point that I started to feel bad for the poor Hank Ward, who really deserves much better. As much as I did not want to "Barracuda" (this on one DVD), I must admit that this film makes this one look like Citizen Kane <br /> <br /> Eye Candy :. One pair of tits (they may belong Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My class: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage ads for different drive in food; and trailers "Bonny Children" (especially nudity) "centerfold girl", "Incomplete Wife» (especially nudity), «Psychic Killer», and «eaten Alive». The DVD also comes from 1978 in the "Barracuda"
