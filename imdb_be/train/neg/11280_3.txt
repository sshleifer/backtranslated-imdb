This film is about a person's life is not so. His business is failing and he could not impregnate his wife, despite numerous attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is full of chaos. It just does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the film does not make sense. The history is so poorly written that I just could not understand. It's a shame because the scenery and the costumes are made good, and visually stimulating enough. Filming is well composed for the film. However, this redemptive function still can not compensate for a bad story and a bad story. I am surprised by the big names who have agreed to do this movie. It's a waste of their talents. This film is very bad. Avoid it !!
