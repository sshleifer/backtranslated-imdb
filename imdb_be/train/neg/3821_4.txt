What is the most harrowing film ever made? Gynecological nightmare "Cries and Whispers"? Acid psychodrama with Fassbinder? A black comedy of embarrassment, "Last House on the Left? I am sure that for the part of the film loving public that link them with a good mast ship Buster Keaton, there is only one answer - any one of his sound films. <br /> <br /> I do not know what tore my soul more poignantly in this film - ground intricate and expansive physical art to everyday Keaton slapstick; painful indecision this major filmmaker with dialogue - not that he does not have a beautiful, comic voice, or that he can not make funny dialogue; it's just that the studio does not seem to have given him plenty of doubles, and he seems to be trying to remember his lines before it provides, making it the only - Keaton, not his character, to look foolish; or is it a humiliation of seeing Keaton embroiled in tawdry sex farce, when he gave us some of the richest accounts of romantic disappointment in the film? <br /> <br /> No, I know, what I was most disturbing - you have to watch Buster Keaton, the greatest comedian of cinema, sit on the sidelines watching Jimmy Durante makes his feature. This horror such as this that get yer yer Dantes was hell. <br /> <br MGM />, it seems, I got an interesting idea that the best way to adapt Keaton, the sound is to turn it into a Marx brother, complete with verbal pedantry, preparing, exhausting "clowning" chaotic farce , theatrical staging, the triumph over chaos, and Thelma Todd. Keaton was not just a comic book, and where malicious language Groucho and joyful opportunism may have just made this area of ​​work, socially inept Professor Buster can not, he also studied and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster had to be allowed to experiment how to Lang in the "M" or René Clair; he would never have tried to stem the tide, like Chaplin. If a film like "The General" is mentioned - is busy with trains - the loss is even more evident. <br /> <br /> And it's, trays on the background of a flat direction, the film is not so bad - there is a great impetus to the camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone at the railway station; and the denouement, when almost the original, at least, is more alive than ever before. There is something almost endearing about how Keaton slows the plot, which need all the lightning, it can get. <br /> <br /> There is a film about loneliness, emotionally paralyzing order, numbness effects of education and so on, struggling to get out. The best way to appreciate this film look no story Professor TZ Post, but emasculated genius Buster Keaton, trapped in mediocrity prison, difficult new technology, ridiculed malicious fate (in this case, studio), while maintaining a stoic affection. He looked so it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
