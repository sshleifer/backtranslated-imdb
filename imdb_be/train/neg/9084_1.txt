It was the worst movie I have ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) could not act ALL! she did not have any emotions, it was blah-blah-blah, it reads from the sad text books. Clever child and a child who loves food (where the names do not forget) so annoying it was driving me crazy.When ever said this about some scientific things or food. Mollys dad did not show enough emotion about his daughter went missing. A police officer and Mollys dad said the same thing as four times. it was just awful. All repeated the path of many. Beatrice had something bad happen to her for being mean. I just wasted time in my life, watching this film!
