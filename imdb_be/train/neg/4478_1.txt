I did not expect much from this film an amusing diversion. The storm could become a plausible story beautifully modern and soap, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film has decided to throw out the talents of the people involved in the simpering version so watered down from the original material, which is strange, they had the courage to call him Thunder general. He ignores the fact that this is the story of people who are inherently unsympathetic, basically unsympathetic and often cruel to each other. It changes the nature probably characters- Isabelle, for example, in the novel, he was not condoning the bone in her body-they stripped her blind idealism and turned it into a cunning whore. Heathcliff is a horrible man who psychologically tormented by the majority of people on their way, but in this version Ekaterina finishes leaving his daughter in his care. Dialogue is commonplace and wonder how the actors were able to put any of her with straight faces. Instead of real depth or emotion, we know that they mean something when they cry is something individual. I have read criticism of the early version of the '90s, "Emily BrontÃ«'s Wuthering Heights", which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it has become intensely dark, gothic story into a frothy bodice ripper. Slightly valid comments, but MTV version goes a step further, using a basic narrative structure to deliver CHIPPER beach bums jump really bad music.
