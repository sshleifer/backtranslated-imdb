What happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he made a show of typical summer action feed that could have been sent by anyone available from film school ... but in fact, they probably would have done better. They would have at least put half thought in a nightmare scenario. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some wormhole and landed in the planet apes rule. (Gasp!) But this time around, monkey squirm through groan worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and spectacular special effects, are constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could have been put about 10 independent films, which would be considered "a masterpiece "next to the scar. <br /> <br /> as far as I enjoy the wonderful acting talent, which Tim Roth, his performance as the leader of the evil monkey Thade is nothing more than an intense composition stooped and heavy breathing. Fortunately for it allows you to make it as an actor, to keep Neka thorium-esteem and most of the shit-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sighs. <br /> <br /> And, unfortunately, always a reliable Hollywood tradition of taking a male and female wire and attach them to the end without any development of relations or causes . And the "ha ha, we are so smart, do not you?" so that Hollywood intertwines references from the original Sweat in it. sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of having to see it, to spend the night in and call some friends and rent "Ed Wood," "Edward Scissorhands," "Batman," or even to a lesser extent, "Sleepy Hollow," and the memory in those days, when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... nya shame and ridicule.
