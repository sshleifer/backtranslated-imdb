It was not the worst film I've ever seen, but that's about the same as you can say about it. It starts with a good atmosphere; Hospital respectively sterile and alienated, the mood is set to "awful." And then ... nothing. Well, something. Just something that clearly does not fit ... and no attempt is made to clarify the relationship between the bizarre and yet not particularly scary creatures, and in the hospital they took longer. I mean, come on, biker clothes? Some of the group watched a little too much Gwar. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite was the main daemon, which looks pretty much like a middle-aged truck driver desperately trying to threats, while at the same time, looking like he really wanted to give preference to sag down on the Afghan-coated couch, unbuckling the belt, pop-bank cheap beer (maybe Schlitz), and watch the game. Frankly, I've seen much worse truckers. In truckstops. Drinking coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary !! <br /> <br /> other monsters even more caricatured and even less scary. At least, on DVD, video to give some explanation of their presence in the hospital ... they seem to just randomly appear in the field to play a bippy Â«metal", and get people to be a little bit dead. Except for a few good special effects, as well as the acts is not quite scary given the lack of decent writing, there's just nothing here. This is only the background noise film.
