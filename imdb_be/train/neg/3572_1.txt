Magnificent «Z» Channel in Los Angeles showed the film Pia Zadora about six months or so after the "Butterfly." I had such high hopes for the actress, and then it goes from bad to worse explicitly in this film. <br /> <br /> Again, it was 80, and I must tell you, Harold Robbin's work was overshadowed by clever writers, Jacqueline Suzanne torn it (she hated his way of women's writing), the work of Irwin Shaw caught on with many women and, of course, Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's and early 80's, and then came the Jackie Collins, who has made women stronger and more equal to men in all respects in her books, even more so. That is why this work is smelt. Harold Robbins work in the 80 years just did not catch on with audiences. Pia Zadora operates in one of the papers was as throwing Robbin gases on fire. supporting cast was not helping. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... it was horrible to look at and even more 20 years later, it looks even worse. I had hope for Pia as an actress, and it's all shot on the latch when it was done. It would be difficult for Pia redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters throwing it in "Hairspray" was the spark), although she has a good voice. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, no matter where you are. ..Hairspray can go on tour! Join the show. You can be a great comeback story yet. <br /> <br /> I just hope that they burn the movie for you if you do.
