Beautifully photographed and skillfully acted, as a rule, but the writing is very messy. There are scenes of such unbelievability, that there is no fun to watch. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for example, is so far-fetched that I groaned aloud. And the "Connect light bulb emotions" it seems a trick, too. <br /> <br /> I do not know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few limp comedic scenes, this is a very good movie. No serious effort on the part of the viewer is required. But Italian film, especially the Italian comedy, tend to be much better than this.
