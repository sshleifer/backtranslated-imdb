It starts very well, nice intro and build for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same form as the main character of the American pie and lost without. supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the film a commercial success Pie <br /> <br /> Let's be honest - the current Heder was pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did everything they could, but there was no significant plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just runs without ramp or a clear logic of the plot to justify its length. <br /> <br /> The ending is as predictable as they come - so predictable I tick box spoilers for this one line <br /> <br /> My advice: avoid at all costs if you do not really have anything else to do / listen to or watch, and even then. you'll feel manufacturers simply deceiving you with an hour and a half of his life.
