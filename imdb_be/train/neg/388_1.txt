I can not stand most of the reality show, and it's worse than that, Paris Hilton, and I'm sure it's his company. But "you're fired" or "you're hired" for how many seasons? After watching the show, I would not want to work for a guy with his ego and all, and I think watching paint dry valve have more entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear only one person to stand up and say, Â«Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent haircut." I see that he is not even trying to buy popularity in the fight against WWE. I hope it does not hurt, so I have no more to see his sorry face. It must be boring want fame so bad and have no talent ass and make yourself trying to buy it. I would give this show a negative sign, when I could, but it gets the 1, and he does not deserve.
