This movie was terrible and an insult to the viewer. Silly script, bad casting, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the current Hollywood tradition, the US government has shown, as always evil. Communist-sympathetic idiots in Hollywood, most of them are dumb as a box of rock, like taking a lone madman Eugene McCarthy and drawing him as the leader of a huge movement. The truth is that at that time he was considered a fringe character who exploited the legitimate concern of the Soviet Communists for political gain. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and the United States have brought all this evil fascist. Werner VonBraun, without which we would not have a space program. He really liked to be American and was a great asset to the country. <br /> <br /> Yet the irony is that the fools in Hollywood, uneducated, many lives the fantasy of existence, still believe that the government should work everything and give us everything we want. And yet, this is the same government that they are constantly portrayed as a complete evil in films like this.
