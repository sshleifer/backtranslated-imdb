I really wanted to like this film a lot more than I do. This is because I love the silly comedy foreign - especially strange ones that catch you by surprise. However, while this one is often caught me by surprise, they are almost never a pleasant surprise. It reminded me of South Park that almost every social norm was disrupted until the only ones left to broach were too ill to be funny. For example, after studying adultery, drug abuse (with almost every kind - from the pot, heroin, speed mold sniffing), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc., the film was a fun topic Pedophilia (?). Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about 12 years old) to sleep with the neighboring people. In fact, at some point in the film, she gives the boy to the dentist instead of paying for dental work! It's funny! You must be joking. This movie just goes too far and deep into the "black hole" of comedy. What they need to make fun of the next, cancer or tumors of the rectum?
