Do not knock Corman, it was very funny on The Carol Burnett Show. He was also good at playing supporting characters in films by Mel Brooks ( "High Anxiety" comes to mind). He, however, was not the man who can carry a movie in a duel role, no less. This one mainly "Gremlins" fake, following the tradition of films like "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It's not a very good fake, or at the same level as «Ghoulies», but with a much lighter tone to it, as it is no where near as dark as this film has received. In fact, this one is too light and frothy, and unfortunately, many of the jokes end up falling flat. Although I give it 3 at the expense, it's only because it's a film that's even worse, "Gremlins" fake. If you watched the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know who I mean ... the infamous "houses". This one has a boyfriend, finding the animal in some underground place (I've only seen the movie once a long time ago, so I do not remember everything clearly), and it starts quite friendly. Nevertheless, this creature is fast becoming unfriendly and, of course, more are generated and that it is a movie. More misses than showed in the department of a joke, and it is also very lame to see Korman plays the role of the evil brother. It is best to skip this one, but you can check it out just for kicks.
