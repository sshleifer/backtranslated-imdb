I've never read the book "Wrinkles of time". To be quite honest, after watching the movie, I want to do? Well, I should not be a review of this movie, I'll start with this. Next I will talk about that TV movie rather forgettable. Do you know why I say that right? Because I forgot what is happening in it. I told you that it is forgotten. Frankly, not a TV movie will never be better than the "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How to describe a TV movie? I have never written a review on one before. Well, I'll just say that they tend to have some celebrities. Fold time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has special effects cheese, gently interesting plot, the scenes that make you go «WTF». The film is incredibly bad, and it makes you go «WTF». What did I expect? This TV movie. They are usually not good. As this is one. Wrinkles in a waste of time and a great time waster. To top it off, you are likely to forget about it the second it was over. Well, maybe not the second over. . But within a few minutes <br /> <br /> folds during: * / ****
