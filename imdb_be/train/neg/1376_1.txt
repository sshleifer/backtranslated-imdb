Of all the films (and I am a graduate of the film, if it's worth anything to you), this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I know that there are probably some of the worst out there that I just have not seen it, but I have seen it, and it's the worst. A friend and I rented it for one night, because Denise Richards was on the cover. It's about a young and underdeveloped. She credits! Her role was incredibly small! As it does so on the cover? IMDb does not even list it in her filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a small note in the video store when we got back, and put it into the cabinet. He read something like "Please keep your future clients from having to view the full and very bad movie!"
