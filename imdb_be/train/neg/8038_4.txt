** SPOILERS ** Redicules slasher that does not make any sense at all with a killer running around dressed in a black robe and wearing what looks like a load of Peter Laurie rubber mask. Said at the beginning of the film, almost the very first scene, the young Beth Morgan was in rehab due to heavy drug use after her friend was killed in Tennyson Collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> He also brought FBI agent Sacker (in Jeff Conaway), which will get to catch the killer, the daughter was also killed in Tennyson at about the same time. By the time the film Â«Do You Wanna Know a secret" end is never explained, but the fact that these two murders so the Connecticute involved in the massacre in Florida some half a dozen students of the collage a year later? another that the killer, at least in the murder of one Beth wore the same stupid Halloween costume. <br /> <br /> On the spring vacation in the Sunshine State six students spend their vacation at the beach house, and before you know it, they start to get shot down one at a time. Starting with a computer geek Clyton Brad, Chad Allen, murder even spill over into the city with the number of people who have nothing to do with the target students, including Gavin police chief, Jack McGee, getting cut. <br /> <br /> masked killer saves beta in the past in this amazing desert ceremony in the church, that looks like the Everglades in Florida. Then he finally reveals who his intentions and that he who makes as much sense as the film does not. Trying to intimidate his audience all the movies do, confuse and embarrass him with a number of not very convincing chopper scenes. The most effective ones that have sacrificed Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, survived at least three attempts on his life, and ultimately, with the agent Saker, the hero in the film. <br /> <br /> Oz was also a vicious cut on this leg by a large shard of glass that is almost cut it in half and mutilated him, but later he miraculously recovered after being arrested for a murder he did not commit, in fact, he had another two-time killer with him as with a weak limp in his walk! It also does not make sense at all, why Oz and beta went independently to maneuver down and catch the killer, instead of calling the police, with a mobile phone that Oz was, instead? <br /> <br /> Beth's boyfriend, who loses his head over it, in the film Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is also very convincing, and the two girls on the beach house.They with Beth Oz ultimately the future victims of the killer and then somehow disappear from view! for a moment you do not know if they were actually killed at all, or if it's some kind of hallucination on the part of Oz or local police. Until the final scene outside-wall, where they were in church. HN <br /> <br /> We also get a glimpse of a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her drunk and acting bad, trying to get it on Hank as Beth goes without Hank and Tina did not even noticing it. This seemed to upset Beth even more than her boyfriend to be killed early in the film!
