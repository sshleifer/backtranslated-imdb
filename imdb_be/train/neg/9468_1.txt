The only good thing about this unfunny dreck, I do not have to pay for it. I saw it for free in college. And if a student can not find the humor in the fact that it was free, it was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Stale acting and poor jokes can not be disguised by the beautiful, but amazing scenography (which goes out of its way to market VOLKSWAGON Zhukov). I do not know what does Michaels Myers in this movie, but I had nothing more depressing seen. It was nothing more than an open effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (who has his opponent, but I enjoyed it very much). It's hard not to sit through this setback and wondering what the best projects have been transferred to finance it. <br /> <br /> You want a fun adaptation Susie? Go with the Grinch.
