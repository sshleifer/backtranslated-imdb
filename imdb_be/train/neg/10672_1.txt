He had all the clich√©s of films of this type, and the lack of substance. The plot did not go anywhere, and at the end of the movie, I felt like a sucker to view it. Production was good; However, the script and acting are the quality of B-movie. Casting was poor because they were good actors interspersed with lumps of actors. Good actors do not hold their own at the same time they do not bully others. <br /> <br /> This film is not worthy of a greater number of words, but I will speak more to meet the minimum requirements of the ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding Jr. to play the cartoons themselves in other films. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still would not recommend this movie.
