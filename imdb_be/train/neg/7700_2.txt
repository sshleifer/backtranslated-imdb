I saw the movie last night at home, but I thought it was too long in the first place. Secondly, what I saw in the movie was too out of the text, even though I thought it would be kind of comedy film, like the rest of this. The fact that it is not funny in the movie: fianc√© hitting his girlfriend, beating. The film was too long - to talk about wanting to go to sleep and I wonder when it will end, when you wake up and still he played! Some of the things on the reunion was too much to seize - a lady singing - I felt like I was watching almost spiritual songs of the show here! to come to Perry, you can do better than that!
