There will be times when the children have grown up without seeing the one and only Bugs Bunny Kiss (technical) another person, on the lips. There will be times when it will not be a duck or rabbit season. There will be times when Tazmanian Devil is dubbed politically incorrect. <br /> <br /> But so help me now is not the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, no one wants the version of "extreme", with our favorite Loony characters. Whoever it is marketing that comes with "Corn Nuts: Corn gone wrong" and "Extreme the Doritos" and, apparently, this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising, or that does not mean that they are aware of a jack children. <br /> <br /> I think that they are doing a disservice to the children, depriving them of one of the largest and most iconic shows of all time. This show disgusts me, and it is not only dated work or a terrible dialogue. They abuse the good speakers like Phil LaMarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Kandy is lovely, and many others. It lacks style, humor, character development, and most importantly, heart. <br /> <br /> In the show, as it is repackaged characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny) is a mere shadow of his former, timeless and beautiful itself.
