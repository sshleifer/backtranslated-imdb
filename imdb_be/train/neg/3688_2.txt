As usual, I went to watch this movie for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the film is not good. Rajni wanted to finish his career in cinema with this film he will be successful. But, fortunately or unfortunately, the film was a failure. After that, he put a hit with Chandramukhi. I look forward to advancing it forward Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I read the comments of other users on Razhne. I found it interesting, as a user of the TN too. Rajni is one actor who acts, I think his heart is not on his mind. He is not the actor's technique, like Kamal Haasan. I think we should appreciate Rajni its strong going on in his life. <br /> <br /> There is a way, I need to fill up to 10 lines to this comment ... so sorry you progress Rajni ...... .....
