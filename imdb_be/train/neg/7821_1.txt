It is possible that the filmmakers even see it before they released it? The script jumps from place to place, without giving much explanation. Start does not clarify when a prequel or not. It starts with the beginning of Superman on Earth, and then proceeds to a point after the last film - but do not actually alerts the viewer that. Very confusing! Superman himself is weak and in need of Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential home-wrecker, stalker, and someone who clearly overwhelmed and confused. This type of character rarely makes for an interesting character. The ending is ridiculous. Superman end up in the hospital I just wanted to kill him off. I'm seriously waiting for the SNL parody, where it appears Superman Sea Povich and Mori says. "The results - in the case of a child, Superman, you are the father," In summary - OK, acting on the Superman and Kevin Spacey, but scary scenario. The film is basically unwatchable.
