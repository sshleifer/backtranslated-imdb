It is not entirely a bad start for the program - but what a slap in the face of real law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that he is trying to present themselves as a reality fare - and nothing but. Men and women who dedicate their lives to the fulfillment of the laws deserve better than this. What's next, a medical school in a minute? Magic performing lipo? Grodin facilitating a hip replacement? Let them ... show some respect. Even citizens of Muncie are output in program formulation. Police Academy = High School Gym? Poor editing (how many times they can use a picture of the car by car from Taco Bell in the background?), Cheese siren effect (the same cycle of added classified ad nauseam that there rolling code each "call" or not), and in the past but not least - more questions security officer than you could shake a stick at <br /> <br /> If I want to see made police work and egghead fake cops, I would look RENO 911 ..
