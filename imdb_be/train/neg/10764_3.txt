I will give the writer / director William Gove loan to find someone to finance this ill-conceived "thriller". A good argument not to spend money by signing up for GB, not to mention your DVD-ROM drive through covers and advertisements. Pedestrian and Dennis Hopper play Richard Creek add anything substantial in their resume, even though the art direction is not half bad. Dialogue will leave you surprised to grimace on his self-esteem; This story is at its worst. A lot of tension, no stress, no fear, no fear, no pity, no catharsis, no nothing. Several attractive and often naked women cutting melancholy, but it's certainly the film is best viewed as a trailer. It is a pity the guy who green light this thing. Good for late night, zoned-out view only. You have been warned.
