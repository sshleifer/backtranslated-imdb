This film has a weak story, weak characterization and really weak special effects, I question why I lost my precious life, watching him. It has random characters that do not add anything to the story, and it seems like an excuse for the director to get his girlfriend in the movie. Robots boring and the main "hero" bot included a huge switch. If this film is not so bad, it would be funny, but not funny. The main antagonist is one of the few redeeming characters, and he was killed. It's sad, if you root for the bad guy, because he's the best one to cheer for. When all is said and done, this film was better left on the cutting room floor or never funded.
