Cannon pulled real visual beauty medieval epos, which is a fun (dragon for props, except). Now just how long-vanished studio known Chuck Norris movies ever to come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place? Case in point: amateurish actions and terrible story is a sign that a revival of the medieval legend is not a cure for some lousy execution. They actually went ahead and made another cheap exploitationer involving hundreds of lusty girls only, just to make this kind of better. For two "barbarian BrothersÂ», they sure know how to make strange noises, you become brave warriors so strong and brave enough to save his homeland. This is the single biggest waste of potential I saw from the "expensive" a low-budget film, and worse enough to strike an ax through excellent print without mercy. All this followed an advertising company that sells t-shirts on the basis of the barbarians! The film itself makes a great souvenir!
