Yes, you guessed it. Another film in which identical twins are reversed. I think that now, when the Olsen twins get older, they should try to make the story less predictable and less repetitive runs «Full House». If you want to see this movie, you do not need. Watches 'The Parent Trap' instead. It's more interesting.
