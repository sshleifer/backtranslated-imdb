I do not think any player in the history of Hollywood lasted as long as David Niven made taking into account the majority of weak movies that he had to bear the force of his incredible charisma. He could act, won an Oscar for it, but most of the stuff he did was as light as a single layer of tissue paper two layers. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is the case. This is music for the most part you will remember Vera-Ellen dances. Do you remember that they are in the Scot costume as the film is set in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can remember any of the songs from it you have to have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is light. Vera-Ellen is the leading American in the musical, which, apparently, is getting him out of town trial in Edinburgh. It starts in the choir and running late one day. She gets a lift from the driver of the king millionaire postcards. Now everything suggests that it is mainly squeezing millionaire. The doors open, they never opened before. <br /> <br /> Millionaire David Niven, and it goes along with it and the various situations that generated errors. Cesar Romero has some good moments here like a mad musical producer. <br /> <br /> In the end though Happy Go Lovely light and harmless fluff that David Niven did so much and was so tired of.
