Jon Heder was absolutely terrible in this film. I felt like I was watching a bad college small act for the first time in a student film. Anna Faris was in the order of things is not good, but did not get (plus it is nice). Diane Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only salvation in this movie (even though it was short-sighted, for its part, a). <br /> <br /> In general, I would avoid it at all costs. I'm just glad I did not pay to see it! <br /> <br /> Jon Heder forever stuck in the reduction of the role of "a child stupid," if he does not do serious work on his acting chops.
