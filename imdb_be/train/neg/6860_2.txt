for crazy people there, and there are religious nuts out there. <br /> <br /> The characters mostly have no meaning most of the time. <br /> <br /> The film has no real beginning, middle or the end, or do not explain much. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young man with an unlikely name Hazel specks, apparently returning from service in the army. <br /> <br /> He hitches ride a two-storey house, which is in extremely poor condition, the windows boarded over. He goes into the house, walking around, and finally writes a note that he leaves there. This scene comes to anything, and we did not know about the future house or its history. <br /> <br /> He never explained exactly whose house it is, or where people went, but we are given the impression Hazel probably lived at the same time. <br /> <br /> Yellow decides to go to the city. Why - we do not know. After he arrived in this city, he writes the name & address, which he sees on the bathroom wall, and goes to visit the woman, which is a surprisingly fat prostitute. He sees her for a while, and then he apparently no longer see her. Like everything else in this film we are talking about nothing and serves no purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch, trying to make friends with him, but Hazel is not really interested, though they continue to cross paths. <, Br /> <br /> Enoch is about as crazy as you can get. One of his habits, go to the zoo and to stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees and speak their offensive. <br /> <br /> We never know why Enoch to behave the way it does, or why Hazel behave as he does, for, of Hazel had overdosed old time scary, fundamentalist religion through his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Enoch later becomes infatuated with a man who dressed in a gorilla suit and manages to get a gorilla suit from him, and then runs it. <br /> <br /> hazel, which is wound tightly enough and seems to be in a constant borderline rage makes preaching the little street. I got the impression that he is trying to free themselves from the falsehood of religion, which was drilled in it. <br /> <br /> He has several meetings with the preacher and his daughter, while their interaction never make any particular point, and there is no storyline. <br /> <br /> eventually faint yellow to end religious and starts causing harm to themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a very strange film. The interesting thing about this oddity, but other than that he has absolutely nothing going for it. <br /> <br /> cast does an excellent job, but this film is completely unable to put a point of view or the storyline. <, Br /> <br /> The film also has characters, throwing around the N words from time to time without being connected to the rest of the dialog box. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
