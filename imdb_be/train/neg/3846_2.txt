W. Somerset Maugham Of Human Bondage must be English classic. If so, how many were missing versions of the film here. (Leslie Howard) attraction to Philip Mildred (Bette Davis) is so completely inexplicable how to make a script, it seems, after the collapse of the statement of relationship with the male point of view. As a family lawyer, I have heard many such accounts; man portrays himself as a noble and always correct, but the woman is the varmints that had no other purpose than to exploit the people. <br /> <br /> In fact, if a person is not ready to laugh at the social assumptions cinematographer, it's uncomfortable to watch a movie. Philip even indulges Mildred, when she brings a child of uncertain paternity, but the real high point comes when Philip allows Mildred - furious and now questionable sanity - free path of his apartment, with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for five years of her life, but this time did not happen here. In fact, by the end of the film, she appears as a symbol of Baby Jane, she will play in thirty years. <br /> <br /> I note how the Howard character always impeccably dressed and groomed. He tells me that Philip longs for middle-class respectability. Someone loves, he could not run away from a woman with a cockney accent course fast enough. Philip, most of the film, the student; such a man would be more believable if he was younger, had a disheveled appearance that benefit low income and low self-esteem that often accompanies student status - English Dissenters, as it will be. And balance that by allowing Mildred modicum of charm.
