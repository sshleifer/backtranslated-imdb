This God gave the film three stupid millionaires who collect a bunch of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, acting is terrible and the movie makes absolutely no sense. It's not scary in the least, it is so stupid that it made me laugh, because he earned that 1 star.The film is not violent at all, but rather sloppy and focuses primarily on women's breasts all the time, and some of the characters is very annoying and whiny. In addition, this film is so bad monsters and fake and not terrible, it just makes you want to throw something at the screen. And last but not least, the ending is terrible. I do not want to give it, if you are actually quite strange to see this piece of junk. Avoid at all costs !!!!! <br /> <br /> Or not rated (But there must be R) for nudity, abusive and Mild Gore.
