If you expect to see a lot in Altıoklar bath, as promised by the slogan, you will be very disappointed that the film consists of nothing but a populist Altıoklar style on the most well-known problems, such as sex, marriage and cheating. To a lot of nudity, which seems to appear out of nowhere and has no relation to the story or even proves that Altıoklar was unsuccessful "try something new", he quoted. To a lot of sex jokes centered it seems to show that Altıoklar fell to a famous saying, which is "sex sells". I was hoping to see a very good story with a very good narrative technique. But in the end I sat down for 90 minutes and watch Altıoklar Experimental still a lot of focus on popularism work.
