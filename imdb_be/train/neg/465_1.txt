When I was in a movie store the other day, I went up Blonde and Blonder, but something about it just seemed like it could be a nice movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure that most people hit Romy and Michelle, before they saw him, the blond Blonder could have just been another secret treasure, which was accepted. But when I started to watch it: The executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew that something terrible. Not only that, but also that were considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, so as not to offend them, but they did not age well at all, and they play a role, which I think were more designed for women who it is assumed that in their 20s rather than their 40s. The story was just a bad and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> And Don your stupid of stereotypical blonde, they really do not have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world, it's just really boring. But when the girl somehow mistaken for murderers murder, police on their tale and actually calling the girls geniuses because of their "ignorance is bliss" attitude. They are designed to make the "hit" to the guys, and they think that they are just going to "show him a good time," but the real killer is designated and wants the case to kill a girl. <, Br /> <br /> Denise and Pei just look very uncomfortable on the screen, and almost like they read the script the day before. I know that it must have been a stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, he went to the unpleasant and simply unnecessary. Will I ever recommend it? Not in a million years, the girls just at that moment, trying to preserve its status as a "sex kitten", but rather a sign of desperation and a huge blonde and Blonder Blonde. <br /> <br /> 1/10
