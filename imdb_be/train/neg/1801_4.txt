Istanbul is one of those movies that expatriates Errol Flynn did in the last decade of his life, trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the IRS. This is a remake of Fred MacMurray- Ava Gardner Singapore ten years ago. <br /> <br /> In contrast studio product, Istanbul has the advantage of a large cinema location in front of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was aging exponentially front of the camera in each film was too old to play these types of action / adventure more. His scenes of Cornell Borchers really lacks conviction. <br /> <br /> As for Cornell, she plays a former lover Errol, who through the trauma of escape from fire now has amnesia. She does not remember, Errol and now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol got some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer, which appear after a few diamonds that come into his possession. It is necessary to deal with them. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Most people today do not realize that Cole was an experienced jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer. In fact, he was the first pianist, singing was secondary. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure film for those who are proponents of this kind of cinema.
