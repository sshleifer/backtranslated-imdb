"The Curse of Frankenstein" sticks faithfully the story of Mary Shelley in a single word in the title, which would not be so bad if the changes have been of any use. Tragedy creatures destructive Frankenstein family was completely excised and replaced by ... nothing. Heart and moral center of history gone. It does not help that this is Frankenstein conniving, treacherous murderer; He deserves everything he gets. The plot is mainly shallow checklist Frankenstein clich√©. Even taken on its own terms, this is nonsense: soft, ungainly film shit look like creatures from a pudding bowl haircut. As this is the first of the horror films of Hammer, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in the history of horror is safe. But this shit.
