This film probably had some potential for something; my surprise, these completely unfunny prosaic themes continue to do that in a movie theater, it's as if the ideas are processed only because generations. Indeed decerebrate patients behind most movies, like dogs, they are returning to swallow his own vomit. Well, they're 19 bucks richer now because of me. It was not at all imaginative, there was no redemptive moment, anything remotely funny it was shown in the trailer (and nothing was funny in the trailer), performances have been stretched (especially Molly, completely unconvincing). What was theoretically should somehow be homoerotic comic was one with a penchant for Disney movies; none of its analogues has not got home, his little moral speeches were flat, I just wait until they go on to say something significant, only to find that it was made. So-called "hard 10" is the plastic substance is stale (except the presence of horse, as a person with surprising smile); I honestly found my friend Patty (called Hamburglar) is much better looking than her. But then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is shallow, and if love is probably it is beyond all social fronts; they have shown that this is a strange dude shaving the scrotum and a million times, mutilated, and beaten to death skate routine premature ejaculation (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latest in a disgusting scene junction with the family dog). I feel as if the film was both fitting funny jokes unformed miserable ball of raw sewage. Goes to show marketing can push anything there, shine any stinking mass and call it gold, people will come (worked for me). Fully tirade.
