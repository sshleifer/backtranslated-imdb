It was it meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? The film begins with a light-hearted banter between the three women. All right. It moves in the conflict between women, when one of them meets a man. All right. There are a few tricks in between. All right. But if the plot thickens, and finally turns black, I began to wonder if I was misinterpreted by the first part of the film. He's still in this vein for some time, until, in the end, she tries to return to the original lighthearted banter. But now it's too late. It is difficult to understand why these women will continue to talk to each other and the final unconvincing. Indeed lesson (for British filmmakers anyway), they do not make movies. It is difficult to understand how the manufacturers never convinced themselves this film will work. And cash has proved it to be a real failure because I have never heard of this movie before this weekend (four years after its release).
