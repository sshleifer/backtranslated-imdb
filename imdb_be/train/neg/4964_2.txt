This film is a farce! Names highly distorted, and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable any literature enthusiasts. And they have the audacity to give Beowulf funny guns / crossbow weapons. Beowulf is not necessary weapon like this! In the poem, he tears off Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And I can not believe that the writers have done such a thing. Grendel is portrayed the way impressive, however. This and the actors are only positive points of the function. My English teacher would go mad if she saw this mess. If you are not a die-hard fan of "Beowulf" epic avoid this film at all costs. And even then, I would not recommend it.
