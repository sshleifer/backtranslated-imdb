<br /> <br /> Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is a "parody" of bad monster movies, which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs. (Very poor) The story tells of tomatoes, which are a rebellion against those who treat them badly. Basically, they spin and growl (yes, they growl), and the next thing you know, a man covered in ketchup. No name actors who have never made a film after this, so that there would be no reason to call them. There's the guy who hired by the government to try to stop the threat to the tomatoes. It is accompanied by a black guy who is a master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. Anyway, there is another woman who spies on the first guy who works for the government. if it does not make much sense to you, you understand. This film would never have been not very good at first, but it does not even have the pleasure to laugh at silly attack scene. The film is terribly cheezy, which, while being the whole point, is really very painful, it may have been (wisely) an entertaining movie. At some point, a giant tomato wax "slides" of unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it! Maybe, I would recommend the movie if it is to have a nice value of the camp, but even that is not enough of this terrible film. 2/10
