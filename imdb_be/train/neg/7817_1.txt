in the beginning I was happy to learn about the new Superman movie, I though it would be great, but it was not. <br /> <br /> is a bad copy of the work of Richard Donner, Lex again the villain, who is no more than another, even played Kevin spices. <br /> <br /> evil plan of a first film Donner just a lot of enforcement. <br /> <br /> script is predictable and easy (all things Luthor is in the museum or the old lady). <br /> <br /> history is not something that should be a Kevin Smith script and maybe it could be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the continuation without Bryan Singer and the new director of talent to make something new, and not a copy. <br /> <br /> all read later
