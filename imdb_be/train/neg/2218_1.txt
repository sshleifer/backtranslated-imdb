I admit that my review from 2006 point of view, almost 30 years after the creation of this film, and at the time of its conception, it can be a brilliant horror / thriller film. <br /> <br /> starting on Halloween night 1968, 6-year-old Michael commits a brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael seeks a psychiatric hospital and after 15 years of escapes and returns to his hometown to kill again. <br /> <br /> From this point it is clear that the film will follow the basic and elementary way, which is very predictable, beginning of each scene easily predictable, it ends while the music for each episode with Michael (killer ) in the same way throughout the film, thereby preventing the viewer probable events to follow. <br /> <br /> for a horror / thriller enthusiasts, there is an urgent blood / gore shortage compared with today's films, although I do not like the amount displayed in this day and age. Happier between could be found. <br /> <br /> On the half-hour movie, not one scene unexpectedly. We act for a horror / thriller is fairly typical of the era and, therefore, lacks any punch for today's enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> Positive for the film it is stored camera images and dark lighting, which creates a chilling atmosphere. The second positive is the nature of Michael's doctor who gives the keys to the probability of where the story may lead. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the star Jamie Lee Curtis is in the infancy stages of her acting career and is therefore not able to provide really scared the central sacrifice. <br /> <br /> it's hard for me to evaluate this film, as it was in his time, but also from other horror / thriller movies really 80 years and to a lesser extent, the 90s, it has lagged far behind from the truly great horror / thriller film. <br /> <br /> I suggest you move on and find classics from the '80s. Hooray!
