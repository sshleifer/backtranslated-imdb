In my humble opinion, this version of the big musical BDWY there are only two things going for it - Tyne Daly, and the fact that there is now charged with the original version of the script. (OK Vanessa Williams a good look.) But it's all there for me. Most of the actors seem to go through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim is really not surprising that people are not fit Harry McAfee, where he played George Wendt, who looks like he would prefer to return to the bar chair Boston, Jason Alexander is passable, but the wig to go, and I've seen better dancing in Bugsy Malone. As I have said, it is good to have a version of the script stage, but I hope that young out there who have never seen a musical, do not judge them all this.
