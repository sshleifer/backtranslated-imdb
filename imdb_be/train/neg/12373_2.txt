The script is so ridiculous ... so it, in turn, makes the actors' lines appear rigid and unrealistic and does not believe. There is a repetition of phrases. - "my dear little god daughter" and minor variations on this line that comes to mind ... and that's just sloppy soap opera dialogue <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the music is so wrong! In addition, the main blues "theme" terribly strange and totally wrong for this. And he feels abused mainly because equipment, texture and placement of this theme never changes, even if the emotional context of the scene does. <br /> <br /> Further, if it is, it is sticking out like a sore thumb as core. the transition from one scene to another <br /> <br /> music is banal, and it is as if the author wrote the music for the soap or sitcom - a low budget 80 Canadian sitcom that - and it makes him feel, as if we were always on the verge of throwing in advertising. <br /> <br /> so miscast, there are a lot of replays, and it's a real stretch, that many of these characters using only one type of the New York accent - a thick Bronx accent. I do not know if this is the issue of the limited capacity of the actors in knowing only * one * NY accent - or whether it is a question of the director's ability to notice a glaring anomaly <br /> <br /> Q. end, an amateur script with him lead lines, which makes this whole "film" ... a blow. If any foundation fragile and unstable, it is not possible to build on it without its flaws put exponentially damaging and unflattering ways.
