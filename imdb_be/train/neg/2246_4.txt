I've never seen the original version of the 1954 Judy Garland, therefore, do not have comparison means. In addition, it was a few years old, but I found the story not exciting, nor his novel is captivating. The film tells the story of two lovers, whose musical career is moving in opposite directions. John Norman Howard worn, disillusioned rock star on the decline, starting to songs with a new, talented singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. Its dramatic success only serves to emphasize its decline. <br /> <br /> The leading actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, adequate in their roles, but neither they nor chemistry plot leaves much to sign me. The film is remarkable to me is just one aspect, a beautiful performance of Streisand Oscar winning «Evergreen» song. She really has a powerful and beautiful voice.
