This should not come as a shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie. Simply put, it's like dung defecated monster ate the result, and then vomited. The final product will continue to overshadow the film. <br /> <br /> It would seem, based on the old (!) video games Otar, the film has something or other to do with the portal in the bowels of the earth, unleashing demons and ancient civilizations. Something about the existence of two worlds, that of darkness and light. (Guess which one is ours.) Yes, and 10,000 years ago, really super-duper advanced civilization opened a portal, the demons came up and there was an explosion, and then destroyed the civilization. That is why we have never heard of them, quite convenient. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater, perhaps, misses the days of Heathers and pump up the volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher, to whom something bad happened when he was 10 years old. He is hot on the trail of one of the mentioned artifacts of an advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret facility called 713, which is trying to find out what happened to that old civilization. Carnby but assumed he was not going to be able to find the answers he was looking for, so he left the band. <br /> <br /> But to see the Beasties came out, and they get their prey of different ways, such as gutting them, dividing them in half, introducing neurological control device in them, or just turning them into zombie killing. Yes, it's another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> This is about as distilled I can make a plot. This is a fairly complicated and incomprehensible. In these films you can see the intrepid explorer / adventurer understand things a step at a time, and if we mentally audience with the researcher, this is a lot of fun. But if the scene goes from attack to attack, without perspective or context ... not so much fun. <br /> <br /> To act badly, except for Slater, who (although he seems almost a shame to be in the film) showed that he was able to carry the load. He had to; get this - Tara Reid cast as a museum curator! Honestly, I thought I saw a casting for a lifetime, when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist, Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here corresponds to Richards, crappy emoting emoting for the poor. Hightlights include Reid pronunciation "Newfoundland", as the "New Fownd ground," Reid delivery of most of its line of semi-conscious guttural monotone (kind of like she was on all night drinking binge for the last week before the shooting), Reed - a museum curator, mind you - spend a lot of movie through the abdomen and bring the top hip-Hugger jeans. Oh yeah, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson gives stock quotes. Oh, why must they be so pretty stupid? (Note: I do not think that Tara Reid everything looks good, it looks as if it is in constant need of food.). Almost everyone else in the cast completely forgotten, except perhaps Stephen Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders with 713 character Dorff was not terribly well developed, but nothing in the film was not with sets of characters in Reed container. But I digress <br /> <br /> Anyway, confused and completely ridiculous plot pretty tough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but the director Uwe Boll throws in the bombardment, the mind-deadening soundtrack. it is so loud you can not hear what the actors are saying in some scenes! It can not be right. Given the level of action, however, perhaps because in the order of Mr. Boll. <br /> <br /> Yes, and a merry note. Introductory moments of the film include a story ... a word that crawl on the screen simultaneously. Remember the first Star Wars? You've heard that now familiar Star Wars theme while prologue crawled. There was not, of course, there is no need in the narrative; Why do I need some Doofus read what is on the screen for me? Producers were just looking at people who are blind? Perhaps that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they, too, peering hard of hearing people. Furthermore, the narrator was inexplicably lisp during the first few lines of the crawl - the lost. Bizarre. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark loud, sluggish mishmash of hardcore action, awkward script and clumsy directing. It is unlikely that the note rings true. There's so much chaos that the public simply refuses to care about the characters and root for their demise. Even in the dark, demonic creatures seem colder and much more developed in comparison. <br /> <br /> Strangely, because there were only three other people in the theater, I saw this one in the dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll had planned it that way? I can not give enough, the lowest rating because I had low hopes to start with - and because he never grabbed me enough for me to start up about it. It's disgusting, but Slater redeems himself slightly.
