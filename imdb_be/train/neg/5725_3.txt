2005 gave us a very decent Â«Gore porn" Hostel flowlines and 2006, gave us a live feed; plagiarism is not as decent Hostel. Buzz is worth largely the same formula as before Eli Roth movie, except this time the stupid kids are in Asia, not Central Europe. The plot focuses on those stupid kids, and one of them irritates one of the locals that they were in trouble. The locals decided to lock them in the theater, and kill them. While I've heard some less than favorable things about this film before you see it, I'm still hoping that it may be at least half decent, because the director Ryan Nicholson had previously made a very decent 45 minutes of rape and revenge movie "burned" but this film falls simply because most of them are either funny or sad. The film is clearly trying to get back to the good old days of movie Grindhouse (which did Hostel, successfully), but it does not really come off. Strangely, given the previous work of Nicholson in special effects - not even blood is impressive ... but it is much better than to act! There's not much else to say about this movie ... this is bad, and not in a good way. Avoid this!
