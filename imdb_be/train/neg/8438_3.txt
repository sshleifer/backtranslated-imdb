I believe bad Laurel and Hardy is better than not Laurel and Hardy at all, but only slightly. It's sad that Fox movies are the ones that get a big release on DVD, autopsied people who may not be too familiar with the L & H until February of things, rather than the classic comedy. <br /> <br /> Once again the boys saddled with dumb romantic story about the guy who invented the invisible beam. He is in love with the daughter of the bosses who hate it and prefer some clever guy. It is incredible to think that genius Fox thought is that L & H must be in their films. <br /> <br /> Without them, pancake makeup boys look tired and old. Only scenes that work for them in this picture, as they try to escape from the bedroom window at night and rather strange scene where Robert Mitchum, being a classic noir bad guy trying to sell Oliver Hardy Â«Insurance" on Stan. <, Br /> <br /> Otherwise, this scenario is just a mess. Forget it and see if you can find a copy of the "fool in Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
