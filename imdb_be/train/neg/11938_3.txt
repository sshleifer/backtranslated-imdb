The film started well enough. It was a guy get knocked glows green meteorite getting superpower (telekinesis, X-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, the ability to speak with dogs, SuperSpeed, heat vision and the ability to make plants grow big and fast), and the fight against crime. From that point on it all down. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man gets a costume from her mother, struggling with gang residents, and has many aborted meetings with the leaders of the gang, which is used to set you up for disappointment, overlong and intoxicating ending. <br /> <br /> This would not be so great to bad, if not want to watch a boxing match, where two soldiers pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking ahead while the fighters just keep dancing. <br /> <br /> In spite of all this nonsense film has good moments. It clearly states that if you are trying to take over the gang alone, that they will come back to your house and hurt you. It says that the gangs and the community need to see their real enemy (the big bosses, who use them for their own purposes, to crush the honest people in the existence of the ghetto). He also argues that people do not need superheroes when they are ready to work as a community to really destroy predators that harm them. The only message, it really is not enough, so that voters should ensure their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush H.W.) are not crooks too. <br /> <br />
