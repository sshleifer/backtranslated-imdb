That dog from the movie. Hazelhurst Nonite performance is pretty good, but he is sitting in the middle of the jungle disgusting writers mediocre direction and wood action from the main mass of actors. Many of the characters woefully miscast, especially if overestimate Colin Frels. <br /> <br /> There are very few works in this pretentious rubbish. Most of the "character development" implemented through silly angst-ridden sound and often completely contrary to the behavior of the characters on the screen. In fact, it's hard to even know who the voice-over saying, because they describe such different characters that we see on the screen! As we meant to know Colin Frels (Javo) is assigned to be unstable, unreliable and hard drug addict? One of those stupid voice-over tells us. To call loudly, the nature of his character halfway point of the movie, and the only thing that allows us to know, is a Flippin voice-overs! The real killer characters. All of them. Their clothes are beautifully maintained and look fresh from the rack, even though we are constantly reminded they are intended to be pretentious poor. They all speak good absurdity "addict." It seems that no one has any real understanding of life on a sled or taste, and yet it means that in the case of most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Power does not deserve more attention than weekday television film Matinee. Crud as, well shot and technically represented, but clich√©-driven angsty drama that shoots so broad to be believable and meanders around for a few hours is not really going anywhere. At least Noni gets down to her birthday suit in every given opportunity. There is no other rational reason to tolerate this garbage.
