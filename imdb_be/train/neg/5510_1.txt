Rodney Dangerfield Sun protagonist of this film. He barely in it. Most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny joke. One running gag that the character named masturbate. There are also many erection joke, where someone has a zest erection. This film is so ridiculous as the British accent Kirstie Alley convincingly <br /> <br /> This film began as a weak fighter :. Five minutes of history, and then bam! Unfunny joke. But apart from the terrible letter, the film is directed too bad and terrible action. In addition, this film does the old bad comedy clich√©s have a lot of well-known actor B-movie. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid, and Phil La March are just some of the people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, despite the fact that he was exposed as the protagonist. Do not be surprised to find this film to the drugstore sells for five dollars. Even that is too much.
