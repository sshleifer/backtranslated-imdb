Almost as tedious to watch, as it was read, the evening is a great relinquished ... until Meryl Streep does not go quietly reveals her other actors how to operate this kind of thing. Vanessa Redgrave shocking by its role as a dying Ann and Claire Danes is a cipher. Maybe when Vanessa and Claire exchanged roles, we could see the dynamism of young Anne, who gave her go into the rarefied world of the story, and we could imagine that actually older than Anne die. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the addition of Cunningham to write the loans will smooth out the nervous story, but alas. It gave me a headache.
