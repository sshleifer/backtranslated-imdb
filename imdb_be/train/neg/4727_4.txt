This film is really something egg vicar, good in parts. Unlike other reviewers, I found that the main fault with it is its inability to attract viewer interest in the characters and the plot. I sat through it, because I was interested in rock 'n' and the dynamics of groups, but if I had to rate it based solely on its merits as a film, I would give it a thumbs down, a few warnings: Jason Behr is good in parts John Livien, and quite convincing as a rock singer; the story of his childhood trauma is not clear, although we are given hints of well-acted Livien relationship to his parents, but his behavior is ultimately strange to the audience (it should not be). Nevertheless, the idea of ​​using the stage image for the solution of internal conflicts is interesting, though not new and not fully explored as a theme in this film. Mention John Lennon was annoying, but I confess that I do not advocate Beatles. Anyway, Livien and his band Oasis is an reminded me more, than the Beatles, in the sense that there was something a derivative of them. Another distressing thing about the film was a way to open it with some interesting - although the man in the street and middle school level - philosophical reflections about the main character, but left the thread of his thought there only to pick them up again in the middle of the film is very short, if Livien says, "before God was music "(ever seen that ad for Tia Maria in the 1990s," till the time was the Tia Maria "This is something that came to mind anyway?); it seems idiotic conclusion, and the audience has no idea how he reached him, but he has that right. Fortunately, his bass player and one could play Dominic Monaghan, he seems to recognize the fallacy of this thinking when he says: "You do not know that." <br /> <br /> In general, limited by strong lines and the plot can go either way for future projects that meaningless platitudes or interesting and more mature point of view.
