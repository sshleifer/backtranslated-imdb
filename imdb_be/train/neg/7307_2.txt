This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. Events in it quite by accident and make little or no sense. The fact that there is a continuation of the so sickening I can come down with a case of irritability (I'M SO SORRY). I describe it as a mistake being smooshed in the newspaper, because that seems to be different parts of things mixed together. Kevin eg pancakes loves karate kid just awful strange in itself, that is the police, which is a bit strange and abnormal, the drug addict, that is, the fact that they attack some random guy who obviously needs help. then suddenly the protagonist has sex with his girlfriend friends just because she says something stupid about the plane going down. at the end of some good old family should racism rabbit that runs on Kevin karate kid. Its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film. There's no reason for those who like this film, if you do not like Eli Roth, even that does not make me like this film. Hatred strong word, but seeing as it is the only word that I'm allowed to use it will have to do. Boycott Fever 2 !!!!!
