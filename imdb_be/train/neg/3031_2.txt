Tony Scott destroys anything that might be interested in the cliché, spotted, overwrought screenplay by Richard Kelly. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) model was rushed and became a bounty hunter. This is her story ... "like." <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage, that there is not much of a story at all, and extreme graphic stylization Scott each shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in the chaotic life of Harvey. <br /> <br /> You just do not care about Harvey. Knightley plays her as an unpleasant, cynical apron, which has done nothing to warrant our respect. She strikes a man whom she does not love, and shed her clothes and inhibitions, if the situation requires it, but she was not real and Knights is no convincing either. <br /> <br /> film boring. It's loud, too, and irons with one of the most annoying source of sheet music I've heard in a long time. The last twenty minutes are poor restart with «True Romance» Scott climax with a gang of Domino's going to meet two sets of adversaries of bad guys, who - surprise! surprise! - destined to shoot each other in the upper part of the Las Vegas casino <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially exciting fire completely failed Scott, and becomes confused, pretentious, pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. It's not artistically daring or experimental sample; it is a failure at every level, because it does not give us an entry point for life and dilemmas of his characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good as a gray-haired hunter, but he disappears in the background as a "story" is progressing. Chris Walken turns into another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman, always solid, underutilized. <br / > <br /> Do not be fooled by a multi-layer, stunt-ridden surface of the film. It's not still a turd no matter how much you polish.
