I give this film 3 as worse than cult films that deserve a proper 2. It does not make sense to you? Well, it is not necessary. This is another vampire movie with a silly plot, no, let me rephrase that, incredibly stupid plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) battle in the space race Moron vampires. <br /> <br /> it get any uglier than this? The only good thing about this film was Natassia Malthe, with her stunning beauty of Norway. God, I want Michael Ironside and DeLuise brothers would stop taking dumb roles in silent films! I mean, at least, SeaQuest was nice! I know that Mr. Ironside of the many films he has acted in 164 films in the day !! It is true that it is rare in the lead role, but still!
