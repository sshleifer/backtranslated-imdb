Lamas star, like some type of a CIA agent who captures the beauty of an exotic name Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and made her fight for his former employer. O.J Simpson also on board to ensure confidence in the shooting range of the current is not as talented ensemble. I must admit, I am not a supporter of Lorenzo Lamas and his films. He stinks. However, compared with O.J Simpson and comatose wife llamas Kinmont, llamas seem to ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I just saw the CIA because of the renewed interest around the court O.J Simpson, you see, because if your parents had cable and additional channels, you could not avoid this movie. in 1994, you could go in the Amish community and some moron would have this game in their portable TV. The film itself is a set of sequences of actions and the lame will intrigue, although the value of shock O.J Simpson jumps after cars and ships exchange will provide some unintentional humor. In addition, where there were Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make a complete camp classic? <br /> <br /> * with 4- (Bad)
