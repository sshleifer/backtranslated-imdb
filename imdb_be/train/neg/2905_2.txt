Expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to see this film, in the end, I thought that Steve Carell could do nothing wrong looking great films as Anchorman, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong <br /> <br /> I will start with what is right, and with this film :. At certain points, Steve Carell Steve Carell is allowed to be. There are some moments in the film that made me laugh, and that's due almost entirely to him to be given a wiggle-room to do their job. He is undoubtedly a talented man, and it's a shame that it has signed a contract that turned out, in my opinion, the general train-wreck. <br /> <br /> With this out of the way, I will discuss what went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls, who are currently under consideration in the nationally syndicated advice column. He prepares the girls to family reunification, where his extended family gather for some time with each other. <br /> <br /> The family is high on the top of the list of things that make this a terrible film. No family does not behave like this. It's almost as if they were transported from Pleasantville, or leave it to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we believe, what a family, when we 7. It reaches a point where they become unpleasant and simple care. Touch football, crossword competitions, bowling and family talent show not as actual PEOPLE THEMSELVES. It's almost sickening. <br /> <br /> Another big drawback is that a woman should fall to Karel. Watching her in the first scene with Steve Carell, like watching a stroke victim, trying to rehabilitate. What I believe to be unique and original in this woman comes off as slightly slowing down. <br /> <br /> It makes me think that this film takes place on a different planet. I left the theater wondering what I just saw. Thinking further, I do not think it was much.
