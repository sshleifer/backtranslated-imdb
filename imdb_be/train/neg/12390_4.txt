Looking highly censored version of the film on television years ago, I was interested to see how the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more believable and well acted, than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think the other reviewers have already talked about it, and, in particular, that it is the nature and motivation of the character Chris Sarandon? Had he raped the victim before others? Is he completely psychotic, or "average" sociopath? As he waited to walk away from his attack on her younger sister? Is this character at all credible, or is it simply a matter of great background is necessary? He seems to be almost the same time uncomfortably plausible character, and too crazy to actually be able to hold a teaching job, which puts him in contact with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint of viewers as a whole. It has nothing to do with his work, which is terribly convincing.The film occupies an uneasy position between pure exploitation and halfway serious treatment of the subject, it is not to get in any mode. Not the worst movie ever made, but not all that well, either.
