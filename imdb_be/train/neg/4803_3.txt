Adrian should really get a life-without g «Brady». It nauseated me, and was one of the main reasons why I know the longer tune in to the show. It's pretty stupid show, and every little argument or disagreement, it seems, put the scope and analyzed to death. It makes them look / sound they are anything but ready for marriage, and yet, I know that these differences are part of life. I believe that it is fun for some people. If it happens to get into the next season, I feel sorry for those who have nothing better to do with their lives, but watch this garbage. Although I was not very surprised. He can not even stand the commercials for this show anymore! I hope they get enough money to constantly embarrass yourself in front of the camera, week after week. However, "A" girl has a hell of a big ass!
