box cover makes this movie look really good, do not be fooled. University splash came in 1984, which was the last good year of terror, but this movie sucks. characters are so annoying. Only a teacher, it's great. there is no plot in this film, which is hell, ever to produce these films waste? <br /> <br /> spoilers ahead <br /> <br /> Teacher dies in it, and it was a woman, we all know that we need to have female survived, if you're going to break the rules make it a good horror flick Do not waste it
