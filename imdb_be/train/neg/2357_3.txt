Let us hope that this is the last nightmare. This incarnation of the good things soured. Well, there is some fun to be had, but only in the earthly sense. Talal was there for this franchise, has been on the production staff and made even. I do not know what she was thinking, but this fiasco comes with a human boy of video games and the visitors' <br /> <br /> Tom and Ryazanov Arnold! I wish I knew what she was thinking when she wrote / directed this piece of garbage disappointment. She even tried to distract her from the audience that this film was nothing more than over-glorified popcorn movies instead bear any resemblance to the horror, with far-fetched using 3D end. Are these glasses graceful? And you get to keep them! This is the equivalent, you just spent $ 9.00 makes me rich. That's 10 cents. Now, you do not feel special? Sorry, but it just did not make me feel very special for me. <br /> <br /> And Freddie had another facelift. This one was the worst, I think. All the beautiful artistry that went into his "look" in the earlier films was replaced obviously cheaper, less detailed set of prosthetics. He looks ... less burn victim it should be, and more than that he has a skin disease. Lead change makeup like that so far in the series at approximately the same level as the change of lead actor. But wait! They did it, and did it. Thus, I believe that it does not matter. But it mattered to me. Sun Freddy longer scary. He just ... another low rent monster like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... dark comedy than a horror classic, this series promises; It permeated with the fact that you can only hope the authors thought was witty one liners and clever resourcefulness (unfortunately, this is not justified on both accounts). <br /> <br /> So, there is nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh, because I was not scared one or anxious moment throughout the film. <br /> <br /> It is the rate of 3.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
