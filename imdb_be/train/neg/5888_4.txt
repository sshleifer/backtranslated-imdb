I saw it recently on a faded old videotape, and remembered vaguely. Looking at it now, it seems magical. <br /> <br /> When it was first released, it was found in pretty much everything, like a parody comes out as a gay teenager. To drive the point home, the mother seen reading a paperback copy of "one teenager in the 10 ', the most popular book of the time out. David Warner ham it as a vampire hunter pursues [= gay-hating evangelist], which, of course, a wardrobe case, self-loathing. List of gags and jokes that were included to make sure that nobody missed the point it would be too long to go into. Producers who have some kind of good-natured fun, and in the hope, no doubt, to lighten up, as well as enlighten. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea, as a teenager, the audience will be looking at this film now, in some places, where there is education and culture, terrible torments that homosexual teenagers had to go through this thing from the past. But I'm sure there are a lot of dark, nasty corners of the continent, where it is as bad as it has always been.
