I totally agree with the review by the reviewer Variety, the film is never as funny, lively and insightful about the creative process as it is a prerequisite, it would seem to justify. The plot is dirty and the lighting is really problematic. If the film is to be the nature of poor lighting initiative does not contribute to the current, and sometimes it is difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty in following the English spoken in the film, and some of the local humor would be lost in the process. I watched the film in Cape Town World Cinema Festival last year. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and neglect in the welcome departure from our painful past films. Unfortunately, Bath Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of South Africa, New Wave, but some of the great movies of our history of apartheid will truly our ranking among the best in our 110-year history of the old film. Not surprisingly, the film disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town, just two weeks after his release, and the majority of cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. He clearly limited appeal among the South African audience.
