Well, what can you say about the adaptation of Barbara Cartland? <br /> <br /> There are some amazing actors in it (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they are clearly the timing of their money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared in two other epics Cartland. - Anthony Hugh Grant (who looks suitably embarrassed) and Gilbert and Helen Bonham Carter <br /> <br /> If you really want to see "watchable" adaptation Cartland, then Bonham Carter one is the one to go on ( "A Hazard of hearts" - that title !!) Gilbert is a weak link in this, but Bonham Carter suitably beautiful and, of course, can actually act, and the other actors playing his grip tongue firmly in cheek. (Edward Fox and Diana Rigg)
