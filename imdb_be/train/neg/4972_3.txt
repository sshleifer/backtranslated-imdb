Hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: bad acting, bad acoustics of various parts, bad CGI, unsuitable kits for the period, a bad script. It would be nice if the script was the original story a little closer -. There's enough voltage and good stuff in Beowulf, to provide more good stuff, and better storyline than the writers could come up with <br /> <br /> Why introduce amazing new weapons like the crossbow, triggering explosive bolts? <br /> <br /> I can see that this film was made in "only" 21 days. This indicates the absence of quality. I'm starting to think it at all (bad) attitude taken by the Sci-Fi Channel (and others) when it comes to creating movies from classic fairy tales in the past few years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
