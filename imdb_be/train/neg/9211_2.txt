This film reminds me of the anti-drug films 50s and 60s due to the fact that this was done by people who obviously have never experienced a social evil that they warn us about. Tom Hanks and his friends to "role play", but no bones, lots of candles, and then you just wiped out a bad installation, featuring Hanks drop for the ladies in the group. pretty funny, but wrong. I wonder how many poor children had their D & D stuff destroyed, and said that the use of their presentation was the road to destruction. The film is mostly after school special, bad acting (although Hanks does show some of his talent) and negotiation relationship, and no one seems to be not having any fun. It seems that these films have the psychological focus on teenagers, starting on the road to adultism, more seriously, apparently, and requires to buckle down and do the things everyone else. Despite my voice 2, it is worth watching because of its unique genre, scary movies that I personally find quite amusing.
