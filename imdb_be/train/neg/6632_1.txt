What on earth has become of our dear Rama? This is the same man who made Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. If AAG was the most ambitious project of Rama, he obviously jumped from a high cliff, he stood up, giving the industry some of the greatest works of all time. This film is made to fall like a brick. I was cringing leave the theater, but I was forced to sit, because I would not be able to take my car to the parking lot before the others, too, are gone. Otherwise, nothing would have made me sit down for a period of time. <br /> <br /> This film is nowhere close to Sholay. He did not even come close to him within a mile. I believe that Rama, of course, loves The Godfather more Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic piece of work. I read an interview of Rama in a couple of days ago, in which the interviewer said that Rama did not sleep for more than 4 hours per day, which is not on the site. I fully agree with this now, because his lack of sleep is likely to take its toll on the film. <br /> <br /> There is no force in the performance. Amitabh Bachchan did not even look scared. He looked more horrible in a few posters and wallpapers that I've seen before. Frame your favorite niche Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar, because she did not have a lot of dialogue (in fact, no one, if I remember well). She opened her mouth, in this film, and has found its place in history. The new guy is playing the role of Jaya seems to have that cheeky look, but not had time to Jai role at all. I can not go on ... Im sorry ... my pain is too great for me to run right now. <br /> <br /> I promised myself throughout the film, I'll be watching the original Sholay again to see that it's still there <br /> <br /> The result :. Terrible movie. The media and the critics are going to cook a goose in Ramah. And just to remind all readers once again, I am one of the biggest fans of Rama, and even I can not feel sorry for him for this act.
