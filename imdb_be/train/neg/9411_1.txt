It is interesting that those who (still), it seemed like this movie did not have any expectations - I believe that it is a trick. Unlike them, I had optimistic expectations, and it was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close to the edges of the camera has always been, I knew that we were in the hands of very amateur filmmaker - it's always obvious sign of them, they think it's art or effective or vigorous to keep the camera for about two inches from the actors . The actors in this film, though, was just one expression of each person. <br /> <br /> If the camera's closure was not enough, lack of light in the film killed him. The film seemed to be shot entirely in the dark. Thus, we now know that the filmmaker was a rank amateur as well. "Oh, oh, we will light the set with a flashlight! This will make it all seem intimate! "No, it made it all seem invisible. <br /> <br /> In addition to the serious technical deficiencies, there was absolutely no stories for the daily hint at the idea that never developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship covered. (Perhaps this is a new kind of film for Germany, but also in Los Angeles, forget it.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this film has won several film festival awards does not indicate the quality of the film, but the quality of these besmirches specific festivals. I can assure you that this film did not win anything in the festival where I saw him. In fact, twice in the course of the film, it seemed like it was finally over, and people started to get up to leave (it was one of the side effects of technology in the operator's "total darkness"). But I shuddered when the film further, instead of groans were coming from the hall. And when the film finally the end, it was clear that it did not matter if he actually ended in either of the two preceding paragraphs. Earlier, the ending would be saved from the audience even more homogenous thrift scene (bending sheets, cutting vegetables, which spreads honey on bread). Yes, we get it, the life of a lonely old man was boring--, but we decided that one of the very beginning. <br /> <br /> I recommend the audience to miss it, it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated moviegoers.
