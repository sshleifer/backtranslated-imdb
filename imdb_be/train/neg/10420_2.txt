Well, I know that many people are likely to resent this review as Watership Down is a "classic" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but after seeing this movie for the first time at the tender age of 18, I have to admit: I really hated it <br /> <br /> We watched this film, because my sister read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who are most in whimpered words Â«Watership Down." - their memories to see the movie as children and who have their emotions tore seams- recommended. Frankly, if I had not bothered. I gave him the benefit of the doubt; Actually, I did not want to stop watching a movie half-way through. This was an exception. It was really, really painful, nauseating boring. This film was probably the slowest I've ever seen (think doped up snails in space), and does not really "do it" for me. Art was good; backgrounds were well done, if not a little soft and TWEE, while the rabbits themselves, they were not very nice and the animation was pretty nervous and poorly made. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to go into detail about the huge storyline; basically it is a story about a group of rabbits who leave their Warren because of the penetration of people in the area. Generally moralistic tale about the dangers of human interaction on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbit post a message. For me, I kind of wish they would have received in the gas chambers, and not because I'm a terrible person sadistic, but because the characters were boring, annoying, dull and generally pretty rough (oh, I'm so terribly in English ). I found that I kept looking at his watch while watching the movie, and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax. <br /> <br /> If I praise it, in any case, I must admit that the concept of showing children the dangers construction in rural areas and, hopefully revealing the arrogance of people, etc. etc. entirely well-intentioned. Maybe all of this at all sanctimonious and instructive, but the message it tries to allocate a good by nature. Musical accompaniment was not bad, too. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude that this film is very poor. I could not watch him all the way through, or I would probably be forced to eat their legs out of boredom. Of course, this is not the "Torque" is bad, but it still does not rate highly in my eyes, so I gave it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I hope this helps.
