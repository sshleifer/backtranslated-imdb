Carly Pope plays JJ, again contributed to food critic whose bright, overbearing mother moves with her. JJ, stunned by this turn of events, and then blackmail the restaurant owner, Alex, to please his mother in exchange for a "maybe" regards his dying restaurant. Alex predictably falls in love with the daughter, the mother warming. There are numerous problems with this film, the characters are universally 2D. JJ is a selfish, hateful character, her mother superficial and shallow. JJ colleagues in the journal are cynical and opportunistic. The leitmotif of 50 women are not able to do it on their own, without the help of men bad, bad, bad. Actions uniformly dull, uninspired script. Movies only saving grace is the location of New York. I would not recommend this movie.
