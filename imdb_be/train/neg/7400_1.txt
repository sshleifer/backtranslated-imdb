I have seen some pretty bad movies, and it's right there. No story is not to talk, it's like one of those bad coma episodes of a soap opera. I just wanted to smack the little girl, because, well, let's just say that it is really suspicious all the way through the movie. Monsters running around wearing what toys were funny. I also saw a little «Silent Hill» in there. And I read that it was done, and watched the Finnish metal band, Lordi. So it is not surprising that it does not make much sense. This seems to be a means to promote the group and there is nothing else. FX is very good, the appearance of the film, monsters and even act as well. But history, of speaking about it, simply does not exist.
