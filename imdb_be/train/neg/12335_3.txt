Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan among this class of actors that I always interested in the fact that, in spite of the reviews. I've always found Mrs. Ryan be a charming and charming actress in almost all her roles, and Kevin Kline are almost always worth watching. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" is largely because of this film. <br /> <br /> First, Meg Ryan plays a lovely character, she plays a spineless whiner who starts grating on the nerves shortly after the opening credits and does not until several days later. However, the character of Kevin Kline is even more irritable and less likable. Thus, even if you usually like these two actors, I recommend your compliance of this film pass.
