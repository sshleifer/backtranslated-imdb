View retracted using erotic scenes, only to realize that it is one of the most incredible and amateur broken movie I've ever seen. Kind of like a high school movie project. What Ryazanov Arquette think ?? And that all these actions the characters in this amazing city alleged the Midwest? Quite difficult to communicate with it. Many lessons not be learned from it, is not a brilliant idea, just stilted and rather funny (but a lot of skin, unless it is intriguing you) filming nonsense .... What bisexual relations, out of nowhere, after all heterosexual encounters, and that this ridiculous dance, with everyone playing their stereotypical roles? Give it a pass, it's like a million miles the other bad, wasted film, money that could be spent on child malnutrition and AIDS in Africa .....
