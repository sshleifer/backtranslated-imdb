This is one of those movies that makes you want taking the time to watch it back and then some, as the time spent picking up his chance, time spent that falls into the video store, etc. <br /> <br /> First Appearance: Granular it is a low budget. Now that in itself does not make for a bad movie. But the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural, so it's kind of distracting. <br /> <br /> Then the story. 3 girls go on a weekend away from the guys Gal. Of course, like everyone does when going hiking, they stop on the way to get the earrings. When they arrive in the area in which they are going to stay, they are involved on Mr. Ranger Sir, who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car in the fire season, and then leads them to where they are going (deleted cabin). Of course, 2 "cute kids" to wander in their neighborhoods, and Bambi (as Bambi) and Aubrey immediately killed, but apparently Bambi hit anything with two legs. Madi very disappointed by this development, because it is looking forward to the weekend to forget about her ex to obtain sh ** -. Duality and stones out of her gal-pals <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot, there is an average old hermit who lives in a way that it can be to someone not to mess with, and the area and the cabin, where they remain in a kind of "reputation". <br /> <br /> So, of course, sooner or later (sadly, much later), some of our weekend Forestry visitors begin to die, and to find the various traps (although a few of them actually hit below) and of course the other tourists, upset, for obvious reasons. Many cell phone reception, of course (who would miss the opportunity to check your mobile phone for admission to the movies anymore?). Mr. Ranger Sir continues to appear at odd times and his behavior seems a little strange, but he said that he would get help. <br /> <br /> There's a fantastic twist to it that you just do not want to miss too much, if you're still awake. Pray that you wake up at a blank screen. <br /> <br /> The acting in this terrible, terrible production values, and the whole thing just lame, and I find it strange, it was even released. Avoid at all costs 1 of 10.
