After watching this film I sincerely disappointed - not because of the actor, the story or the governing - I was disappointed with this film advertising <br /> <br /> trailers suggest that the battalion "chose a third way out." except surrender or die (Polish information were even misinformation, that they had the choice between being killed by their own artillery or German guns, they even translated the name incorrectly as "ridiculous Battalion"). It was tickling the right place, and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> The disappointment began when I realized that a third way to simply sit down and count the corpses of the following sitting down and counting the dead ... then I started thinking, "Hey, this story may not be so easy ... I bet this intelligent officer will find some clever way to save what remained of his troops. " Well, he did not, they just sat and waited for something to happen. And so was I. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events of the Second World War, so we were not able to make much use their imagination, but even thought I found this film is really not a difficult and even a little sad. And as I wrote in the first place - it is not the fault of the actors, writers and directors - their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that the film could have done.
