The forest is not just your everyday standard Slasher / backwoods cannibal fare, it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well. The story of two couples who hike in the woods on a camping trip. Cave house cannibals lumberjacks and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon to terrorize them. There is something you do not see every slasher. Directed by Don Jones receives the "A" for effort, but the film falls flat on almost every level, acting is just average, Janet Kelly, who plays his wife dead forester (Michael Brodie aka Gary Kent), except. <, Br /> <br /> film begins with some beautiful shots a couple trips through the valley, the forest. They are too late to realize that someone is following them. They both went to a typical chopper rate. Our killer uses a reliable hunting knife throughout the film, except during the flashbacks, when he realizes the hacksaw, villas and rusty chainsaw to send an amateur. <br /> <br /> his cheating wife Wood has a good story, but the film just does not work with him, I found it rather dull from just a shitty action. 4/10
