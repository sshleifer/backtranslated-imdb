I must congratulate the genius who has approved this one. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think, my friend, you can not get on each piece of cheap amateur crap that only intention should be to get some money. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera will get the same results or better <br /> <br /> action lets just say :. Nha goes to the supermarket looking for the actor. Good usually come with a degree or at least have some experience of the damned! Director .. Mr. John Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director just suck. Directing your poor, corners all messed up (not in a good way), the line, it seems as if they are reading from the toilet paper, and damn music .. it always comes when it should not be in and out for no apparent reason. And is not no writer, by the way. Making movies do not like to serve on coffeshop, it requires art and skill, I very much doubt that you ever will. <br /> <br /> Instead of making the shoot a teaser film, you should have removed this back to oblivion and wait "until something good came up .. Or just go and find a job in coffeshop. You will have less stress, and you'll save money and film Goers bad night <br /> <br /> voice :. 1/10 (my first one)
