Oh my God ... There are so many other movies that I want to see it ... I'm stuck with my nephew for the weekend, and this is what he wants - Yes ... <br /> <br /> I see it the show when I was in college ... it was meaningless, a kind of fun, and more action-oriented. The show had a good heart tho ... and the characters are cute; no one was killed or even hurt bad ... it was like a cartoon come to life. Cut to 2005 ... What happened? This one does not work. As already said, that simply is not a cohesive story and presentation amazing ... almost annoy - definitely not exactly original character ... all this is like a Mad TV parody and lasts for 100 minutes! It was one of the few times when I was embarrassed to watch a movie. What were they thinking? As far as I'm concerned, there must have been for the marketing of products, toys, etc. All I can say is, whether one die a quick death. This makes the original Duke of Hazzard, it seems like Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> I think that the only left to do a remake of TV's Gilligan's Island ... Good luck!
