This is one of those movies that try to be sullen and tense, and, instead, eventually tripping all over themselves. Seeing it on the eccentric film festival, I was intrigued by the "young college trio went wrong," the review, however, over-all end up very disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's hard to criticize the "real story", as there is not much that can be done about the story - but I found it to be inconsistent, melodramatic and completely depressing. It is dark and almost sinister, the picture darn terrible outbreak of the seventies with the imposition of music and jerky close-up. It just does not work - some of the scenes where the cheese so that instead of muted awe, my audience was suppressing laughter and rolling eyes <br /> <br /> The story takes an interesting premise, but it just turns down the dark. , Unfortunate spiral.
