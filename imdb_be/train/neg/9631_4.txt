The film appeals to the public in connection with the charisma of Ben Stiller and fame John Aniston. It seems that here we have a recipe for a successful title, but there is no success in this film. <br /> <br /> Polly Aniston plays very well, no doubt. It's kind of a character that suits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller same restless guy, as in "Meet the Parents", but in this movie, comic scene is small in comparison with the above-mentioned title. <br /> <br /> script very poor nothing special at all. With these two well-paid actors, things could get a lot better -. But what can they do if there is a bad story and the script <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
