Gods, I have not watched the movie that awful for a long time. Maybe not as «The New Guy» or various films Freddie Prinze Jr. Yes, this is what an amazingly awful. wooden workpiece and acting in World Sor surely must have been inspired by Freddy. The film production was uncomfortable (like playing faster, and the feeling of confinement does not work well on film). Actors did not have a clue what they are doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was horrible and her sex appeal to non-existent here so it was painful to see her "seduction" of other characters, and they "fall" on it. And that was with occaisional frames of a live audience in a sun lounger? Meaningless! I had to include DVD-player, he would have been applied to himself the pain to finish this film.
