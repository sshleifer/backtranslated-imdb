I understand that the director was trying to do, but he missed. The main actor was really good, but editing around him moments takes you out of it. The camera work, that is, lighting and exposer like an amateur that I could forgive if the direction was more freely, but it was not. The sound was a bit off, and that takes you out of the film as well. I see, could see this director makes a little bit better in the future, rather than a total of at once, but do not expect Dv movie is almost as good as 28 days or something, keep expectations low, and you get more from it . At least it was only one and a half hours. Oh yeah, and the action was very bad except the lead, if you ask me. But I'm a movie snob so believes that what it's worth.
