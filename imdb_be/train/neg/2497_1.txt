There is only one problem with this site, you can not give a negative assessment. Also akin to appreciate it as a Class D film. I say that he was too good. A piece of wood can show more emotion that the actors in this film, and the money used for the production of this film would have been better used to start a fire. It is absolutely terrible 2:00 life, that anyone who is experiencing this mediocre bloodshed will never return. After viewing the 5 minutes, I and the boys thought, sinking bulk Heavies make it more interesting. Carto and half a bottle of 151 later, I finally found some of this class of the G, acting remotely funny. It is an insult to the whole planet, the director thought someone might find something useful from this more, he should go out and buy a rope. And the actors in this film, I hope that you paid good to be in this joke, because I doubt that you will ever work again. As a result, I had a great all in this film the majestic 100 and 12 penalty points from the actor's license.
