I looked forward to watching this film and see these great actors perform. However, I was disappointed, unfortunately, in the script, and the whole plot of the story. David Duchovny (Dr. Eugene Sands), «Connie & Carla», «04, was a doctor in history who use drugs, and the loss of his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands visited the nightclub and was able to use his medical experience to help and assistance to the injured client Angelina Jolie, (Claire), «Taking lives," "04, which immediately attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton (Raymond Blossom), «Kinsey," "04, plays a big Gangster shot and people with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton appears to be more than act in most scenes and goes completely out of his mind, trying to keep his gang member from death. Gary Dourdan (Yates), «CSI-Vegas television series," plays a supporting role and reflects the real COOL dude, that is so-called bodyguard for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby ​​red lips that attracted a lot of attention on the part of all men. This film is not the th big, but it's not fun.
