I saw this film in my class international film and dirty from going. This film is nothing but a blatant shock scene after the next. <br /> <br /> 4th person has to alcoholic writer named Bray, who has his vision in the dangerous. He meets a woman named Christine, giving a lecture at a local book club, and just decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend. To put it more clearly, Reve loves Dutch sausage. So Reve up with a plan to seduce a friend of Christina, so that it can eventually have sex with him. But it later emerged that Christina had 3 previous husbands that she killed. Now Reve and Christina boyfriend may be a "fourth MAN.Â» The story line makes sense, no plot holes. Edit and everything else that is technical about this film is remarkable. The film is just full, and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. In principle, it is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Reve getting out of bed in a T-shirt JUST. Thus, in the beginning, you will get to see the beautiful PECKER Reve flop around as he walks around the cramped apartment in a state of hangover. Later, he had a dream where his beak gets cut scissors, and they show it with a fountain of blood that must be. Reve caress the statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. In addition, there is a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger films combined. <br /> <br /> Not that I have anything against the "shocking" scenes, but this film is just so outrageous when it comes to shock. The entire film revolves around the value of shock. <br /> <br /> So, if all this is your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far far far far away from this. My mind is still injured.
