Belmondo is a tough cop. He goes after the trader big-time drug (played by Henry Silva, as a rule, this is a great villain - see "Sharky's Machine", but here it is clearly dubbed, and due to the fact that he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to scuzziest places in Paris and Marseille, asking some names, some people are beaten, given names, is more scuzzy places, ask more names, hit by more people, etc. The entire film is a blow after blow after blow. It seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create a French equivalent of "Dirty Harry." Belmondo, who was 50 here really do some good tricks in the beginning; except, Â«Le marginal" is a violent, occasionally, banal, small and overlooked a police film. (* 1/2)
