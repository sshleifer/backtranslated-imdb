I'm dumber people for renting DVD Redline. Chicago Pictures, who made this stupid movie never paid Palisades Media Group buy web advertising on a variety of automotive sites, including mine, which has ALEXA ranking of 16K. They tore me a deal, and now I'm at $ 16,000, and they wasted most of his spare time (Peter rapport Media palisade) you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy this film !!!
