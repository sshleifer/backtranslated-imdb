I came out that I had never seen or even heard of this film before undesirable? That is right up my alley with a bloody teenkill, ridiculous drawing and an insurmountable 80-Cheese atmosphere hanging around him. For some reason, no one is really interested in, staff and students of the Catholic University of the elite are butchered unknown psychopath. Just typed teacher Julie Parker becomes participation, when all the people she has contact with the dead will pass or behave strangely. This film is funny bad! There is absolutely no logic or sequence, and each character is equally meaningless to others. For example, a girl killed and her body thrown into the container. Then, and for no reason, the story suddenly moves forward in three weeks has killed the girl never mentioned or even missed. Not even her boyfriend! Acting pathetic and there is not even a little bit of nudity to enjoy. killer revelation quite funny, because the producers really seemed convinced that it was an original twist ... It's not that guys! Â«Splatter University" is easily one of the worst horrors of turkeys ever.
