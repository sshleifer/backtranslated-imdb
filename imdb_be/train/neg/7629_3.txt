I gave this film a very fair chance, and he betrayed me. It is very slightly larger than the black and white occasion to bore the hell out of the audience, even selfish Bogdanavich (who did a better way to target) is "great performances" from tons of hams in their debut. Many teens sex stamps out of this film, for example, making the wife of the Master, Impotence, making ugly prostitute (which is very awkward shot and grinds things to a complete stop, not that it was actually going anywhere anyway) and skinny dipping. <br /> <br /> I believe that this film has to be funny, because all sex is nonsense, for me it was just annoying. I seriously entertained a lot more cleaning my nails than watching this mess.
