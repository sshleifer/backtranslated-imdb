Seriously. This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> A portion of the family without a mother and 3 "dads" to raise the 3 little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters- neat freak Denis cartoon lover Joey, Jesse hair get spoiled brat Michel, stupid DJ, Stephanie and almost normal. The creators of the show really want you to hate the character, is not it? <br /> <br /> So I do not think that someone should watch this show. I just chuckled for a few minutes the whole running the show, and I think that instead of lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, torture is much worse than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
