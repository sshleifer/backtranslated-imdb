"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" What does that suppose then? This site can not be worse, like a boy who is afraid of everything, it becomes very bold at the very end of the film, because he went to the library. The sole purpose of these celluloid waste was to encourage American children to read when cheaper and more efficient way of doing this could be a series of ads! Even talents Culkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (as predictable because "it is a page with the masters' librarian) can save this pointless film with a dull story. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy, Hollywood or the voice of God, Frank Welker as cartoon characters entirely keep it forever. I can only describe it as the 1990s equivalent even terrible one thousand nine hundred seventy-eight devices Water babies, because the soft animation makes the film worse, does not improve a dull story!
