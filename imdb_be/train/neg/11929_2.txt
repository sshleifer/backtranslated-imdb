I watched «The Eye», before I watched it. I really liked the "eyes", it was one of the best films of recent Asian horror movies. Thus, I chose the "Bangkok Haunted" because it was the same director, and it was a kind of popular tour here. But man, what a disappointment ... "pursued Bangkok" Three stories of love, revenge, ghosts, etc., which are not scary at all, not even worrying (as the "eye" was) ... NO nothing. I can not even fill the 10 lines necessary for the comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% sad <br /> <br /> * My rating :. 2/10
