I'm a big fan of old horror movies, and I have since the middle-aged, old for me it is a film made before 1970 with the majority made in the 1920s during the 1960s. I'm not a big fan of the more modern horror films, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could remember the stories, but I really enjoyed the monster in the history of the box with Hal Holbrook, and each guy was really clean end. All the stories were great, though. So why I love them so much? The characters were some decent development, the lines were very simply about who is good and who is bad, horror bits have been strengthened with a close-up of a person overwhelmed with fear and funny bits were really funny! This is a continuation, or are lacking in these elements, or they are completely absent! I am writing this just by looking him in part because the movie was a waste of time, and I turned it off to do other things like writing reviews on IMDb.com movie, lol. When George Kennedy and Dorothy old Lamoure get top billing, it tells you something ..... 4 10. In addition, the experience of Romero's hard to find here, they have ordered him to tone it down to the PG standard (I don 'know it was priced at, but it looks PG for me), and it's not a good thing for the film out of nothing happening. This is shown on the cable channel Encore, if your dying (yuck yuck) to see it.
