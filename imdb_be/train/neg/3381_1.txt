This may be the worst adaptation of the Broadway musical ever. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about the theater - almost every shot and torque ring false. I will say, however, that it is almost bad enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> Hair perfectly dated. I can not for the life of me understand what is meant by (conceptually), opening film on the outside of the theater, where the "chorus" plays. Are we to think that these people audition for «A Chorus Line», which contains stories about the people who audition? Oh, no, show collapses on itself. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production, and listened to the album a hundred times. Why, oh why, did they do?
