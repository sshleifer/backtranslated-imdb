OK, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so that you can give him a little credit for concern about terrorists, and the idea that the CIA director doing a plot to blow up the plane from the sky convicted before he brings death into the world, is prophetic. That's all. This is good stuff. Actions ... dishonest. The plot is ... silly. "Twist" ... there is no need. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not as though no one ever thought about what to do if the plane is contaminated. Do you think the bureaucrats have a manual for "ulcers" and how to maintain them? The proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Hurricane Katrina. But they have a plan. This is not to send them to Iceland and then in Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why the plane door and "shooters standing there without protection? In fact, nothing has occurred to no one to take her legs? It would stop her. But not so dramatically ,. I'm a sucker. I always watch the movie to see the end, once I started. But it was a waste of time, and for the most part predictable. I saw him using the recorder, so I did not have to watch all the ads, that's a plus. It is a good example of why I look so small TV network. Rubbish.
