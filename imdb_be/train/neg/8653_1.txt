I got into it in the hope that it would be "thoughtful" little precious people viewed it as. I love indie films and is expected to dig it too. knowing that it is a hot button topics as I expected to be really entertained, maybe even see a perspective of outsiders. <br /> <br /> All I can say is wow .... if your a torture or injury, then maybe you will like it. I personally do not like the idea, pee'd or cutting themselves, so I thought it was garbage. bad script, bad acting, bad history, bad directing, bad editing .... I could go on. I have no idea why the reviewer stated that he or she makes a political point, giving the film 10 that is misleading and ignorant. Vote for the film entirely on IMDb creates a precedent! it simply allows other people to think that the bomb debris as it is OK to look, as long as this is debatable (this film is not, he is trying very hard to be, but it will not work). <br /> <br /> You know that the film is bad, if the 15 minutes it your prayer, that all the main characters die horrible. Unfortunately, they do not die, but not painful in ways that would allow the viewer some justice or justification for what was observed in 2 hours crap they just experienced. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and just do not even bother. I got the movie deal in the bin at your local video store for .50 and feel ripped off!
