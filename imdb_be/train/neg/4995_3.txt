I found it a real challenge to sit through this movie. The sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what is at stake. There has been little to move the plot along and often the action just stopped and there was a long period of conversations that seemed extraneous to the film. These conversations switch between family groups and the observer was left to try to piece together what is the common thread that bound them together. It is rare that I appreciate a movie, this low and make it in this case, the entire viewing experience left me thinking "so what" and "why do I waste my time watching it."
