I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, compared with a witty, fun, funny and innovative 1970 classic film by Robert Altman, the show was, was probably destined to be smaller than an ordinary ... even if it is to work for 11 years, that does not necessarily make it any good . This show is all formed a very integral part of my early childhood (he was re-runs every night, and guess whose parents watched it and laugh it), but it's one of the memories that I do not miss. And now, when I actually saw the film, I can give this series of accurate criticism. By themselves, it is almost "2 of 10" bad. Nevertheless, the signs on the show has nothing to do with the film. Some of them are technically identical, but they are only similar in name. For example, since when Alan Alda something like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as well as its characteristics and prospects. New characters are not so great, they merely serve to make you miss the ones they replace. It is the same with new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that really sends a series of radar, which is still (despite playing the same actor) just a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh, yes. With a laugh track (it does not matter whether it has been used in surgery of the stage or not), he comes across as terrible, because what is happening in other places. And because it lasted almost four times more than the actual Korean War, he takes the viewer into this amazing temporary break that does not work outside of the world of cartoons. I never liked this show, and I never will.
