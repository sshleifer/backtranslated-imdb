Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was curious to see what he would do with the complete creative control over the film. Unfortunately, it's unwatchable, but not because the jokes are not funny - some (I will not say most) of them, and in fact Mr. Mike did a good job translating his mentally unbalanced ties in visual gags. The problem lies in the fact that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it), so God awful movie unbearable. Some outfit called «PKO Productions» gets the credit for production, but it does not look made at all; it's more like Mike stole one of the cameras from a variety of SNL and done it all in one day. I understand that the goal Mike was torturing the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear or understand all this, it should be shocking. However, DVD is not a complete waste: it includes a eulogy for ODonohyu Bill Murray and three "Least Loved Bedtime Stories Mr. Mike" with SNL. In addition, the "swimming cat" from the movie big stage, to be caught watching, if you want someone a freak. 3/10
