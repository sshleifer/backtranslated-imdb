I have seen a romantic comedy, and it's one of the easiest / worst attempt one. A lot of work scenes in plug and play manner inserted strictly conform to the romantic comedy genre. Usually this is good because we are dealing with the genre, but the problem mostly lies in the creation of his original, fresh and inventive. This film is not able to do it. <br /> <br /> There's no sense of who the characters really but Sylvie Moreau (which is the real star of this film, Isabelle Sun Shit). They fit into a one-dimensional clich√©s, and they are no more than mere puppets, which serves the purpose of the story is very easy. <br /> <br /> stimulation of the film may become irritable, lacking rhythm and editing filled with unnecessary close-up. I should also mention overly stylized decor make some scenes are devoid of any natural, or, rather, an attempt is made, of course, seems too obvious. Of course, along with this, you have a right-to-ki juicy music, which, unfortunately, often sounds mismatched. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the movie, which makes obvious allusions Woody Allen ends up being is deceptive, if you are waiting for a good light-hearted romantic comedy, it is not. Or, rather, it is a weak attempt at it. You just leave the theater wondering why this film was to receive such praise, when the movie is already more than 100 years, and there is so much superior to the Quebec Director of doing more clicks. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants good movie for what it is. But it is bad if we consider cinema as an art and directors as a film director's.
