This film is so small class compared with strangers on a train, or even involuntary meeting on the subject that, despite the similarity of story I would not feel really compare it to any of them. The nature of Yancy Butler came as such a sluggish dullard I was too embarrassed to writer and director to keep looking. <br /> <br /> I do not like a lot of Lifetime movies, but feels compelled to watch one every now and then in order to promote harmony in the home. I often groan in silence, but this movie made me protest loudly, get out of the room and walk around the house muttering to himself, before I returned to my favorite chair usually expose themselves to more torture. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
