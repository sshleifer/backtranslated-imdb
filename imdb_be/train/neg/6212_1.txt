Previously, it was my thinking that the films necessary parts, or any other means do you care at all about the storyline or anything that happens. This movie showed me that you really do not have anything like this. <br /> <br /> I can sum it up just like that. But, IMDb want to have more lines. It was kind of pretty. entirely convincing in the least degree. The way the characters speak in the film makes you think that was going to happen in a few days, but there is no passage of time, and I am sure that all this is happening in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you want to entertain yourself, and then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up. It would be much better use of your time. The time that you will never get back. Jurassic Park 3 was pulled better than this movie.
