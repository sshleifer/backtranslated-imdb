Do not listen to the misleading title «Werewolf Woman». Europeans are well known to put the emphasis on sex and poverty over the actual panic in their horror movies, but this one is just a bit too much. "Werewolf woman" seems to be a sleazy sex scene copped out of the title character is crazy and brutally kills his partner. Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes, it becomes very monotonous quickly. Shes not a werewolf, a schizophrenic chick, whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can not even decide the tone, the first ten minutes (remembrance) of the future law supernatural horror (I thought that for the classic garbage after them) in a poor female character study being repeatedly abused and tortured to revenge thriller. In the end, the director claims that it is based on a true story. Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some entertaining aspects of the production. The name of the werewolf woman is a viewer and have some good effects and Gore nude scenes. Nevertheless, they become quite monotonous quickly. Furthermore, dubbed dialogue is pretty fun in camp fashion, especially in the world's most swinging doctor (he was drinking on the job). Unfortunately, the film becomes quite annoying quickly. There's no actual plot, or anything else really. Its a shame, because reading the description, I felt that the film had some real potential. "Werewolf woman" is far from a long, slow moving, and a bit too meaningless, even by the standards of operation of the genre. (4/10)
