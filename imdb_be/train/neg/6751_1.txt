My friend and I rented it because we thought it might be a good "Halloween" takeoff. Killer terrorizing young people, white mask ... you get my drift. We were dead wrong! A lot of pun. We not only found one of the scariest movies out there, but what is a cult classic! It is filled w / plot holes and does not make any sense. The actress, who plays Maddie really, but that's about it. I give credit for this shot on a very low budget - I always support films like this. . Not this particular one <br /> <br /> This film can be good to see if you are drunk or high; otherwise do not bother. If you do not want to lose your movie franchise, as I did!
