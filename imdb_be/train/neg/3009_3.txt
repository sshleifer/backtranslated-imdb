This song continues to hum in my head. Not a great song, but in the '80s. This film about the singer, who «supposebly» gets killed after being accused of murder, he has his girlfriend, who sings backing vocals in his group. Soloist whose name is Billy "eyes" (yeah, right) died after two years and his group returned to the concert only backup singer is a soloist at this time. Billy pursues her, and in the end, going around killing all of these people and scared little girl and it allows people around her brain Theres something wrong with her and that Shes imagining. In the end, she decides to go to the cemetery and dig up his grave to see if it's still there. She sees that he's dead, but still See and hear his voice. At the end of the film, we learn the reason for it all, Billy has a brother named John (right again) and John admits he was jealous of his brother, and he killed all these people to return to him and place the blame on his brother, and then take his girlfriend and terrorizing her because she called him crazy. The ending is very cheezy, and the action is very lame and wood. .... but I like it anyway. I watch it for a song. I would like it.
