This movie was terrible. I gave it high marks 2 as I've seen worse, but very little. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the clich√© having a film at the beginning of the end and return to the beginning of the end of the film used all the tricks in the box, used in making the film for the sake of it, like a kid with too many toys. Was infinite, sad repeated narration, slow motion, stop frame, flashbacks and combine images, etc. -. None of which made a dull film better <br /> <br /> It's called "16 years of alcohol," but there was not enough drinking or drunkenness, and not the image is removed from the film jumped everywhere, without a coherent sense. The story was poorly written and very pretentious and direction were equally poor, and it's a shame that people put further money for a movie, Mr. Jobson, previously know for a fact that in the garbage group and on TV makes as much sense as the film It does. <br /> <br /> I found it a major struggle to see it to the end, but in the hope that better I carried on a bitter, but it's really a waste of time, and I would have been better not to bother.
