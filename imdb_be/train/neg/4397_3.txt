One of my sisters friends gave me this game, and it's damn hard! It carries the appearance of children's games, but you have to learn how to make tons of complex movements that require you to twist and turn your hands into all kinds of contorted positions, and you should look for a seemingly endless levels 100 notes to improve your "price"! You also need to find the hidden base jigsaw puzzle games that require you to make an almost impossible task to get them! And I ONLY TO THE THIRD STAGE !!!!! Maybe if you do not have life NAD can stay home all the time, you might get a kick out of it, but otherwise stay away! And it is definitely not recommended for children - they will pull your hair out for hours!
