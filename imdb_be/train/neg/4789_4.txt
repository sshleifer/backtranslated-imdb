"Phantom" 1979 was a very atmospheric, terrible, terrible, and very original horror film, and, in a word, the cult. The first sequel to 1988 was a bloody, witty, futuristic and very interesting. After the first sequel however, "Phantom" creator Don Coscarelly apparently, there were no new ideas. "Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead" in 1994, certainly not a complete failure, it is even interesting enough, but no more originality, and desperate attempts to make something new, sometimes tiring, making it very disappointing when compared to its predecessors <. br /> <br /> - spoilers - <br /> <br /> It is at the very beginning, we have introduced the secret of the mysterious sentinel areas (brain-sucking flying silver balls) unraveled further, a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters (for example, Tim. in «Home Alone» -style small child, who happens to be great at shooting, Rocky, hard the second and the super-cool nunchaku-swinging black chick with a hedgehog) introduced The film also has its own quality -. Reggie Bannister again very cool as a ponytail, playing on Reggio guitar Angus Scrimm still pretty terrible as a tall man, but the fact that. tall man says a lot more in this film, makes it lose some of its horror. the character played by Mike A. Michael Baldwin again (he was replaced by James Legros in part 2), that, in my opinion, does not make much difference. Gore also keeps the film is quite interesting to watch, but it's still disappointing, especially because it attempts to compensate for the lack of ideas to annoy pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> All things considered, "Phantasm III" is a convenient time waster, but it's certainly a disappointment compared to his predecessors. Supporters of the first two "phantom" films can give it a try, but I do not recommend to install your expectations are too high.
