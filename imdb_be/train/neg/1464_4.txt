I watched it, hoping to find something I did not know about modern history`s notorious people and did not represent the idea that history was rewritten in HITLER: The Rise of Evil. Hitler was so busy with his niece that he had threatened one of her admirer`s shot. Hitler addressed a pistol in his hand to arrest Ernst RÃ¶hm. Sorry for the question, but the writers `t confuse harbor Adolf Hitler with Tony Montana with a scar? That`s bad enough, but what really insulted me, there `chunks of historical context is lacking in this mini-series. Germany lost the First World War and the Allied States of Germany paid a high price for it. It is this economic environment, which has led the German people to someone - anyone - to restore his honor and that is why they turned to Nazism. German humiliation of the 1920s, caused by the allied states, seems to be completely missing, therefore, there is no way that Hitler: IMPROVING THE EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I even mentioned haven`t that Himmler and Goering conspicous is their lack of <br /> <br /> There is one positive thing about the mini-series and That`s Robert Carlyle in the title role. Well some of his mannerisms wrong, his voice a little too loud (Archive records show that Hitler was a soft seductive voice), but Carlyle charismatic actor, and he really knows how to talk Hitler`s own charisma on the screen. Comments in the British press that Carlyle reminds keyboardist from Sparks over Adolf Hitler are unfounded, and it gives one of the best interpretations of Hitler. <br /> <br /> I liked the performance of Robert Carlyle, but I hated everything else about this mini-series, and wondered why on earth was done in the first place. There`s nothing to recommend it for serious history buffs
