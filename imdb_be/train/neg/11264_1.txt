I have not yet decided whether it will replace the Anaconda, as "the worst movie I have ever seen." <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the weird accents, low production values ​​and terrible camera work, the film has absolutely nothing going for it. I just went to see him, as I read the book and wanted to see how they will work difficult part of a 2-hour movie <br /> <br /> The answer is simple -. They did not. Characters emerge from little or no explanation of who they are, and then continue, do not play an important role in the story. Even the main characters act without a reason, so that by the time the film reaches its climax it you do not care what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> I can admit that sometimes it is necessary to rewrite the book to fit into the movie, and that it may be unfair to judge the movie against the book it was adapted from. But when my friends and I walked out of the theater I had to spend most of the way home, explaining what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> They even change the true meaning of the book "rancid aluminum" name squeezing it in another piece of mindless voice-just so they can allow the film to have a cool name. <br /> <br /> a real mess of a movie from start to finish.
