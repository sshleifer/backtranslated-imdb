I usually use earlier films Loretta Young: it works then it was light and fresh, and she sure knows how to wear clothes. But this is only one loser from the word go for the funny supporting turn, Glenda Farrell, besides. Young is hatcheck girl who says her writer husband (Paul Lukas) in the formation of the championship bridge player. This is not the most cinematic games, and a long, Talky middle part, where their marriage is falling apart just about kills the film. <br /> <br /> There is one interesting point, though. As Lukas Ferdinand Gottschalk begin its climactic game, a series of quick shots show the plane, train, football matches, even a diver in the air, frozen in anticipation of the event. This is the earliest use of the still image that I saw in the American film. The desire to rest was that inventive, and funny.
