Have you ever sat, watching a movie, when 20 or 30 minutes passed, and suddenly you realize that you actually seen the film before? It happened to me with "young graduates". Cover a box if you can find the video is very misleading. I swear that the two women on the cover even in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was born ten years too late to appreciate the subtleties of the film or ... it is simply meaningless garbage. I am strongly inclined to think the latter, but I believe that there is some relationship developed with this film. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. Site. Let's see ... there's got to be a story here somewhere. No, I can not find it. It's pretty much about some of the seniors acting sluggish and do drugs and to speak the language, which became obsolete decades ago. One student in love with his teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (with whom he actually refers to an iceberg), so it is susceptible to the girl's achievements. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of driving around and meaningless dialogue and many spastic dance. Our cat, Buba, had permeated the higher school of dancing. She watched with surprising intensity as dancers whirled and shook out on the dance floor. Nice to see that at least one kind of found something interesting in this shrine. 1/10
