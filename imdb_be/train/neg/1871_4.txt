Despite the lavish production numbers and great costumes, this film makes me sick to watch. The murder-mystery plot is just a vehicle to mount a musical number on, but it is often bring things to a halt stunning besides not being too roles. Although, obviously, it was a lot of money spent on their figures badly placed and poorly photographed. This is obviously the pre-code film, because the girls often wear very little clothing, and there is even a song in praise of marijuana! The performances are all one note, while it's nice to see Carl Brisson in the musical, but when Victor McLaglen, as the police Lieutenent, rolls into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues, you can throw in the towel, or at least fast-forward to the next number. Sorry for patrons who were trapped in the film to release it, though!
