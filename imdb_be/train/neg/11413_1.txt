Seriously - avoid this film at all costs. I just saw him in my first "preview" ever, and while I'm a non-refundable money for it, I left the theater after just 15 minutes. Which already includes a 2-minute discussion among my friends or stay. The first time I came out of the cinema. And I've lived through some pretty bad. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that are duplicated (and bad so), even if it is shown in the original language. It is based on the oldest, simplest and cheapest of jokes in the book. Military ( "What do we do once we reach the combat zone?" - "You get out of the car and die", in fact, it's much funnier to read here that it has been delivered in the film), drug (man eat some "space cookies" behaves very stupid and miss his wedding to live through it while the highest - all poorly written and acted)? women in the military ( "Why do we only get the tube promised us weapons!" - "That's it, that's how it will remain") ... Argh. Well, you can actually find this really funny, but in this case you are seriously scare me. <br /> <br /> Also, I've seen better acting in the form of soft porn films you get on the European TV late at night. So were lame jokes (delivered bad) for lower secondary action, lacked pace, it was poorly dubbed and edited ?? It just does not work. At least, not at any level, which is used as a measure for movies. <br /> <br /> I would even dare to say that this film proves that there are people who may be significantly less ridiculous given Zee Germans. And it says something, if you like the stereotypes. (What am I doing wrong, it is a pleasure to play with them, though. Just in case anyone thinks that I am not in a PC is sufficient.) <br /> <br /> Rather than see this movie, do something useful. Try to teach a hook for shrimp, paint your nails in a very annoying color, disassemble the bike, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theory, to convert to another religion and back - in fact, go and listen to the «Last Christmas» wham! on the endless repetition. Anything, but do not look that terrible movie.
