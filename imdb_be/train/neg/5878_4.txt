Since the front cover says "The village of our time, for our time." <br /> <br /> I had to learn this filmed version of Hamlet immediately after viewing Keneth Branagh version, and it was a really disappointing experience. <, Br /> <br /> This version uses a different approach to some aspects of the game, including sexuality; VERY homosexual one very interesting and Osric interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think that for the time (60 years) it was very well done version of Hamlet, but can not be compared with the full version of Bran. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found a video on my local video store (Australia), and I'm really looking Keneth Branagh DVD, to buy, if such a thing even exists. If anyone knows of one, please let me know.
