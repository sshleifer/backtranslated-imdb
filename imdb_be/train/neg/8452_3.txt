This is the first time I commented on the film, because I felt that if the right person to read, they can wake up and do something about it. Over the past few months, ABC Family began airing a new movie format. I saw the last three and enjoyed them. They were interesting and did the trick. My wife loves these movies. I look forward to watching "See Jane Date." Trailers looked and sounded great. Unfortunately, this is one film where the book should be light-years ahead of effort manifested music writers and people associated with the project. Year 2003, the source of (bad), the cost was interesting how to ride the elevator in a department store. It was not intrusive and add emotional content of the film at all. He worked against him. I work in the business of film and television. I enjoy entertaining. This is one case where I kept thinking it could be worse. The script had a line from another decade, and I know that these women can work, but you do not know that from this film. To add to the overall experience, the end left me shaking my head. Governing Council in Disney, ABC, ABC Family and producers: In all circumstances, please do not hire a composer and musical director, to do any of your future films. They lost contact, and they should understand that the word "modern", "today" and "current" means that the description of a romantic comedy. There is a world pass you by. Overall, a huge disappointment from the people on the Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
