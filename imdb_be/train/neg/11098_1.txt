Like most people, I was intrigued when I heard the concept of the film, especially "the filmmakers then attacked" aspect, that it seems to emphasize that with the picture on the cover of the filmmakers being chased by an angry mob. <br /> <br /> Then, to see the movie and find out about what they mean by "the filmmakers were attacked" had several children, threw stones at the sign and the number of people complained loudly and said, "Someone to beat these two children. " The image on the cover, "Pursuit", as it was? Total product. I think, in connection with the theme of the film, lies and manipulation to satisfy a vain, stupid kids with a lot of money and time sense. <br /> <br /> I do not know that much is true the viewer is supposed to take from this film. It's like Michael Moore «Roger & Me», but when he was «Roger & Me» Moore mocking the people of Flint. It is totally misdirected and absolutely meaningless. Wow! Can you believe that people who have suffered under the yoke of communism would be very pleased that the markets are full of food? What jerks! And it's not so much, "Look at the consequences of capitalism and the Western media blah-blah-blah," because it was not just that their fake market was comparable to the price of the competition, it was the fact that, as many people in the film talk prices were absurdly low, who recalled that it was necessary to know that it is a fake, how much they charge for a duck. It does not prove anything except that people who are poor, will go to the store, which has a low price, well done guys, so follow it to the people at the bottom. <br /> <br /> The way to play a stupid joke on the elderly. You must be very proud. What about your next film you're doing a documentary about Iraq and to show how the people there will get really excited for the house without bullet holes in the walls, and then, say, «HAHA! NOT SUCH HOUSE DOES NOT EXIST! YOUR SO STUPID and like to be lied to by the media! ". <br /> <br /> Morgan "Love me," Spurlock unleashed this wet fart film, which is not surprising, since Sperlki as a One Hit Wonder, Prince documentary world, seems to throw his weight behind any silly concept that sounds to stay relevant in a world that does not really need it. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
