NSA, CIA, FBI, Federal Security Service and all other spy agency in the world should watch this movie, to get information on how to spy on people. (As MST3K Comment approve it ... "Sanat has dirt on everyone! Santa's tentacles reach far and wide! There's no hiding from Klaus organizationÂ») <br /> <br /> With the telescopes that can spy on millions of miles through the ears, who can hear everything. Its amazing that the CIA entirely Sant on the payroll. <br /> <br /> dance routine Satan cheerful. Pitch ... he was so useless. <br /> <br /> cheese factor in this film is tremendous. Very low budget, but so fun to watch. I recommend looking at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version for even more laughter. <br /> <br /> You can even get a laugh in missfortune of good children. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 for the production of quality and 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
