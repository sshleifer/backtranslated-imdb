The series was CBS network to respond to the success of Big Valley. It was 90 minutes of Western as well as the ABC program was. Despite the fact that this was the answer, it does not have the material to make it last season 2. <br /> <br /> The problem has indeed become a reality lost on the show. For approximately one episode, Johnny receives his eyes sticking out too far. Surprisingly, until the end of the show, Johnny has healed completely. At the same time, stories on this was no where near as strong as The Big Valley. <br /> <br /> This is a show that I would not want the DVD, and I sincerely hope that they never released. Think, as CBS has been launched of the parties, they again used a lot of familiar settings. It was one of the last Western CBS series production as Westerns were not real popular in the 1970s.
