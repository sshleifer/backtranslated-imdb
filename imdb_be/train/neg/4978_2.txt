The film lost me with the crossbow RPG (grenade launcher). It was like someone cut and paste a scene from Robocop. I almost expect that to say Beowulf exclaim, "I like it!» <br /> <br /> I watched it, because I like Chris Bruno «The Dead Zone» TV show, and he did his part . he chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it consistent throughout the film -. Unlike any of its Kostars They glided into all kinds of speech from an old English into modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already a lot of comments about how this movie is different from the source material. However, even by itself, the plot of this movie is not very good. It's just sad that even a low budget is not justified. Having a low budget it means that you need to at least have a good story, dialogue and decent action. These things do not cost much. Instead, they spent your money on half ass CGI and some decent costumes and scenery. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
