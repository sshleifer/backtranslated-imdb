This show was absolutely horrible. For one, George is not funny, and his children snobby little brats. He also treats his mother with respect. As Latin Americans, I was very offended by this show and the characters are displayed. <br /> <br /> Plus dysfunctional family that has been done to death. This time, I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times? I thought that ABC will come to its senses and pull the piece of debris from the air, but, unfortunately, we will have to digest this as they do not "jump the shark". <br /> <br /> In my opinion, they have already made.
