Cliche wounded soldier home from the war are given blunt treatment. Sorry wonderful cast, acting within its high capacity, can not redeem "Returning Soldier" from his tight collar, the inability to move the viewer's emotional involvement. The best moments, as another reviewer noted that, when it comes Glenda Jackson on the screen; but crackling good cinematic power even Jackson could not pull the chestnuts of the film from his cold, sun-heated hearth. Ann-Margret, it is from sex kitten standing and too often blamed for lack of acting ability, it is the actual and deep enough capacity is wasted here - in spite of her conversation with the perfect close to the Middlesex-emphasis. Template evaluation, fragrant many dull miniseries plastered-on saccharine emotionality is irritating odds with the emotional remoteness script blocking, and overbaked formalism direction; at his expense, and the script and the direction of the corset, with the exception of "The Return of a Soldier" has all the necessary bits, but he can not get them to work together.
