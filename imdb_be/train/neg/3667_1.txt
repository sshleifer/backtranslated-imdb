Opening scene "explains" why Hurt later "immunity" to the "dirty man". It is a pity that nothing explains more: How did he get what he "caught" / it was / why it works so quickly. Then we go to the Â«Present Day Budapest." Well, a knife in the past or in the future? It turns out that the past is, of course, but within a minute it looks just as likely to be the second of the movie moved to the beginning. Unfortunately, I had to pay more attention to, huh? Or maybe it's just poorly done. Then a lot of confusion about the various jobs he had in related fields, and, finally, to mention how he was going to die from an original experiment in n s done it. Aha! Thus, n s and the private sector have come together to poison one of his best men, to observe the effects? He must have been one of the top guys, he is friends with EO Chemical Company, for God's sake. Then there is the substance itself: Technically, this is a poison, but it mutates in immune "carriers", so that we can have whatever we want; poison, disease, allergic reactions, all very different things in real life. Magically, it is not contagious from one victim to another dying, only from the media. How convenient. Then there's the h g u t protocol: They jump into a situation, not having the slightest idea what's in store, or how to prepare for it. Did the producers do not have enough money to show the correct washing down after the crew had just left the scene of the death of an unknown substance? I kept thinking, Hurt was going to die from bad cleaning technique, and an open stage to get closer still.
