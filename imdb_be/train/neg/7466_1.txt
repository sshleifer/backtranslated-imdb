Wow. Some movies just leave me speechless. This is undoubtedly one of those movies. When I left the theater, not one word came to my mouth. All I had was an incredible desire to close my head against the wall of the theater to help me forget the past half hour. Unfortunately, it did not work. To be honest, this film has nothing to recommend it. Humor was the first-class level, in the best case, the action was too reckless, and the plot was far-fetched astronomical. I hearby promise to never see another movie starring Chris Cattani or any other cast beam with SNL.
