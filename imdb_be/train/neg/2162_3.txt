I do not believe that all the praise for this film. The game and the film was a rip-off with Detective. Michael Caine would he, Olivier, and Reeves wanted was Caine. Caine even had the audacity to make a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law plays its original role. Jude Law? Do you mean the one that made the remake of "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> This film was made during Kane's career, when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts. He will do anything for money. He will star in such award-winning films such as this, and "For the Poseidon AdventureÂ». What it seems to be behind the wheel of praise for the film Death Reeves. He deserves better than it should be remembered that for a lousy movie. And as Caine. This film can be found in the bin $ 5.97 at Walmart. Along with gems like "The Island" and "accused of Rio."
