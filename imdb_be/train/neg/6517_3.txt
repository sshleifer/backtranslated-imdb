I went to the screening of the film, and while it was a few things that made me laugh, it was a very serious deficiencies. It primarily presents itself as a humorous exploits of real-life divorced trying to find love in Los Angeles. The fact that he turns into a depressing, narcissistic, and unfunny to travel on the history of the love life of the film's director and professional life. Jokes wear thin quickly, and you suddenly find yourself without worrying about how much progress the man's date. The absurdity of the fact that the director at the same time presents itself as an extremely annoying and much character flaws, and then waits to worry us.
