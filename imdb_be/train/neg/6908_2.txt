This series has the potential, but I believe that the budget will not allow him to see that potential. Interesting setting, not different from the "lost" provides a flat after the 1st episode. A number of 6 episodes, could make a convincing 90-minute film, but the creators decided to drag it on and on. Many scenes were unbearably slow and long, the sun moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and does not work as a whole. There were a few characters we care about how their characters do not grow up in a period of time --- well, one had grown a bit. The ending was so terrible, like the rest of the series. Only here is the glory of art and debt decorators, they created an interesting look, too bad writer and director did not have the foresight to do something interesting with this element
