Some unrealistic movie spoilers included. <br /> <br /> From real-life situations, this film continues to disappoint from the outset. I am currently deployed on my second trip to Iraq as an infantry man. This film has nothing next to what will happen in the real life events. From the very beginning, to name a few: vases bomb, EOD members are rolling out solo without any escort, EOD staff sergeant sneaks with VBC, with sleeves rolled up all the time in the needle to where I had to call it quits on my 2 Haji dollar copy, sniper scene. This list will continue, but there is no need to list the things wrong that occur with an interval time of 2 minutes, before more things were wrong; and it was suggested. <br /> <br /> This film is for people and critics to see that they have no understanding or experience or military deployments. <br /> <br /> People with a military background or military knowledge will be disappointed with the inaccuracy.
