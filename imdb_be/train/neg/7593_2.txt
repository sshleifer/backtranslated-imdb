I do not like this film, but I do not think much of the book or that, while praised by many as a "masterpiece", I found lacking character development and inconsistent and illogical in the plot, although it was much more readable than terrible Fante first attempt in "The Road to Los Angeles" is not published to the Phantom became fashionable in the mid 80s. <br /> <br /> I was intrigued to see what the soup Town have such poor ingredients. He worked hard script-wise, to restore many of the shortcomings of the book, but for the money did not save it. There has never been in a movie Ask the Dust, and when he tried to stay true to the book. I believe the stupidity of this film in TOWNE <br /> <br /> In short. We forget.
