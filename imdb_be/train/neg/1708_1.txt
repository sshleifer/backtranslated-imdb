Well, I'm really not too much to say about this movie, apart from that I have seen over 4000 movies in my life, and more than 2,300 of them were horror movies. Although I have some difficulty in deciding what is the best (as opposed to my favorite, which I can tell you, George A. Romero's DAWN dead), I can tell you and straddle that Todd is Sheetsa ZOMBIE BLOODBATH absolute worst horror movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is not just nothing positive I can say about this film. Action, dialogue, direction, makeup, music ... Every aspect of this film is just so far below what is acceptable, that it boggles my mind that it was ever even released. <br /> <br /> Even if you are the horror or zombie movie completist, please heed my warning and do not waste your time on this garbage. There is no pleasure to be derived from watching this. You will not even get a laugh with a complete lack of talent on display ... Believe. Please.
