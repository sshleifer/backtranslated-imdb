Poor. Poor. Poor. These three lines to summarize this shitty little film that could only attract idiots children and their parents in the movie. ... and his # 1 movie in America! That this country thinks? Mike Myers is more like Michael Jackson. Some Chineese lady who sleeps for 3 minutes. Lame plot with dirty jokes. It grotesuque and terrible. If Green eggs and ham come out in 2005. I'm so happy! (Do not) Eddie Murphy and Tracey Morgan probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost-green egg and ham. They will try to chase Sam-I-Am, and it means a guy who runs away with him. (I hope they do not ruin the classic book.) Do not waste time and money, when they saw it.
