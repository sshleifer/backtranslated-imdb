Well, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series, and even Batman Beyond. I even read a comic book Batman now and then. So, as you can imagine - I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was severely disappointed. This series is nothing. He does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like one long TOY advertisements. A lot of depth at all. And what the hell happened to the Joker? Who, in my most humble opinion, is the best Batman villain of all time, and they killed him. I would say that his design was the worst part. In fact, I would say that there was something about this series that was remotely interesting or creative. In short (because, believe me, I could say much more), do not waste your time on the show, or your money.
