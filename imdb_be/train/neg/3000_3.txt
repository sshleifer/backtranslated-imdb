Marty is the school nerd (Simon Skaddamor) sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates, and then in the explosion laboratory (established by them too), where his face scarred with acid. A few years later, all the jerks are invited back to high school (closed) for a reunion. What they do not know what Marty invites them back to kill them. Then the storm begins, they are locked in the school, and Marty begins to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty silly. Murder creative and mountain, and there are some terrible atmospheric shots of deserted school - but that's about it. Humiliation applied to Scuddamore tougher (it is deprived, he has his head dipped in the toilet and gets burned) and just uncomfortable to watch. Given Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after it was released to make them virtually impossible to see. In addition, this film goes out of its way to nakedness. There is a full frontal with Scuddamore (enough for any movie), but one girl decides to take a bath alone ... Once they know the killer haunting them! And then there are a couple that should have sex. This type of film where the killer seems to know where everyone is and can teleport himself to them. It ends with a twist that had me moaning and rolling her eyes, then another turn, which made me want to throw something heavy on TV! Act tolerated - not good, but tolerable. Caroline Munro in this too. She is a very beautiful woman, but not a lot of actresses. <br /> <br /> It gets a 3 for some effective massacres and atmosphere. Otherwise, it is mediocre and forgotten. Scuddamore tragic suicide in this movie gave more attention than it deserves.
