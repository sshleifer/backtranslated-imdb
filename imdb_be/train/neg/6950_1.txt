We all know that even before the broadcast, mini-series, Ron Moore did not Battlestar Galactica. This is normal. This simply means that he has to stand on its own. It can not rely on Battlestar Galactica. If it is any good, it's well on its own merits, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If the reports are true, this is what I wanted to Moore. However, when it rots mini-series, he confounded all the wonderful actors who performed on the screen, not to mention the myriad of outside personnel of the screen. And that's what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series is not a remake. I would not even call it a rethinking. This new production inspired by Battlestar Galactica. This does not happen in the universe of Galactica, the same places, and jargon and technology. This is not to search the galaxy for the thirteenth tribe. It also does not rely on legends and mysteries that lie Galactica. mini-series Ron Moore space-opera action flick with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say, "just a friend" space opera, the action flick. Because, as sites go, it is not enough that the original or even interesting. I could convey all this to you without warning spoiler. But I did not cause that to you. I just hit the most important moment. Ready now? Here it is: Just watch the trailer. He will tell you all there is to the story. <br /> <br /> So, all creations of human person and seek to destroy humans. (I guess they forgot to Asimov's rules again.) They are like the people, so that all the newcomers-we-have thing. At least, there is no travel time. Oh, and a lot of action scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that, when Moore made a draw from Galactica, this ceremonial nod, he left more banal than respectful. I mean, he could not even think of anything of his own? <br /> <br /> From the first few minutes, I would like to see something else. I did not care about any of the characters in Moore, because I could not identify with any of them. This fact hit me in the face when the Cylons attack began. Armageddon on a global scale, and I do not give a damn. How depressing. <br /> <br /> Heroes of Moore, when faced with the insurmountable obstacle, rather than to overcome it, and tucked tail and kept their butts. In the end, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. They have a safe exit, rather than risk their lives to protect others. At least squeamishness Sun apathy. <br /> <br /> But, in the end, the mini-series, Ron Moore was a simple operation without a purpose, a film on the treadmill, always works more anywhere. And I just wanted it to end. And by the time she was finished, my life force was sucked from me. Against my will, I turned into a meaningless, soulless zombies are probably the type to which this mini-series will appeal. I needed to replenish itself. I had, and I swear, it's true that I need to watch an episode of Babylon 5. Two episodes, actually, and I felt much better. And happier.
