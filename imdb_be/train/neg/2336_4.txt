I read some gushing reviews here on IMDb, and thought I would give this film a look. Disappointed. On the positive side male leads are good, and some interesting pictures, but overall the film fails to convince. It seems full of his own self-indulgent values ​​in an attempt to say something significant, but falls short way and the whole picture is unconvincing mess. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that are classified as film noir, which can be determined as follows :. <br /> <br /> «film noir marked by pessimism, fatalism, threats and cynical characters» <br /> <br /> Well, that story here: 3 lost to stumble upon each other with their collective problems, which include yourself mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, arrears and so on, and they conspired together to steal a child and outwit each other <br /> <br /> it would be much better than the movie. when the story limited to abduct more instead of iconic failures kidnappers. I thought that the leading man was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> While some good points, I ended up feeling that I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
