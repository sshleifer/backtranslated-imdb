Phil alien is one of those unusual films where humor is based around the strangeness of everything, and not the actual punchlines. <br /> <br /> At first it was very strange and quite funny, but as the movie progressed, I did not find the joke funny or odd anymore. <br /> <br /> It is a low budget film (it will not be a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but in the end I just lost interest. <br /> <br /> I believe this film will appeal to Stoner, who is currently relishing. <br /> <br /> for anything like that, but it is better to try, "Brother from Another Planet"
