Horror / Sci-Fi, it is interesting, as it is funny. F / X is pretty good ... for what you could see. TV thriller, which is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant scientist, though flawed, that faked stem cell research and manipulate human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark. Horrific results give birth to one hell of a killing machine. A team led by William Forsythe and Tile invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment. Of course, after the laughter and stammering in fear ... Coombs creation, by the way is his own son merged with the hammer released freely to hunt down the one on the colleagues of the same father. Revenge is not always useful. Also starring Elsie Mueller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
