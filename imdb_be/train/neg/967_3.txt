In 1988 PaperHOUSE was billed as a "horror film of human thought." Wow, you can say, sign me up. This thing is a mess. He has every young actress who has a number of 1 to 2. G. Headley with poor UK (dubbed) accent, and history with no chills, thrills and spills. <br /> <br /> This ISN "t even interesting psycho-babble. One will only laugh at their cheap effects and long to display Leprechaun 5. <br /> <br /> The story involves a girl from glandular fever, is slipping in their dreams. What you get is not a good horror film, art house or even a decent after-school special. I found myself after two o'clock point saying..where did my two hours to go. <br /> <br /> The direction of strain, and I wish it could even be pretentious ... something interesting..it seems like the producers were on lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in a dream world things are boring. <br /> <br /> short was not on it.
