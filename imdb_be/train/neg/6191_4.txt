I watched this movie, along with any other adaptation I could get my hands on- including seeing plays- in preparation for some research. The cinematography is very moving as the music. Unfortunately, his life was taken from history. I have never seen such a terrible image of Mr. Rochester. All of its most basic features of the disappeared. Where his mind? Where his passion? Rochester Scott is more like a foil Rochester, Kupala than a character from the novel. In fact, the actor playing Kupala in this adaptation has played hot Kupala while Scott content to break things or just watching the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they were thinking. I would give this movie a little higher voice, based on the excellent music and cinematography, but I honestly can not see this movie is too long due to the performances of George C. Scott.
