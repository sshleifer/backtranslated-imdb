It was not nice to look at. Frank puts all your dreams on the back burner and get normal (boring!) Work just so that his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides that he will make an insulting film about a man instead. Documentary filmmaker must send the camera and just shoot and not to manipulate and annotate with a malicious titles. Bitterness and resentment to the filmmaker stepfather obvious. And boring. The aim seems to be to make Frank seem silly and pathetic, but instead he comes across as the most humane of the 3 signs of a person. <br /> <br /> In fact swab companies are dressed like a much smarter and sharper than it actually is. He left me with an intense dislike for the director.
