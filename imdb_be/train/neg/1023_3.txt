LL Cool J performed much better in this film that I expected! He did an incredible job, which acts as a "renegade," a police officer in the "renegade" department. From the beginning, he does a great job of building the viewer empathy for his character and he's heavy It acts as a kind of «Gentle Giant» -. A man whose rough appearance can scare anyone, but whose heart is clearly the right place from the start - and he's doing a terrific job. He was obviously the best character in the film. <br /> <br /> This, of course, the work is not Morgan Freeman win any awards. After starring in such films as The Shawshank Redemption power this movie was definitely a step down. His role in the Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor - and in terms of the symbols piling put, unfortunately, in the background. There are so many ways to his character (Moses Ashford) could play a more important role. The fact that it was not disappointing and truth down. I expect to see more from him in this film. <br /> <br /> Timberlake had to stay in the music industry. His portrayal of a young journalist badly acted and unconvincing. This film is a typical action movie, which (at least initially) has some similarities with corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past. As a fighter, he has his share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood and intestines. These scenes are usually unrealistic and painfully predictable. Watching the beginning of the movie is very little uncertainty as to what will happen at the end - to think about what you would normally expect in a good Cops / BAD-ments of the conflict - and it has little to do with the real police hunting departure. <br /> <br /> What annoys me the most is how the hero Timberlake behaved during a shootout scene. He begins with a weapon and did not use them. Then, when he finally around to using the one he shoots, as if he had fired a gun all his life. Then he runs out of bullets and a gun - and in 30 seconds, not moving, and nothing - suddenly there are 2 fully loaded gun and extra ammo! Small plot error, as it really ruined the movie for me. <br /> <br /> If what you're looking for is obviously a fictional story in a fantasy world where everything goes well, then you will probably enjoy this film. Personally, it does not matter what kind of movie it is so long for me as it's real. Make me believe that the story is true. This story was so obviously fictional in many ways, I came away feeling unsatisfied.
