"Intensive Care" from Dorna Rouveroy background is easily one of the scariest horror films ever made.This very cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some gusset and a lot of absurd situations.A George Kennedy horror veteran completely wasted, and as a professor Bruckner.The action ' They are pitifully, the action takes place slowly and climax laughable.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma for seven years, and then he wakes up and goes to the bloody unrest. "Intensive Care" is clearly influenced by American horror films including "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" series.The Kill funny dialogues and painful stupid.Still, when you are in the right frame of mind, you can give this piece of trash on the look. you'll laugh until it hurts with this one, you can trust me!
