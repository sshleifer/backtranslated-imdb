This is hands down the worst film I ever remember watching. Everything was incredibly clich√© and backward. Action was awful too. The camera work was not bad, but it still can not redeem it. Writer / director of the film has to suffer from Down's syndrome, if he believes that this film will help his career. I want an hour and a half of my life back that I wasted watching this crap. I'd rather watch grass grow than that. I can not believe, IMDb makes me write 10 lines to leave it, but I feel that this film is so bad that I have to continue to warn others about it. So I came to this film that my friend had asked him of the local library, thinking that it was a movie Kris Kristoferson, which ended with the "disappearance" was the title. I do not know whose fault it was for this garbage that ends up in my a DVD-player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / author of this film better hope that I have ever found him on the street.
