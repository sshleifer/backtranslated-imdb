I look forward to this trip, and was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I'm easily amused on a roller coaster and amusement park. <br /> <br /> coaster part was just fine - and it was all of about 30 seconds, 90 seconds away. <br /> <br /> It was visually dull and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> He is desperately trying to look like a mixture of Indiana Jones is far superior and Space Mountain, and Disneyland, and are not in all respects. <br /> <br /> It was not exciting or thrilling to say the least.
