How can someone say that this film is a comedy ?? If I did not go with my finacee then I would fall asleep, and asked for their money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was as if she was on the wrong set. Most of all I like the chick-clicking, but I hated it. This is the only time I have seen so many clevage and was not included. These costumes were way overdone. Nobody says that more and I do not think they're even. Dancing part was later horrible.My ex told me ... "Do I not like that part? Did I do not think it was sensous? Â»I said yes only to regret her feelings. Now I know why we never married.This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.
