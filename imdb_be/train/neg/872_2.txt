First of all, I waited «Caged Heat», to be on the same lines as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden». Boy, I was wrong! In any case the movie '70s exploitation, "Chix in the chain", or "women in prison". Of course, the plot consists of a handful of women in prison who wear street clothes by the way (quite comical), but nothing happens. <br /> <br /> There is no strong competition, no one tries to seduce a jailer or a doctor, in order to try to escape, and no prisoners will not be issued. There are 2 shower scene, I suspect, simply return the footage, but without fighting erupts Sun / no man deceive here - or anywhere for that matter! Apart from the lack of plot, unconvincing, not nice and flat characters, a few prisoners who managed to escape in fact go back to prison, to "liberate" his fellow prisoners ?? !! <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the film had just finished out of the top of refugees into the sunset ... as opposed to allowing it to continue to disgrace! <br /> <br /> I feel scammed.
