I had such high hopes for this film because I loved the original so much. It seems that Disney, however, trying to perfect the art of bad sequels straight to DVD. They deserve a Razzie. Some of them, in fact. I thought that the idea deserves attention, but the music was absolutely terrible, and the story was not much better. What happened to the great music Disney used to have in his films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. They have made so many great movies over the years, it's really sad that they fell before the resume point, which is not even good enough to put in theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope that this film is not a sign of things to come for the Walt Disney Corporation.
