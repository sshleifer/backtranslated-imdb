I grew up pouring interwoven stories of wrinkles during the chronicles. My dream was that one day the writer came across your child, sitting in the large sofa, reading Winkle time, and would have thought that it would make a strange film. It is sad that the writer has failed, changing the characters, cast in chrome humor, and all with destroying the land. I know this is a difficult task to change the well-loved novel into a movie. But why can not you stay true to the book? Why do you have to change the way the characters think and act? For those of you who have not read the book, pick her up, find a soft couch, and let your imagination run wild.
