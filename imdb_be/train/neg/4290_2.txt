I give this movie two stars because it is teeming with beautiful photograph. Otherwise, it is teeming mainly of clich√©s and stereotypes: mountaineers or dull white dirty fanatically religious or racist torn type white or wise Indians. Indians magical people who are moving around without a sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals, and to read the thoughts over long distances. And so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film I thought that was the point of the film (except showing me beautiful pictures of mountains, log, forest, range animal, free- excellent mountaineers and crazy people in the church). <br /> <br /> story touched a number of issues, but did not investigate any of them in depth. It was not a story about growing up during the depression, nor that of the orphan, nor to combat identity. He was trying to be all these things and many others, making it superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film was supposed to be the formation of trees, we know almost nothing about it. He was given a brief overview of the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and distilling demonstration; I tried to cut the wood itself (where it has failed) and whiskey work (literally); learn to read (and possibly write) with the help of her grandmother and vocabulary - and that was it. Apparently, he had not learned a lot during his stay in the boarding school, because he was locked in the attic. <br /> <br /> However, the grandparents and the character of Graham Greene made it so that in the end a tree was a very spiritual person, the main aim of which, as an adult - after, and I'm paraphrasing here "riding with the Navajo" and "will fall in a few wars" - was a "catch up" with his grandparents and the character of Graham Greene in the sky (instead of, say, love the girl, marry, who have a child or other such nonsense). <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I must say that I found the commercial offensive grandfather. Why, of all things, it must be the whiskey until now? To counteract the stereotype of the "drunken Indian"?
