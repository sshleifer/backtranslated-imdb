... it would be something that you have received. <br /> <br /> Words alone can not describe how bad it is. If you have any problems with the pop dream it and I guarantee that you will be in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowry was a very good actor in 40s--, but he calls it here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowry was bent out of range of the camera, because his belt was too tight! Duncan himself more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder-- actually it is more like a man in the thirties, waiting Lowry push so he could wear a big coat. <br /> <br /> Driving Batmobile, it seems that a lot of used cars rolled Honest Ella on the label below the price-- Dynamic Duo Sun put a lot of effort to hide the fact that this is a car of Bruce Wayne driving-- they actually is It was noted by several characters throughout the serial. <br /> <br /> Effective wooden-- many are cheap-- dialogue is terrible, and even if they had followed the script I am sure that he read the line, "Batman says something here," because it Of course, it seems that they do so, as it goes along. <br /> <br /> Batman's utility belt is made of fine cloth bags without visible gadgets-- keep him in one scene where Batman needs a full size blow torch manufacturers simply tuck alone, like a scene starts-- never seen. Its fairing so bad that he can not even see out of it, and his ears are more like Flopsy mopsy angry easter bunny, than they do anything batlike. <br /> <br /> In one scene (I'm not making this up), Batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that lit up the second it is exposed to air, as the mercy of some hoods. This radioactive so that he can trace the cause of it-- it's so easy to ignite, is not explained. Well, unfortunately, the thugs to open the package in a cardboard warehouse-- we know that this is part of the cardboard, because Batman sneaks in and pushing the boxes that look weighs about six ounces per hoods to knock them out-- and soon the whole place burns to the ground. Thanks to Batman! <br /> <br /> In another scene after the Batmobile disabled, Batman flag down passing motorists in the middle of nowhere and takes his car-- leaving the person to stand up for yourself and tell him not to worry because if Batman smashes police car, of course buy him another one! Yes, you guessed it, said the car rolls off a cliff in a few short seconds. Not that it matters much to the motorist, who probably died of exposure trying to stomp his way back to Gotham City. <br /> <br /> There is a tired story with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale, who is convinced Bruce Wayne Batman -. She must have noticed the Batmobile parked outside the house-- Bruce or maybe she saw Batman and Robin ran up a walk in a clearly densely populated suburban area <br /> <br /> Everything about this show is bad-- and all but the youngest in the audience will want to throw toast at the screen. If you are looking for a bad movie, you could not hit a mark-- if you want entertainment, try the Burton films Batman, Adam West Batman TV series or earlier Lewis Wilson Batman series.
