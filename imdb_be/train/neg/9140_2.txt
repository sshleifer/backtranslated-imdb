Uh - not what to say. This is a film that can be very good with lots of stones spectators. Some actions reminded me of the beginning of the sentence John Waters. Maybe I should take it back. - I do not want to insult the ability of the Waters as a director / narrator <br /> <br /> I especially loved the lawyer, taking on the "full faith and confidence" clause. This is the "full faith and credit", by the way! <br /> <br /> It also reminds me of Â«The Conrad Boys," where the main actor is also a writer, director, editor, etc. Those sorts of multi-layered part of the enterprise, such as what is probably best left to a very experienced film professionals, who will have the technical ability (though stuntmen, some might say) to pull something like this off.
