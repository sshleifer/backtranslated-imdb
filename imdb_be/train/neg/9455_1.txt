Well, I think I know the answer to this question. For the money! We were so bombarded Cat In The Hat and advertising products that we almost believe that there must be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give him a chance. Well, I have to go with your instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood trash. It proves once again that the average person can be programmed to believe what they say well, should be good. Besides annoying the fact that the film only lasts about 80 minutes, he apparently began with a moth eaten scenario. He is full of failed attempts mindless humor and terrible pastel landscapes. He jumps around the world, without purpose or direction. It is then mixed with, ............................ yes, I'll say it, BAD IV! I could not help but feel that I was watching «Coffee Talk» on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Cat was designed for middle-aged Jew? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning was no any prize, but Mr. Myers to disappear under a rock somewhere, until it is ready to make another movie Austin Powers. F-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!
