First of all, Jenna Jameson Best Actress in this film, and it is just terrible. This film has all the horror cliches to move in the view, and all played badly. Excessive sexual teenage couple. Comic (not) horny athlete. Snotty cool chick. Horrible local color guy. Parent type pairs. Virgin chicken, which amazingly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so terribly painful and come with a deep marsh pools. It's almost like you're regretting that they die early. I have seen a draft of this film a while ago, but somehow, it got worse. Of course, the funniest thing here vampire tries to eat implants Jameson, but hardly even rates for the rental of this dog. Avoid at all costs.
