Unfortunately, I do not remember the book anymore, but I remember that I was fascinated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film is a typical German production of poor quality. He does not hold my attention - though the story itself is good, it is just bad adabted. The suffering of the heart are symbols that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they do not have their nuances in the performances. Even well-known and loved German actor Joachim Fuchsberger and Vortex if can not save this poor sight. However, there is hope ... I say that the film then one gets better and better. Thus, in conclusion, I have to say that this film is not worthy of a cinematic screen, but it can be enough for a lazy afternoon.
