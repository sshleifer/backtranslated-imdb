There is a high level of expectation, when you sit down to watch a comedy with broskomami headed by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. These expectations are supported by even more if the film directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so evident in, among other things, Damn Yankees!, Bedazzled and CHARADE. During the first five minutes or so, it seems that these expectations can be met, and then ??. Never mind. What should be a light comedy, drops in the lead, heavy-handed melodrama, not a drop is worth a chuckle. <br /> <br /> In comparison newcomer Suzie Parker has often been criticized for its implementation, or lack of one, in this film, but in the movie, in which even the great Cary Grant is often flat and wooden striker Parker seems unfair . Not even as bright a light as Hepburn or Doris Day, Audrey could change the fate of the winding, sick and completely nonsensical script that pulls herself unconvincingly along and pulls the viewer's interest and patience to put up with it. <br /> <br /> the rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, keep trying to breathe some life into the process, but a terrible scenario for resuscitation. Desperate, senseless effort to drag half of laughter from the heart numbed the audience in the last minutes of the film serves only to add insult to injury. <br /> <br /> This film is not the same as a big disappointment on all levels.
