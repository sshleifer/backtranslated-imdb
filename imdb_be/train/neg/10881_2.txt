my friend's mother worked in a video store and get pre-view movies before they come out, so when she brought home to a monastery, a horror movie, I could not wait to watch it. Given that it has to be scary, but actually quite fun, I can tell you that in some strange way, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> So, acting is bad, and yes, this is the cheapest film I've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! "What, are you smoking CA-RACK?!" I do not know this movie was even ever released ... I realized that it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yeah, so ... the whole film is very bad (you have to admit that much at least), but I promise that you will get a good laugh out of it. <br /> <br /> * this film kind of sucks, but it's good for a laugh ... especially the guy who keeps the "dagger of despair" .. dagger DESPAAAAAAIR!
