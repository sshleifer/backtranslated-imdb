I came to this film really wants to level it. I thought that the room had a lot of opportunities and ripe for an interesting film. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect that Citizen Kane, I took this as a movie is what it is. Nevertheless, it still fell short of expectations. The historical aspect of the story faded and the end left me a little cold. Action in the film was very wooden. Overall I give it a 4 for a great idea, but the film could kill much higher with a little more attention to make the film base. It is worth seeing? I do not want my two hours ago, but I do not know what I would recommend it to others.
