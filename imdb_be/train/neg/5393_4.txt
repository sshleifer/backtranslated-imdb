I am a supporter of Shakespeare, and I can appreciate the fact that Ken Branagh made to bring Shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers. However, this film falls short pass overall intentions to play with absurd musical sequences. Add that to Silverstone stumbling over dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About Nothing) and other bad actors' role, it is still a painful endurance view.
