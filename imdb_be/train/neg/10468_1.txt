I did not know what to expect from the film. Well, now I know. It was really a terrible movie. The script, direction and acting were equally bad. The story was silly and stupid. The director could make an intelligent and thoughtful film, but he did not. I settled into a chair in the last half of the film, because it was so bad. Where was the focus of the film? Somewhere in this film? Christians should boycott this film, rather than promote it. This was done poorly and waste my money. Do not see this movie.
