I always felt that a good film should have a story. This particular movie was no one, and I feel that it would be more efficient with the plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed, forever; I really like to see it finally ends. However, I just noticed that it's been a long time in all 123 minutes; it felt like four hours. Moreover, there was no story, but the film also did not have a significant conflict. This is not the worst film I've seen, but I said it was, until I saw «The Fast And The Furious». So, do not think that this review of mine from someone who does not need anything other than the action. I really hate the majority of militants today; it's just that this film all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much is really going on in this movie. However, the sets and costumes were good.
