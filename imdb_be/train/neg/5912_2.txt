Who had a Mike Myers preliminary work (Waynes World, and Saturday Night Live) my expectations fraud in 60 years bonds were quite high. This became clear after the first minute, it was an exercise in how to be both frivolous and unfunny as possible. I Świt Chad off after ten minutes. I watched it at the bottom of the second time to see if I had been unfair for the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve year old boy would find it funny. Dialogue is also mbarrassment, Myers painful to watch (Heather Graham) and a sequence of characters, including Fat Bastard makes matters worse. Apart from a slightly funny name and psychedelic staging is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I personally recommend you avoid it like the plague, even though some of my friends liked (perhaps they were blindfolded at the time) .º
