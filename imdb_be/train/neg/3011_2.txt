I was very happy to see this film expecting a visual insight into the relationship of art and the beauty of nature, containing species of wisdom like the "rivers and tides." However, this is not what I got. Instead, I get rather dull film about how one industry is bad for nature. Which is obviously very unorthodox claim. <br /> <br /> photographer seems to contradict the aesthetic quality of its images and the alleged "ethical" duty he has to work sometimes populating images on the periphery. And, frankly, the images were not all that impressive. And according to this "artist" scale it is the basis for what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> In all respects, silly movie. For people who want to feel better about their environmental consciousness ... but not for anyone who would like to think about the complexity of the issues surrounding it.
