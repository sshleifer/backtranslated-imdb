I happen to love the show grows, along with millions of others. So I set to this film, thinking that, if not it would be good, at least a little dazzling and fun. <br /> <br /> wrong! I just have to wonder at the end of Charlie's Angels was really that sad? I do not remember, as such. But this film is just as bad as the films of this type can be, bore little resemblance to the excitement of this period of time and shows. I see it all, despite the negatives, it was not unwatchable. But it was very soft, I do not blame the artists for all, especially women, who have played the angels, they really like them. The film just was not that interesting. He tried to make every Angel "symbol". (One angel in the evil one is the "good girl", one is her husband ....), all the characters were depicted with one main characteristic of their definitions and shallow depth of stereotypes. The excitement of the show and there was no dialogue was .... dialogue. That's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> I do not awful. Not the worst of television films. But missable.
