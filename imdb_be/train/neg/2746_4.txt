I was afraid, and his nephew in this film, because I do not think it will be good. Children between the ages of 6 and 10 were set to see him, so I gave up. I must admit that it was not as bad as I thought, but still far from the book. The film seemed to be right on the understanding and sense of humor in the 10-year-old in. I found that 6 years realized what was happening, and he represented the resolution of issues that have taken place. In the end I had to explain that sometimes a movie does not show the best solutions to problems, because it is more interesting to see what happens if they do "stupid" or "dumb" choice.
