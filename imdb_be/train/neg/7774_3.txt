For a good half hour or so, I remember myself thinking, "Hey, this may well be the best achievement of Bill Rebane, ever." Opening sequence of atmospheric, there several scary moments to enjoy and our director even refer to his notorious bitch "Giant Spider Invasion" in the form of a game. Concept shamelessly stolen from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill with" three old and very sad millionaire lured nine lost in an isolated mansion to win $ 1 million in the elimination game. Naturally, the participants begin to quickly and one zero one, and it takes the remaining greedy Bonehead too long before they know how old people are sadists ... there is one killer among them. The film begins and ends with an odd storyteller told many meaningless things, which is not relevant or even interesting plot, but there are some interesting T & A to admire in the first ten minutes, and dumb dummy (Shelley, I believe it is called) is really fun to watch . After the first half, of course, inevitably occurs and "Cold" is transformed in the textbook production with rebuys late plot twists, fairly clever dialogues ever and a complete lack of emotion. There was no budget for the bloody murder sequences, but our multi-talented director (?) Trying to make up for it with an endless drive dancing footage and amateur rock band. The film also has a four or even five different climax and none of them are a little bit of satisfaction. Maybe it was the inspiration for the LOTR: Return of the King? Avoid this film, you will live longer and happier.
