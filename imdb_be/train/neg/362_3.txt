Not to be confused with the film Madonna «The Next Best Thing», «The Last Big Thing» silly, campy, off-the-wall comedy about a man who wants to start a magazine called «The Next Big Thing», which considers a variety of and-coming artists. This low-budget indie makes "Chuck and Buck" looks like a masterpiece. Rich lousy action, bad sets and costumes, etc., «... Thing» has earned horrible reviews and to date only one has been nominated for awards fringe. Pass on this one.
