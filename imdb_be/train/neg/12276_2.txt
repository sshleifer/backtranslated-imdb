The film has a lot of potential, unfortunately it collapsed because of weak / implausible storyline, miscasting, and a general lack of content / material. One of the most obvious shortcomings is that Sean Connery, who played the Arab people did not know how to pronounce his own Arabic name! This may seem like a small flaw, but it points to an apparent lack of effort to pay attention to detail. The quality of a uniformly well below average. <br /> <br /> single saving grace Movie was a turn in the plot at the end; and the French song (I do not remember the name). Overall, it was a very bad movie where Sean Connery was clearly miscast.
