For the love of god, please do not watch this movie! Its a waste of time, the plot is predictable, like the romantic scenes. Trying to build too little, this film and its predictable evil villain just lame. Characters are not developed, and most of the film is laid with the arrows in Rome, which is much more interesting than the actual film. On top of all this, the current mess. I know that everyone is trying to find its niche, but it's really a disaster. I can not believe that someone actually paid but many millions of pounds to put the film on the screen. Do not waste your time and money on this movie, go see your grandma or something worthwhile instead.
