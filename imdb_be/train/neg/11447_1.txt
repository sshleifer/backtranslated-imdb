It is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen; I was ready to leave after the first ten minutes. The only people in the theater were laughing tweeners. Do not get me wrong, I love stupid, stupid movies as much as the next gal, but the whole premise, writing and humor smelly. It seemed to me that they were going to touch "Napoleon Dynamite" - strange and random scenes that could lead to a cult audience. Instead, they were eventually forced, awkward and weird. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher, and I just felt very badly that she (and Sissy Spacek) Subscribe to this terrible thing. <, Br /> <br /> Thank Gosh I have not paid for it.
