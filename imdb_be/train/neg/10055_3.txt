I grew up in the theater version of "Superman II» ( «s2t») and, as a child, I loved him more than part I, because it not only contains more than Superman and Superman are three types of villains, he crashed? ? Best Clark Kent Superman conversion and rescue scene. Children no longer have to eagerly wait for Superman to appear on the screen as in Part I. Now, as an adult, I can see how powerful fallen from s2t (see my review). I have always heard about the back-story of they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the director of the original Richard Donner from part II. (It was rare then shoot two separate films at the same time, it is now the general: "Back to the Future" and "The Matrix" 2 and 3, for example) Unfortunately, after finally seeing Richard Cut Donner (or "S2RD" ) I still can not fully recommend it. Ushlite was a big change Superman scene, saving the whole of Paris, as it was an excellent repetition of Part I in the opening s2t in. In fact, they are all but wrote the word: "Earlier on Superman ??" in S2RD. The special effects were not great either Part I or s2t, but S2RD, they were mostly quite ridiculous ?? such as Lois fall of Daily Planet window. I admit, some new scenes worked and some took greeted deviation, such as any scene in the "honeymoon". In general, if you grew up on s2t, like me, and loved him as a child ?? Sun nitpicking, like me, as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD, as it is almost a completely new experience of childhood with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: Gone also surprisingly amnesia s2t kiss replaced by exactly the same as the end of «I.» It is not only lazy, unoriginal excuse, it does not make sense why Clark would like to come back to this diner if these events actually happened. And he will continue to "turn back time" for each opposition?
