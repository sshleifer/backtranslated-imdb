bad film. There's no other way to tell. History of weak and outdated, especially for our country. I do not think most people know what a "walker" or will not care. I felt as if I was watching a movie with the 70-ies. The subject was simply not believable that in 2007, even when installed in DC. I think it rang true for everyone else who watched it as well as the applause was low and fast at the end. Most of them do not stay for a Q & A. <br /> <br /> I do not think I really thought Schrader film ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed to be broken, as if they had not done, or he just does not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another, and you had to try to figure out or guess what's going on. I really did not get Woody (Carter) or private lives, too. Who were all "art" male bondage and torture photos (Iraq prison) about? What was he thinking? I think it was his very weak attempt to try to create this dark personal subculture life for the character Woody (Car). It is not worked. He even seems to have no meaning in reality. <br /> <br /> the only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (the car) perfect. you really get a great feeling that is a "walker" can be both (say, twenty years ago). It was a great, and most likely, Fang will not be recognized for it. <br /> <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Christine ... sad. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it! That hurt! If you're not a true fan Harrelson .
