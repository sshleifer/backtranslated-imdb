I wonder whether there is any sense of meaning in this film. Its a big joke. Well .. His entertaining .. You can see the most stupid storyline played very seriously as a film .. I wonder what a group of audience, the film mainly focuses on. <br /> <br /> Priety (and pro) plays a surrogate mother for the happy couple Salman / Rani, who want a child, but can not. I wonder how it would be if this was a real life drama taking off from life. <br /> <br /> Rani this pair seems happy with another pretty lady in her home, brought up in, to make a child for her and Salman. She cares about Priety and tries pushing her husband in Salman, moreover, that they can have some romance. If the viewer get bored with nakhras Salman. <br /> <br /> While a good past time, this film is unbearable. Absurd.
