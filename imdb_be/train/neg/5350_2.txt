Yeah, talk about the bad sequels. Rick Moranis star in this terrible third for the once-a funny and entertaining "Honey I Shrunk the child." The concept basically played the same way as in the first film, but the adults instead of children being shrunk, and the inner house instead of the garden as a universe to explore. If you think it sounds interesting, think again. The film is boring at best, just an embarrassment at worst. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity of the series completely flushed down the toilet. The only remaining of the first film actor, apparently Rick Moranis. The actress playing his wife has changed, the actors playing children have changed, they play neighbors have changed ... you name it. They try to make us believe that this is the same family, but the results confused, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the history of a rehash of the first, with not one bit of originality. All a few jokes (and barely any) and dangerous situations shown in the film simply copied directly from the "Honey I Shrunk the Kids." <br /> <br /> The third problem, special effects. I am sure that it was done on a small budget, but they are helpless, the way is much worse than the ones that appear in the rest of the series. You have to admire the awe these little figurines explore an extensive hinterland, but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem is to find the action inside the home just boring. Few things happen and when they do occur, they do not care at all. The first film was fun because the kids were dealing with nature, grasses and bugs that live in it. In this, adults (which come as a rather boring compared to children) have to deal with dust, cockroaches and cockroach trap. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the idea of ​​releasing a sequel is already dying a banal series turned the heads of Disney, with the exception, perhaps, because they need to earn without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I warn you: leave this tasteless presence in the trash where it should stay: dust on store shelves.
