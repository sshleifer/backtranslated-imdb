Good Earth is not a great film any means, it is a way ordinary. Maybe it was different in the 1930s, but who would like to see a farmer's life. It's not very interesting to me. So, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job, which is acting, but the film was too long. I could tell you the ending of this movie in the first act. Briefly Van Loon (Mooney), a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father, is exactly like him. Both fall in love with their wives just as they are in pursuit of dying. The film does a complete 360 ​​transition from one generation to another. In addition, this film does not have a good character actor and funny moments, it was just depressing things lasting farmer during the crisis.
