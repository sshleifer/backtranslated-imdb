I hate this show! Was there ever another emollient quality, an interesting punchline, or one section of the line that "no" to make the average viewer wants to drown himself in a bowl of uncooked cereal? <br /> <br /> voice. Oh, those terrible, pitiful voice. It appears repeatedly dragging a lot of small cutlery on the dusty chalkboard, each character is irritating uniquely in its ability to shrill, nasal vocals. Cosmo sounds like whining curs, by Vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew, and those the father makes every line sound like a bad incarnation of a game show host (Guy Smiley from "Sesame Street" comes to mind). <br /> <br /> animation is terrible; even the manufacturers "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at the overwhelming majority of bad art in this show. Each character has a step-down teeth, or a square head or head three sizes too large for his body. And what with the fact that the characters speak each line, wide-eyed and grinning as if posing for a photo session with the president? Then, there's the fact that every character on the show completely stupid. Nia as thin Amelia Grace Bedell, Homer Simpson, and Buddy Lembeck from "Charles in Charge" fame were portrayed as unrealistic characters dumb. Usually "unreal" is synonymous with "unfunny" and it is most definitely in this case. There was not so much a farce based on the ignorant, as the "Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at the very least, Leslie Nielsen was good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the room shows (and this is because each episode, so big time spoiler ready here): Timy wants something from him two "Fairly OddParentsÂ», something goes wrong, there is always some kind of far-fetched reason why he can not immediately change course and to ward off the damage, and then everything turns out just fine in the end. Oh, and on a side note, parents Those never believe him when he complains by Vicky, and they continue to use it at every opportunity. Maybe it's just me, but I think that shows children having a subtle message that pretty much does no good at all to say about the offensive nanny, probably not a great idea. <br /> <br /> If you write an article and want to give an example of how far the quality dropped "Magic parents" cartoons must be a great place to start. A striking example of television producers of throwing together a useless product, aimed at children with little or no effort, simply because they know that someone somewhere is watching.
