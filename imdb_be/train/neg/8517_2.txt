The biggest secret of Veronica Mars is not the one that she had to decide on the screen. <br /> <br /> Most of all, the mystery of why this is a long-term ratings of frustration is still on the air. This week marks the nadir for Veronica Mars: It takes 146 out of 146 shows in more than 6 (soon to be more than 5). Yes, you read that right. Veronica Mars was beaten every show of right now defunct WB and every show on UPNE. He beat all shows on Fox and, of course, all the shows on ABC, CBS and NBC <br /> <br /> Now, hip hypesters going to say. But it was a re-run. But everything on TV that week was largely re-start! It is puzzling why the CW mind would have chosen it was disappointing ratings as one of the few shows that saving on behalf of the participant. <br /> <br /> It is clear what is happening behind the scenes. Favorable exchange takes place and influence extended. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? "Veronica Mars has the potential" line is clearly dead, it was two years to establish themselves and could not do it. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the influence of the flap and Joel Silver, but to be honest, I'm puzzled why someone decided to hold its impact on the poor show that no viewers are not watching. <br /> <br /> big secret and is very unfavorable for the debut of CW.
