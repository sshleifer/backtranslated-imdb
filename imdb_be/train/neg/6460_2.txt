* Can someone tell me where COMEDY ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian (Thomas Haden Church) looks so weak (as), and all this so thickheaded! <br /> <br /> * They tried to make a living comic book, which was a super bloody nightmare comics, and it was not even funny? How to plan the scene in the bathroom; it was so well with his cinematic fantasy, but there is nothing more .. except it hurts! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! His relationship with his daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * It's actually kind of work they did it just did it, and make some money from it, but it has become such an offense, if the money will be robbed from the us fool who was so low the work of art and entertainment was absolutely no entertainment AT ALL! <br /> <br /> Well, it would be ugly when it was a big production and starring Brando in his golden years with a real star. <br /> <br /> * Tire family here. Just be aware of this! <br /> <br /> Anyone who found himself admiring the film or -God Forbid- love it! Then you should go directly to the therapy before becoming more dangerous and anyone else! Hurt <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but the film is not so! And he was not going to be alone in here after reading this for sure !! But the real big problem that no one has ever worked in this case does not try, or the desire to be a reasonable short time or even good !!! (Unfortunately, I'm crying right now hurts the film is incredible!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) Impact (Mira Sorvino) on shoes! It was so realistic !? Maybe he saw himself in it so he punished himself for being in this shit! <br /> <br /> * For a billion times: This one could have been better (or worse less!). The script, by train robbery, it was nice, and I just thought they'd run to have some kind of pursuit, as another (Smokey and the Bandit), but with (Brando) is the sheriff. In fact, any of these chimeras was very merciful than what I saw! <br /> <br /> * Why this masterpiece has not received any awards Razzie ?! You want to make me believe that it was lower than the movie THIS? I do not think so! This is a situation where the head of the Razzie in itself should win one for his oversight !! <br /> <br /> * Martin Sheen also here as a guest star, possibly, for the support of his refusal to son, but, ironically, his father was a failure, as well as his son! and why is it ?! Well! Because I hate Martin Sheen maybe more than I hate comic movies were not as good as his ambition! <br /> <br /> * This is not a comedy film, NO .. This one fear !, and I hate horror movies, especially those that have been promoted as a comic one! <br /> <br /> * The name of the good thing about it? Mmm! Well, this one compared to the other monster movie Marlon Brando (The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996) would be close to (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: if you still want to know what or who is bad, ugly and very ugly in this movie .. Just pray your last prayers and go look .. May God help you!
