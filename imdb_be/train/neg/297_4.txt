For the record, this film is intriguing, but hardly original. In 1998 film starring Talia Shire called the hostess was almost exactly the same story, but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> The history of Amanda Lear was a bad life, abusive father, horny doctor, mental homes, etc. she finally came out of the happy home under the guidance of his perverted doctor ... who she anal abuse and kill the poor thing. (Now that was original) Doctor financed mansion for her before she killed him and buried in the backyard of the suction cup. After moving in, she falls in love with stud named Richard, who just happens to be married to a blues singer. If you've seen the hostess, you know, everything else, it kills or tries to kill anyone who gets between her and Richard (including road). <br /> <br /> Most of the idea came from the previous film, the same idiot sidekick who puts his nose, just spying on a guy with a bowl of popcorn same flight bodypress. He had some original material, a beer bottle was a tough thing. The highlight of the film was beautiful breasts Amanda in the hot upper stage. Several of the robbery, but not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
