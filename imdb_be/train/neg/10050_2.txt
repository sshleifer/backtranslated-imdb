Huge disappointment from writer and director Dante Hamm. Their previous collaboration on the first season of "Homecoming" was distorted and angry cheerful in all the right directions. This ill-treatment with an intriguing left me at a loss. The apparent "bribe", specifying the general alien extracting something from the infected brain of psychopaths was totally unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the story point has been unearthly "cleansing" of the planet is the human invasion, why do they go about it in such a wanton and sadistic misogynist fashion? Why not just start a completely lethal virus a la Stephen King «The Stand» instead of the male population Butcher females? I continued to hope that this episode will be improved, as I continued to watch, but it just got more pretentious and stupid. Religious overtones just seemed forced, but it was clear, Sam Ham, I must have thought that it was deeply by weight he gave it. I like a lot of work as Dante and Hamm, but that was just unwatchable.
