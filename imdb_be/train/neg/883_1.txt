The problems associated with this film a lot, but I will try to mention the most glaring and annoying ones. First of all, while the topic provides a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality is that all, as usual, in the movies and on television, it was something strange, usually of a sexual nature. Storylines were thin or non-existent, and in almost every scene, the camera shot, line of dialogue, and expressed their emotions were absolutely and completely false. It finally reached the point after an hour so in the mind numbs the garbage that I went (something not uncommon for me in recent years.) I would guess fi9lm was sent some outs fall wannabe film director from a third-year film studies program, but I think that (one-time, pre-Amelia, talented) director Mira Nair took part in this hideous parody, so perhaps directing talent in America left en masse into the cloaca.
