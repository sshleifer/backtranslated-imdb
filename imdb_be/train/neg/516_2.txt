Have you noticed how in later films laughter Burt Reynolds sounds like screeching brakes? <br /> <br /> It must be hanging out with Hal Needham too much. <br /> <br /> And from the looks of «Stroker Ace», too. <br /> <br /> you can assume that it was based on a book? Neither I could, but it was. And probably not the best seller, I'll bet. <br /> <br /> Bertha another good-old boy in the NASCAR circuit, which is a hitch with Beattie as fried chicken magnate with his team on the project. Anderson ensures that there is a love interest and Nabors makes his cell Gomer Pyle impression as a true mechanic / best friend tips. <br /> <br /> A lot of people here are members Bert or Halley. Others had the necessary work. And even the real NASCAR drivers get in on the action, and look to have more talent than those with a SAG card. <br /> <br /> As far as laughs go, Bubba Smith (previously "Police Academy") receives them as the driver Beatty. And Petersno in full Elvira mode, a lot of grateful Leers as a lady who wants to learn the tips are really good. Real good. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Bert threw as much time and effort in the film as «STROKER Ace», where it did not matter whether he worked or not to act. They do not bother to write a character for him, why act? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for Petersen, and at the end of doubles. Now they're funny.
