That the Americans and their religious hang gobbledy-Sound? Thinking it was the best-selling novel is incredible, but to pull it out like a movie you really need a good action and a script that delivers. In this case, all the good actors went up to heaven, and we are left with Kirk Cameron as CNN reporter type (!) Trying to figure out why so many people just disappeared. Oh yes, there is a plot of an evil world conspiracy and hunger, or something. The good news is that it is so cheap, and so senseless dialogues, it has the obvious entertainment value in all its involuntary laughter. Not recommended for those with a 3-digit IQ.
