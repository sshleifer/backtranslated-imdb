The first part, Che in Cuba, on the part of his life. It contains too much indistinguishable battles and Che servants too much indistinguishable wounded (remember that Che was a doctor). It ends, like Castro wins the revolution; Che never gets in Havana. The second part of Che in Bolivia, is about guess what. It contains too much indistinguishable battles and Che servants too much indistinguishable wounded. <br /> <br /> When I realized that it had to be "epic" (I never knew * nothing * but the name before it began), of course, I thought of the greatest epics of all, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. . Moreover later <br /> <br /> Do not be racist, but aside from that I have already mentioned the fact that there are too many characters that are, well, invisible - unknown Hispanic actors who look like, especially considering all of them are «Che» beard and all wear Che tires. This leads to the viewer, without being able to identify with someone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very minor role). While del Toro's stunning to think "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only great character :. A lot of Alec Guinness, nor Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Sun, etc. You get the idea <br /> <br /> As the other characters are interchangeable, this leads to a loss of links. If the principal assistants killed Che, you do not feel remorse because you do not know who they are. Even if Che was killed (I do not think it's a spoiler), no sympathy from the audience - he had just killed <br /> <br /> It is too one-dimensional applies to man .. Moreover, that the revolutionary and second only to Jesus in morals, the only thing we know about Che is that he is married with five children (he says another symbol, which is closer to the end). That was his motivation? A complete mystery. <br /> <br /> Maybe Soderbergh deliberately imitating Lean. Soderbergh's Che, of Lean never allow us to know anything about Lawrence of Arabia mystery man. But, at least, Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness, Quinn). He was as bold as it was dangerous - that is, were human qualities. Che, like a machine, about as warm as the Terminator. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year, there was another war epic, Mongol. Che does look Mongol It's a Wonderful Life.
