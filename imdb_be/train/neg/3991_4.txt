I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie, and cheated the poor Stevie Wonder in the ever combined his beautiful music with this theatrical mess. I, too, resent the way he uses profanity as part of the normal professional prose Blacks. Abuse of its content on ethnic movie lovers it's a shame. Scenes that seem contrived and blue and have nothing to do with the topic or subtopic, play as if some college kid wrote it. I especially hate the ridiculous scene where the two wires playfully sparring for no reason at all, and the cops come and rough to Snipes. Replays of the findings makes you feel as if Spike has no respect for its audience, or he has no idea what the film is all about. The final scene seems to be cast in order to justify the use of a sledgehammer to tack point. This film also supports the myth that all men of culture to use the F-word in casual conversation. I hope he will understand that the rest of his films are in the same pool as this, where it does not grow as a filmmaker. I think that his alliance with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move. He should stick to making documentaries like four little colored girls. Shock films do not make the Oscar.
