Female country singer nicknamed «Big T» - seriously, that's what they call it - risking her promising musical career and his life, getting into the company slovenly drunkard (Busey), who wants to be her manager . His mother committed suicide, his father was an alcoholic, as well, and he is quick-tempered. You can imagine where this leads. At the same time, there is music in abundance, as Parton, with its liquid-vocal, belts out songs after songs (at least half a dozen of them around Texas). Stay away from this mess and check it in the nine to five or Steel Magnolias instead.
