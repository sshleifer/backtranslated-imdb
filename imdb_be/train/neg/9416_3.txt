Steve McQueen has, of course, a lot of loyal fans out there. Of course, he was a charismatic man, one of the most charismatic big screen has ever known. But even McQueen can not save this turkey of a film that looks like a brownie camera in real locations in St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen's new baby, without conviction led to the planning of the bank robbery of one of the other gangs. There's more than a hint that there is a gay relationship occurs between a young Steve and David Clark. He did not like at all the other members of Heist, mainly because of his lack of criminal summary. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a girlfriend Molly McCarthy, and she suspects that something was afoot, especially when he starts to stick out from Crahan Denton and James Duke, and Clark, it's pretty rough characters. It would, of course, get my suspicions were aroused. <br /> <br /> Robbery Great St. Louis Bank had two director Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim made mostly documentaries and Styx do nothing. One of these two jokers decided to speak to Steve was the best, making a bad imitation of Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This film may go down as the worst ever made Steve McQueen. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions has signed his Wanted dead or alive, because I can not believe that they would have if they saw it. <br /> <br /> Or they would have seen something the public would lose sight of the dressing for this exception turkey.
