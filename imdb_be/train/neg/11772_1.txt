I will be brief ... This film is a challenge for everyone but him cinematographer. The fact that this criticism of the sex tourism industry, seems to act as we do not "treat" the slow dance scene. The plot is not funny, no one but the most ardent supporter of terror BAD get something out of it. And the love of God, please stop saying this movie is a story of innocence lost, or even women's empowerment and capacity, because it is obviously not (children murmur lesbians, what the hell?). this is definitely the worst film at the festival in Edinburgh (that I saw anyway), some even collapsed halfway through the film, probably because they can not take any more. This may seem overly critical tirade, but I really can not find this film to softening, it is possible if you take it in a pure comedy, except. In short, this film is best watched on drug cocktails class A.
