or those who have prayed for the eyes of Al Cleaver fight naked, 7ft tall black guy in a full Nelson, your film arrived! Movie starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Bachfellner) stolen by a group, which require the purchase of $ 6,000,000, which will be delivered to their island hideaway. What they did not count on durable Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cleaver) future film producers hired to save the girl. And the fact that they do not really count on was a local tribe that loves young women offer them a monster ogre god with bloodshot eyes mistakes. <br /> <br /> Much the same filming set of cannibals, the fares a little better when it comes to entertainment value, mainly due to the cheerful dubbing track and incredibly goofy monster with bulging eyes (Franco confirms they were divided Ping Pong balls on interviews disk). Franco EuroCult get a strong supporting cast, including Gisela Hahn (pollution) and Werner will roll (whose death is one of the most head scratching things I've ever seen, like a guy who does not fully show it - in close-up - try be it). In the film, tons of nudity and gore (Tempra variety of colors) are. Highlight was the world to me slowly fistfight between Cleaver and Antonio de Cabo in splashing waves. Unfortunately, Ol Â»Jess is one block to the country (and, at times, painful) 1 hour and 40 minutes, when he has to work 80 minutes top. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Severin DVD looks pretty good, but there are some amazing images going education repetitions during some of the darkest scenes. In addition, a long section of dialogue in Spanish without any submarines (they are an option, but only if you listen to the French track). Franco give a good 16-minute interview about the film and have a much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner, than his cannibals star Sabrina Siani.
