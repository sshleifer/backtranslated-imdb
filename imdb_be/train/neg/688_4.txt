I've always loved McMurray, and ?? Although her career was tragically cut short ?? I think, Carole Lombard fun to watch. Couple these two basic and attractive stars together, add on top of the support of the players, like Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic scenario, their team with a famous director Mitchell Leisen and you get ?? mediocre movie experience. <, Br /> <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) Â«meet cute" during his visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks to fall in love. great trumpeter skid, so he went to a musical career that is predictable in both of his meteoric rise and fall. During his rise to musical fame, he neglects Maggie, which later inspired him to start after it collapse. Ah, yes ?? it is a true Hollywood happy ending, which does not come any too soon. <br /> <br /> Stars and directors of this caliber should guarantee success, but the movie is so predictable and slow, it is difficult to watch at times. The first scene, set in Panama so draggy, they seem to go on forever, and then Skid alcoholic just wander endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole are trying their best, but a tired script and S-L-O-W direction just do not give them a chance. Even the final scene in which Maggie urged Skid rise from the ashes of alcohol and frustration, simply does not ring true. <br /> <br /> This film should see once, to see some early performances with stars MacMurray and Lombardy. However, I guarantee that watching it would seem, takes about 48 hours.
