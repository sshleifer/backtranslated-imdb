I agree with all the above, who said that anything that will convince you to not spend even a brief moment, watching this amazing amateur film. A very bad effect, impromptu production values, fully pedestrian direction and script are so inappropriate and meaningless it had never been written, let alone carried out. Even Hollywood "professionals" seem to go to work only for wages, but none should be paid for this poor performance. Career should instead ended up on this inconsequential nonsense. <br /> <br /> OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad. And Chad Lowe and consistently awful bad.
