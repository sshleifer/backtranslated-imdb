Robert De Niro plays the most incredibly intelligent illiterate all times. This movie is so extravagant talent, it's really disgusting. The script is incredible. Dialogue incredible. Jane Fonda character is a caricature of himself, and not funny. Travel movie on a snail's pace, photographed in a thoughtless manner, and unbearably instructive. It is also embedded in every clich√© in the book. Swoozie Kurtz fine supporting role, but what? <br /> <br /> Equally annoying is the new IMDB typically require ten lines for each review. If the movie is not worth anything, it does not require ten lines of text, so that other readers will know that this is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
