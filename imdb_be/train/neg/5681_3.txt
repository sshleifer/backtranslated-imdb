Once seen and loved Postal (yes, I actually loved Postal), I decided to try another film by Uwe Boll, and I chose the seed, because I happened to stumble upon it at your local DVD-shop, and it should be one of his best films. <br /> <br /> while the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising, and looked like the beginning not too basic psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there, and eventually degrades into one of the most common films Tesakov I've seen so far, including a large number of plot holes, unrealistic emotional reactions and poor actions. It seems that Ball tried my best to come up with a decent story, but after a while just gave it up. Maybe he should follow a comedy? A few good things about this film is that it does not create a general eerie atmosphere that special effects are better than I expected, and the soundtrack is really well with the general ambience, but unbalanced stimulation of the film in conjunction with the complete general nature this makes it the last half an hour is quite tedious to watch, that ruined my experience as a whole. There is a very pretty well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there just the shock value. And let's not forget the camera, which was quite sick at times. <br /> <br /> I hope that Uwe Boll one day learn what makes a good movie, because between the plurality of horrific movies that he does seem to make a decent movie every now and then. Seed is simply not one of them.
