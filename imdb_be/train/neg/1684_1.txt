*** Spoilers *** spoilers *** Spoilers *** spoilers <br /> <br /> There are bad movies and then there are movies that are so terrible that they are affectionately comical in their absurdity. Such is the case with Columbia Pictures' The Grudge. This cinematic atrocity began when otherwise well-intentioned American saw the Japanese made for television movie «Ju-on" and was inspired to remake the film in English. It started a virtual tsunami of bad decisions, around the world, has not yet ashore in Orlando October 21, 2004 <br /> <br /> preconditions, and I use the word loosely, includes a house in Tokyo pursues skinny mom ghost that It looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with her chubby sidekick horrible, annoying, but evil second-grader. Is there anything worse than a terrible 8-year-old Japanese boy? Of course there is! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this fancy clot we have to add a mysterious black cat, who I affectionately named Chim Chim. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you may have guessed that they were killed in the death of domicile and now they want to kill anyone who enters the room. You see, as described in Japanese detective, when someone dies in a rage of a ghost seeks revenge against everyone who comes to the property lines, determined by the district commissioner or something like that, I forgot. <br /> <br /> The story begins innocently enough with the famous theatrical Bill Pullman jumping to his death from the balcony. I think Bill Pullman got the job because of his children asked him to travel to Tokyo Disneyland. Next we withstand mildly interesting saga nurse Yoko, "Oh, no, do not go there," shouts the audience, but, unfortunately, she does not listen and predictably dire warnings put out like a magic lantern. About 30 minutes of the film, we finally see his American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar may be competent actress, but I could not help but think of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so it was distracting. This is equivalent to saying that Aniston star in the film about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try as you may, you just can not stop thinking about another project, which made her famous. But I digress, Karen, a nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver, who disappeared in ghosts r us. <br /> <br /> She Snoop around, meet with ghosts, coma lady dies, and some other things happen. Watching fair hair fox in search of keys, I half expected her to find a ghost and pull his mask to show that this is actually an old Gower, who had abandoned amusement park! "I would have gone with it too, if it were not for you to interfere with children and that your dog! <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who claims to be the Ed Wood of Asia, made two unsuccessful decisions related to sound. first, he chose to use the sound recording only when someone is going to kill him. it's a great Develops for occlusive any uncertainty, because the public gets two minutes warning to prepare for other accidents predictable murder. Secondly, he gave Spook Country throaty sound that sounds like a gopher Gargling. After f lma, I heard a few people who leave the theater makes the sound of laughter. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the only survivors. And, of course, we know that she set the fire to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter. However, taking into account the comic audience reaction, they do not want a sequel, but an apology. «The Grudge» can be easily edited in a comedy, perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value. Of Baring, it will go down in history as the greatest cinematic thriller as "Godzilla vs. Megalon. I would suggest to wait until the movie comes to a local discount theater where he can get the public ridicule so richly deserves.
