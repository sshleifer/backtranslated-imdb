I do not remember a movie where I'm less worried about where the characters came from, what happens to them or where they are going. I understand that the greatest pastime of Hollywood is the navel of dreams, but these people are either too cowardly or too boring to take the time to. For what it's worth, however, the discussion, and then the show under the auspices of the series Key Sunday Cinema, made supplement that may have three women, and show some redeeming characteristics. I do not agree.
