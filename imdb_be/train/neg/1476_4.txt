It's pretty formulaic swords and flying fists movie decent early talent show John Woo. The cinematography is excellent and some of the work of the sword is really incredible. Unfortunately, the work of the film under the weight of dull stories and defiantly low budget (check out some of setbound fight, if you doubt me). Nevertheless, it is worth a look, especially if you can catch Letterboxed.
