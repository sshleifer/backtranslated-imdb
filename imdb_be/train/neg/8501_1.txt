<br /> <br /> This movie sucks big time. It reminded me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I also found very sad. And «Semana Santa» in all respects poorer cinema. <br /> <br /> Only one penalty in the cast to do something for this movie Alida Valli. Alida is one of the great old movies in European history. I loved her manic views in "Suspiria" and "Inferno" (Dario Argento). I'm not going to spend more time dealing with this film. I will say one good thing about this film ... use it if you want to go to sleep very quickly ...
