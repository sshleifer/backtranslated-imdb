I'm a fan of Columbo, especially in the rainy Saturday, and it was interesting to see, Oskar Werner after 451 degrees Fahrenheit, but this episode was very lacking. The original story and plot twists were obvious and could have known how to advance, even years before the modern detective shows today. But it was interesting to see the crazy pictures couches and "modern" electronic equipment and, of course, required a suburb of humor poking fun at modern art for sale. High-tech house version of Jetson-th or a Disney Tomorrowland, and fun to think about writers invent this "strange stuff". <br /> <br /> When it sunny outside, to play, because there is a much better Columbo episodes. Nevertheless, we should be grateful for cable television, these episodes are broadcast.
