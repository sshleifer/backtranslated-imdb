A Nightmare on Elm Street: The dream child, the fifth contribution to Nightmare on Elm Street series and the continuation of the worst ever in the series, is even worse than a nightmare on Elm Street 2 I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday, and I was watching all the extensions. The child sleep was the worst, no doubt, I was surprised too, because they do so well with the last two sequels. But I think they just lost the charm, history was just making fun of, and I was not happy when he left. Alice just became more irritable, it is not Nancy or Kirsten, so it is of this film on its own did not work for me. Freddy also loses its panic, it's just getting a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she is holding a child, she can not be happy with my life. But Freddie is also back, and it will not be too light on her since she won it so easily in the fourth film. But in any case, he wants her child, and be born into the world again. Have you ever wondered if Freddie, too, were the parents? Well that's what A Nightmare on Elm Street: The child explores the Son, and Alice soon discovers that a child Freddie was like that, maybe it's the one thing that can beat him <br /> <br /> A Nightmare on Elm Street :. A child's dream just all around bad movie and an insult to the series. I do not think anyone can be satisfied with this sequel. Just the story was really stupid, I mean, that could possibly work, but again, it was just performed the wrong way. I know that if you want to see a sequel to A Nightmare on Elm Street series, you have to watch it, but I really would not recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> 3/10
