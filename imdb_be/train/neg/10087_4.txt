This is likely the first entry in the "/ Nurse Keith Lance O'Leary" detective series; O'Leary in the next film, he plays a much younger cast than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all played by well-known character actor) is going in an old house (in the rainy infinite, of course!) to talk to a rich relative who is in a coma. <br /> <br /> while they are waiting for him to recover all kinds of mysterious habits occur, including several murders. <, Br /> <br /> terrible film; worth a look!
