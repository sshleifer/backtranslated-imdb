There was a Bugs Bunny cartoon called «Baby Buggy Bunny", which was the name of this site. Baby-faced Finster robbed a bank and money in the carriage rolled away and fell into the rabbit hole beetle. He is dressed like a baby to get into Bugg hole to get the money. The scene in the «Little Man», where he looks in the mirror in the bathroom shaving with a cigar in your mouth straight from the cartoon. It was a fun 5-minute cartoon; not so much the entire movie. If you are really interested in this, buy a Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original for the first time (1954). In addition, you get much more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to download!
