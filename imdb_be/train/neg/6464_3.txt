Watching Marlene Brando on the screen, like watching a master carpenter slotting complex parts in a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the only thing that makes this film watchable. The plot is nonsensical and funny (not the comic). Other big name actors seem to make desperate attempts to give nature they draw some modicum of humanity ... humanity of these characters have a wet cardboard. All of the technical side of the film or mediocre or awful. Director throws freeze frame and slow motion shots of impunity. Incidental music cartoon and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. This is not what I really look for in a movie, but even the cabinet was away. Dear Brando could not focus on the horrible rags they decked him in. I've heard that a movie called "David Lynch-squire" and "irreverently funny" ... it is not. David Lynch movies are evil creativity - this film is not creative. And do not confuse stupidity with disrespect.
