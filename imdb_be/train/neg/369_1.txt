I almost called HBO and demanded the return of the money for a month, just because they were airing the film. I can only see Execs movie sitting around going, "Well, we have to come up with something that just like the one at home, but we will add a bunch of cash for the child, to hire the actors at a reduced price, and yes, we will do it much less funny! "<br /> <br /> Well, maybe not the last part, but it's basically what you get here. You should not even see if someone rents it. And as a movie for kids? Forget it. I would not allow my kids to see it, not necessarily because of the bad taste jokes, but because I would not want them to say, "what were you thinking, showing us that a lame piece of trash, dad?!?!"
