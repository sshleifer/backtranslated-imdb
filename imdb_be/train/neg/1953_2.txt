The first episode of this new show has been to date, and it was awful. Not only that, Shaggy has a new squeaky voice that made listening to his line of torture, but it is so far from the original concept and animation style that is almost known, as shown by "Scooby Doo." <br /> <br /> back in the dark days when Fred and Velma disappeared and nephew Scrappy Scooby was there, the team is still a mystery is solved. This new show features instead of Shaggy and Scooby fights such as James Bond super villain and his henchmen, living in a mansion. There's not even a van under the name «The Mystery Machine» (and a teaser of the next episode, which is promised to the type of transformer robot car does not put your mind at rest). How anyone can take the Scooby-Doo and do it? <br /> <br /> show gets two points for two scenes that show the whole Scooby Doo gang, all of whom speak with the right voice, except Shaggy, and even then I'm being too generous.
