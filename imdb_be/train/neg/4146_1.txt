After watching this thing, and then read the summary on the back of the DVD panel, recalling the actual movie .... I got a little dizzy. I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed that I was a down syndrome child waltz through an endless forest, where people drive 11 miles per hour and stops for a different purpose, sometimes tasteless lesbianism. Where (a zombie?) Come out of nowhere and (vampire?) Who (entice?) Pure-hearted people on their way to save the world. No zombies, no vampire, in particular, are facing each other. Only fighting I remember receiving panties margin Bonny fat away. Coo Coo cha FAT! All of them! Maybe it's because we have seen this wide-stretched and was too lazy to change it to their native resolution, but actually make it more interesting ... In conclusion, my thoughts trailing thesis was more continuity, story, character development, antagonism, subject matter, and then acting in the fullness of the film. It made Bloodrayne look Citizen F *** ING KANE
