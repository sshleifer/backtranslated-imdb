"Mistress CraftÂ» Celeste works as an agent for the London branch of the Interpol Bureau 17, specializing in (I think) occult criminals. It possesses the Eye of Doom, well in her hands, a dangerous, if someone got it. <br /> <br /> Office 17 contracted Satanists from California, Hyde (has nothing to do with Dr. Jekyll). Detective Lucy Lutz from LAPD flies to England to get it back in the United States. Lutz connection with the earlier films of Black Magic, being played by Stephanie Beaton before witchcraft 9. In Part 7, Lutz played another woman; 6, Lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> Part Lutz 9 was not very big, but it is one of the main stars in it. Although she left behind high heels and short skirts, she still opened the top of it. And this time she has sex scenes and naked. Beaton is quite attractive in this role. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a number of sexual scenes. Anonymous clubgoer has fatal threesome with two vampires, Satanists and the head vampire to get it with some kind of a break, said Lutz English friend, and Celeste and her boyfriend making love. <br /> <br /> The main recurring nature series Witchcraft Will rotator is not in it, though Lutz mentions its Bureau 17 Dickson agent in a conversation about vampires. She phones her partner detective Garner (part 6, 7 and 9), although we do not hear his end of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Hyde is sprung from prison group of vampires led by Raven for Walpurgis ritual that has something to do with God on behalf of Morsheba (I think). Hyde delivers all his lines in a very flat shape, while Raven overacts into mannerism degree. The fight scene choreographer awful. <br /> <br /> The sound of the film was quite badly written and poorly edited. In addition, a dialogue will be lost under the music blaring or siren. Operator is not great either. With the film set in and actually filmed in the UK was a bit of novelty, though, at least for this series <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good as Celeste. attractive, of course, but more importantly, it is easily the best actor in the movie (bad fight notwithstanding). I am very surprised by her filmography is so small. If there is ever witchcraft XIV, and I bet it would be, they have to get it back, even if it means flying her to California! <br /> <br /> Voodoo X is available on its own or in a DVD collection Hotter Than Hell with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies.
