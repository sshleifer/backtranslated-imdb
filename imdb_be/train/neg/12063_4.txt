Wife team Bennie fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville, but they have done very few films. As in the case of some other artists of his era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence) most affordable piece of film frames to fields and Seeley is a biopic about them, in which they portrayed the other actors :. "Somebody Loves Me", starring Betty Hutton, and that incomparable song and dance man Ralph Meeker <br /> <br /> in its heyday, Fields and Seeley were so extremely popular that another wife vaudeville act - - Jesse Block Eva and Sally - reached almost as stardom perform an almost identical action, effectively becoming a "second team" Fields and Sealy. Behind the scenes, however, there was a big difference in the living conditions of steam. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel rooms, paying for room service price for each reception of food they ate, and eventually run out of money. Block and Sally lived modestly and wisely invested his earnings, ending with a comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> In the first 30 seconds of the Vitaphone short occupied by two plates carrying pianists. Apparently, the two men had a small value of the name of its own in 1930, although I had never heard of them. Finally, Paul and Sealy invade and begin execution. They both have a lot of courage, and it is quite attractive. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by the fact that both performers continue to make a motion as if they were going to go to the dance, but they never make it to the third of the three songs that they perform in this short. When they finally begin hoofing, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was glad to have the opportunity to see these two top performers do their act Vaude. Now, when I saw it, I understand why they never became stars in the movie musicals. My rating for this: only 4 out of 10 and I will stick to the block and Sully.
