This film is a huge steaming pile. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why someone thinks that the version Garland / Mason needs to be redone, and why Striesand would be the first choice to star. <br /> <br /> In this regard, I have no idea why our people (Gay Americans) tend generally considered Striesand as a kind of treasure. At least, in my opinion, it peaked professionally with funny girl, and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent a classic Judy is, or even the original (thin film in its own right), but please, please, please skip these sweltering pit!
