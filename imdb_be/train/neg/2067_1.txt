Straight to the point: «The Groove Tube» is one of the most unfunny, unclever completely terrible movies ever made. This "comedy" so devoid of even remotely resembles a trace of mind, that it is almost inconceivable that it was even made. I say almost, because all the fans after all. <br /> <br /> This film is not even a "good" or bad "pleasant" bad. To put this film at the same level of entertainment as the «Plan 9" or «Robot Monster" would be a crime in these films. Films like that you can watch and enjoy. But this film is so bad, so bad done acting and script, and so incredibly stale that there simply is not even a trace of "camp" or "quickies" to find. <br /> <br /> While it's been done before Saturday Night Live premiere, comparisons were probably inevitable. I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this film is worse than the worst SNL skit you can find. And man, it's bad. Just to keep the audience to leave the man, Shapiro throws in a pair of breasts so often, but bad shot breasts since 1974 will not excite anyone these days. Truly, this film is so bad and did induce a dream tour, I doubt that they are excited by anyone in 1974 or. <br /> <br /> A man named Ken Shapiro made this film. I swear to God, any ten-year-old with a camera could do something funny and more reasonable. It's just completely unrealistic - it's really an incredible film. The "joke" and "gag" is so infantile that even little boys who like to sneak porn parents MAGS night will not laugh <br /> <br /> I will give this film one -. The most recent sequence of a sequence of "dancing man" where the guy (Shapiro) on the streets of New York dance music, easily the best thing in this awful film. Not that the sequence of "dancing man" is that great either - it certainly has its moments are not telling the whole story, as the Shapiro desperately trying to fill the time for the entire song - but it was actually a few watchable. Part of this sequence, where the police begins to dance with a man, it is one single track uptake in the whole film. Not surprisingly, Shapiro did not put this last sequence - "film" again, until not so great in itself, it easily beats anything else in this <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this film is a a complete piece of shit, it's incomprehensible as to how actual human being can be so completely cleverless. The title of this film was to be "Ken Shapiro Craparama.» It is surprising that this has been done, but a lot of really talented filmmakers can not get. However, I will say that I bet geniuses at New York University, will love this film. All rubbish.
