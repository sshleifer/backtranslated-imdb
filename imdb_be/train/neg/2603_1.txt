I was interested in this topic, and just lovers of dance Drew Barrymore on David Letterman's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it. Well, it shows some breast (or maybe double hull does). The plot is slashed to pieces and the action hit. No lead is a material for working, since the direction of the film leads nowhere. Do not waste your time. See Donnie Darko instead, if you want a terrible Drew Barrymore movie, and if you want to see another, skip it and see Darko again. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of the legend double absolutely criminal, as well. Please refer to the novel by Charles Williams "Descent into Hell" for something worth considering instead. It's just an excuse to make a B movie to go straight to video and suck the life out of some people in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> What makes any of these people think the action here was flattering? Give me a break.
