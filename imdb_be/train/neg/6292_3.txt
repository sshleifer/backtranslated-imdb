I wonder how much this film really needs to be done from the 1984 movie "Bachelor Party", starring Tom Hanks. Is this film, even the official sequel? This film is lacking in every department, and you are obviously better not to watch. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this film is just not good enough or funny. It basically depends on their stereotypical character count, and then the movie actually has some good, original and funny moments. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is also very little story there is also a movie naked breasts than pages and a script. You just keep waiting for things to finally start. There is a storyline in it somewhere, but this one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so bad in the movie that it feels more like it's something non-existent. I think even that is a message and a moral story in it somewhere, but this is again so terribly unoriginal and poorly made into a film, it just does not work. <br /> <br /> basically a typical teen comedy with a lot of sexual jokes and nudity, but without the teenage main characters that p obits story all the more sad and tasteless. The film makes some really incorrect jokes that are impossible for any type of movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, if you watched it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
