Another case of a decent DVD case changes the quality of the shot on the video film. <br /> <br /> It was not so bad. Rochon does a serviceable job and damned! cast looks good. I've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis. This film really wanted to make you think, Rochon, was a killer, but it was not to be. My biggest problem with the film is that in the end, I did not much care, that was a killer, but the real killer little sense, because he was out of the blue, and the filmmakers thought "Ha, Betcha did not see that one coming, sucker! ". So, there was a continuity error (mostly from the IOOC. Constantly changing wardrobe Rochon), but for an indie slasher is not so bad. I was sure that at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless, but it was just a gimmick. The dialogue was too painful to think and time. <br /> <br /> Do not have high expectations that go into it, and it will not be so bad. And cameo Lloyd Kaufman beautifully understated.
