Who were they kidding with this? There has been too much in this film, it was difficult to digest. Right from the moment when Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unconsciously desires the death of his father when he came to London with his uncle (played by Om Puri), only to give it up after a few minutes. The only problem with this theory is that anyone who has ever passed through London knows what fête would not be possible to remove and especially not an Indian. But the problem does not end with the film, there is the question of the two main leads (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan), who are as a rock star on the verge of achieving their dreams. I mean, yes, we have seen the success of Susan Boyle came to (the woman in the UK, reaching her dreams after 50 years), but it was a rare case. It was very difficult for me to suspend my disbelief, because I felt that the cast of Salman and Ajay just thoughtless. They would never cast Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi played the same role, so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men well into their 40s) prance around desperately trying to hang on to their 20s? Let's not even speak about the shy actress on the screen today, Osin. This is her second film (I've seen), and it is simply hopeless, as an actress, so conscious of her looks that she refers to herself only look good and voguing for the camera, and not to give a good performance in the cast. It's just hard to believe that she rejected all of these other roles in the movies shot in this down, then so fluffy, as an actress, not to write home about nothing at all. And on top of all this, the film is simply dragged tediously. There's nothing special about it at all, believe me, you will be provided every clichéd thing that needs to happen in it.
