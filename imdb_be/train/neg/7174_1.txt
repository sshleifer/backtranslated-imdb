I would like to read the other comments before you leave my review and most definitely rules: This film is aweful! From action to non-realistic animation in countless errors. I'm really hoping that the flaps would be extended stretch (can not extend the flaps without engines). The chassis can be reduced if you have electricity. This tiny little fan that was not enough going on any site to lower the landing gear. One thing that I thought was rather peculiar when they landed, the rear wheels touched down, and then one broke his nose, so that the suspension of the aircraft with both rear tires in the air. As the captain applied left and right brakes tires which do not relate to the land? Have they forgotten spoilers? According to the director: * Find out all you can about * aircraft before attempting to "airplane" movie. Sorry for the technical tirade, but I give this film 1/10.
