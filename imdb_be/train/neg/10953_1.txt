This garbage excuse for television is the most god awful piece of garbage ever to hit Australian television. The house mates dull, uninteresting, funny stupid and selected on the basis that you would most likely try to kill them, if you were to live with them. As far as I am concerned about Big Brother is the reduction of the western society, showing how we, as a society, are on a steep slope to become stupid morons. Whatever happened to the television, not targeted the lowest common denominator of society in the audience? It can not be classified as entertainment. I think it is true that Channel Ten may remove your soul. This happened because Rove McManus, who was once a respected comedian and after the transition to the 10-th channel, it becomes terribly unfunny. With the exception of The Simpsons, which is highly did the right thing.
