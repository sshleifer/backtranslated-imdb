This is absolutely the worst film I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would say that the effect was very good, and all the cast. <br /> <br /> This was apparently meant, which is very unusual, and therefore he was able to. In addition, the story revolves around a self-centered wannabe that clueless, talentless chronic liar whose source of confidence comes from a pair of leather shoes. <br /> <br /> It was worse than watching a car crash.
