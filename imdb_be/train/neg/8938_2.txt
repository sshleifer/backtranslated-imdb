I still can not believe how bad this movie was. If I was not massochist I do not know if I survived view. It seems that costs about $ 1,000 to make, but it's not the money that brought them down. Action was awful - not just bad, 3 classes could read these words better. Secondly, just another reason to watch this type of movie is the skin, and that is sorely lacking in this film. We did not even get to see a more attractive Chicas in amateur. <br /> <br /> Ahh well, better luck next time right?
