This film is lame from self indulgent moment-to-moment self-indulgent, promising to become worth hanging on for a while. But this is not the case. It's flat, he deliberately mundane and tedious. <br /> <br /> A series set of images and backgrounds to make a film entirely, they make calendar. This kind of pathetic socialist pseudo-documentary drama ( "The truth is that really happened") is not only entertaining, it fails to convince, so that not even a function of social history. Clich√©s together mingled with bad acting make this movie very difficult to finish, wear the entertainment factor rather quickly. Dimensional characters, never develop to such an extent that one feels for them. director of the ego is a major character in the film.
