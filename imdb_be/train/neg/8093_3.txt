Based on the satirical novel by Tom Wolfe, who praised all (I have not read yet) Tom Hanks star, like a wall Streeter, who accidentally kills a black boy, while lost in a bad part of New York Willis stars as a reporter who starts Hanks on its downward spiral .. the characters are very thin, and seems to have no sympathy for those who are in this film and comedy and satire there arent a lot of laughter either..Melanie Griffith her breasts made during filming so much fun, you need to do is to to see if it changed the size of boobs in different parts of film..This will keep your mind on other things, like the lack of a script or humor .. On a scale of one to ten..3
