I do not even know that it was originally a film made for television, when I saw it, but I realized after a time working. It has the same color gaunt, polite character and eerie synthesized music that I remember from the 80s, plus a "social platform", which practically screams "Afterschool Special". Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Rona Jaffe (thanks) Mazes and Monsters were made at the height of Dungeons & Dragons, pen-and-paper RPG, which took away the hearts of millions of geeks across America. I consider myself one of these geeks, tho I never played D & D, especially, I dabbled in one of his brothers. M & M has also been made in the heyday of the major contradictions that D & deuce it was so exciting that people can lose touch with reality, to be worshiped Satan, not knowing blah blah. I believe that this was a legitimate concern at one point, if very rare, but this film is terrible dates. <br /> <br /> We meet four young college students who play aptly called Mazes and Monsters, and to communicate a little time away from the mundane life. Besides the fact that M & M, as set forth more sad than their worldly life. None of the games appeal is not represented here, and please take JJ M & M in the "real world" comes out of nowhere. It's just an excuse to make one of the characters does not go crazy out of nowhere and, although at the moment we are not interested. JJ, Robbie, Kate and Daniel to be different, but they are rich WASPy prigs, having a problem nobody has. <br /> <br /> But just keep getting worse in more than one Low budget comes awfully clear (I love the sign "Login" and a cardboard cutout of the Forbidden cavities) Robbie / Pardu shows why he is not a warrior in oafiest stabbing scene ever, and the gain on the top of "The Two towers" is unintentionally hilarious. sobbing Tom Hanks "JJ, I'm doing here?" He made me laugh for a few minutes at a time. Picked the lowest point in his career. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this as a compelling satire is ridiculous piece of trash-TV 80, and you'll still have a good time. That is, if you can not sleep. Most generally sad, but it's all worth it for the breakdown Pardu at the end. At least Tom Hanks became better. Not that he could have gone much worse here.
