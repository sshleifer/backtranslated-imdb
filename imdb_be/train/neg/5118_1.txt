I am a Christian, and I say this movie was terrible acting, unreal situation and fully front facade of Christianity. You might also see "Remember the Titans" and at least not to confuse Christ in the football film as a template steroids for losers. Allow me to make some really relevant commentary that bothers me in this film. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and was white academy school. I did not see a single black student at the school or the player. I deal with the White "Christian" academies in the South, and they were built for no other reason than to restore segregation. This is alarming, when the film about Christianity and Christ is changing lives ... how to change the hearts of segregation? <br /> <br /> 2 ;: (note I loved the token black coach, he joined the all-white team, and all the black players, "giants.). uncritical acceptance of all Christian about this movie. Can I get a couple of people to say that this is a bad game, bad filming, bad writing and poor shorter than with other films. If we compare this with another football movie, whether it will have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. The half-baked Christianity, which has been shown to have made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending. Feces Christianity just about reading a few scriptures and praying to get a complete change of life, do not be surprised if no one will listen to what Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a panacea. do not need to sell him and he should not be attached to such quirky way of life. it is not surprising that everyone considers to be anti-intellectual Christianity with this unreal presentation. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film can be inspiring more people. For most, it will not. He did not give a real picture of the struggle, and cardiac stress. Most importantly for me, it is not Christian by any means or stretch. It has value, but it does not hold, as the "retractable yourself up-by-the-bootstraps" message as shallow as positive thinking. If you live next to people who are struggling and / or those who are in the third world living conditions, this film will be hollow, as most churches today in their religion.
