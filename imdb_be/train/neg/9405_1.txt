I just finished watching it on TV, and what can I say, but this is the worst movie I have ever seen! I am ashamed to be from Melbourne, where the film was made. Devilish actions amateurish makeup and a very bad soundtrack. As for the plot, well, that's even more stupid! Some scenes just left me stunned by how bad it was. There's a reason they put these types of movies TV late at night - because they are full of crap! Avoid at all costs.
