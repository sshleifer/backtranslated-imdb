Am I wrong, or is it the 2007 version simply a rip-off from the original? I have to ask, because that DVD-I just bought this one of the worst films I have ever seen ..... bad acting, bad editing, etc. .... only "operational" aspect here, as we were ripped off for our money by buying this piece of shit. This is nothing more than a lightweight porn movie ... there is no real gore, no scary images, just a little cheaply made junk. If someone wants to see a great movie without a name actors, some mucous Mountains and a decent story line ... get a baby's blood ... is also made on a cheap budget, but well done ... and the actual story too! I ticket office is a waste of money, but I'll keep it just for fun .... it's pathetic! New comment September 3 .... ..... I'll keep this film forever just because it is SOOOOO bad, it's almost good .... in a very bad condition .... the worst acting ever ... in a real shit-movie classic!
