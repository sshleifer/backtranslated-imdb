I could not be the biggest fan of the Blair Witch, but nevertheless it is clear that the efforts, so I'm looking forward to change, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various comments IMDb. "Unique," "intelligent," "Future cult" and so on ... You have to wonder, when people come to this thing, to describe such a poor effort. <br /> <br /> So, unfortunately, we replace the poor, weak film that can not participate in any and all respects. Stupid not funny. Fear, and the blood is not scary. And all that "think" aspect of some poor guy saw this movie was because of a serious error, because there is, of course, nothing deep or reasonable about it somehow. <br /> <br /> OK, so we know, nothing stands out. That, at least tolerated? Whether the experience is worth anyway? Unfortunately, no. First, get a very bad effect. It is no exaggeration to say that the majority of B-movies these days have a better effect. The plot? Sad and dirty. Dialogues? Many fans are actually better. <br /> <br /> This is really the direction of the puzzle. I did not expect significant improvements over the Blair Witch, but at least a small step forward. Instead, our director, seems to be getting worse over time, completely ignoring the previous experience. <br /> <br /> If there is a great shortage of treason, a basic set. Much of the story takes place in one place, where the main characters is dated, but Sanchez was not able to give the place a person at all. Given that the Blair Witch, the forest plays an important role and as much character (antagonist, if you will) as the three students, you might think the director is needed here to understand the same. But no ... this place has no personality at all due to inaccurate direction, and no attention to detail. <br /> <br /> There's nothing here to save ,. Die hard supporters of the "Blair Witch Project", it is better from the following Daniel Myrick. Despite the fact that his way is not gold, it shows used better than Sanchez's structure and some of the lessons of the Blair Witch (unfortunately, weak story, but still).
