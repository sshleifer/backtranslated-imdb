The only reason why I decided to give it a shot Flick was due to the presence of the Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is it was the biggest waste of a good actor ever put on film. As far as I could judge, Borgnine was the only actor in it. The rest of the performances were so uniformly awful, I'm surprised the studio will actually pay a "performer" to appear. Couple this talent level in the current department with a history of perseverance and so fresh that I thought that my eyes begin to bleed until the credits, and you have the perfect cinematic tribulations. It is clear that the film was made to appeal to the audience of children, and to his credit, it was better than most of the original programming at Disney Channel, and similar kid-oriented network. But honestly, that's not saying much.
