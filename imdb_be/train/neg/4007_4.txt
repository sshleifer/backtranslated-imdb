I hope that the one who trains the lost accents on them was dismissed. The only high point of several secondary characters, 3 of 5 of my favorites were destroyed before the end of the season (and one of them was a cat to put that in perspective). <br /> <br /> the whole storyline is not centered around sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with a gay vampire, gay sex with straight vampires, sex to win the vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex in front of vampires, vampire sex, without vampire sex, sex, because they are afraid of vampires, sex, because we wisely vampire sex, because we just become a vampire, etc. <br /> <br /> Nothing is against sex, then there would be just great if it was a little more subtle in that peppered the plot, maybe have a story, and then squeeze some sex into it. But they did not even bother to do that ... and Anna Paquin is a dizzy bitch tooth gap. Or it sucks and sucks her character, I can not figure out what. <br /> <br /> The other part of the storyline, which I find very implausible why 150-year-old vampire Bill, who seem to have their stuff together to be interested in someone like Sookie. She constantly fly off the handle at him for what he can not control. He leaves for two days, and she had already decided that he "will not return", and suddenly have feelings for a dog person? Give me a break. It should be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People close to her dying all over, and she got a very bright smile on her face, because she just gave her V-card to some dude, because she can not read his mind? As the protagonist of this story, I would hope that the show will do a little more to make it understandable and someone to put the interest, not someone you hold in secret hoping that gets destroyed or put in a coma. I can not find anything about his character that I like, and even the fact that she can read minds clearly sad and not at all interesting. <br /> <br /> I will not waste their time with watching Season 2 coming in June.
