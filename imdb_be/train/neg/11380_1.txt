When I first saw Robotboy, I found it unusual and interesting, but then I noticed that with each episode of the show is trying to teach you how to behave, what is good / bad. Episodes become predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see a hyper-intelligent boy laid his elder brother, parents who do not understand your child and his friends: girl and the fat man. In addition, this show has no logic. Super-modern robot that is powered by two AA batteries, the size, and can use a large amount of weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated mode. We see two different robots, and it takes the basic idea of ​​the exhibition: "A robot must learn to behave in human society"
