This film looks as if it might be a good thing in the beginning, but never specified in this expectation. Directed by talented and has some good angles and artistic ideas (a typical Asian director), but does not know how to create and tell a good story to go along with it. The story was fragmented and seemingly from all sorts of different directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, understandable, interesting angle. In principle, the film is not suitable explanation to the press release. The action was very good, however. All the actors give good performances, and Jude Law was outstanding as it always is. It's too bad that he decided to make such a weak film.
