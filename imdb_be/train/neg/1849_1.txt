It was interesting to see the move, thinking it might be a diamond in the rough, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible direction (shot not flow sequence), even if the director would say that this is what he is going for, it looks very uninspired and immature), editing can be done by someone of 2 VCRs and supply was low budget video. I would say that it was not even something as simple as a mini digital video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to fix the film that the director has, both through editing, etc. But it is obvious that he simply does not care. There is also a lot of effort put into this film as a ham sandwich. This could have been done better, but it will mean extra work.
