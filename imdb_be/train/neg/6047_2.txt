What made the French Connection work so well was a connection between Doyle (Hackman) and Rousseau (Scheider). In this disaster director Frankenheimer (who also brought us such gems as Raindeer Games and the Island of Dr. Moreau), the film focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession with capturing Charnier (Rey). Fictitious idea that the NYPD will allow Doyle to go to Marseille to find Charnier with the help of French local authorities to laugh out loud funny. Correct me if I'm wrong, but do not miss the city Charnier with 65 pounds of pure taste !!! The street value of 32 million, but, let's send Doyle to find this guy, this was a crushing it in the end. Please !!! The story was weak. Action was awful (with the sole exception of Hackman, who completely outplayed his part). Direction was everywhere. Even cuts between scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one.
