The plot of this film is not strong at all, a lot of holes. If you approach it as a movie car was not bad, a lot of great cars in this. The reason I like it, because I'm from the area where it was filmed. I get the maximum pleasure, looking at famous places in Saint-Cloud MN and seeing how the city has changed to 89. It is an interesting historical piece for us locals. It seems like every time a movie made here everyone wants something to do with it. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video store, they were all stolen as soon as he came out on VHS. If you like to receive a copy of Japan on Ebay, I find it interesting, as a way to drag race it around the city. I did not know that the director was with St.Cloud.
