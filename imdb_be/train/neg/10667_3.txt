Nha fooled with all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods, and Anne Archer. They are simply a glorified extra's. Their scenes were probably filmed in a day or so. Whatever the motives, being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods better make good use of it. For me this is a sign of bad directions through. The story itself is not so bad. And actions of the majority of the actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr., however, was terrible. It was so unbelievable that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since it's meant as a serious film that can not be a good thing. Scenes they were not bad, but they lacked that special kick to make it more exciting. Again it was necessary to better direction. In addition, ECS was not right for a film like this. It took nearly half an hour the protagonist to get in action. For thriller just 90 minutes, which is too slow. The only redemptive factor Angie Harmon. She does everything possible to make it all work. Too bad the director left her on the gallows. Yes, this movie could have been so much better with a great director. Andy Cheng too inexperienced as a director, to pull it out. And for an action / stunt coordinator of his caliber would be expected, at least more exciting scenes. Do not waste your time with this. Avoid!
