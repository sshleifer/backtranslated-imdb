I have a question for those who have thought about this idea. Why? What made them think, to make a second film this. If the memory is not Cinderella ends with "They lived happily ever after"? I'm sure he did, or is it meant. Wait a minute, if they all lived happily ever after, how could it be continued? If they did not try to make the saddest story in history, can not be continued. I mean, of course, they could sing about Cinderella nonsense for two hours, but why? The film, which ends in a "happy" can not be continued; if this happens, they do not live happily ever after! That is, it goes wrong, which causes problems with the first final! Why? It is not, it is evil. This is my last word on the subject.
