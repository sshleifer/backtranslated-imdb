Well, I recently had the opportunity to rent it and watch Santa Claus conquers martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would like to say that Santa Claus was much worse than the movie. As a concession to the Spanish Spanish 5 we were to look. I'll tell you, as a rule, when we watch a movie, we were just talking and eating the food, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept it open jaw is interesting that the evil Mr. Pitch going to do next. Merlin will help Santa Claus!?! or its robot deer to come and save the day? I would like to offer for rent, because this is the biggest piece of garbage I've ever seen, and I love him for it. : D
