This is probably the worst film ever made is simply a bad name Roger Corman's associated with it. I could understand him in his early years, when he was below budget, but there is no justification at present for giving birth to it! I «B» movie freak and some people from the point of view of all the clicks I like to be postponed for "normal viewers", but take my word on this, the club vampire makes the top of my list of the best of the worst .It is hard to imagine, vampires, does not have fangs, score quite absurd sound effects just are not effective and, finally, Mr.Savage, does not seem to know what he is in the vampire film in all the witches too bad because it was "not bad" career around . Let me know, i'f I worked on this one because if I do not like the movie, I tend to forget about his good side.
