Even if one did not know that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and died before the film's release, the devil STATION DR. FU Manchu will be painful to view. It is alleged libel famous oriental villain Sax Rohmer, but it lacks any attention. The potential for satirical comment on the anti-oriental overtones Romer concept ignored. Indeed, the film uses racist abuse. There is hardly any actual jokes or jokes, but mostly the actors behave like an idiot and gushes sad lines. Particularly upsetting to see Sid Caesar is forced to spout profanity and racial slurs for trying to laugh. Most of the other actors confuses good. <br /> <br /> And then Peter Sellers. He plays the dual role of evil Fu Manchu, who is trying to prepare the formula to regain his youth and his stalwart British opponent Nayland Smith. Sellers are not one hundred percent bad; it transfers heat Shifty, Smith, when he discusses his fetishistic devotion to his lawn mower, and he moves strange as Manchu, when he expresses his love of English music hall entertainment. But most of the time, he plays both roles with weary gloom, thus further sabotage any comic possibilities. Sellers routines, where he revives his strength disappears from electric shock is particularly distressing; he seems tormented too convincing to be funny. <br /> <br /> A few really witty lines capable farce little Bert Kwak (Cato in the Pink Panther movies) as one of the minions of the Manchu, and amusing musical numbers Helen Mirren can not save this mess. If someone wants to understand why Peter Sellers comedy is considered a genius, they are nothing of the diabolical STATION DR learn. FU Manchu.
