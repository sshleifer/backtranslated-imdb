First of all, I really liked Henry Fool, that puts me in a very small pool of movie lovers. Posey is one of the best actresses on screen today. But this film was full of parody. Hartley and watching the actors speak about the film in the extras - so full of pride, and make nonsensical analogy with the Star Wars - was stomach-turning. It was advertising on producing parts (HDNet), sold at max. A true example of the emperor and his new clothes. Basically I feel that Hal spoiled Henry Fool forever. I do not think I can ever see him again in a pure, innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember, Hal, you can fool some people some of the time ... no, etc. The director will be nowhere today, when all he was doing was in a large number of meaningless garbage. Unfortunately, it is a pure example of a lesson taught in the movie. The story should be interesting and active, or cashier hopes faded actually. Nothing decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to act in a straitjacket. <br /> <br /> through, I believe, Hartley, tasteless. With the drum to get the go throughout the dialogue. Apple was one cycle, Soundtrack, I learned that gave me a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, ah, they are just trying to capture a new audience. But it's really funny to drive it. I would love to spoil the movie for you, but it was done. It's rotten. FOOL franchise is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
