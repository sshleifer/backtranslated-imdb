It was a good story, but not very well said. I liked the theme and storyline, which was not as clear as it could be. Maybe there was too much going on and the lack of ability to rule it all. Action was fine cheese, some were stronger than others, and even more powerful actors had their moments at as acting. It took me several months to go through the whole movie, because he did not hold my attention, and the flow was just bad. I just finished watching it and I'm glad I did, as the film moves and finally has some continuity to the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was to the south Wed. I would recommend it for the storyline, and perhaps a bit of eye candy, and I mean a little.
