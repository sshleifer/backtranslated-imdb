I would like this film, but Van Damme just doing the same old same old garbage over and over again. Poo pants fight scenes in accordance with the usual. The only thing this loser left of Russian were usually were eventually killed in the end. This film full of dog do make higher nature, please, please, please, Van Damme to get some acting lessons, you need them. Anyone who loves Van Damme has problems, it seems sad that the only way to Van Damme never get any acting work when he wrote the film together, jointly producing the film and makes the screen play for the film. AVOID Van Damme and its slicked back nasty WIG. I give this movie two out of ten, because one of the sand was better. To add insult to injury, I wasted pounds on this manure
