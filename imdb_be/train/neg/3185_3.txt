This film was just throwing on MST3K, and with good reason. First of all because it is "cop" movie starring Joe Don Baker, who we all know as the good cop actor Michael Jackson is a country western singer. <br /> <br /> All the typical cop movie plot device rear their ugly heads, bar fights, the children hostage shoot outs, bad acting, lame of Chiefs of Police, the bad acts of revenge / justice, endless thugs, and, of course, bad acts. Do not look without filter MST3K people.
