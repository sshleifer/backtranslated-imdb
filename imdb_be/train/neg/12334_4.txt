The premise is ridiculous, the characters are incredibly banal dialogue and ending the absurd. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I am a supporter of Kevin Kline, but watching him emphasize Pepe Le Pew for 2 hours, presumably, the Frenchman is not as fun as it sounds. <br /> <br /> For its part, Meg Ryan once again, as the perky and charming as (take your pick): Kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think is cute creature on earth . It also has not the slightest resemblance to the real person. <br /> <br /> This film strikes me as an opportunity seized buddies Kezdany and Klein on vacation in Paris and the south of France, being well paid for it. So I can not blame them.
