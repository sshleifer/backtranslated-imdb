Well, let me start by saying that this did not come as a surprise to those who have read the other comments. That being said, MY G-D, this movie stinks! I mean, WOW, I do not know what it could throw as much money as they clearly did in fact and still worse than any film, Roger Corman! Corman was probably pitched the film at some point, but he refused because of the poor quality of the script! The only reason why this movie got made in the first place is that someone said, "Hey, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game we can grasp that there are zombies in it? Resident Evil? Nope, someone got there first. Silent Hill? No, it's too quiet. People will never sit in a dark room, just to be scared silly. Hey, Segal is a game where people are running around shooting zombies? He and business platform, we could get that money! <br /> <br /> In general, they have tried to make a film that felt like a video game, shooting up to the battle, as if the characters were actually playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and main problem lies in the fact that the original game was terrible. I mean, <br /> <br /> bad movie merchandising production-in-a-worse-game-in-two weeks, and some-shippe d-Out-and-buy-on-morons- and are their parents-for-Christmas terrible. The graphics were sad. Monsters were boring. Levels were boring. The interface has been boring. It was boring. In other words, it was a boring game. And it was ARCADE version. Home version was even worse! With a home version, you do not even get a shotgun in your hand, and you longing stupid this pointless game! But I digress. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they have gone so far as to actually interspersed with scenes of real game during the fight scenes. HUH ??? Nha editor enough confidence in the effects to show that there is actual fighting going on? Not to mention the fact that every fight was filmed from the perspective of video games, which may explain the tedious use of a matrix-type effects. The problem is that the game is a first person shooter (the player moves from the POV character). Maybe that's why they put in game graphics, so you know that they were referring to the game ... Yes, all that ... <br /> <br /> In any case, the only thing that made this the whole experience remotely pleasant was the fact that everyone in the theater loudly ridiculed the film, so that a sudden bouts of hysterical laughter and a general skepticism were accepted as commonplace and do not get me kicked out. <br /> <br /> To sum up, do not go see this movie! Not even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of weeks. Run. Just run.
