Just too many holes in the film, to be pleasant and worst fanciful almost like a Hollywood ending that completely out of context with the rest of the film (this is not a spoiler, you'll never guess how it ends!). <br /> <br /> You should also be thick skinned for all kinds of politically correct overtones. The conflict between whites and blacks was very contrived and one-sided. I do not understand why the author was a local black communinity behave in an unacceptable manner, he / she is trying to be racist? <br /> <br /> Indeed bizare film. If you want to be really annoying holes in the story and would like to discuss anything that may or may not be supposed to happen only watch. <br /> <br /> But on the positive side filming and acting is wonderful.
