Worse than the ranking it was given. This is a typical SciFi movie today: poorly terribly action script that is poorly written and cheesy direction. From the first scene, where DeMille hides his set to the end, this film is terrible. In the early scenes of the film have Moses (who was Charlton Heston in the film DeMille), Pharaoh (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) with a view of a boy burying in the sand box. Characters that were supposed to represent the above three icons were awful and had similarities with the people they were "supposed" to be. The fact that it's in the desert, away from civilization fun when someone is hurt, and they're all screaming at the ambulance. Screenwriter, obviously not paying attention to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Baccarin decided to make a film of such poor quality.
