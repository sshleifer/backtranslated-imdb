If you want to make a film like this, there is a threat to be real. Nha surround Patsy with a bunch Bonzos. There's no trust here. The plot is dull and incredibly. It acts even worse. I thought that I looked at Arthur Lake (Dagwood), which is one of the worst actors in the story, when I saw the protagonist. Well, at some point it has to face the music and get fighting mad. I do not care. Do you have any? There are all these long scenes set in this harsh office (furniture made of cardboard or hardboard). People talk and smoke, and do nothing. Much of the action takes place in a sequence of five minutes. After that, it's over. Do not disturb.
