Another look at the horror. Styling differences between Russian and American films interesting. However, from my point of view, America the film just was not as good. The main character, played by Mary Anastasia Hille was not a pleasant character and I had a hard time identifying with it. It was an unpleasant most of the time and confusing for most of what little time left. In addition, too much time was spent on bringing it to the main location of the film. Then it was a long time before any real suspense is built. After what happened seemed volume was used as the main effect that was more irritating than the rest. The concept was more original than most movies directly to video, and they do not use sex to make up for the thin portion. In general, I would recommend it for a rental, but not for the theater.
