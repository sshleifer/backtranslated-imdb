This is the last time I rent a video without checking reviews at IMDB. Englishman, directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote wrote a truly awful NightWatch with Ewan McGregor and director of such debris is out of view of the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a great actor, and it's a shame that he was involved in a bad movie. There is often an editing error, it seems like it was a last minute decision to compensate for the absence or history, surveys and simple common sense. This film makes it all wrong. What were they thinking?
