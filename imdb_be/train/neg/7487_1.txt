Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. With the original visitor was manic and very funny, of course, they used a script written by Neil Simon. For some reason Neil Simmons script is not used in the film, so that falls flat again and again. Even the audience I never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious, and if there is a joke because she betrayed the joke dies then there are a couple of sex in the park. They state that the lighting ceremony in New York, and we all know that the lights are going to come, and we can see the cute and robbery Goldie and Steve do a bit of buffoonery. The entire film is completed to be like this ... a joke set up and distributed. Why not Goldies hair never even messed up in the film. You will also notice a close-up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
