Ah, yes, Sakura Killers is stupid, horrible movie Ninja is not a mistake. But it is also incredibly enjoyable. This is largely thanks to the amazing presence of Chuck Connors, who is billed as starring in the film, but really shines only in a few scenes. I believe that it must be some kind of type of Obi-Wan Kenobi ( "hard ninja-buster", a box copy exclaims), but his "wisdom," is ridiculous. "Driving without thinking" ??? My friend says, it is a sign of mental retardation, is not higher than the concentration. <br /> <br /> But in fact, his two assistants, sleepy and Dennis, a terrible dialogue, "Brooklyn", as we call the Colonel, tends to shine in comparison. Especially it is necessary to follow the logic in relation to "Dennis the genetic splicing" Sakura involved with. If you know something, etc. cloning you die of laughter. And yes, this is the main point of the story, the people. <br /> <br /> A lot of fun movie, Sakura Killers is hard to find a gem. I will not spoil the "trick" the ending for you, or except that it is the perfect set for Sakura Killers 2. Too bad Chuck Connors died. :-( Because it has the smoothest way to demolish a ninja.
