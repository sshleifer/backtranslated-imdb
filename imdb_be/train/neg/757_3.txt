My kids watch the show every day that it further. Its a great program for young children. However, they should stop showing repeated runs and do some more live shows and get rid of Rooney and yellow teeth to Deedee. MOU is the only Doodle bop with clean white teeth and pearlie children notice these things and ask if 2 never brush their teeth? There show will ever make its way to the United States, and if so, where can we find the schedule to. And one more thing, if we might add. MOU you need to stop hiding so much. Sometimes, when you jump out of where you bully younger children and that pulling on the rope? What does this mean? other then getting wet all the time. They need to add new things to show them instead of the same ole ole same. Children lose interest in that way.
