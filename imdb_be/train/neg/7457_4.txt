Chris Cattani is a large sketch of the actor on Saturday Night Live ... but he should probably leave the film industry alone, if he does not get some kind of control over the creative process. He plays an annoyingly cheerful character, which mainly comes from the moderately slowing and speed. only part of the fun you want to know? The material that they have shown in the preview. Yes, its implementation take at me funny. More does not mean anything. Especially if you can say that he is trying very hard to be a physical comedian that he should not have to try, because it is one. And yet, it "blows the vet's office" comes off as a bit obsequious bad. This film made me develop a twitching eye. Avoid this at all costs, and continue to watch SNL.
