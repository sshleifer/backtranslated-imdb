I can not describe how awful this movie. Am I the only one who finds a way to his animated totally disgusting? Men Roch look 100% fake them badly dyed hair, do not even come close to matching that actors look. Orcs looked awful. Why Gandalf go with a bad limp? Why cant they pronounce things correctly? Saruman did Aruman. There were others that sounded like a terrible * sp * Tolkiens pronunciation symbols. All and all im glad the studio who made it pulled the plug out of the sequel, it was just awful scary adaptaion. Go watch Cartoons for the best cartoon Tolkiens work. Heck, even a cartoon version ROTK better then this dig. 2/10
