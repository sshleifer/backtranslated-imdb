Well, I finally saw it. I did not go when it first came out, because, well, frankly, I was afraid. Afraid of how bad it can be, and how frustrating. Although not as bad as the Menace, and better than the clones, he was not particularly memorable or pleasure. <br /> <br /> I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the opening crawled up to the final credits of the film it was an experience that I will never forget. The eternal story of a bored farm boy who just knows that he meant more to save the princess and the galaxy from the evil threat of being mentored wise master rogue pirate and various comic - all in the space of -opera installation. <br /> <br /> This is not to punish Lucas to use the old formula. It's an old formula, precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave it a new twist that made it very special. <br /> <br /> Later Empire and the story has become more than just a fairy tale. Darkness came into the picture, and we have learned one of the greatest films of all time twists. Big villain Vader was Luke's father. Wow, no one saw that coming. Of course, I'm not sure, and did Lucas, as he appeared in the script. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, especially in light of the first three episodes, to see if it really is the network. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the problem I have. Revenge entertaining movie - huge consequences, a lot of action, some good action scenes. But the film still lives or dies on its site - a story he says. Oh, of course, very good actor can save a weak plot, but the plot is weak, coupled with poor acting - is a burden, not a single director can not be overcome, of course, no one is as bad as I have understood, George Lucas (The man has I managed to send some of the worst performances of his career to some very fine actors -. Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson) <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD * ******* section. Oh, my. You see, he was already disabled by what happened in the first two movies, so it's an incredible burden. One is too much for him to overcome. <br /> <br /> First, we have the absurdity of gantry background. We Anakin was found as a baby on Tatooine, the product of the virgin, the miracle of birth - in the "chosen one." Well, this piece will never be removed explain. Indeed, the closest explanation Yoda observation that perhaps they were wrong. Oh, well, then fine. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Currently, the same wunderkind is the creators of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And he returns to Tatooine and never knew he was there? Wow! How about this. Testing of the old suspension of disbelief is ready there, George? Anyway, we've got this bratty kid, moody, irritable, whining young adults who have somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinema history - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - a nice guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption eventually. <br /> <br /> How, please tell me, is this happening? Why, he has a dream that his wife dies during childbirth. Now, of course, he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity as we process the gasoline, but it comes with a "dark to be" maybe consult with your doctor the reason maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society may can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think to do is to kill the baby because the bad guy at the root of all evil, they were chasing two films tells him that he has the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> As Lucas can expect us to watch such nonsense and be moved by it? How can you expect us to care? Damn, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. I would Kenobi to kill him, not because he was angry, but because it has been pathetic stupid. <br /> <br /> Oh, Padme finally dies. In childbirth. Why? Well, they do not know. The doctor who droid himself shows incredibly high technology, which is a society marked, offers only conclude "it has lost the will to live." Well, well, well, of course, it is. Maybe it finally dawned on her that she's sleeping with a wimp. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have Kenobi gift for all. He knows about the birth of Luke and Leia. He knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. He knows, moreover, the role of both R2 and C3PO. Nevertheless, for several years, as Luke approaches and shows the courage to 3PO and R2 (interestingly, the mind wipe 3PO in, but R2's - why ????) stating, "I think those droids belong to you "Obi-Wan, who knows that the protocol droid one believed it was built" chosen "and a disciple of the Emperor, and that will just be built on the same planet, says:" it is strange, but I do not remember having any droids. " <br /> <br /> Oh good grief. <br /> <br /> Lucas just thought of it as it developed. After he presented Vader Luke's father, unfortunately, the story began spinning out of control, because he does not know what the story was. Episodes 1-3 plot is incomprehensible. Nothing did Palpatine made no rational sense. And none of these links in the story that he initially told Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This is an afterthought, and it looks it. <br /> <br /> I can not give this film a high ranking, it reminds me of the triple X. A fun movie to watch, but it is forgotten. Star Wars will be in my memory forever. Fortunately, this is one and the two that preceded it, will soon disappear.
