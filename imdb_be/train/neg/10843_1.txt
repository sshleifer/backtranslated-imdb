Perhaps this was done to hell, but it was probably the worst film I've seen in years, the best thing about all DVD will be so !!! I am surprised that people take the time to do something about the garbage and even spend money on it, too, I'm glad I only rented. I believe that the real fans of this film will probably have to be sadistic and gothic take care of him, not taking any CGI or any other effects for that matter, I hope that Alex Chandon learned a lesson about the lighting and SFX, to make the best movie in the future, that is, if it is still in operation. <br /> <br /> Note to buyers it is very frustrating not buy it !!!!!
