This ambitious film suffers most from delusions of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson greatness. Highly qualified derivatives are much better material (Altman "Nashville" Lumet's "Network"), the clumsy elephant takes too long to get anywhere. Pairs wayward detours along the way (awkward musical interlude, the biblical plague) does not help the cause. Nor does the uneven level of performance. Especially bad: William H. Mays, whose character and the plot could be easily removed as a whole; Julianne Moore, her unconvincing grief. And how many times we have seen incompetent mot John C. Reilly ( "Chicago" and "Hours" will be enough)? Tom Cruise will star well compared ?? his misogynist, foul-mouthed Holy Roller was pretty funny. Speaking of the infamous mouths, the script was so loaded with bombs «F», they have lost their influence in the shortest possible time. Do not even talk about that terrible soundtrack, full of tasteless and annoying vocal Aimee Mann. Its enhanced performance of «One» sentimental number to start with, has led me into a rage at the beginning of the film. I had heard the handwriting on the wall, and escaped about three hours, during which time I have been moved to the edge of hell. One emollient, which I have not seen mentioned in other reviews, this is the best result in a heap on neizvestnymam Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, damaged coke FIEND bent on self-destruction. Its authority surpassed all others away. This film took itself too seriously, and just does not know when to end.
