A few months ago, I was involved in a dispute with another poster IMDb (Hey, Kmadden) about this movie. Poster insisted that if I gave the "Flushed Away" a chance, I'd like it. Based partly on the argument, I agreed to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> «Flushed Away" has good intentions (at least in part by Aardman), but not strong enough to pull it all together. His best asset sewer rat captain / boat, Rita (played by Kate Winselt), which, IMO, should be the main character of the film instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita's cool, tough and interesting, while Roddy spends most of his screen time to whine. <br /> <br /> One of the things that most excited me about the «FA» is the repetition of jokes that are not funny to begin with. If Roddy gets hit in the squat, the film makes sure he gets immediately hit five more times. "My name shocks," says one of Rita's brothers, who then electrocutes Roddy, at least three times. May tolerance cheap gags, which include pain at an all time low. <br /> <br /> I will not spend time on colic Katzenberg kleptomaniac tendencies toward Pixar (one such film coincidence, five's a rip off.), but I will say that I am disappointed by Aardman. They can do (and have done), so much better. Try harder next time, guys.
