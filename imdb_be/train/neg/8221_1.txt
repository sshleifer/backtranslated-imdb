This "movie" trying to follow the genre of low-budget, hand-held camera click, which proved to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This one goes down, and how. <br /> <br /> it is amazing how many so-called "rewards" that piece of garbage was plastered on the cover ..... it makes you wonder what these critics, when they are actually presented this .... <br / > <br /> Words can not describe how absolutely awful this film really is. Seriously, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I watched it in 20 minutes flat, almost constant fast-forward. <br /> <br /> From trash to the terrible lighting direction, grainy visual to the muffled sounds, and of course not forgetting the miserable act, it was one entirely pathetic piece of so-called film-making <br /> <br / > it is serious, it has no redeeming qualities. - general. Save your money and look decent low budget horror flick, there's a lot there - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, to name just some of them <br /> <br /> To avoid this rubbish any price .. do not waste your money and time on this piece of garbage pretending the actual film. <br /> <br /> Beware of all other comments! You have been warned!
