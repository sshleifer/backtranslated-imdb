There are films like "Plan 9", which are so bad that they have a charm about them, there are some, like "Waterworld", with the same strange draw a car accident, and there are some, like "Desperate life" that you hate to admit you like. Cowgirls none of these redemptions. Gathered enough talent to make almost any story watchable, and from what I have said that the book is enjoyable. <br /> <br /> How can this film so unbearably bad? To begin with, it seems the director has collected the names of the actors with no other tie than that will bring in 20-something. Then tell them to do their best imitation of Kevin Costner. Open the book at random and start shooting everything that is on the page, making sure to keep the wide open spaces of America, it is interesting anyway. Finally give editing work for your brother-in-law, because the meat-packing plant just put it. He has twenty years of cutting experience. <br /> <br /> This movie currently defines the foundation for me. It is so bad that not even good to be bad.
