Where to start. The film started pretty good, but after 30 minutes the marking I found myself staring at the clock. Horror at the beginning of the movie was good, but then the story legs. This is just dumber and dumber as time ticked by. <br /> <br /> The actors gave an average performance in this film, however, I got a little bored Vinny Jones permanent angry in the film. <br /> <br /> in the film was delayed, and take my word, it dragged on, it just got more and more contrived. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought that the film can not be worse, to the end loads when looking for the skeleton monsters appeared just to eat the dead man who has no sense at all. It turned out that some of the cult of eating the flesh and the good guys die in the end. The end is really just made me laugh, it was bad. After leading role manages Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie Creep made to look like the best horror film ever made. I gave it 1 star because the leading man has done a very good job, but even she could not save this train wreck movie !!
