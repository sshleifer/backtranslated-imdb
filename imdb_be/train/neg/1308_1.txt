The fact is that actually gets me about this film (which means that about this film, which makes me physically ill) that someone actually paid to have it done. There is absolutely no objective existence of this film. It's not terrible, it is not thoughtful, it is not interesting, it is not good. It's a sleeping pill of cyanide. DVD case compares it with the Blair Witch, Evil Dead, and several other worthy films, filmmakers making a desperate defiance is evident. This is nothing like any other movie ever made; it is far, far worse. Claims "extremely shocking finale you will never forget" are the equivalent of one ton of stinking litter horses. Please do not waste your time watching this piece of garbage, because it can make you sterile. The man who wrote this film should be wiped off the list of members of the writer's guild, and never allowed to take anything back. Because, when he thought it was a movie worth doing, it probably has almost nothing to offer in the future. Zero stars. May Grod have mercy on the souls of those who are unfortunate enough to see it. I'm going to go vomit now.
