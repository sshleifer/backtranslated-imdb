I love silent movies, but it was a little too idiotic. As much as I would like to say that it's worth the hour, I got up, I can not. I do not think that any version of the film even comes close to the book. And do not try it on the kids, they might freak out. And the woman who played Pollyanna, how old she was? 38? I know that labor laws were different then ... BUT COME ON PEOPLE.
