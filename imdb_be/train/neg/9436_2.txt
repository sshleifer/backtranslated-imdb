Frustrated worth the typical trend slasher story in the early 80s. Pretty young girl in danger. I have to give it to the director, who used a helicopter for some early road trip shots, you really think for a second there is quality in production. Watching "Distracted" was like seeing an amateur class acting to go through this workout. Some of the most uncomfortable, poorly lit, overlong scenes are played with gusto FLA overdose. I wondered why they did not just put the cue cards on the camera as actresses do not have to constantly change their look. The two main girls were obviously chosen for their T & A factor, and not talent. Laurel Munson as the main chick Terry is as exciting as watching paint dry. Two naked scenes make for teen thrills. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle like crazy / horrible daughter and mother chicks are in a difficult situation with competing for worst actor Ever. Long pauses, a strange expression, the emphasis on the wrong word, it's all there, and it's fun for those of us out there who love bad movies. Scenes shift suddenly with long black outputs, you can drive a truck Mack later. Cartoon lightning cuts through the shots, did not even show the sky. Eighties eyeshadow attacks the viewer. But I know it has grown on me. I felt sorry for him. I wanted to hug her, kiss his boo-boos and make it better. The ending is entirely compensate for the damage that it caused, but I still smiled. I have my own theory about the whole "forbidden" deception and I hope that anyone who wants to watch this film does so with significant substance abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise, pass.
