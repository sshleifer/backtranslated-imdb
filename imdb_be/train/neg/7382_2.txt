Well, let me say that I have always been a fan of Steven Seagal and his films are usually great, but it just did not measure up to the others. This, in my opinion, very stupid, I do not like all this. The biggest reason I do not like it, because it is very imperfect and I does not make much sense. Action is very bad, even Steven Seagal does not act well, other actors, I can see, because they are just straight to video movies. It does not follow a straight storyline, everything happens at once, so that is why it does not make much sense. Ther hardly any action in it for everyone, and to do good fighter you usually need action in it. The special effects are really bad, and you can tell are fake. So all in all it should seagals the worst movie of all, so if you want to see Steven Seagal movie not to rent it just to pretend does not exist. So avoid this movie <br /> <br /> Overall rating :. ** with ********** <br /> <br /> * to *****
