(Review in English, as the Swedish are not allowed) <br /> <br /> I saw this film with very low expectations, and I, unfortunately, I can inform you that the film almost lived up to them. <br /> <br /> how much I enjoyed seeing Janne «Carlson» Joffe on the big screen again, the authors should have realized at the beginning of the scenario process that seven people are falling into the water it is not original or funny. The story is very thin and used jokes and predictable, those that are not, it's just boring. I smiled as three times during the film <br /> <br /> Swedish Findus product placement is (unintentionally) funny, why not just big sign saying. "Findus did it!". <br /> <br /> Göta Kanal 2 should not be considered in the cinema or on DVD, just wait for it to air on TV, it will not take too much time.
