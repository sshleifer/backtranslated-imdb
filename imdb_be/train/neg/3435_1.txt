I ordered an extremely rare and highly valued film on EBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this film. As an eternal fan of horror from poor 80th American slashers in European zombie movies, I told myself, that would be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it would be largely gorier, than it actually is. In the end, I heard about this movie, I was almost afraid to look. Murder are boring. Actions ... remember, there's no action! History, even if we do not take care, incredibly bad. It seems that they were trying to get your attention with some amazing sex scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately, in this case it does not help the film. Why? There is no atmosphere, and it's the worst thing about this film. It's just a bad shooting from point A to point B. Although this is a very funny and fun to watch with friends and a lot of beer, do not make any effort to get your hands on. There are so many movies in the world, do not waste your time browsing Necro Files!
