Crude, rude several times - for me it is the summation of the latest work Madhera Bhandarkar - Page 3. He has no point of view - only small, funny dripping on stereotypes. What is the film about ?? Whether it is about the message of Clan people (the so-called Page 3 types), are so busy communicating and progressing their profiles in life - they do not have time for anything else. You either have it or out of it. Except that there is no press at all to report daily incidents. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a major newspaper and Page 3 is the only supplement; possible to verify the entertainer who's who and what's what. Do not mix the two. And then there's the power of the game - it will take place in all spheres of life. So what you said at the end of it all - nothing - only a few crude jokes strung together in the other direction less than the film.
