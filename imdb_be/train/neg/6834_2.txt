Gee, what a hell of a movie! ... I said that I wanted to become an expert in bad films from all decades, so I decided to start with this. It was quite adequate choice. I went into this adventure to find some lost gems and masterpieces incomprehensible, but I have not seen anything like this pastel-colored mess. I do not really watched a lot of bad movies before, but I have a feeling that this is what is called the "so bad it's good", probably because it's so damn funny unintentionally! First of all, there are some uncertainties. There is a story associated with inaccuracies, inaccuracies physical and psychological malfunctioning. The latter, in particular, such as mad as buttocks Van Damme inside this blue spandex. Very sticky lines also exist, and I will not even begin to talk about some funny passages actions. There is not really bad acting from everyone involved in this hot mess of the film, except for one case. Jeffrey Lewis looks very poorly, as Frank, which is totally stupid character. And to be honest, I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing a twin. He succeeded in reaching a different tone and mood of the two roles that were convincing for me. But the film was mostly very bad and the sad thing is that it was carried out large-scale film studio ... which is now bankrupt.
