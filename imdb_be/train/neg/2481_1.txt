I've never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but judging by these efforts in writing and directing, he should keep his day job as an apprentice actor. Like many others on here, I do not know how to classify this film, it was not scary or sinister so can not be called horror story was so ultrathin can be no tragedy, there was no uncertainty, so it can not be a thriller, it's just bad movie you should see only when you have been a supporter of Blair witch project. People who liked this film used the word as "ambiguity" and the complex and subtle, but they read that was not there. As Blair Witch Project, people were afraid, because people believed that they should be scared and bought some guff that it was scary. This film actually started well with a "meeting" family locals after hitting a deer. It looked like being a modern disposal, but then for the next 45 minutes (and more than half of the film), nothing happened, pottery family about his holiday house, which was all very fine and dandy, but not least entertaining. It was obvious that local people will be involved in some way at some point, but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in the film. Finally, if something happens, it is not even clear what had killed his father, how he died, (the nurse said that his liver was only grazed), and all the time it's Wendy's spirit apparently stalking the alleged shooter in a very awkward with the third class special effects. The film is called a Wendigo, but no attempt is made to explain it in a clear way, the film ends with all the confusing and leaves you very unsatisfied, I would have jumped from 15 minutes to go, but I wanted to see if this film could redeem himself, he did not.
