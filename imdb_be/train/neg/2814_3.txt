First I watched 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Toba Hooper): It is terrible, but the sadistic (which makes sense) drawing relative Marquis De Sade performing the sadistic action and enjoy it, that, say, his predecessor I did. This movie Tobe Hooper does not really do a whole lot different than it like Freddy Krueger style movie with the same star (Freddie himself - Robert Englund) plays a dual role (the Marquis de Sade and his cousin). In addition, it seems that he wants to really poke in Christianity and then loses, in the end, to my chagrin, but leaving with mixed feelings to the film. It could have been much worse if the kinks have been taken into sex and violence, but they try to keep it at a minimal level, despite some ugly scenes. My last thought, why Hooper wanted to make this film. This obviously took some time to actually get the spread, it must be advertised and brutally Hooper named in the title, we hope to make some money in his name and his blood. Obviously, it did not work.
