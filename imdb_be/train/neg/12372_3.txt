I had high expectations of this movie (the name, in translation, "How do we get rid of the others") In the end, the concept is great:. A near future in which the ruling elite has adopted a consequence of constant verbal and legal pursuit of the right of governments so-called parasites and left wing as a whole, and decided to just kill all who can not prove that they contribute something to the creation of (the institution called the "common good", but in fact it means the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology). <br /> <br / > Very cool idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only, this film completely blows his chance. Satire comes in only a few scenes and performances of the absurd, but this satire entirely slow, it is neither sharp nor witty. And supposedly a comedy, the film has almost no funny scenes. comedy, I believe, should be the absurdity of the situation, but the situation is largely uncomfortable and too seriously, but without causing any laughter or thought. <br /> <br /> The script is replete with grave errors in the placement. Action should focus on the political aspects and how it would be wrong to do such a thing, but instead a bunch of time spent on a young woman who was the one who wrote the new laws for fun, and someone tries to save all organized resistance that comes to Africa. All this is beside the point! The film, as it should not claim so seriously! It is a satire! Political statement. But this does not even begin to really solve this problem as it should be about. Maybe he was afraid to go too far? Coward. This is not art. It's not even a real satire. <br /> <br /> Sren Pilmark, very serious and is now one of Denmark's absolutely senior actors, was very good. He basically delivered what little entertainment value of the film was not. Everything else :. Nothing special (well, maybe Lance Poulsen, who did deliver a convincing performance with the exception of) <br /> <br /> In fact, the problem with the majority of Danish films is that the language never sounds natural. Neither the wording nor the delivery. Why is it so hard to make it sound right? Why this should be so stilted and artificial? I hope that when people look at these films and fifty years, they do not think that this was the way people talked in general, Danish society. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
