I can not believe that it is a wooden piece writer and director of the film was made clich√©s. There are about four good-looking staff (director should think about switching to another photo), and that's all. Strong gypsum completely devastated scene repeatedly ends up in the least interesting moments and the script does not say anything new. Please save yourself the film.
