1937 "Stella Dallas" with Barbara Stanwyck certainly not aged well - someone thought half an updated version of the story will be working at the moment is a real puzzle. Maybe they thought that lively, fun arrogant Bette Midler can make something out of it, but this gray scenario defeats her. The plot of the female bartender with a child out of wedlock, and a few years later, a young girl giving to the rich father of the child, so she will have a chance at a better life, can not avoid the tasteless, old-fashioned attributes and attitudes. Midler works best with the movie director who can control their excesses, but it can not happen here; Stephen Collins phlegmatic, as someone who changes his life, but Trini Alvarado is well cast as the daughter in Midler. This is what used to be referred to as "a picture of a woman," and, while falling, but it does not pass inspection because he is too faithful to its origins the 1930s. * 1/2 ****
