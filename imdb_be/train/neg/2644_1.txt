The sight is all the soul-Hollywood lifeless and boring lack of imagination is present in so many films these days. I can not think of one good thing about it all is so common, because a factory and assembled so lazy that actually exists only as a promotional video about how to make money from the unsuspecting, unworthy of the public. <br /> <br /> section of the Secret Service agents planned to kill Prez may well be interesting. If handled well by a director or caring gypsum, that is. Douglas is the one who decorated. Basinger is the first lady, with whom he is dealing (immature, unsettled fiction section). Sutherland is the best friend, who believes him guilty, because there would be no movie if he did not. And Longoria nothing. Woman with Maybelline state and ... that's it. I believe that there is less demand for women at the entrance to the Secret Service. As usual, in the film, as is the role of Prez himself no more than a tool, a marker and a very badly written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, who gave us the same miserable matchmakers back in 2003, the mechanical direction lacks any signature and has all the visual sophistication of cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly boring and phone in their performances from afar. Eva Longoria, most of juggling woman of the 21st century, mostly only in this to attract Desperate Housewives audience. Its role is 100% meaningless and it does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to the development of character. She barely has 2 lines to rub together. Really shameless marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> If you are a masochist, do not let me stop you. But the time and money you will not get back.
