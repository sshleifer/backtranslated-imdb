This film is very funny movie. Violence is bad, the acting ... Well, Danny, stick to sing or scream or something, damn it, that's fine. Random chicks wearing next to nothing just to catch a sexually frustrated young men in gothic. Personally, I think this film really suck. Story and characters can be very good if to say, directing, actors and other small Nibby things were made better. But the film is simply bad, the only reason why people like this piece of shit, because he has Danny in it. This film may have the worst rate of B movie ever. And believe me, it is difficult to achieve, especially if you compete with Def temptation of bad excuses "serious" horror movies. I'm not a fan of CoF, and so I just see it as another waste film ... And in fact, bad. If Danny did it as a comedy, it's good to go with him. Very well done. More than that, though, I appreciated its low, it crappiness. See if you are in a happy, happy, joy, joy mode so that you can laugh at all, or, if you are high up on a number of different types of drugs.
