Here again is another Diane Lane movie, where she deceives her husband. This is the only role that she knows how to play? At this time it is set in 1969, and she deceives her husband with a blouse of man. I was not surprised, because it is so very predictable. Then her husband gets angry and throws the milk. I would not be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well. I would not be surprised if she slept with the ice-cream man, too, because it is very sad movie. Then, after some throwing milk, she says, I'm sorry, and then see the blouse man. Duh. Then, while she was doing this to him, her son gets stung by wasps. My mom always told me not to throw stones at a wasp nest. These are children, my mother did not have time to tell him that she was too busy with a blouse of man.
