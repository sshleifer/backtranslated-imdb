What a bad, bad movie !!! I can not believe all this hype that has been sketched in this pretentious, amateurish cause for real movie !! I left the theater before the end, stunned by how bad direction and camera work of the film was !! And read the ode adored, who claim there is truth and reality in this film, when all this is actually a blatant attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals economical and tasteless. <br /> <br /> at least, this movie showed me once and for all, that the Sundance Festival was a complete joke, and that, as shown here a shortcut bad film than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid any price. You want your time back! I know what I did.
