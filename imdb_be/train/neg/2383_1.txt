It is a candidate for one of the film the most frustrating experience of my life. Cool name, outstanding director (I saw «To Die For» and "Drugstore Cowboy" before), and hey - Uma Thurman in a cast. How can you go wrong? Well, it's a question that pounded in his temples for a few hours after I watched this turkey. <br /> <br /> incoherent and serious in trying to be unusual, it is a dead zone of the film, which should be avoided at all costs. Its critical refute was well deserved. You are one of those rare films that do not contain any softening qualities. Zero with ****.
