Drew Barrymore continues to see her alter-ego all over the city, and it's really starting to become a pain in the ass. <br /> <br /> After Dee rents an apartment from schlock writer, her meeting with the "other Drew" has become more frequent. Writer-man feels that it is his duty rigging "the real Drew" from his stupor, so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has free time. Not very interesting, and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially if it gives the group a rough construction worker thumb ... but to Drew Drew, what's hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene may just be where Drew pierces her real life mother, Jaid, with a large kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how is your day?
