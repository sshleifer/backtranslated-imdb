After already disappointing «Final Conflict», a series of hit rock bottom with the very weak fourth record. At least, the third film tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien, while this one just paraphrasing and copies ideas from "The Omen" (animals are afraid of the Antichrist, the death of one person is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film). But what looked interesting and creative it looks dumb here. And the little girl looks just like a spoiled child.
