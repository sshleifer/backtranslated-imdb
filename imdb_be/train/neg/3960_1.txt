Hey, maybe because I'm not a big or complex movie theater which oversees ... I think that this film is "boring" and "Dumb." <br /> <br /> I made this film because of Charles Bronson, and the name ... but boy, it's a waste of time ... just watch 2 guys who sit in the safe and say ... < br /> <br /> film on this DVD was so «DARK» ... I had a hard time watching the darn movie ... I understand that this 1968 film ... but they put it on the DVD, they should do some digital remastering. <br /> <br /> In addition, I was quite amazed to see the high scores on the IMDb this film ... as I said, I'm not as hard as other people who have commented on this film before.
