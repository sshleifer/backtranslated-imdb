This is a problem I have movies that come on TV, if there's nothing else to watch. Once I get involved in a very bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this was quite watchable. The concept of being the only ones left on earth after the comet, and then find out the zombies around makes me laugh. And that is why I gave this movie a 2 instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but in a way that makes you laugh (too stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I think I only watched it because the guy from Star Trek was leading. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and he was the only funny character in any way.
