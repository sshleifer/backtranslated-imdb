I recently watched the Belle Epoque, thinking that this could be the perfect, as it was to win the Oscar for best foreign language film. I was a little in awe of predictability and simplicity of the film. Maybe I had a conflict that from the time when the film was made at the present time, the plot falls on the person of beautiful women, and eventually fall so many times it was done on a good girl. In addition to the plot predictability, some scenes in the movie felt really out of place with the subject line (eg. For a wedding event). Sometimes the film was a little instructive in his ideas and against the Franco era the film was set, and the Church. The only thing the film has going for it was Cutesy things, decorations and character Violetta being a strong, independent woman at a time when women were not really connected with these characteristics.
