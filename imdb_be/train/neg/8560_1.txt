At what time we live in, when someone as Joe Swan-what the hell, it is considered a good director ... or even directed at all! Where a new crop of filmmakers with brains and talent ??? We need them badly, and to hell with mamblkor! <br /> <br /> This film is about anything, just like the movie characters stand for nothing. It is terrible, so-called Gen Y, which is full of bored idiots, some of whom declare themselves filmmakers from outside trying to learn something about the craft before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was the director. John Huston directed. Fellini directed. Dreyer was a film director, etc. Currently, films such as they show how foolish young, so-called "film makers" can be, if they believe the comfort, without a script, no direction, no thought, no legitimate "operator" (all shot horribly on DV), Amphibious craft editing, there is nothing, no means "rebellious," or "advanced" movie. No, this is called ignorance, laziness or just pure masturbation movie (and it really is in your face "jack-off shot," so be prepared). <br /> <br /> Look at the early films of any completed "indie "cinematographer: Linklatter, Maurice Allen Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee and Herzog ... none of something as difficult and unnecessary, as it is, but Swan-what the hell is still going to SXSW each year, and is regarded as a kind of fearless, new talent. this shit! I can not imagine anyone liking this, and everything else, it is the so-called the director did (all seen me) is just as bad (more new material is clearly made to appeal to a wider audience, one of the sitcom call). Stay away if you are not one or a family member who is involved ... on second thought, if you are a family member or friend, you'll probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations ... <br /> <br /> Utter rubbish. This is not art. This is the ultimate against him.
