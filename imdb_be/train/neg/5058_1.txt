(If I ever learn-?) Ecstatic reviewer on NPR made me think this turkey was another Citizen Kane. Please allow me to express my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I admit: the installation, presumably, New York has never been so completely ugly and unattractive. I recalled that the 70s was a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And smoking! If the plan was to cheapen the character, she succeeded. <br /> <br /> For the film to work (at least in my simple assessment), there should be at least one sympathetic character. Only Ned Beatty was close, and I could not wait for him to finish Nicky. If an errant shot struck Mick, well, it could have caused a shrug of indifference to the greatest extent. <br /> <br /> I can not remember when I hated the movie, how much. I believe I redneck, do not dig the "art" clicks. Oh, well.
