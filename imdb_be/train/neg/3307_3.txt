My comments may be a bit of a spoiler, for what it's worth. Stop now, when you care enough .... <br /> <br /> Saving Grace was called Â«Paper-Thin Justification for the old British women to get High On-Screen". This movie is dumb. Incidental music irritation as obvious, banal melodies, which sporadically emerge comment on the narrative ( "Spirit in the Sky", for example - Oh, I see) This is basically the movie Cheech and Chong did trust his heavy English atmosphere and the overwhelming power Blethyn to strike emotions to the audience, using his voice alone. I could literally hear the person in High Times magazine to get them over the vast Jollies "buds" that litter this picture. The worst scene? Easily. Brenda is trying to sell illegal goods on the streets of London in a roaring white dress-suit. Not funny. Nya original. Uninteresting. Not a very good movie. 7.2 Evaluation result is fanatics more voting. Do not waste your time ...
