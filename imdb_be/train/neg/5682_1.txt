This film is incredibly funny. I love horror movies, but this is the worst I have ever seen. I'm a big fan of gore, but most deaths are not shown in this film. It just shows us that even the dead bodies, and only death scene, they actually show in this film are terrible. The graphics look so obviously fake. Actors awful as well. There's no real emotion from any of them. Not only do I spend my time watching this piece of crap movie, but I had to expose themselves to real footage of animals shot down in the beginning. If I could evaluate -10, I would. F * ck this movie. This is crap. <br /> <br /> Or do not watch.
