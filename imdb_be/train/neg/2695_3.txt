When I go to the video store to rent a flick I usually do not trust IMDB views on the film, and while it never saw the film rated 7.0 or above on a site I did not use. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, the legendary director of some of the best 20th century films actually misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a director can :. filling the cast film with a thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever <br /> <br /> I do not like movies with flawed characters, but no matter how someone's dark personality we all have a bit of light there, too, we are all shades of gray color with some darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet's crossed the line, filling the film with a completely unsympathetic and almost masochistic quite clearly visible signs. <br /> <br /> Hank Ethan Hawke is a 30-something whining, immature, irresponsible man-child is torn from his marriage to his wife, she hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser, he's very much. His indecision and a willingness to let others do the dirty work for him, because he was too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan is falling apart and the mother killed. By the time he gets up to his older brother at the end of the film, it is more miserable than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but is not given much to work with as it is portrayed as one of the shoe permanently stamped on their faces, and it is not "particularly important that it's there. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which his wife character is just as bad. Almost every shot of the film is her verbally abusing his rent and child support money and further fragmentation of his defunct self-assessment with icons. Seriously, it's just about all the character makes. Her harpy as the behavior borders on malevolence. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays their father, Charles, and while Mr. Finney was a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of the film with the same open-mouthed half grin on his face, he suffers from the worst bout of constipation in the world. For someone who was an actor as long as Mr. Finney, do you think that it would be more appropriate to emoting. Despite the fact that he does not show it much, his character is supposed to sadness and anger filled the victim. When he puts out Andy in the film's conclusion it looks like Dr. Frankenstein put the monster he helped create with his own poverty. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei is not given much to do with her character. I stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and dealing with his brother for some inexplicable reason. When Andy's world begins to spin out of control, it is logical to jump ship, but it actually does not make it any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film, but probably one of the most common sense at measures. <, Br /> <br /> And finally, we come to Andy, always plays good Philip Seymour Hoffman, this is the only reason why I rated this film 3 instead of 1. Its implementation heroin, embezzlement financier who is the "perfect crime" robbery insured jewelry store of his father goes awry mesmerizing. Its origin is from the peaceful master scheduler vicious scheme to unstable, crazy maniac and tragically true. Hoffman's character ends up being the main villain of the film, but it's hard to root against him, given the alternative emotionally castrated brother and father, who repented the poor parents of early psychosis led to the final of his son and indirect, inadvertently killing his mother. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is really worth watching just for the great performance and PSH is a family train wrecks nature. Just do not expect there to be any character, get involved, because it is actually not.
