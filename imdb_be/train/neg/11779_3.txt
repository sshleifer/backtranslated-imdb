I do not like this film a lot. If you read the books in Puzo, or at least watched very carefully the first two films (especially the first), you are going to agree with me. <br /> <br /> In comparison with the saga of the Corleone presented Puzo novel, the script of the film, sometimes even funny. The characters and the relationships between them are distorted. The story ends without reaching anywhere, though, it seems to go in any direction through the film. <br /> <br /> It is understood that different times can be expected in the saga of the Corleone 90 years, and we're not going to find things the way they were before. But, on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some of the dialogue from other films, in an environment where they do not fit. Why is this? It sounds like those made bad sequels that are just trying to copy as the original film. <br /> <br /> What will never be clear, is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino teamed up to do it. The person who sent pieces like Apocalypse Now and the Godfather should be forgiven for almost everything that he does in the movie, until he dies. Just as Al Pacino, for what an actor he is. But Mario Puzo did not write it. How? He damaged his entire previous work. What a shame, my friend. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 90-story about the Mafia, which is great. We can never say the same thing about the plot for Godfather III.
