This is absurd - apart from fellow Australian, who reviewed this film, I can not help but think that all the others who presented a review so far has been in some way involved in the production of electro, given how generous they were out of their praise. <br /> <br /> I must say that I really am not a fan of comic books, to-film conversion, so I did not go with a lot of expectations, but still I found to be incredibly Electro destroyed. The fact that annoyed me most was that there was so much to this movie, which was released on the inexplicable, that left you thinking "yeah, what does this has to do with the story?" Or, "as well as the aspect of nature is going on? "I can only hope that these are things that may be attributed to some extent Daredevil, I have not the slightest intention to see. <br /> <br /> in addition, the behavior of the characters in this film with It is to make a turn around at random according to the storyline, and even tightening ki me a completely meaningless romantic south of the site. I also (still) scratch their heads over the fate of the character Tagawa, who seems to have gone unexplained. <br /> <br /> If I give kudos to this film for what it was would be a fantastic place in which he was shot, but otherwise I've got a bit of fun on electro. I know that we have to suspend our disbelief for a fantasy / action movies, but almost all have been so incredible in this film, or confusing (even by the standards of the film), it is easy It shocked me. <br /> <br /> Well, hell, at least, Jennifer Garner looks damn good.
