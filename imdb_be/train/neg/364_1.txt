Larry Buchanan. So, the same guy who did "Attack of the Eye Creatures" and two (count them: TWO) conspiracy movies about Marilyn Monroe. He is to blame here. <br /> <br /> Adding to his growing pile of folders left over from Oliver Stone's "A-I-grow-out of its" conspiracy drawer, here «Down On Us (IE-« outside the door " ), which is a working definition of historical inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you thought you knew about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar "Because this is the real deal! You see, the three biggest names in rock '60s were assassinated by the government because they were saboteurs and counter-truth, justice and the American way, or sumpthin ", like that. I know what it's all about. <br /> <br /> anyway, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf), who looks awfully like the shadow of their real life (that is, if you completely close your eyes, turn your back and walk five miles from them) shows that instead of their reported cases of death, the good old US ties hits on them! Yes, it's true! <br /> <br /> Man, I did not believe, NY about I watched this movie are facts, if not str etch confidence in the anchoring point, ridiculous,. actor makes TV commercials look like high drama and honestly watch it to the end, you deserve a "Twist" the end you really, really.; I swear .. Genius <br /> <br /> But like the man said :. "rock 'n' roll is dead - long live rock 'n' roll» <br /> <br /> not this movie, although <br /> <br /> no stars for "us." And that movie goers with the description of the film, by the way ....
