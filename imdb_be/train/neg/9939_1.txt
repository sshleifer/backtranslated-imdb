Film School intellects can spit all they want about the importance (imaginary) sense of the film, but it's just that: smart saliva. This film is creatively bankrupt, and some kind of mistake, is an endless one condescending jerk off as substance. Yes. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Godard was not a fan of Stones. Too bad, because it could be great. He capturing the birth of the eternal song, and he chooses instead to cover music from some guy reading a true detective Megan or some such shit. <br /> <br /> Then there is the endless shots of what looks like a 60's librarians spray-painting words on people cars. And then, seemingly endless "interview", where the actress brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no all the really deep and intelligent questions. There's a man in a purple suit reads more crap from the book, which goes for, oh, only about 20 minutes. And the black panther or something in the dustbin. <br /> <br /> It almost sounds intriguing? Well, it's not. <br /> <br /> But unwashed hipsters film school, who do not care squat about lost opportunities that have full access to the stones that bring Sympathy for the Devil in the world, and would like to hear some English guy reads instead of in while looking at Nudie magnetic cover, this film a real winner! <br /> <br /> More specifically ... maybe Godard simply blows away.
