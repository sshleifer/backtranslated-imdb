I regret every second of the time I lost while watching this movie, actually. Unfortunately, I always find it difficult to exclude the film, when I started to watch it. Especially if it's a classic or what people used to be called a classic. I think this is one of those movies, each movie-lover should be monitored at least once, so that's why I watched it. Do not get me wrong, I love Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall and as a couple, and as actors, but the film was a big deception, in my opinion. A lot of really good story or a spy movie or a romantic love story. Well, not even convincing mixture of both of these genres. The only thing that has strained that it was unclear whether the "scarecrow" and Bacall will stay together in the end or part of each other. I think "Have and Have Not" very overrated and Bogart in many of the best films during the 1940s.
