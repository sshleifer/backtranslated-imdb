This is definitely one of the most frustrating and terribly acted account of the first days of Adolf Hitler, which I have ever seen. Robert Carlyle a great actor, but to throw it, Hitler is simply wrong. In order to cast Liev Schrieber as one of Hitler's long-time and assistance, Haefengstal be emitted cries of despair and suffering of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. J-W plays Nazi supporter bad bad bad casting. It was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background. It was Hollywood trash at its finest, cashing in on the strength of a strong (but sorely underused) supporting cast of actors, who seemed to have all but disappeared from the radar for the past 5 years. <br /> <br /> fake German accent (VI Vill Vin ZIS Var) insult to the German people in the world. My mother is German, and she sat, fuming at the sound of the voice, which contained a transition from American / English / German all in one sentence. The supporting cast do a better job of cardboard cutouts at the local video store than on the screen. Jena Malone as a convicted Raubal was gorgeous, though, she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who finally ended his own life to avoid what its future would be in the shadow of Hitler. <br /> <br /> If you would like an extremely fantastic and historically accurate account of the early years of Hitler in front and including war / Holocaust rent "Inside the Third Reich" in 1983, starring Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler . It was good, and the more sense it's nonsense. <br /> <br /> As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you it was, I reached for my book to confirm your countless inaccuracies.
