for a long time, I'm looking forward to see this film, here in Latinamerica Japanese or any oriental films has not spread in the theater, we can find some of these films in some underground storage facilities, and I just found the Avalon, I have something the expected good, but the only good thing in this movie is the scene of the first, the rest of the film is sad and meaningless, just silly, with a lot of unnecessary scenes and sad stories. I'm wasting my time even writing about this film. Sorry, but it's true.
