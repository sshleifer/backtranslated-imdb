I am very tolerant of really bad SCI / science fiction and horror films - I watched them since I was 4 or 5, so I've seen some really bad things, but I deal with it. I even watched a lot of SciFi Channel movie, so I do not know, we should expect a lot - usually in a promising film that has no ending talk. Hope springs eternal, I think - or the triumph of hope over experience, as they say. Unfortunately, it is a dog from the beginning, and I knew it, but, like a butterfly on the fire, I kept thinking, something, something interesting will happen. It does not. All the actors give a decent performance - this scenario, I do not know how they kept a straight face. It has something to do with collagen starving creatures worm parasites that are slowly taking over the human race, one body at a time. There's also an evil plastic surgeon that collaborates with the enemy, giving them the appearance of a man ... do not worry, he gets what's coming to him. Slug people do not know where they came from, they think that they might have leafed through a trip to the meteor that landed on the ground, but ... somehow they know about the members of the royal cork among them - snail Princess managed to breed with a man who knows what it is, the worm queen and loves her for herself ... oh, I have to go? Please, I beg you, do not spend 2 minutes of your life watching this ... something ... it would be better to think of the worst, no less enjoyable ways you can spend two o'clock ... it would be better than this.
