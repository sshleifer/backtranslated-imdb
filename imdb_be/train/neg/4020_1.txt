I will never be a member of any club that would have me, <br /> <br /> This is especially true one. <br /> <br /> Page Endreff is a single mom / stripper who gets attacked by a <br /> <br /> vampire and left to die. She starts to get bored for <br /> <br /> blood, and meets with John Savage, watching him <br /> <br /> I wonder where he left a phone number Michael Cimino. Savage <br /> <br /> Also, a vampire and wants to join him Andreef little vampire <br /> <br /> family, consisting of the UK vamp, blonde vamp who <br /> <br /> attacked Starr, and dwarf green hair (I do not do it <br /> <br /> up). <br /> <br /> in the family does not want to Starr, so they are trying to kill Savage and Starr <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br Starr's child. /> Someone forgot to tell you, John Savage, it was a drama. He <br /> <br /> spends most of his screen time exposure tics over the face <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant on Jolt Cola bender, and he reads all his lines like <br /> < br /> it makes the film the Farrelly Brothers. Andreeff trying to do <br /> <br /> Most of poorly written role, but writer / director Ruben leaves <br /> <br /> for all vampire clich√©s like Starr eats hamster pet his son <br /> <br / > and buy a lot of raw meat to fight thirst for blood. Baby <br /> <br /> also gets knocked around a lot, for those who think they see <br /> <br /> violence against children is really interesting. <br /> <br /> The film is more mountains, but not in the wild, on top of the road as "Killer <br /> <br /> Russian language." Here the blood is complete and never justified it just happens. <br /> <br /> It's just in the budget. Most of the R rating comes in <br /> <br Andreeff /> co-authors, who are put through offensive routine strip <br /> <br /> background conversation scenes. The budget does not include <br /> <br /> The Vampire fangs! All the vampires here have to stab their prey to eat. <br /> <br /> Nifty idea, if you've seen <br /> <br /> George Romero's "Martin." <br /> <br /> Even at 77 minutes, and once you throw in an attempt to Ruben <br /> <br /> arts direction (skewed images, blurred scene), it is one <br /> <br /> tiring, boring and dirty riding. Leave the club and take a shower, <br /> <br /> You'll need it. <br /> <br /> This is the ranking (R) for a strong physical violence, armed violence, sexual <br /> <br /> violence, strong blood, strong profanity, female poverty, sexual <br /> <br /> references, drug abuse, and adult situations. <br /> <br />
