Three Russian aristocrats soak Monte Carlo decadence, even though they are up to the last penny. In order to support their lavish lifestyle, three use the services of a counterfeiter, and use the notes in the casino, hoping to exchange fake currency in the jackpot. Andrew Hughes, the US envoy, arrived in Monaco with his wife Helen and three decided to buddy up with visitors, in the hope of financial support. One of the three Russian, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to go further, with the continuous progress toward Elena, but disappointing maid of Count, who loves Sergius. In the end, circumstances play a hand against three aristocrats. It is obvious that von Stroheim is trying to convey a message (with the foolishness of American women and the improper behavior of the aristocrats), not to tell a story, and the film can really wear modern audience, like me, easily making it. Even the action, which is larger in the later the EVS, like greed and the Wedding March just mediocre here. The film could use improvement at different levels. Rating 3.
