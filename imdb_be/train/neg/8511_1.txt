I could not for the life of me, to watch, to find out or understand the history. As the story progresses it also remains unclear. I'm going to guess and say that there was a problem pre-production story / plot, which was never dismantled. The producers could not separate a lot of details that the novel, or any novel, has the time and space to create from a different idea, which was to make a film about a serial killer and prosecution of the killers of the police. They end up too many things going on in the band gap of the film features life. It is a pity, really, because they have a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things around and a great movie. In fact, a well-made film, which could enjoy and relax for a few hours.
