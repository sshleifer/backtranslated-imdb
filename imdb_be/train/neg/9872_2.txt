Kind of hard to believe that a film of this book may succeed in topping him terribly! The plot is so contrived and unbelievable. ,, Since bookmark a ton of wine for a small child, to spare her the pain! Then we have the plot, at least six and perhaps more people (including clergy), involved in what is a crime in the world. Next we have a wife who, it would seem, in the long ferry ride goes from relatively happy soon kicked over the traces. It is very unpleasant and coo coo mother helped, abetted and supported politically correct group of friends! Moving the unit with the island off the coast of South Carolina, have not helped stories, though, may have helped the budget filmmakers. Very beautiful building allegedly housing the monastery did not seem logical to approach the island is small enough to need a wheelchair course and such a small ferry. Kim Basinger, whom I really love hurt in this thin film, and her hairstyle is certainly the case in the next decade. In addition there is simply no chemistry at all between it and any of the male leads. I absolutely loved the book from which it was taken but read the whole thing. I continued to surf the film back and forth, I had to leave if that saccharine music became too much. If you do not enjoy the incredible story, wooden, which operates on a mixture of distorted religious / mythological / allegory, my advice is to skip it. Yes, and maybe a little nagging criticism, not caring father have a life jacket on a small child in a small boat? The best part of the scenery of the film
