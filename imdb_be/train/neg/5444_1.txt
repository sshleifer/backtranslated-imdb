It was 1974 and he starred Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> That in itself tells what to expect from this film. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the movie, Slovic was reformed, I had a good woman, and did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovic may be naive innocent, or he may have simply wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Who Slovic was or was not for history to decide, but it was a film that dealt dessertion at a time when the country was questioned why he was fighting, but the film took part. <br /> <br /> excluding soldiers who were in Vietnam and in 1974 (as told to Willie Nelson, let's tell the truth, it was about the Vietnam War, not the Second World War), EoES was propaganda as Gung Ho was in the forties. <br /> <br /> according to this film, Slovic expressed its position clearly and simply. He had problems with the nerves. Heck, I have the clinical condition of the nervous, and believe me, if I did military duty, then there would be no problem for me or just let my nerves are not on my goals and get a reduction in the office or put on KP duty or latrine duty without any problems. <br /> <br /> If we believe that teleflick, Slovic do not have this option, no doubt because of his criminal history. <br /> <br /> what would the audience want to believe to the viewer. I learned that movies of this decade, or decades, or in the decision of the military service, will largely take the same position over and over again. <br /> <br /> 1940s and 1950s, to serve his country. <, Br /> <br /> 1960s and 1970s, to tease his country. <br /> <br /> This is the story. <br /> <br /> whole movie seemed to me predictable Hollywood. He refused to serve, and only when he was to be bound to be carried out it shows emotions. <br /> <br /> This emotional outburst could easily have worked in his favor in a statement his nervous condition, but, obviously, the film wanted to show him as a man, and only when he was going to die, he began to mourn. <br /> <br /> I'm not Catholic, but I thought that the concert in Virgin Ned Beatty and Sheen in the end, with the Lord's Prayer, it was funny, it sounded like they were trying to find out who might say that this faster. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this film could be seen, not realizing that this is aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope this is all worth it Slovic and those who decided to follow his example.
