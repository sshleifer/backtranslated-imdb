Despite the fact that this film was made prior to Dogme it has emerged as the preferred method of filmmaking, and to win over the digital - to strike it. You get the point. This masterpiece of 1991 is clearly ahead of developments. Corin Nemec is simply outstanding as a ne'er do well as author and narrator. The pace is slow, but elegantly so, because cinema is so beautiful. Write it the next time it on TV, because I guarantee you'll never see a better plagiarism of nostalgia-for- film tanker. Direct video never felt so good!
