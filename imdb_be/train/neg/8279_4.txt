This film has all the elements to be smart, sparkling comedy, but for some reason it took Dumbass route. Maybe it really did not know who his audience: but this is unlikely given the man the film cast and plot, but too slapstick and the dumb blonde, in order to fully appeal to women <br /> <br /> If you are already seen. Legally Blonde and its sequel, this is how amazingly terrible sequel. Great actors such as Luke Wilson should expect the best material. Jessica Simpson, too, would get so much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Ann Miller languish in support roles that are stupid and not funny. <br /> <br /> Much of this film were painted by numbers, various uber-plate mounting, at the last minute "misunderstanding", even kids party chaos. It just goes to lazy writers. <br /> <br /> It should be possible to find this film enjoyable, if you do not take it seriously, but it's such a blatant could-do-better than you are likely to feel frustrated and more frustrated as the scene to roll past.
