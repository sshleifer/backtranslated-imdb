Style but no substance. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as he wants to be. <br /> <br /> This is in the genre of films about difficulties of filmmaking. Young filmaker hired to finish mannered 60s sci-fi movie called Codename: Dragonfly. Think Barbarella, or danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is an angst-ridden filmmaker. He did not hack he is an artist. The film he wants to make a diary of his life. It is hardly original. <br /> <br /> All of the characters is a filmmaker Jeremy Davies as thin as rice paper. Characters that can be interesting, such as his father, his double, or Jason Schwartzman as schlock director introduced, and then the door, without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This film is full of eye candy, but if compared to other films about filmmakers such as Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 it pales in comparison. These films are funny, provocative with well-developed characters. These films are lessons that apply outside <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comic and mannerisms, but it's just the derivative is not a funny scene. The filmmakers describe it as a mockery, but what a satirical purpose? Actors say that this tribute, but I think I would prefer a full-length version of Codename :. Dragonfly <br /> <br /> Coppola clearly amused installation, as can be seen on visual humor, sci-fi film in the film. But he did not share why we have to be pleased. <br /> <br /> Beyond the science fiction film it just a mess. There is a continuity error, the director chooses a sci-fi weapon, after it has already been chosen. What? <br /> <br /> Just because it has been the stage director is facing criticism complains about the lack of history, the lack of points, the scene in which he makes an empty mind does not mean that he has addressed these criticisms. <br /> <br /> I think if your Roman Coppola, you can get away with making a film about an angst-ridden idealistic filmmaker who does not know what he wants to say, and so in the end is not saying anything. In this sense, it can be considered autobiograhical. <br /> <br /> I would have to look at Circuit City on a wall full of television, when I had a choice. Watch the 15-minute Codename: Dragonfly movies included on the DVD as extras, and then send it back.
