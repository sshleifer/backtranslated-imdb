I agree with everything, Calamine said! And I do not always agree with the people, but what Calamine said very precisely, it's time for the girls to go to more roles. I would like to see them a lot of success, as they were very inspiring steam rising, and I'd love to see them grow as people, actress, and in their careers and their personal lives. Therefore, manufacturers, please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes on a tangent a bit, move them into a new direction, which recognizes them individually and their talents in many aspects. This film, which is currently being commented on is not so bad, but as I saw more in their films, their films are the same typical section and typography. When in Rome is good for the younger generation of the audience, but also adults who were children when the twins were the children want to follow the twins in their successes and back, so I think that we adults would like to see what they are doing films of different kinds maybe some of them are like a sixth sense, an hour, Chocolat, this kind of cinema - not only says that the serious films for them, the humor of which is also the case, but rather to see them in different roles that they play in the his later films, like this one, and New York minute. (Note: I'm from Australia so excuse my strange writing like reognise with s instead of z)
