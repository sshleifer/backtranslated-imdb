War, Inc - a corporation to take over in the future war and use the lone gunman Marc Hauser (John Cusack), to make them work against wetting competing leaders. Dark comedy satirizes the military and corporations. It is often difficult to understand what exactly is going on. I kept waiting for things to make sense. There's no reason or method of madness. <br /> <br /> It is considered Cusack to be a "spiritual successor" to Grosse Point Blank. Ie, the war more or less knock-offs. Once again we see Cusack as a murderer, which protects * spoiler * Man, he must kill him to get to grips with his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack looks kind of confidence in taking out a half-dozen guys with relative ease. Short fights look good. The rest of the film does not. This is all nimble often borders on the bizarre. War Inc is not funny enough to be a parody, as well as floating for anyone to even think about all that the message of the film may be, I believe, can be a heartless way that corporations such as war factions are competing and the scheme without a drop of paid in how they affect ordinary citizens. Interesting, but satire just does not work, because it's not funny, and at its heart the film has no heart. We have to give a damn about how war affects the skin Cusack's character, not millions of lives torn apart by war. <br /> <br /> John Cusack gives a decent performance. His character snorting hot sauce boom and drives the smallest private jet, but strangely designed to replace the character traits. Marisa Tomei in the slums as a romantic friend of the journalist. There's really not much chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent, and not make a fool of yourself. Joan Cusack just screams and screams and wigs. Blech. Ben Kingsley, you may have to return the Oscar if he does not begin doling out decent performance now and again. Helpless. <br /> <br /> This is not a scary movie, but in the end you have to ask, 'War, it was good, "Absolutely nothing?. C-
