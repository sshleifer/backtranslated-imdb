I'm still trying to determine whether there was worse than this one, or vice versa pre-payment. Being that it is almost fifteen years since I saw this film, the fact that I remember so little about it does not bode well. Maybe it's just because I looked only once or twice, but I doubt it. If there was something worth remembering about this film, you can be sure, I remember. <br /> <br /> At the time this film was released, the franchise still comes into the dying phase, so much in the media was allocated to it. It's never a good sign when the teenie pop magazines contain an explanation of the basics of the plot. One such article should have explained that Freddie had been left too weak to infect dreams a grown man, so he decides to go after the unborn son of Alice. So far, so good, but is the work of a writer or director, to explain to the audience. Should not be left to some unrelated publication. <br /> <br /> Using this detail in the third part of the concept of Freddy, you would expect half of the scene, which would raise the joke with "horror for children" category, but unfortunately it was not to be. This shows the obvious stupidity of the American system of evaluation that part B'harni-esque trash, as it could get the same rating as a truly frightening piece as the original. <br /> <br /> So far, the franchise can not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide competent action factor. Or perhaps she just looks competent in comparison with the rest of the cast. In any case, given that her last role was in something called the all-new adventure Chastity Blade, I doubt that it was really something to be more to it. Even poor old Englund was in the best productions than in the past fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Given that cash earnings were in steady decline, not only for this franchise, at the time, one would think that the studio would understand castration their films does not make them more salable. In fact, this film, like its immediate predecessor, was sterilized so that it is not only to attract a new audience, how it was alienating core audience, which initially supported the franchise. In spite of this, part of the five must be given some credit, having a bright, luminous sensation that made part of the four so disappointing to watch. <br /> <br /> I gave Nightmare on Elm Street Part Five in one out of ten, trying to appeal to everyone, and the idea MPAA all, it succeeds in accessing NoOne. As part of two and four, one can erase it with continuity completely, and no one will notice the difference.
