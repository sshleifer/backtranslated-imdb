Noble effort, I think, but ultimately poor. Before seeing this film, I felt "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was unfilmable. Seeing this, I still do. Unfortunately, I think that only those who read the story will understand what is going on, and they will be upset by the unnecessary film changes (updated from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even excellent talents Paul Scofield can not save what looks to me like a well-meaning but mislead the effort to film the metaphysical classic Melville.
