The explosion of TV channels should be eternally grateful to the production line Randolph Scott Western, because anyone at any time should be the one that seems to be a hundred and Randolph Scott movies play at least one non-budget station. <br /> <br /> "People of The Gun» is typical in the early 1950s, a period romance with prewar production values, which is based on historical actual murder mystery plot filled with scenes to hide the complete lack of character development, script, and thus, the lack of suspense, in subsequent years, the role of these films will be transferred to television shows like «Gunsmoke», «Bonanza," and so on - and it really did work better. Randolph Scott, looking especially gray this is a good guy fights the bad guys, against whom he would eventually win. There's no more interest in the fact that it passes emotionally, than the fact that his horse feels, except for wondering whether it will look into the initial misunderstanding with the female role to the end. Music is a strong indication of the emotional state of "characters" rather than acting. But that's okay, if it floats your boat; and I would not dishonor to enjoy "Diagnosis Murder", either. <br /> <br /> qualified, pedestrian, and is rapidly aging. 3 stars during intelligently connect; 0 for artistic creativity.
