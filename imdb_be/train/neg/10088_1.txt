I'm an actor, producer, director and what I'm going to tell the facts. This project was the worst film in the history of film-making. From producer to director and editing of this so-called joke movie, and I mean a big joke. Why Blockbuster released such nonsense? I take my job very seriously, and this film is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad film? I do not think so. I saw a bad zombie movie, but this takes the cake Coffie and all this damn table. This movie sucks !!! I really hate to say bad things about other filmmakers, because I am one myself, but please consider taking on another profession. I respect what you are finished film, but I have to ask you, "Have you been smoking CRACKÂ», I mean make-up on your girls, scary zombies, what you were thinking. For the whole country, if I could I would have voted Zero. The worst film in the film industry STORIES !!!
