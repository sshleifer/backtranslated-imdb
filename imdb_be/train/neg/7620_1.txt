I made this film because it sounds pretty interesting, but, to my horror, this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen! I read a comment on the Gumby-8, and it should be part of the cast or crew. If Gumby-8 is not a 4-year old child, or some crazy cult member, no one in their right mind would think that this movie was any potential at all. <br /> <br /> I could not believe that Gumby-8 comments. <br /> <br /> The citation: "With the" Dune "has inspired the opening animation at a rapid pace ... this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that the repeat viewing is not unexpected.» <br /> < br /> animation is the only aspect of the film, which was interesting, and the fact that the film keeps moving the eyes, and that is because you continue to search for any type of uncertainty. I mean give me a break Halloween was filmed with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and shows a mask, as well as ways to become a cult. As for the "repeat viewing is not unexpected," I think he made a typo <br /> <br /> Another quote from the Gumby-8 only fan :. "There is also a strong aspect of the film" <br /> <br /> With all due respect to the actors, their performance is not more than the corresponding talent Robert Napton <br /> <br /> Shot in a nutshell :. "Beware of the hour between dusk and darkness" <br /> <br /> it's because there is no twilight or darkness in this film. <br /> <br /> MPAA rating «Rated R for some violence / gore" <br /> <br /> only gore you see some red paint on a sheet over the dead body, you'll never see. As far as I know, this may be a lump of grass. <br /> <br /> In summation, I have seen the horrors of 50 -x, 60s and 70s. I saw what I thought to be absolutely the worst and some of which were very good. The director of this film or did not make any attempts, sleeping, took the brunt of acid. In any case, I think that the actors deserve applause for having to save a very poor job of direction. I would give this film rating .5 to «B» cinema.
