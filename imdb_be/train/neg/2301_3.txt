Or someone thinks that this show really helps some people, or is it only infuriate the people who watch it? When I was flipping through the channels and come to the show I watch with half an unhealthy curiosity. I understand that pet Roberson is not all together. what I do not know when his audience, he, or if they are good people and they think that they will have a better life when they listen to what he has to say. pat Roberson does not really matter. he is an old man who thinks in the old way. Sun fear the curse no longer has the same effect as it once did (thank God). Now, if someone please answer my question, I'll be dodging lightning till the end of eternity.
