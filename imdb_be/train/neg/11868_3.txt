At first glance, this movie got all crazy wants: vampire story with a "not under 18" limit, filled with hyper-violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatics fanatics and even gay necrophiliac cop! But then, this film is a sequence of bad stories (so fine), bad acting -c funny English accent makes you think that you look bad Monty Python -, bad music (80th hard rock), the video recording will be terrible , the ending is a real shame ... Plus sex scenes are funny, gore is not very impressive. And these vampires are reflected in a mirror, and not even afraid of the light of day! You get very disappointed if you do not see it as a Â«Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope that the bloodthirsty would one day get to the bottom of the 100, because it is his real place. <br /> <br /> I would say that it may still be interesting to see if you have enough friends and beer. <br /> <br /> 3/10
