Unentertaining, uninvolving hybrid "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it is not as good as any of the junk-minute classics. It is about acting sheriff, Artie (Taye Diggs) is called to investigate a near-fatal drug overdoses in the posh upper class Univesity, but keep it on the down low. If he digs deeper, he thinks that it is much more than it seems at first glance. We go to Alicia, a girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well. About 90 minutes later, when the film was met from the very beginning, it would wear it. This film does not bring absolutely nothing new to the table. But this is the only movie that still has Miss Swain topless so score higher only for this <br /> <br /> My rating: D. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain gets topless (fixing error «Happy Campers»); another girl topless <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy: more men than women ass tit
