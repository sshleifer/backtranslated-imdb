Nha see this movie. Bad action and blunt the effects of Gore. A waste of time. I expected to see a lot of interesting murder and hot chicks and not the director depends on the slaughter of animals video shock you, the observer. Disgusting. Murder pretty lame, mostly strangulation. One woman he fills worms in his mouth, he puts a raw burgers on her face and choking her. BTK BTK = chicken, Burger King in the "killer" new sandwich .... haha. I do not think this film relied too much on real facts. I mean, he was a real BTK killer did not carry a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms..and oh yeah ... killed a cow's head, too. Go figure it out.
