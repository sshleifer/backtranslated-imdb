Any film with «National Lampoon» in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die the death in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy, and somewhere in Germany.It can be an institution in the United States, but it is virtually unknown in Europe to a wider audience . "European Vacation" is unlikely to remedy this situation. Terrible Griswalds just - appalling.They not funny. It is clear that Mr. Chevy Chase thinks it's funny, because Miss B.di Angelo lots of laughs at his jokes, but she paid for it and do not need to fork out £ 2,50 for the privilege. Section is set in England typical.The same type of TV performers, the Idle gentlemen, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M.Lippman trot the same old same old tired clichés, Mr. Chase lost in the corridor of the hotel .... yawn, yawn, yawn .. sawing - ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated that we had never seen Bobby on bicycles, two-on-two ......... Rosy red cheeks in the Middle - Tei, whether you want to continue? English are clowns, wicked French - Tongued Yank-haters.The Germans are arrogant and haughty, (not to mention the war, Clark), and the Italians depraved bottom pinchers.Have I forget anything? A variety of "comic" The situation worked to death, Mr. Chase gurns desperately, Miss da Angelo sweet dimples, children strikingly bad. The fact that this franchise running as long as it was necessary to bring comfort to those who advocate that you will never lose money by underestimating the public taste.
