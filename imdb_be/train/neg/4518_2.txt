Few movies dashed expectations and frustrate me like fire. pretentious rubbish film. He did on the artistic level, not reach. The only thing he managed to get a ban in India. If it was due to the poor quality of film-making, and not the local controversy, the ban would be more justified <br /> <br. /> Now, when I got my affliction of my system, I am more able to analyze the movie: <br /> <br /> * from the beginning the film feels unreal, especially when the protagonists are beginning to communicate in English. The director, of course, does not make a movie for an Indian audience; However, he underestimated his international audience of more than simplifying it. Observing the nature of maids speaking in perfect English too unreal to be true. <br /> <br /> * Next we get regular glimpses into Radha's dream. These scenes are not very effective. They come up with how sharp and prevent the passage of the film. I still wonder how this philosophical dialogue is associated with the story. I felt that surrealism was lost. <br /> <br /> * The love scenes felt voyeuristic and probably meant to tickle the audience, rather than being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not reach either of the two. <br /> <br /> * The names chosen for women, Radha and Sita, the names of Hindu deities and thus were chosen to shock the audience. However, since the film was not intended for the Indian audience in the first place, the impact through the choice of the name is not intended to achieve its objective, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * direction quality is very poor, and some key scenes were felt badly treated. Best director could make a powerful emotional drama of the subject. <br /> <br /> * To act felt wooden although Nandita Das has brought life into the role, and the rest have been wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not visible in this film. Males wires were just rubbish. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Earth and would like to see more of the directors, to stay away from it. Please.
