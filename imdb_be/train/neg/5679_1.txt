I was so concerned about the actual shooting of the film in the beginning, I felt sick to my stomach, and ultimately closing off the film. How anyone can give this movie more than 1 rating excites me. I know that the purpose of the film is to shock, but shows actual footage of a dog who was flayed alive (holding back vomit as I type) - PLEASE! I closed it after the scene with the child decay. I had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point. It is not surprising that this film was not found in the bargain bin at HMV. I really have no desire to meet with any other film of Uwe person. Anyone who has used this therapy needs. Period.
