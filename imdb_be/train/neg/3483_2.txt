Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Katherine O »Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Mays, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Discharges with his girlfriend, desperate yuppies do not want to be left alone on Christmas, so he decides to return to boyhood home, imposing on a dysfunctional family that now lives there and bribe them to put in their family. Unpleasant and dimensional performance Affleck, who mainly works with a flashy smile that makes his character comes off as mentally unbalanced creep, but Gandolfini and O "Harry breathe life into this mess. Even for a farce, it is folly lumbering, not so much, it makes sense from scene to scene, and his sentimental messages are fake, as a smile Affleck. 91 min., Rated PG-13. * ½
