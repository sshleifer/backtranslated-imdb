How do you guys want to know a secret?. This movie sucks. Well actually I do not know, because if you allow yourself to soak up the plagiarized version of the original films, it is possible that you may find this mind-blowing film (this film to be plagiarized copy, I Know What You Did Last Summer). The first 30 minutes of the film is based on a typical situation of speech; a bunch of so-called cool teens savoring their holidays in Florida and be themselves, behaving much like teenagers they are. The only insight we have at the moment is the extent to which the director turned illustrating a pretentious teenager feeling of decadence in the characters. The second half hour of the film gets a little momentum and begins to illustrate the start of decompression, where a number of unprecedented murder. The third half-hour film will most definitely remain a mystery to me, because I turned it off before I could continue to fool ourselves into thinking that the film may still have something interesting and original is left to show. As for history, it can easily be explained in a few lines. A bunch of teenagers go to Florida on vacation. While they are busy with partying, they are slow (and I mean slowly) beginning to kill him, because they know that some stupid secret. The only thread of murder in the fact that all the victims were matriculates with general secondary school. One thing, however, strike me about this film was how much Betty (I'm not sure about it name..the blonde character) looks like Reese Witherspoon. Another thing that struck me about this film was that it made me jump up from their seats several times. This makes it a work of art? not because my 12-year-old niece to release me a glass of orange juice, because it «boo'ed» me when I was about to go through the guest room door..whats difference between the director and my 12-year-old niece ??? ? <br /> <br /> Do you want to know the secret ??? I'm not sure what you guys, but I do not ..
