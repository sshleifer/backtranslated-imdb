This is the biggest part of the Lamo I've ever watched. It is painfully sad, I'd rather sit through a seminar on creationism than watched it if I knew it would be just as boring as it was. Not even 40 seconds of a hot chick in a bikini with a big redeems the TAC is nothing lower than 1. <br /> <br /> The reviews of this film, who claim that the film "unintentionally funny" absurd and just plain wrong. Not one thing funny about this movie. They spend the first 50 minutes or so walking through the woods to talk about things you do not understand, does not care, and it is just as lame when people begin to die, because you do not even know who the people are, because they so uninteresting Honestly, though, I have not watched it to the finals, but I must say something about how awful it is. WORST MOVIE EVER. <br /> <br /> Right after throwing this shit out of my DVD-player, I started scraping it against the cement in front of my house, not wanting other blockbuster clients to fall on the same mistake I did to make this film. Then Zach peed in his pants. Thanks for your time.
