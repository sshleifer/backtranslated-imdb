This film had good intentions and a good story to work. Director and screenwriter of this film and created the dejection failed filmstrip that made me feel that I was in the eighth grade Social Studies class, Mr. Hartford - still 67. <br /> <br /> What is waste to be someone please, the story and make this film with him. - story deserves <br /> <br /> Every time the scene has the potential, we all remained were a few clich√©s, combined with black and white footage, which they are likely to receive from The History Channel, to show action . Shameful. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only shining light in this stupid Fest. Another effect was unbelievably boring - it fits well in the film, and whoever played the captain set a new low standard for the delivery of the line <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to take all the many flaws in it. a movie and is not associated with being awed or fun, but want to learn about the USS Mason, it's worth a look.
