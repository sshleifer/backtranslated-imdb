This film, for after school special, not so bad, and it is a problem. Nothing happens. You feel as if you are still in the classroom. Man teaching young bunch of losers, how to be good paint ball players. We will never see these outsiders doing bad as good a player trains them. They all suddenly turns into a good player for meditation. Also, there are too many characters and no character development. Too much time spent on the main character and his sexy sister is not enough for some of the other children. This could have a sense of 'bad news bears (the original), because there was a girl, all boy team, but there was no sense in this movie at all. It does not make any sense, and leaves a dull ache in the bones after viewing, not interested in the bag is not fun to watch, and it's just kind of ... there. Plain. Sad. That you look after your school to the previous night sleep. As sad as the day is long, and it was a long, long day to watch this movie.
