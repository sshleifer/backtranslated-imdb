Burt Reynolds came to the point in his career, when he seemed to be just going through the motions. He will appear, the party with his friends on the film, and take home a big paycheck. It did not seem to matter to him that the product, which he represented was pure crap. <br /> <br /> No film is not embodied it more than «STROKER Ace», which makes «Cannonball Run» looks like a classic and «Cannonball Run II» look watchable. Except for a few scenes of racing there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here. Even beautiful Loni Anderson hams it's as bad as a dumb blonde this is inconvenient. <br /> <br /> If the thought of Burt hamming it up with Jim Nabors and dress like a chicken sounds funny, then this is your movie. Otherwise choose almost any other comedy, and it will not be worse.
