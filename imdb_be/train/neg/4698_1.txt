I mean seriously, that the group would sing about crazy car? So, if there are ten, it is too unstable for a small child to sing about "being a woman" I mean seriously! The name pretty corny as naked brothers? only because they remove his pants ??? As CREATIVE.I do not understand why they need a TV show, I mean most of the artists do not really need the TV show itself, especially the naked brothers band. Heck, many of them are in the fucking band. And seriously, what with the movie? Jeez Nick used to be Hightlight of my growing years, but seriously naked brother band? SO many parents would not allow their children to watch it, especially with the name of the group of Naked brother, his stupid, uncreative shows that should not be broadcast on TV.
