Just Cause showcases Sean Connery, as a law professor at Harvard University, Kate Capshaw (it still has to get a job?) As his wife (a small difference in age) and Laurence Fishburne as the racist south of the police (!) And Ed Harris in a fully over the top performance of fundamentalist southern serial killer. <br /> <br /> Weird pronunciation, but the film plays a major mindf ** with the audience. (Do not read if you ever intend to seriously watch this movie, or ever watch this movie seriously because of the spoiler) First of all, I felt like rolling his eyes several times a liberal stereotypes: all cops sadistic and scope of this black guy without any evidence. The coroner, witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused to cooperate with him (he was accused of the rape and murder of a young girl), because he is black. <br /> <br /> Connery is a law professor at Harvard University, which provides a hot talk of injustices against blacks and against the barbaric death penalty. He approached the convicted person's grandmother, to protect it and re-open the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery obstruction (yawn ...) in the small town officials and GOOD il boys club, but believes that the case against Blair's alleged killer is now on death row, it was all fabricated. The main proof of its recognition, which knocked out of him. <br /> <br /> Beating introduced Copo black (!), who even played Russian roulette to get a confession out of him. Connery discovers that another prisoner on death row is actually killing and after a tete Tetes with serious replay, Hannibal Lecter, Ed Harris, he knew where Harris hid the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> it gets re-test and Blair released. <br /> <br /> I think a film ... More .... <br /> <br /> and suddenly! It turns out that Blair psychotic crazy and that he used the "white guilt" to attract Connery. He came up with the story of Ed Harris in exchange for Blair holding several murders for Harris. <br /> <br /> Now Blair is on the loose again, due to the insane principles PC Connery! Final 30 minutes. is a strange film sewn legal action drama Connery and Fishburne fighting a serial killer in crocodile skins houses on stilts (yes, you read correctly) in the Everglades. <br /> <br /> It was an amazing film. <br /> <br /> Thus, the whole system is corrupt and inefficient police all just intimidates and cats such as Abu Ghraib, but criminals are really crazy and deserve to fry. <br /> <br /> really depressing at every level! The system is completely rotten and PC white types of wine that are challenging it seriously wrong, too. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something.
