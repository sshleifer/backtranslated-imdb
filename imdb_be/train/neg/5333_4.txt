Carr farce creates a mess as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays Indian bull riding champion, which leaves the rodeo to stay at home on their own people, the spread of desert in Arizona, where government suits only to invest in the family herd of cattle (which is in dire need of a hairpin), which director Peter Tewksbury in dire need of it some narrative skills, but what it lacks in the assessment he is negligent in comedy installation (his social commentary is not precisely specified, but Tewksbury has a satirical bend to it outlandishness and there are some funny scenes). Despite the colorful supporting turns Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, general wackiness gets way out of hand, and there are too many hoopin 'and hollerin' to sustain much interest. As for Elvis, he freely and playfully everywhere - and while it's nice to see him having fun on the screen, one has to wonder if he just gave up a movie at the moment. This carnage has a clear picture of what hell-The-feel to it, and although the spirits are high, returns to the main low. * 1/2 ****
