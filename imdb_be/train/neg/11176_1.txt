I saw this film at the beginning of view, and I can not stress enough how bad I thought that this movie was. From the beginning, the audience moaning over the terrible southern accent Pacino. Poor Al looked very, very emaciated, and I can not decide whether it was on purpose of their role addict journalist, or maybe he just could not get to sleep before coming to the set. Much worse than to close the window Pacino, however, is a parody on the story. At the beginning of the film we gave indication that Pacino's character is gay, and I suspect that this is what the writer originally intended. In the future, however, we must suspend our disbelief and believe and Tea Leone and Kim Basinger (both of which are sleepwalking through the lame role) the lust of the elderly, the half-dead looking, effeminate man with a ridiculous accent. Worst of all was generally the main plot thread that had to do with some corporate espionage, which is never fully explained, and we will never, never indifferent anymore. Because it was a preliminary, I reserve my final decision, because of the possibility of re-shoots and editing, but you can bet that I will not pay a dime to see it in theaters.
