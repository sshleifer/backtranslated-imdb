Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. He usually gives a solid performance, for example, in The Straight Story, and Gray Fox. In addition, it makes a pretty good here, but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget, bad writing, and so-so photos. Formula Miller film gives it a 4. Richard gets 5.
