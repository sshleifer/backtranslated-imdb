I was amused and disgusted with people who say that this film is so accurate about Vietnam, and had never been there. This film is about how the right in respect of the entire Vietnam War, as the beating of Rodney King the truth of all police officers. Yes, bad things do (and did) have taken place, but in general the people there just like you and me. They have morals, they do not kill the car, not all of them are doing drugs. The atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, and not the rule. They were much less than "cheating" will lead you to believe. Oliver Stone knack for making movies that show the war in Vietnam, as cruel bloodshed, but based on how many actually like Star Wars. Honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and find out the truth. Fact: The Viet Cong and NVA did much worse things than any South Vietnamese soldiers in the US armed forces have ever made. Fact: soldiers during the Second World War belonged to the enemy much worse than the average soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were welcomed when they came home. Fine Americans who have served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; although the war was poorly fought from a political point of view, one could not ask for more from our soldiers, and it's a big bear to say that this kind of "substantially" true literature is the way things really were there.
