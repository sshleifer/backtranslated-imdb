The only reason I give it a 2, which is so stylized filmography these days, so it has at least something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This film is asinine. This and many other twenty-first century Grindhouse feed. Gore is a gratuitous and just disgusting. I did not care about any of the characters, but I do not care what some nerd worked pen this shit: I would complain about the money I spent, but my date, and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to the adjacent theater watching adventurous and entertaining «Live Free or Die Hard», which is likely to get a much higher rating from me just because I've been through a full feed from the "captivity" for 40 minutes.
