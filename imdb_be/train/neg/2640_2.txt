Trying to imagine something as insipid as the guards will be difficult. There are many problems. Result how and loaded plot holes. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who "took a" Reagan during an assassination attempt on his life. Many years later we find Pete Whitehouse is a family, mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, LA Confidential). Troubles arise, as we can see closely involved with Pete's first lady, and the sudden threat against the president (David Rasche, compound 93). If Pete fails the polygraph test, he singled out like an angry agent investigator David Brekinrizhem (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). <br /> <br /> As the story unfolds the president's murder, Pete finds himself on the run from his own people. His only confidant is the first lady, and she was reluctant to tell anyone about their passions for each other (which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place). But Pete really innocent? Or is he just trying to buy time until he can not kill the president? If he is innocent, it can help prevent an attack while working with the Secret Service? <br /> <br /> one, big, overwhelming problem with this film is that there is no reason for the cause of the threat of the head of state. Is not that something that should the film to be about? One would think so! But the public never miss why the killer (s) want to kill Prez. Hmm. Someone is sure to put that in the script somewhere? <br /> <br /> And with a new partner in BREKINRIZH David (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? It seems that she was placed in the film strictly as a piece of $$ - candy. What is its purpose again? Is it anything other than how to look good in tight pants and low-cut blouses? <br /> <br /> There are so many problems with the basic premise of hours to be laughable. Action too easily driven into the "What the ...?" The answers have to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie.
