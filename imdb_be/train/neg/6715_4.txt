I went to the theater, going to pass a pleasant 90 minutes entertaining if not enlightening. I left no fun, nor enlightened. This movie can not make up his mind, he wants to be, and ends up being not much of anything. There are a few funny lines and some links are incredibly pretentious film (The 400 Blows - to throw this character!). While none of the characters does not get treated with more respect, more than thirty homosexuals are the worst: all ravenous, fat, sad, slobs. If you are in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships check Farewell looks close friend, Trick, around Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead. You'll thank me. <br /> <br />
