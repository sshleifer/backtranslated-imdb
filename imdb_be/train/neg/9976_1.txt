The first scene in "Heavy child" is a child urinate into the face veil. For this movie, it's clever. Reverse, mean "comedy", the inept on many levels, it is believed. John Ritter is his native father who takes the child from hell, and glory to him for his dignity in the Environment pressing a single note, irritating speech and child humor. And what the hell, Jack Ward to do in this mess? Relaxed director Dennis Dugan and unpleasant in their attempts to turn to sentimentality when it is done with the rudeness, the film is made so hard that it's quite a strange experience. But against all this. LowLight all this is Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and obnoxious guy actor ever to hit the screen ?? Believe me, you'll want to hit him right in the mouth.
