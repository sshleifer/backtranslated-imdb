Honestly, I knew what to expect before I watched this movie, and I must say that this is the worst acting I have ever seen. It has its moments, but in comedy at its very interesting, but I'm afraid it's not terrible, but stupidity is taken to a new level. There's a lot of unnecessary gore, and the plot is everywhere. I have no idea why the aliens were evil, and why they even came to this remote part of the column (I mean, who would go there anyway?), But I do not care at that moment, because I was excited from the costumes and bad CGI. As far as B-movies go, it deserves the title of "be so bad its good", and kudos to the filmmakers, because they probably know what they are doing. Long may these films continue .....
