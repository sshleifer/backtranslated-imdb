This one is just like the 6th film. The film is really bad. He did not offer anything in the Department of death. The one-liners bad and what should not be in the film NoEs. Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole film. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth it. Symbols are very weak. All in all better than 6-one, but still one the worst films of the series. My rating 2/10
