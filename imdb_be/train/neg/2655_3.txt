** 1/2 for this Diane Keaton slapstick. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Ms. Keaton, enough with your philosophy and hats Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> This film is simply too much like Keaton's daughter Sarah died in a traffic accident, while her boyfriend survives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who can not be reached by telephone in the first, as it was in the bag with her boyfriend and he took out Jack, mourns anew for the mourners. <br /> <br /> She retreats to the summer area where all members Sarah stopped. She cleans the house, sleeping for two days and then begins to uncover things that were better not revealed. It turns out that sweet Sarah slept with his girlfriend and the guy who eventually married at last. In addition, she had an abortion, because of this guy. We are all put on this guilt trip. <br /> <br /> Her only hope is to find the elusive diary that Sarah kept. She also hopes that the man, Adam, who is a playwright, will not include all of it in the other game. <br /> <br /> If the diary is found, it was written in Japanese. Sarah was a Ph.D in this language. This is not something that is good news for moms, when an excerpt from the diary in Japanese chef in a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Of course, everyone seems to relate beautifully in the end. <br /> <br /> In the name of this shmaltz comes from the Wizard of Oz. Every time my mother and Sarah would say they would like a complete Surrender Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if that is not enough for this wonderful extravaganza mourning, Keaton tells Adam not to be another Woody Allen in his film, interiors, where he tried to successfully emulate the Ingmar Bergman. Ms. Keaton also trying drugs with the group. Come on, guys, can we really believe that someone could sane grieve like this? <br /> <br /> Fair mediocre best sums up this movie.
