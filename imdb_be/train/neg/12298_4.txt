"Witchcraft" might just be the most inconsistent and pitiful horror movie script '80s, but, fortunately, it has some redeeming qualities, such as the fantastic effects gore, disturbing musical score and some terrific casting choice. To tell the script does not do one iota of meaning, but who cares when Linda Blair (with exploding hairstyle) reflects another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof reflects the hunky photographer (who can not seem to get laid) in a film that constantly has a bloody bait, Shut lips attached upside down crucifixion, vicious burning and excessive, but really terrible song. Eight random people gathered at an abandoned holiday resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. Young couple have to explore the local history of the dark; unhappy family (with a pregnant Linda Blair, even if no one seems to bother about who is the father, and that his whereabouts) considers opening the hotel again and delicious woman architect just got engaged for casual sex. They are forced to stay overnight in the old hotel, and then suddenly the previous hostess ?? old actress or something, who always dresses in black ?? It begins taking them in various exciting ways. All have something to do with the intro sequence shows a woman accused of witchcraft jump out of the window. In any case, the story is certainly of secondary importance in the Italian horror franchise, which began as an unofficial spin-off «The Evil Dead». The atmosphere is sometimes disturbing and makeup effects are undoubtedly the most beautiful element of the film. There's something highly painful and anxious about looking at a defenseless woman hanging down the chimney and waiting to get fried.
