Diana Guzman angry young woman. Ruthless survivor of all the disappointments and injuries, she takes her anger on the next order. <br /> <br /> If she sees violence transformed the discipline and focus in a rundown boxing clubs, she knows that she has found her home. <br /> <br /> The film progresses from there, Diana learns normal puberty lessons together with the skills necessary for a successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the roles, especially when moving the focused rage of a young woman, squeezed from all sides and fight against not only their personal circumstances, but deep-rooted sexism. <br /> <br /> The picture may use some of the subtleties in his direction all the young actors who paled in comparison with older, more experienced actors. There are too many pauses in the script, which detract from the dramatic tension. The total silence of the film exhausts its intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of fully realized young woman, femininity is quite difficult to turn its power. His limitations prevent it from room to "see it again and again" category.
