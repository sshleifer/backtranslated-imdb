Knights were only the beginning of the series, the pilot, you might say. Story (I do not actually call it that, there was no plot) is not logical at all, and there were a lot of mistakes, as a [warning, I plot summing]: <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the movie someone said that there only a few of these cyborgs (the bad guys), but after menopause, Neo found out that there were many many more left of them. And it was said that the cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month of training, Neo can kill them with one blow. <br /> <br /> The film was only clean feet. . I was not surprised when I learned that the guest star was kickboxer <br /> <br /> There was a positive moment in the whole film, he really gave a lot of laughter, watching it and talking about it with their friends. I recommend watching it if you need a laugh.
