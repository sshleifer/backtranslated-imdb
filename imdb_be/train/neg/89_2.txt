I've seen all four of the films in this series. Each one of them strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book, he called after anyway! Directors and producers have to call it any thing but Â«Abiding Joy Love." The only thing about the film, which is vaguely reminiscent of a book the names of some characters (Willie, Miss Henry Clark, Scotty and Cookie). Names / age / gender of the children's rights. The whole storyline is not somewhere in the book. <br /> <br /> I think it's a lot of damage Janette Oke, her books and her supporters to produce the film under her name, which is not correct in any case. Music too loud. The actors are not convincing - they do not have emotions <br /> <br /> If you want a good family film, it can do .. He is pure. Do not look, though, if you're hoping for an abridged version of the book. I hope that this will be the last film of the series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies are made, I want Michael Landon, Jr. and others will stick to the original plot and subplots. Book well, and if followed closely, will make an excellent movie!
