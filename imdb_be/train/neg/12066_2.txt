Well that is left for this average original-rich old codger leaves his estate to his adult children, all of them ungrateful lost, and two terrible employees, provided that they spend a week in his awful old house. What happens to surprise only those who have not seen the movie or TV show earlier in the evening. After a series of murders in which the victims look like they are bleeding restaurant ketchup, we painfully obvious twist ending. Gypsum bring some once respected actors were desperate their earnings. There are also several other tier actors who grow up in a while, but long forgotten now. As a result, the film creates all the drama and mystery of the episode "Matlock." I'll give credit where it's due- closing scene smart and cheerful, even if you do not sleep.
