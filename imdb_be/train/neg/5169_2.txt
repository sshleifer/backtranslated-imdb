NOTE :. I encourage everyone who has not seen the film yet to read this comment <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen them all, Hamilton is sure lowsy rescued one of the entertainment that he did not amuse me at all !!!! I thought that, in general, with a floor-poor acting silly plot diagram, and turn at the end of the film, which was very backward, this movie sucked !!! Okay, so supposively that people who eat other people.Yeah ...... note, I said that people are not the people, not because they are not human, or to wait, I think they are, OH NO WAIT, they do not tell you !!!! ! So that's all right, these people are cannibals or they imbreds, or that they are !!!! I mean, maybe they are just "things" that have come here to see what people on the taste or they are cannibals who eat people for a long time now, or maybe, this film was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! that was !!! so if you think that the Hamiltons well, I ask you, why, why, why, why, why it was so surprising, because it was just flat out awful for me !!! One big BOOOOOOO for Hamiltons !!! go see Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail, Borderland or for a piece of fun !!!!!
