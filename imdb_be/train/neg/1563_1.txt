I saw this movie at Sundance in 2005 i was amazed at how bad it was, but based on the description of the catalog, I was excited to see it. Presumably the "mockumentary" two high school students make a documentary about high school life, he showed bad actions, bad directing, fully engages the absence of characters, as written, and all around is a total bust. I love good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and shamefully "cool", although they should be marginalized. You get the general impression of a group of people sitting around components in a specially-bad film, to show your friends, but somehow he got into Sundance. Mysterious.
