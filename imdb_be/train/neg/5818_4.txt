--- what happened to these people unsympathetic. Alan Arkin was, as usual, unfunny and simply passes through the role. Children are a mess. Mariesa Tomei probably wanted this role will never come her way. And Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno in doing this is very bad, then the film? If you enjoy watching lost to wallow in their dysfunction, rather than trying in any way to make things better, this is your movie. All the rest, take a walk, read a book, or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
