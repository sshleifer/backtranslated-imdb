When I saw that users IMDb rating of the film bottom 250 films, I thought it was too harsh, but I do not know that the low rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Wayans brothers, I loved them Scary Movie 2, and even enjoy White Chicks. Little man, however, was very little laughter and jokes were stale. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the joke will revolve around Wayans, who plays the adult dwarf, who was recently released from prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, to steal a diamond, designed for a gangster. Things go awry, and dwarf must put the diamond with unsuspecting pair plays Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, dwarf pretending abandoned child, left on unsuspecting threshold pairs. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins searching for diamonds. <br /> <br /> In the film there are several actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live, Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as from In Living Color. All these talents, however, can not help the poor script and jokes that just was not funny. <br /> <br /> special effects do look like a dwarf Wayans was OK. I mean, it's not 100% true, but it was not good ... nothing special. I just want to Wayans brothers have to make more efforts to develop the script with good jokes, rather than trying to strengthen their bad script with a cameo of his famous comedy actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> Look for it on cable or satellite. It is not really worth a certain amount of money.
