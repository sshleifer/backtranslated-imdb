This is a bad film B, disguised as a mockumentary. Porn documentary filmmaker in the movie is almost as much time on the screen and dialogue, as well as any other character. This completely destroyed any "documentary feel" that they may have wanted to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film does not really mockumentary is the least is the problem. The film is not funny. The film is not sexy. The movie has nothing insightful to say about the pornography business. It's not even particularly obscene. While there are simulated sex, nudity number of mild to nominal film R. <br /> <br /> Someday, someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry. This is not so.
