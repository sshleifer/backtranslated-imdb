The only good thing about the "People I Know" that it serves as an excellent example of the movie, Al Pacino should avoid performing the first big barrier, I was the way in which Pacino tried to portray Georgia accent. sometimes he was a weak and unattractive, as in other segments, it seemed too exaggerated. dialogue and interaction character was terrible along with a weak plot. supporting cast did an extremely sloppy job in accordance movie interesting, and within an hour I still have not seen any signs of a strong plot. History as a whole is a real downer, and I had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake. <br /> <br /> This film certainly bore you, and ... avoid at all costs.
