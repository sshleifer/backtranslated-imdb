This is a film where the actors are all good, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in the film, where each of the three pairs are found in a situation that feels verrrrry forced to be nice or to set the story in motion. In other words, it feels like they contrived scenes of the movie, not in real life. Even if the women who work in salons Pip ever go out with one of his clients, he just does not seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film. In addition, if one of the characters found in overweight women in the film, it feels artificial, as they look at each other seconds after arguing. Again, the actors are all good, and the moments of the film are good, but overall another indie that could use some re-writing to the production got rolling.
