First of all, let me say that this is not a film for those who want to see something energetic and happy for the holidays. This film is a cold, hard, and only very depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays grinchy mother, who down at Christmas, because her husband lost his job, they lose their home, can not buy Christmas gifts for children, etc. You get the idea, a happy thing for the holidays. So along comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon's Christmas Angel, which is a dark hat and long coat comes off a pedophile who hangs around children all day watching them. What better way to instill the Christmas spirit in Mary Steenburgen, they kill my family, and then offer to return them when she again believe in Christmas. Santa Claus and his blackmailer Christmas shop looks like a safe haven for refugees of the Nazis on the run. The film puts all on so thick that you do not care about the happy end, when it comes, because the rest of the film is so incredibly bitter. I am sure that this film wanted to be something Capra-how, but he left the joy and feeling that the holiday should be a movie.
