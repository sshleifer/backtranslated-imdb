Well, first off I would like to add that I did a few of the historian, so I'm looking for a movie that is based on historical events, that it is actually based on historical facts. But it is, however, not the case. Of course, the film is interesting and all, but the fact that he was not entirely based on facts more than annoying. Hitler was not an anti-Semite in his youth he even worked for the Jews before World War One. It was, however, during World War II alone, and after that he formed his opinion about the Jews. His upbringing in this film as a fuzzy, Hitler as a child was not troubled little brother. He was more or less normal upbringing. Nothing is said about his lost brothers and other important parts, which adds to the mystery of who Hitler. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle a great actor, but he's not very good in the role of Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as it portrait ed here. Under his younger years he was a charismatic man who "manipulates" people through their charms. His erratic behavior and furious outbreak began at the turn of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film about Hitler's life, which is based on real historical facts, not allegations. I really hate it when people point to the accusing finger, for example, Hitler and others and tell false stories just draw a picture of them as pure evil. It is much better, in fact, to tell the story as it was so that everyone can know what it is! Those behind the film would have to do some research before you make it. Because it seems as if they do not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even filmed in the revolutionary march in Munch, his shoulder was wrenched from its socket. <br /> <br /> This gives you more to see a good documentary, than to see it.
