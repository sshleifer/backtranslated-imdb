Poor Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali to bring it down. <br /> <br /> The torture is the worst. Definitely a one trick pony, I think they could get another American chef to come to the table at this as Iron Chefs. Type of meals the duo to come up with really ... do not reflect on the work of the original Iron Chef Series. I do not think that Batali even went to school cook, actually. There are many good chefs in America, I just wonder why they are not on the Food Network. <br /> <br /> It also helps to have a more regional ingredients and, possibly, with hosts who can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he's a little too frivolous / comical for this role.
