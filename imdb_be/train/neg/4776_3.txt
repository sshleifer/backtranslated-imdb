I had to write a review of this film after reading another comment that this is the best film in the Sidney Poitier. Poitiers just returned from more than a decade of hiatus in the movie and he obviously acts squeaky here. 11 of his films mentioned in Wikipedia, and they did not include it. 5 of his films in the AFI list of the top 100 inspirational films, again, not including it. Beranger and Poitiers, redneck city slicker and went to track down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border to Canada. Some of the attempts at comedy in the film is clearly not in the state and Beranger and Pottier in bonding was cringeworthy and uncomfortable (not entirely helped mild scenario). Kirstie Alley (as a hostage) was insufficient, and almost completely ignored when it was on the screen. Several attempts made by unknown, for example, if you are assigned to try to guess which of the 5 men on a fishing trip is a killer (all types of alloy villains). I understand that it is the whole appeal to the majority of fans out there. I guessed who it was, and I was not really struggling. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Berenger, see Sniper (1993), you might even get to see Billy Zane strutting his stuff. It's much better. In general, I would give 3/10 to shoot to kill. It is not daring, and it is too easy for me.
