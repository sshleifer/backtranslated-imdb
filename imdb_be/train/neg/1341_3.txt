After the success in the (awful) Island reruns of Gilligan TV movie, was made a number of television films in the 1980s, the reunification of throws of the classic show. Most of these films are released quite as capture of humor that made the show so special. Bunch myunstrov REVENGE is one of the most frustrating, because it goes to the comedy style of Laurel and Hardy type, which actually was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a great comedian and importance to this series, completely lost - it is less time here in 90 minutes of the film than it is in any one 30 minute episode. And as the role of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film is nothing more than a cameo, what's the point to make them younger and tinkering with them? With very little rewriting, they could use Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. While seeing some of Munsters horrible relatives were nice touch, I did not enjoy Sid Caesar as unnatural mad scientist, mainly because too much of it and not enough with the underloaded Munsters (ironically the same year, 1981, a long-time partner in comedy Caesar, Imogene Coco, also inappropriately cast for the most part in the TV movie reunion RETURNS Beverly Hills). Other strange inexplicable little early in the film, is Munster family is presented in the form of a wax at a local wax museum of horrors. Why they were there when they need to be "typical" (if odd) American family, unknown monsters? It was the last Munsters project the image of the original cast in their roles, there was a terrible resurgence of the series in the late 1980s with a completely new cast and a TV movie of the 1990s, which showed DeCarlo, Lewis, the priest, and Patrick as a cameo as a family dining room.
