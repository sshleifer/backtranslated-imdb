Backwoods cannibal killer on the prowl, and two pairs of squabbling could be his next source of protein in the discounted Friday 13 clone cheap. There's nothing interesting to see S literally, in this case, murder is surprisingly scant, and when they do occur, very amateurish. It also adds a ghost in the mixture for no reason what so ever. I felt drained after looking as though my brain liquefaction and drying my nose. And there is no doubt the worst film of Donald Jones. If you are thinking about renting it for a chic new DVD re-release Code reds do not bother <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
