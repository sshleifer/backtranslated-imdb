(John Cusack) is a mission Killer Hauser whack minister of oil of the Middle East, whose name happens Omar Sharif (a certain), the country Turaqistan, which is run by American interests. Hauser is how Trade Show producer, to enable him to get to Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the satire can be so overdone it becomes the most annoying. Here he makes too much: government, politics, music, war, people are usually not accepted by society, and did I mention the "war". And this is what we have here - the most annoying movie, which is bordered by a very bad nightmare realized. I still ask myself why I went from DVD. In addition, there are so many families in this Cusak that Cusack is puzzled by the family just to be there, or is it just me? <br /> <br /> It was previously thought that the film Cusack, while a little unusual was, after all, pretty good. Not here. He believes that Cusack had a hand in writing and producing this disorder. Mark you. <br /> <br /> There's too much going on in the movie, accompanied by constant gunfire, explosions and screaming that you really can not focus, or is that the point? Maybe. It would take too long to establish a strike that is not largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. At the same time we have a meaningless banter among everyone in the cast. And the chemistry between Cusack and Maurice Tormei? I do not think so, but you know a boy ?? girl thing ???? and they need something to take longer. <br /> <br /> So, for what they should have been, (unusual and annoying) performance Duff and Kingsley were good. But when I saw the character of Dan Aykroyd, in the very beginning of the show, sitting on the toilet with a dump, I knew that the rest of the show will go into the tank as well. I was not mistaken. I'm sure some of them will sing the praises of these efforts, but if the rose is still a rose by any other name, so too a mess ?????????? <br /> <br /> Now I remember why I went from DVD. I was hoping that this story somehow neutralize and preserve itself. Never <br /> <br /> violence. Yes. Gender: No Nudity: No Language: Yes.
