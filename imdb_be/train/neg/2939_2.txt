As others have said, "No, LucianoÂ» is a more appropriate name or the answer to the name of the film. For entertainment, a great opera singer should follow the singing ..... is not that he is a terrible actor. It's just that this film stink <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were in order -. a good family film, as it was -. but after that there is nothing but a sad soap opera <br /> <br /> have to play the singer, Pavarotti as "Giorgio Fini" loses his voice several times, and the doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) comes in. The singer then falls on the le car, the doctor slowly falls to the singer, the two argue constantly and on and on and on it goes. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a winning smile and a nice guy. It Harrold that spoil things, and after watching it here I'm not surprised that it did not become a star. <br /> <br /> There is a good view to the cinema to enjoy good pictures of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I got bored and I do not remember about the second half of this.
