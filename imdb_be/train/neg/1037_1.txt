That this is a poor excuse for amateur hour showcase was announced at Sundance it is the perfect example of what happens with most indie filmmakers these days. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is such a thing as the art of cinema, just raise your 16mm camera and showing it to someone is a line does not make for a real movie. <br /> <br /> I think that we should consider ourselves lucky, the director does not take someone's camera ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, indie films should be about real people. There's nothing real in this film. None of the characters did not come across as an even remotely human. <br /> <br /> The fact that they come across as being figments of the imagination of the writer, who is trying to impress your friends by showing them as "cool and annoying," he said. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, but it is not good to write, or good directing. <br /> <br /> what's left is the stuff of bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance. Hard to believe that this is one of the best films presented ... <br /> <br /> In any case, it made me lose what's left of my respect for the Sundance brand.
