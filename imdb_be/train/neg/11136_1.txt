This is only the second time I've felt compelled enough to comment on IMDB about the movie. The first time in perhaps the best movie I've ever seen, and it was for Memento. <br /> <br /> Seeing DarkWolf is at the other end as compared to the Memento of the scale, and in the worst movie I have had the misfortune to see. Apart from the two scenes containing nude woman there is nothing in this film, to raise him up from the trash heap, it is. <br /> <br /> Let's see, apalling effects template scenario, a bad game, and about 90 minutes too long. My wife and I laughed through most of them are at a loss as bad. Strangely, I watched it till the end, as I did, I do not know! AVOID !!!
