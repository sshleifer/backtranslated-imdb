... so I thought I would throw in a few words about William McNamara. Not a bad way to spend a few hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities - it is obvious that he pumped up for this role, and it looks damn good in them - or less. There's an extended sequence in the cave where he had to strip down to his immortal. There's a good bit, where he chasing Ms. Eleniak naked, only his hands folded over his groin. William McNamara, of course, a bit on the thin side, but he has a good, generous handful of production. In addition, there is a moment, when he gets out of bed, that if the suspension of the right moment, you can see the whole enchilada. If you are inclined to do so, and let half of the people who prefer to watch the film about marine men on a "road trip" there. I would like to thank Dennis Hopper for equal opportunities for gratuitous nudity. Can William McNamara act? Heck, if I know.
