I watched an episode. Yes, I sat through the whole miserable experience and I must say that this brand of comedy is one of the worst you'll get. Imagine Peter Griffin from Family Guy fame. Now imagine how Peter Griffin (though subtle and less points), women, except for the fact that it currently lacks something that made him fun. Peter Griffin idiot, but he does not know that he's an idiot. Sarah does not have any real character, none of the acting ability to pull off her character. Maybe it banal, formulaic jokes that pull her comedy is even lower than her character can take it yourself. Maybe it's the lack of plausible foil. It is insensitive, intolerant person may apply to the insensitive, fanatical people, as opposed to the mass appeal that is insensitive, intolerant character Stephen Colbert is. Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, serious character. It lacks something that is necessary for the satire of the genre, not to mention the world of comedy. That Sarah Silverman is not enough, it significantly. And if you do not believe it and identify with it, it's not funny.
