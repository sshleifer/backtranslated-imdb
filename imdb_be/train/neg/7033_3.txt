Black candles rather tangled mess from the same director who brought us the "Vampire" and much later, "Rest in pieces", among others..I'm mention only the ones I've seen. Anyway, we have a couple making love, and then somewhere near the pin on a balanced bait dolls, then pierces it, and the person keels over. Not sure if it was good enough for any of them at this point. Fast forward to where the man's sister came to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and, of course, everyone else except her in something that happens to devil worship. It is very difficult to tell who is who in the moments during the film, and it does get a bit confusing at times. To spice things up, though, there is simulated bestiality scene (I hope that is modeled) with the black goat is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Ugh. Sometimes it is the echo of "Rosemary's Baby", minus the baby, because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place stinks, regardless of unpleasant Satanic herbs that too, because it continues to get noticed on. However, the grass is not the only thing that smacks of this film. End seems to be back to the beginning again, and many viewers might find yourself wondering where they were during the middle part. It is not unwatchable, it's just not very good, and I think it all depends on what you like to see in the movies, and there was not so much that there was something a lot to me. 3 of 10.
