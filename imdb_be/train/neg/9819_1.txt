I read another comment about this film, and, as a rule, I try not to be harsh in my criticism, because I try to be a good person. However, this film is one of the worst films I have ever seen (and that is a lot of bad topping USA Network plus Cinemax night.) Who would have thought about this film should be prevented EVER make another one. This film disgusts me in such a way that no other film ever. I really think that these people are mad. Just save the time i did not look this fllm. Please - I want to, so I did. Actions terrible story (a story) is stupid and degrading and crazy. I really do not think it should be made into a film. But this is my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from having to spend their time.
