There are many good things about the new BSG: There's a few roles Cylon model 8 and 6, for example, that both actresses played beautifully. There's an old school feel industrial design aboard Galactica ( Â«My ship is not a network, over my dead body!") In addition, all the cosmic battle, special effects (even though the seasoned sci-fi watching will recognize cartoonishness with all is) dark characters, their essence character flaws. <br /> <br /> This makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish. <br /> <br /> so, the first part of the scene in space, a raid on the Cylons, and everything was very good. But soft end? I always watch movies and shows these days with a timer hidden, so I do not know how much time is left until the end. So for me it was a special kind of torture to see an end to happen again and again. Every time I thought about it the final scene, the last shot, I got another one. Each character got frakking your full ending! It was not really need <br /> <br /> What is really stressed schoolboy amateurishness of it :. Young Roslyn scene. Why it is important for us to know that: {a} She lost her sister and father in a terrible accident and {b}, that she has a one night with a former pupil / student? What does this bring to the story? Where is the connection? Now, I'm all for more European style could approach, and random acts whateverness in movies and shows, and all that, but this was ridiculous. This is nothing significant in the history not bring <br /> <br /> In addition, I saw "The Last Frakkin special" and in it, Ron opened his own clueless about the story :. He could not come up with a good ending for the story, so .... it just is not done! It's never so much about the characters, as they did the last episode to be. All "it was a thousand years in the past," the idea, the mitochondrial Eve thing was also used in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and believe me, there are plenty of BSG observers who know that a particular plot h2g2. And speaking of Hera, now has a storyline that did not work well at all. Instead, we get Roslin make it a former student who is 20 years younger. Do not get me wrong, I'm all for older women with younger men. More power to them. But this is ... just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> In general, (who writes in) this series is the same disadvantages as they intended it to be characters. This applies to an even greater extent, in the last episode. I hope, loss and top 24, with their finals series.
