This film was two and a quarter hours of painful. Someone please tell me what it was? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical setting. It should be about a ragtag group of Federal Bushwhackers (terrorists?) On the border of Missouri-Kansas, revenge against all of northern abolitionists and sympathizers during the Civil War in the United States. But aside from the gratuitous violence there was not much point in this film. Maybe it was a political statement? This war is really nothing more than gratuitous violence? If this point has been done very well, but I do not think that is the point. I think that the producers really thought that they were doing worthwhile film here, but as far as I was concerned was the complete lack of any plot. It seemed as if I was watching a paperback novel comes to life with the characters look like what you see on the covers of novels. <br /> <br /> This film should be burned along with some of the towns this gang set fire!
