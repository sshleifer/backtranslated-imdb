Although I do not agree with one reviewer who described Charley Chase, how unfunny, he, of course, there is in this movie. It's a shame, as I suspect that another reviewer should only be seen a few duds Charley Chase and suggested that the guy is not funny. Films like MIGHTY LIKE moose and what price Goy? very good chase movies, so that he can be very funny given the good stuff. Unfortunately, in this film, he did not give anything at all. Even the inclusion of generally good Oliver Hardy as the foil is not any help as the basic premise (boy wants to marry the girl, but the girl's father thinks the boy is a wimp) and fun so poor. It's a shame as I really wanted to like this movie, but could not. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those who are used to looking for Charlie since the mid-1920s, you will be quite surprised and Chase sports without glasses or a mustache - and looks very small, as you would expect.
