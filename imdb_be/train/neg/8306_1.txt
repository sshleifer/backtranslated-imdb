ET obsession with Dannielynn Smith despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention, it is likely to rise to psychosis, depression or worse. Think of Princess Diana, and she longed for privacy. Now, poor little rich girl Olsen just wants to be left alone. Not surprisingly, the Greta Garbo became a hermit and said: "I want to be alone." ET How to escape this little girl? Lot ET nothing better to report? I bet there are a lot of people who really do not care what the color of her birthday cake and balloons were. By the way, I have never heard that Anna Nicole never won any of these court cases over the will and inheritance. Who pays for the way of life of Larry, Howard and little Dannielynn? Maybe, ET?
