Aah, this film had so much potential! A good cast of actors as B, hip and Jessica Simpson ... that about it! <br /> <br /> I believe that some guy in some unnamed marketing department was the idea. In principle, it allows you to view the movie Legally Blonde, but do it in New York. This is a great chance of a vibrant city, power and money, and where all the heartless, power / money hungry man. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, a small town prostitute, his brother Owen Wilson, and some no apparent reason, Andy Dick (only because of him you should ignore this film) <br /> <br /> The storyline :. <, Br /> <br /> boy leaves girl for New York City girl stands, Chita boy, the girl remains in New York with my cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, muck up as courting another boy (Wilson's brother) and save the day together and kiss. <br /> <br /> a few words come to mind when reflecting on this film, that is sad, terrible, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, you will be happy. One reviewer called Guantanamo, and I certainly agree with him. This film is a shock. And I know what you think ... at least at some point, I see Simpson naked or close too. It will not happen, save yourself time and YouTube it. ! You will have a better time of sexual <br /> <br /> Movies editing contrived acting intolerable, and why they use blue screens <br /> <br /> In conclusion; This cinematic betrayal that must be punished to the maximum <br /> <br /> Another question is why Willie Nelson always plays a kind of father in almost all Jessica Simpson Flick and why is there no black, Latin, Asian or European people this film?
