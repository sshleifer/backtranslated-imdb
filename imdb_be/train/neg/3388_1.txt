I admit that I was a fan of the original stage production. I've never seen the film version until recently on the cable, and looked forward to it, to see my memories brought revived, because I loved the original shows. Imagine my disappointment. <br /> <br /> This has to be the worst translation of a Broadway show movie ever made. They changed the story, they changed their song, they lost heart. I expected the trip down memory lane, singing extraordinarily touching music and a mirror in a ballet and Hello Twelve Hello Thirteen. Nya! Not only do they falsify the music to the point of almost unrecognizable, but they messed up the story, adding the songs and the external plot (Cassie greetings and Michael Douglas), who do not have the original, and the introduction of "drama", which was not a necessity. The original was sufficient on its own pathos. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, do not worry. I'm sorry I wasted my time, and divorce my memories, I watch this tripe.
