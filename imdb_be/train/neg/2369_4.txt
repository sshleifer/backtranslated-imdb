It works best as a dark, chilling black comedy, to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been deprived of all its ability to cool the audience. (Too many jokes, that's for sure.) The actors are not interesting (except Englund, as always, and, obviously, the slums Jafet Kotto) and there are just too many visual effects. Final in order, but does not provide as many sparks as I think I could have hoped for. <br /> <br /> In addition, a new twist in the history of the familiar dream killer, he Englund provides an opportunity to do more non-makeup scene than ever before <br /> <br /> have cameos note :. joint cameo Ryazanov and then a couple of Tom Arnold, which is devoid of entertainment value, corresponding to the appearance of the veteran shock-rocker Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp funny cameo, which also recognizes the kind of pop icon he has become. <br /> <br /> The film debut of Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things is the replay key scenes of the early records during the end credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
