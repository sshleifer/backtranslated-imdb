I love the stories of Jane Austen. I just read two of them (P & P and S & S), but after seeing this fit, I reached for "Persuasion" from my bookcase just to understand this story as well, because I refuse to believe Jane Austin could write such nonsense. For me, I thought that if you base a movie on the novel by Jane Austen, you can not go wrong. This happens quite a lot of large defaults. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, where the symbols that you sympathize with and how? You must have at least one likeable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them, and it did not give. Of course, I would like Anne and Wentworth get together, but only because that's what you know that the purpose of the story, they come together. Instead, I had to resist the urge to throw his cup on TV and continue watching it to the end. <br /> <br /> Anne was very annoying all over, and in the end, I really do not know why Wentworth was so killed it, as it seemed, there was nothing there for him to be involved. She was modest, soft, dull, socially inadequate and falls like a sheep, follow the instructions and all the rest, and having no mind of its own. It can still work for the main character, if you do it well. It was not done well. <br /> <br /> The other characters are simply reflecting the varying degree of narcissism, of which Mary was the worst of the full scale of narcissistic personality disorder. Where Mrs. Bennet in P & P had similar shortcomings, it still was a nice, while Mary was a freak show. More disgusting than funny. <br /> <br /> Wentworth was very nice and seemed like a decent guy. Most of the stories, I was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he was in love with Anne, as well as of course, it is the kind of guy who would like to see a man, which is a bit more ... alive? Acting wise, not too much to say as I reacted more characters are drawn, not how good / bad the people were acting. Anthony Head was beautiful, but as soon as I saw that he was in it, I expected no less. <br /> <br /> Also not found the story very confusing. It was not until the end of the film, where it seemed as if Elizabeth was not the stepmother Ann, but in fact the sister (I'm still not 100% on this subject). All Anne / Wentworth prehistory was also a little blurry. They were together, but then broke up, and they both bitter about it? How? I was wondering this for a long time, and the explanation seemed to be that she left him because she was convinced to do that to someone? But it has been said in some "way" so that he almost missed it, as if it was somehow all the same. How can that be do not care if it is the very essence of the story ?? There was also a lot of famous names, but not a real feel for those who were the characters. This person Luisa, for example, who is she? A friend? Family? What? It was not very clear who the different characters and their relationships with each other. Lady Russell was there a lot, but why? Mrs Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister, who felt very unrealistic, Mrs. Croft looked old enough to be his mother. <br /> <br /> The final kiss, yes, it was a bit strange, they kiss on the street, but I do not really think about it, because I was too busy shouting "Get on it already !!" at the TV, because Anna's lips trembled and quivered and trembled for what felt like an age before they actually met Wentworth. There is some doubt, but only for a few seconds or so, not half a minute. <br /> <br /> Then there's the question of the operation of the camera. As a regular movie watcher, do not pay attention to the corners and such, if you choose to look at it. I have not decided to do it here, but I still saw them. For me, this means that the filmmakers did not do a good job. A lot of talk has been of extreme close-up person, something that should be used only when there is a very important point to make. In this device, it was used excessively and therefore did not make sense. Portable feeling about, too, does not really work in a period drama. The camera work in the workplace, in the end, too, felt too modern. (Not to mention the works.) It was the only one I caught Ostna adaptation in Austen ITV season. It makes me wonder if it is worth watching "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park," or if I should just read a book and leave it at that. I am sad to say that this is Jane Austen adaptation I did not like. Maybe I'll look at the version of one thousand nine hundred ninety-five instead. BBC having made known beautiful accessories Austin earlier, in the end.
