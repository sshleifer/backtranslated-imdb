"Magnolia" is absurd, surprised acting showcase, which adds to the very few. As «Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is an unnecessary number of episodes, not caring about the agreement. The camera swoops through the hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of the sad signs. Where the reason for the care of these people? The general theme seems to be people who cry a lot, who can not take care of others (John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters, with the exception), and are self-destructive jerks who either fall apart or dying. I thought about how much I did not like «Shine» for irredeemable monster father plays Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unsightly, unattractive characters here, why would we want to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> Having said that, there is nothing restrained about the "Magnolia." Ideas Paul Thomas Anderson slopped on his canvas to give. There are two ideas, in particular, that the bombs. And there in the last hour of the 188-minute film. One has a camera flipping from one character to another while each of them sings one of the cafes folk singer Aimee Mann. Sweet, but to no avail, since we can not see which string them all together. Another idea I have in mind can not be revealed, except to say that it is completely unexpected and totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> «Magnolia" has a lot of great acting. In particular, Tom Cruise, who unleashes the performance, I do not know what he meant by it. And John C. Reilly plays perhaps the most decent and really good cop recently. But it all adds up to something. If the secret of an unexpected event happened, the girl behind me in the theater could not hold it in more and said: "This is nonsense," I have a feeling most moviegoers will agree.
