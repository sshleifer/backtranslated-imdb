Young man kills a young woman without a reason. Brother man jailed on charges that he was an accomplice, but soon escapes. After escaping a seemingly innocent man kidnaps three victims, and soon he was rigging his girlfriend on the site. If this is not so bad, the situation is quickly making a downward spiral. <br /> <br /> This movie had some good aspects and a lot of bad. His forte was the leading actress Emily Joaquim. Leaving aside the fact that she was naked in a fair this movie, it presents itself as a decent actress and a very strong character. I see no reason why it can not take this experience and somehow turn it into a career in some way. I was convinced that she was a ruthless individual. <br /> <br /> In addition, the makers of this film have been very brave and pulled the sun strikes. Graphic nudity (male and female), Coprophagia and anal extreme violence is not shunned. I like that my horror, to expand the limits a little bit, and this one ignored them altogether, gladly letting toward Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think that they have achieved what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the negative aspects. First, and most obvious that this film is very low budget and the quality of the film shows it. I can forgive that - the plot was decent, fine acting and in some scenes the poor quality of the film actually made the film more disturbing (more realistic sensation). Thus, I will not blame them for the fact that the low-grade equipment. What am I going to scold them for this use of bad choices in shots. For no reason I can make (besides seals the film), there is a large amount of square footage of the cemetery. I really do not know why, and I openly began to doze off at this point, because it was so long and pointless. <br /> <br /> I also take issue with the title. The idea was to fool people into thinking that the film had something to do with the classic "I spit on your grave." Now, there is a line that seems to have in mind the main character is the daughter of a woman with that of another film. And the theme is very weak (a woman to avenge the men). But there is no firm connection and the reason it was chosen for the client's name was the video store to think that they're getting a sequel. It was deceptive and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last major complaint is that this site has no real meaning. Not even a little. The woman killed at the very beginning without cause. Prison escapee finds time to steal a person to torture them without cause (because they hurt his girlfriend?). The same person goes from good to very bad without explanation. In addition, female lead (Joaquim) refers here ma normal person to someone who is too rigid a sadist, for no reason at all, and the people who are for the most part were only slightly mean to her (neighbor offers products for sex is wrong, but in no way worth the tortured). <br /> <br /> Do not let the name fool you, or claims that the film is incredibly shocking. So, some of the scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the film dull and makes you want to take a nap. If you see it in the video store or Netflix, just keep watching. Or rent it, and we can sit and tell about it for a few hours. You have been warned.
