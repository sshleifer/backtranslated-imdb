I am sure that the people on the border of Texas / Louisiana must have had a good laugh or two, if the unit is in the picture Paramount, apply them to the public during the war. Very simply the area along the river Sabine, where the film opens cotton country in the same way as the rest of the Deep South, or at least, Deep South was a post war CIVL. No big cattle empire there, they are not much further to the west in Texas, more than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could drive to create an empire. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the two of them partners in the river, and when Leo Carrillo tries to steal its services without paying for them to haul their cattle, they keep livestock. And this is the beginning of a large Ponderosa ranch like they start. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Foster marries sister Dix plays Frances Gifford and disagreement with its much smaller neighbors. They also have some additional modules runs to Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we Easterners who love westerns, as a rule, do not bother with the geographical minutiae, and that's a good western production from the smelter Harry Sherman, who made all those westerns Hopalong Cassidy for Paramount. The culmination is burning, and I mean that in the literal sense, a skirmish, which should be, may have been used in the production. <br /> <br /> But I would not have any, but the western lover to look at it.
