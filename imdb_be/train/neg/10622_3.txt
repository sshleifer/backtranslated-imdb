I really have a love for Christopher Lee, but this just was not up to his other performances ... and it was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> The film does not live up to his room. It's not scary, it's too melodramatic, and it draaaaaags. Every time I thought, "Oh, here's the good part of the" good part never came <br /> <br /> The evil is not entirely convincing Most of the other characters, too, lacks depth <br /> <br /> It is possible... if I was in the right mood, I would have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at the expense of the film, but .... Naaahhh ... not really seem worth the effort. It's actually not very good, it was not really bad, it was just mediocre.
