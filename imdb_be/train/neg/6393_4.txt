I admit that I did not give this film a lot of chances. I decided early on that it's just not my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it has a beautiful appearance in terms of its cinema. Scene of the early 70-ies of Manhattan look very good, as it makes the lead actress. It is very clear black and white, that could almost make the film feel fresh and undated. Nevertheless, some of the other methods used filmmakers to shoot the prospect of all to hell. Unintelligible editing very late-60, somewhere between surrealism and new wave. The story also feels like it came from a very specific time, somewhere between free love and idealism intricate experiments. <br /> <br /> films of young girls in the city, as it looks for a man who she had an anonymous phone sex with. When she meets other odd characters, it shows their quirks, and they show it. The film seems to have had in mind, as the off-the-wall, irreverent comedy, but adds an avant-garde look. I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol's movies, you would be very happy to open the phone book <br /> <br /> Some of the problems I had :. Toward the end of the movie, one character says incomprehensible anecdote, which lasts for twelve minutes ?? - brutal to sit. In addition, there is a very clear sequence of animation that I found rude and juvenile, which serves as the climax of the film. I laugh out loud four or five times, and I liked the ending (minus the flat-out disgusting animation). And when the film went on the color of the final sequence of the telephone booth-at-night, I really liked the way it looked even better. It is ultimately one of those experiences where I felt like I could have liked, when it was a little bit different. But this is what the filmmakers have given us. It is unclear, pretentious, and the rest of the way of the dial, but none of them there is no reason to recommend it on their own. I have not found it to be unique and creative as well as forced and pretentious.
