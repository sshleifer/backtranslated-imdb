this film is a boy forced to cheat me. I honestly thought it would be a campy horror movie with absolutely no humor in it at all, boy, I got cold that time. This film was, and I am a true, damn good. It was not terrible all but campiness and sly humor really mad this film interesting. Some actors in the terrible murder and clichés were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I loved it. Kill everyone vaguely related to winter sports and Christmas, which made all the more intriguing. POV camera angles were bizarre. <br /> <br /> The film is about a viscous killer who dies as a result of the collision the car accident with a chemical truck while being transported to jail. He later rose to the same chemical with snow spliced ​​into the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He than revenge as a snowman, a police officer who found him guilty. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, acting, except for Christopher Allport, that is, it was funny. I will say that I am very disappointed that this film was not horror, but really dark sitcom. They had a long history with a good story, but it was not carried out correctly. Overall, I like this movie at first, but now it's really annoying. But this film is much better and darker than a sequel.
