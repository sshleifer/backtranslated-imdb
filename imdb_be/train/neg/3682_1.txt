I have seen thousands of movies and have never written a review, but Red Eye, I have witnessed so at odds with the glowing tributes located here, that I am compelled to offer their two cents in protest- to vote, the lowest score possible only bring the average is closer to reality. <br /> <br /> It's sad, sad bitch film that will be remembered only for its apologetic image of terrorist targets (as John Bolton-Esquire bully diplomat, who really is a great guy, you do not know), as well as a beautiful and popular Dr. Phil (whose best-selling book, one learns to read, frequent flyers around the world). The only real Red Eye I felt was from rubbing their eyes in amazement. <br /> <br /> Before you shell out $ 10 or so dollars for this B movie, read the favorites "Quotes (trailer)" above, and ask yourself if you really like the movie, in which they were smarter line to be found. Unfortunately, nothing in this film better. The basic premise is stupid as hell; acting is bland and uninspired, completely absent from the r / antagonist chemistry; the potential for uncertainty hampered at every Turn- except for the last five minutes- bad directing and advanced editing; script inconsistencies abound, as early as the heroine reveals University lacrosse star called asking if she later antagonist battles with the field hockey stick; and the opening portion wider than the first class (while strictly character development coach). <br /> <br /> And there are moments of extreme absurdity as if the daughter of a high-level civil servant not to go directly to airport security, in its first opportunity to warn them of conspiracy to murder against both national security and the head of her father . Or if the same woman running a frantic-to-skin along the smooth linoleum airport, pistoning arms and veins in the neck convex while wearing 4-inch studs. Or if her pursuer chasing suckling also with a wound in the trachea. Or when terrorists use bait to open its arms to the fucking harbor below. I am always ready to suspend disbelief, but I'm not going to jump to 30.00 feet without a parachute. <br /> <br /> One good thing I can say about this movie is that it reflects women who are able (even in the form of Bimbo) treatment of the most extreme kind of sex emergencies- images are sorely lacking in American films. In addition, the film never takes off, and no more exciting than a red-eye flight from Boston to New York. Remember the last time I was deceived by misleading trailers and glowing tributes- in this forum or other places? This is one of those times. Wait for the video Red Eye, and not to look, too.
