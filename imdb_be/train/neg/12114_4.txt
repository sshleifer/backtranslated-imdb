Strange people who live in the city, going about their lives. There Licker guy who licks all dumpster diver who finds that he takes the body home to live with him, crazy girl with a doll dressed as she was, the guy who wants to clean the girl their wicked ways ... unusual in extreme cases, this shot in black-and-white film is better because of the color. Monochrome takes the edge off of two steps up from the home cinema feel. As the film three, this film is fun in fits and starts, but generally it is strange for miracles and soon becomes a hole broken, as you can see one set of windows you can kind of guess where it will have plenty of time, do not always- but enough for it should not be fun. (Although I did not see the cleansing come). Worth a shot if you have nothing else to watch and you wait for the next set of Golden Girls, to arrive from Netflix.
