I love Jane Austen novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm halfway through the Mansfield Park. But I could not stand Emma. I was disappointed in the book after two executives and the end of the film, I could not care less about Emma. She did not seem to change. Maybe it Paltrows action (which is perfectly in Se7en) or my lack of interest in the film. Dunno. <br /> <br /> costumes are good, but the dance was awkward compared to Pride and Prejudice dance Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 mainly for Knightley is bloody gorgeous, and although it is as a rather spotty performance for Ewan McGregor, I loved his singing.
