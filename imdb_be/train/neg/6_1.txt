From the very beginning of the film, it gives the feeling that the director is trying to express something that I want to say that instead of history dictates the style in which the film should be made, he went in the opposite direction, he had the type of movement that he wanted to do, and I wrote the story of his room. And he could not in her very badly. I believe he was trying to make a stylish film. In any case, I think that this film is a waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what I'm trying to say, I've seen worse movies than this. Here, at least, the director knows to maintain continuity in the film. And the actors, too, gave a decent performance.
