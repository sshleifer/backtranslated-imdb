Wow. I went to the video store today, because I was in the mood for a bad B horror movie, and I found this gem. I looked at the cover, and I thought it looked like only a film for my mood. I brought it home and put it. <br /> <br /> This film was not a B horror movie that I had in mind. It was much worse. I would like a bad movie, but what I got, I do not know shit, as it existed among humans. This film seemed to 5 years, wrote and directed it, and that is now well aware of this. <br /> <br /> I am a novice director and this film made me so mad that someone out there actually pay this guy a direct movies. It should work in a landfill shoveling shit where it belongs. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking about renting it or buying it. I'll tell you the same thing that I would say someone is preparing to commit suicide. "Do not make it, it's not worth it!" I really have nothing good to say about this film. Do not do it!
