This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. I do not care what the critics say, this is bad. I think the problem with the novel Kundera. This does not mean that it unfilmable; it's just that 99% of his work, it is pretentious and exaggerated. He seems to be in love with themselves, his characters come off as the navel of the dream, and his novels are generally misogynist. I have read many of his works (Even his socialist realist poetry It was really awful.) - I just do not understand what the hype. Characteristics (such as self-absorption) in his novels to make reading rabies. In the film, all the things that I do not like about Kundera were increased. Maybe I'm just missing something, but I do not think so. On a side note, I can not believe that this Criterion Collection DVD. In any case this is not the movie you want.
