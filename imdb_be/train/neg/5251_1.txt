This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" directed Spanish film easily the worst of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, coordination, rhythm, skills, humor ... he repeats the same situation again and again. It does not show character development. He did not even show any violent and / or sexual content, and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre. So lame should be indicated in film schools as an example of "what not to do" in the first film. <br /> <br /> By the way, where the hell is the "talent"? There are scenes that have been shot almost identically; There are scenes that have two or more basic shots, and it's pretty awful to see the effect of jumping from one master to another shot for no reason. The camera does not move almost as if "a very talented artist," afraid to show his lack of visual skills. The actors playing the main role act as lovers, and supporting cast is hardly believable. There are more holes than the plot of the script (if there ever was one) ... <br /> <br /> Really confused film, and generally talented director.
