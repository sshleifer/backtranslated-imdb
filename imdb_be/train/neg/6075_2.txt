One of the worst movies I have ever seen with Robert De Niro, Fan mindless clich√©s exercises chopper clicks. He is trying to spin or twist the genre with ridiculous storylines crazy fan turned psychotic - the film is bent into nothing. (Spoiler) We believe that the knife has an idiot has access and baseball murder generous hotel without any witnesses or security cameras? nonsense film tries to pull at our heart strings through the buzz in baseball finishing mocking wonder, and useless. Not sure what all the actors thought they got on board the Razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay away if you prefer the thought in your films
