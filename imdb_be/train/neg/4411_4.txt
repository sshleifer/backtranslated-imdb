Rucker decent actor, but he has no business being the leader, except in the budget of the film. He really does not have much charm. Ryo Ishibashi has much more presence on the screen, and, unfortunately, it is not really the main character. Most of the screen time goes on the brick face Rucker. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (from Halloween 4 and 5 films) plays his daughter, and she was cute and fun, but it was not written too smart and one of her stupid mistakes receives one of the main characters who have died. Comedians Fred Willard, Goldthwaite, and Stephen Furst here in interesting roles. Just watch what happens to these characters is priceless. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays Consigliare to the local mafia godfather, and it is difficult to say whether he is working as a comedy film. Tim Thomerson also in this film. He seems to be in each exceedingly low budget straight to video action film. Thomerson in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this film made it feel like a parody. Whether it is a parody of the movie Yakuza? It is difficult to say at some point. There is, of course, very little action Yakuza. <br /> <br /> supporting cast of thugs and Goons is an ominous and well-lit. Some of these films have thugs who look like they are working at the local comic book store or share the boys in the Piggly-Wiggly. Overall, this movie is very uneven. At some moments it seems a comedy or a parody. Whereas in other places, it works as a good action movie. Then he mumbles through. Without Danielle Harris deposits and Ryo Ishibashi this film would rate Zero in my humble opinion.
