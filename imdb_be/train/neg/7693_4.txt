Is there anything that happens in this film that is not predictable? I think not. Basically the movie cliché after cliché, and really nothing is ever a surprise. This makes the film is very predictable and because of the fact that the film is also seriously lacking in tension. So for a thriller intense sun and sufficient but also unpredictable, as a drama it's a failure. This is because the film his story is very unlikely. I did not mean it can not ever happen in real life as in the same way as the events take place in this film. So that the film has a real unknown and the problem of trust. <br /> <br /> But it's actually a cliché that killed the movie. It was cringing material at times. Everything is so formulaic in this film. Predator portrayed as heartless cool, almost psycho, like sexual frustration boy and the victim in a naive young woman who acts like she did not see any of this parish. Everything that happened in the film was so obvious, and everything seemed to happen for a reason. Such as the sequence in which the "predator" fixes broken car "victims. That has got to be one of the oldest cliché in the book. I knew that the film was trying to get after this point. I tried to look like when the teacher and student were indeed grow towards each other trough the eyes of other people around them. it was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop to watch a movie after this point. the film is filled with such moments. <br /> <br /> name suggests that it is a cheap porn, but it's actually ge juicy and made for TV movie. This means that everything happens slowly and the movie spends half his time on character development and unnecessary sub-plots to make the film even more drama, how. <br /> <br /> I admit that Elizabeth Berkley pretty good acting in this movie. she makes some of the clichés and events even look almost realistic at times. Her Hollywood career as good as over after appearing in the film by Paul Verhoeven «Showgirls», so, unfortunately, it probably only continue to appear in the movies- and television series like this. This is a waste of her talent, and she certainly deserves better. All other characters are disappointing. Corey Sevier plays a cliche pretty "untouchable" rich boy and the way the husband of the protagonist is drawn even worse. He looks more like a sexual predator frustrating than a true predator movie. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in any sequence. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before he goes to sleep, he wants sex. He comes home, he wants sex. This may be a realistic thing, but I do not know, it just does not feel right for a movie like this, and history in general. <br /> <br /> filled stencil film, and I can not think of any reason why anyone would ever watch this movie. It is predictable, and for that, too lacking in suspense and accuracy. It is not "terrible" movie, and it's certainly watchable one at a time, but still weak and cliché elements in the film also make it far from the recommended one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
