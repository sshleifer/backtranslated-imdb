If you have a lot of time to waste ... it's okay. It moves at a good pace, but to pull the film from it will need a little more with a little more background on the nanny. <br /> <br /> OK action. Claudia as a nanny does the best job is the most plausible. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played a very good role as a husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, and his wife, was the weakest part and the reasons for her return to work have not been developed. <br /> <br /> ending is kind of silly. Like most of these films Sitter ... there are parts that are interesting ... but overall it leaves you wondering why you wasted time.
