I had pretty high expectations for this film, despite the fact that he had received a bad review in the work. I was very tolerant and sat through the entire movie. I felt sick to the end <br /> <br /> Although I am by no means a prude or particularly sensitive to the tasteless movie. - I thouroughly enjoyed as "All Woody Allen, you wanted to know about sex ... and Michael Hanneke on "fun games" - I found the director's obsession with this ten-year-old wants to drink breast milk completely sickening. And when the film finished in the "orgy", where as a boy is drinking mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the entire film, I almost vomited in disgust to the general perverted and sentimental dad that this there. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the vast majority of European cinema, as well as self-made films, so this film has pleased me tremendously. Avoid this film any price, it must be reduced in the annals of history as a lesson in a bad movie.
