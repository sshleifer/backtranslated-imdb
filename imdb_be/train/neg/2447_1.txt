After watching I felt KHAKEE, I will get to see another good film, but unfortunately, the film is a joke, and really tries hard to imagine Ahriman Afterall his father's cache is a manufacturer <br /> <br /> RKS so much talked about film during promotions, saying that the film has meat as opposed to films released that time, wondering what kind of movies he said <br /> <br /> film is actually a typical Maasai film with loads of comedy , romance, action all mixed <br /> <br /> at the ease with which children are kidnapped family, is one of the see eshnyh parts ever imagine himself abducted child family <br /> <br /> Daoud eventually, a complete jumble mumble with a sudden change in the characteristics of the <br /> <br /> RKS gives him a weak film to date except for some scenes Bachchan film boring <br /> <br /> Music sad <br /> <br /> Amitabh trying to give him the role of all that he is doing his part well, though not his best, although he contorts his face too much if pulling the trigger and making a strange kind who smoke cigar H dubbing it also does not correspond to the correct time <br /> <br /> Akshay there for a few minutes and simply repeats his act and hams <br /> <br /> Ahriman seems unclear, he tries too hard, but overdid it in some of the scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika is the best of the many <br / > <br /> rest is all right
