I remember that this show be on TV when I was a kid, in the early 1990s, and there was this anger on children with Goofy leotard doing kung fu at each other and driving around in a plastic dinosaur. It was called the Power Rangers. I remember that young children will go to hit each other, then shirts and stuff from the show were banned in many school districts across the country, because it shows the child is taught how to deal with each other in resolving their differences. <br /> <br /> I never thought of it as a show, especially when better shows how the mite played on Fox Kids. The majority of older teens have always looked at the power rangers to ridicule and contemptuous manner, and it's not hard to wonder why. Frames funny at best. Color Rangers costumes look like the things you like to work in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get into the action, and, of course, those really ridiculous haircut. All the guys running around with earrings half of them wearing 90s mullet, and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then change into a swimsuit to wear Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Toys particularly funny as well and was a joke many late-night talk show. And, of course, two of the worst films ever made, and I am referring to two of the worst movies ever made were based on the show with nearly every critic trashing like in the movies, and shows that it was based on. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers nothing more than bad TV commericial for particularly bad toy merchandising. As an adult, I do not look at it with love, and as another embarrassment in the 1990 children's shows, fashion earrings and boys.
