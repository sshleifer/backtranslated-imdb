I personally found this film to be a terrible, this is hardly the first goal, and provided on one side of the debate. The only people who have been presented as a party, he said, there be a group of people coming from Billy Grahm Renaissance. Secondly, leaned heavily on his alleged subject did Jesus (Yeshua) are there to talk about how violent Christianity, and showing a scene from Mel Gibson's "The Passion." In the end, he has CON director of its former director of the conservative private school in the interview, and attempts to lure him into a trap on the education of children have faith. Oh, and techno music just made the film difficult to watch.
