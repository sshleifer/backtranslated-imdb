Are you kidding, it was HORRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> But, despite I was given this film and 3 others and they were all on DVD. Film runs pretty much OK movie, but goes downhill around mid-year. <br /> <br /> And the ending is well let's just say that it was one of the most anti-climatic endings in the modern history of cinema. Many baked in the final sequence, and if you want a dose of schlock horror, this movie is for you .... <br /> <br /> 3/10
