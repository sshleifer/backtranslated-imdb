the film was banned in England? Why? Savinykh, George Romero, Dario Argento, Fulci and others have done a lot worse before and continue so, so ... <br /> <br /> This film has all the basic elements of a decent 70 or early 80's horror movie. good looking girl (who can not act to save his life, by the way), a terrible storm with heavy rainfall, oblique, crazy brother traveling family estate, and actually pretty damn good twist at the end, but banned? seriously. when the English Parliament banned the film, the Italians are probably laughing their collective asses like that and prim British really were. <br /> <br /> it was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to violence and blood (which was largely undercooked). It was poverty, but not sex, though hints of sex were made, obviously. but absolutely do not deserve to be banned. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see what could be done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with. as it stands, the film is interesting, but the lack of sound and image quality to take away from the final result. <br /> <br /> banned ... what a joke ...
