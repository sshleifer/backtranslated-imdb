This film is about what it sounds like: a futuristic version of the legend of Cinderella, but with songs and (relatively tame) sex scenes! The film is not sure he wants to be and pretty much a mess ends. This is a more expensive look than most films directed by Al Adamson, but it's not on the same budget level that audiences have come to expect from sci-fi movies. The actors are very bad, and unlike most movies Adamson, former big NO namers actor or B. Some of the music is OK, but it's easy to understand why Cinderella 2000 was forgotten for many years.
