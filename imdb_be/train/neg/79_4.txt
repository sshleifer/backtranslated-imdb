The original book that was created in the 1950s, but it will not do for the series, because most people are looking at the style of the 1930s. Oddly tube train in the late 1950s was a train is painted to look like a 1930s train so Underground can play this game too. Dangling plot on the plot on the Jarrow March was weak, but the version of the 50's had students who are beginning to think about the world around them, so I guess, forcing them to think about poverty marches is almost the same. All material on Zheppe order to satisfy itself was weak too, but they had to put something to fill the time. This would make a decent half-hour show, or they could have filmed this book and make it better for a long time shows. Obviously, this episode is a victim of style over substance.
