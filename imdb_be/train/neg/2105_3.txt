White Lugosi as awful mad scientists using orchid woo brides to steal the essence of life for his wife's legacy. Lilliput in this movie is hilarious !! Many monsters, as well as a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this movie in the nightmares. I loved how all the pieces fell together in the end, in typical Hollywood fashion. History will never be fun and you feel helpless as you watch. <br /> <br /> I usually by boring clicks as this low, but the dwarf added just enough horror and entertainent, to get a couple more points.
