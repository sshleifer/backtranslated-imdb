I thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but this one song at the end, which is just a guy shouted «Yaowwww!» While someone knocks at random on a wooden object. That being said, there are some beautiful songs, but it's not worth seeing the film again Hte. Go to ITunes (they have an album), view it, and choose the good. <br /> <br /> Half of the film some guy making tea. Well, that's a slight exaggeration. But you see what I mean when you see it. That being said: I do not see it!
