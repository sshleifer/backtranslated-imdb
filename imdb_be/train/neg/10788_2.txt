And I mean an ultra light. This film shows the four giant stars, about three and a half joke and nothing else. <br /> <br /> There's really not too much to say about this bitch, in addition, that, although he has some very good bits, most of them are not very funny. It also does not work at all like a novel. How about as a romantic comedy? Not on your life. Much of the dialogue is too flat to be complicated, much less amusing. <br /> <br /> What is really ashame of this premise is not bad. This film could have been a lot more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the fictitious ways in which movies are promoted, complete with fake quotes from critics. The film reveals intact mined area news feast - they all paid trip for journalists, which almost always write good reviews. But instead of exploring what was Motherlode jokes, he devotes all of three minutes to the area and moves on in pursuit of a lame romance movie <br /> <br /> Same with Catherine Zeta-Jones. hero - neigh, itself the center of the movie stars. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she gave, but she did not give almost anything. It's all homogenized stuff that looks very pale in comparison to some of the things that we heard about the stars for many years. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's hard to know what did Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign on board the convict ship that is sinking as rerun "The Love BoatÂ». In fact, like the old joke, they forgot the script and shot deal. This is likely to make a better story. So, go ahead and tell us filmmakers that you have on these stars that got them to appear on this?
