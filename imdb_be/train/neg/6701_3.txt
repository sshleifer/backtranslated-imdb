I have been an environmentalist for many years, and really looking forward to this show. I was determined to record all the episodes, because I thought I could really learn some new things. I probably would have, if I could pass by Rachel. <br /> <br /> I'm sure a lot of this set to look like a reality TV show and refer to this class of audience. This does not work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Nagging with Rachel. <br /> <br /> Since Ed such a large font information may be other shows that it really is serious about the environment would be a good idea. Dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us. <br /> <br /> I no longer record or watch episodes of the show, but let me know if the real green show could be in the works.
