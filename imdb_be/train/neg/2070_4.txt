After too many bad memories, I took to skip this episode whenever he appeared in the sequence of Season 2. I recently watched it again to remind me why. I always thought it was the worst ST :. TNGA episode (except for "Shades of Gray", which almost counts as an episode in general) <br /> <br /> I continue to listen to the clumsy dialogue and scenario thinking red-pencil writing on the author's 101 teachers, "show, do not tell!" From pronunciation Dinah Troy, and all the other constant reminders elbows that magical, dangerous robber window is, the explanation of Guinan about how funny it droids joke (it is not), to who-cares resolution of the conflict, there ISN " m plot point that is not highlighted and underlined triple for our correction, entirely plausible point in any of it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, charming actor in other circumstances, too puppy dog ​​Huggable, to be the center of the plot of intrigue. On the other hand, it may be that none are missing John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from "Doctor Who") could not pull out of the aggregate guaranteed role. <br /> <br /> (zero points, by the way, before the data podagovore. Although I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny years ago, he and Spiner had nothing to work with here. Although a little Jerry Lewis was funny in silly.) <br /> <br /> on a good day, you may be able to think of it as a tribute to the magic at an episode of the original series. I, I would go to the «Time Squared» or «Q Who.»
