Do not waste your time on this dreck. As drawn characters have no redeeming value, and watching them interact is torture. "Gothic" was fun, at least, this is crap. When you look like a pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other, this could be right up your alley. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete nonentity, and why others chose to spend more than five minutes with him is really amazing. Mary Shelley, it seems the only character with any spine Whatever it was, but even she gets all the test without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See Goth instead. I also remember another great film based on the same fact, but did not hear the name. I was hoping it was, but no such luck. Not recommended.
