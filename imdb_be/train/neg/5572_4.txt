Another colorful occasion for men in rubber suits to fight with each other. At this time, time travelers from the future come in 1992, and dial a few people to go with them in 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving the future of Japan from destruction. But performing this task, while travelers have shown that a bunch of double-crossing, own creature goes on the rampage, and without Godzilla to stop it ?? Eek! All this sounds very silly, and this is likely, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks pretty good. Unfortunately, the rest of the visuals, just trash and garbage is not pleasant, and the film turns out to be as boring as its predecessors. Pay attention to the fleeting jokes-Spielberg.
