This film was probably the biggest waste of my life ever. Action has been pathetic. Jordan Hinson was unable to show any emotion frustrated. At the beginning of the film, she had to be embarrassed. Instead, she nodded her lower lip stuck out. She sobbed pitifully without tears for crying scenes. I was angry, that of all the girls who wanted to be an actress, they had to snatch it. All the rest are suffering from over-acting as well. It was flat out annoying. It was also an insult to the skaters. Jordan took a month to prepare, and they put her as the person who makes the Olympic team. It is practically spitting on the efforts of real skaters put into their work. A parody of the movie, and a pathetic attempt to tie hockey and ice skating. Do not waste your life. He does not even deserve one star.
