This film was t.v the other day and I did not like at all. The first George of the Jungle was a good comedy, but continued .... absolutely awful. A new actor and actress to play the lead roles were not good at all, they must Had the original actor (Brendan Fraser) and original actress (I forgot her name), so that the film gets 0 ten rankings, rather than a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy, this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the store, if hired or bought. It was nice to see, APE ape back, but it was not as much fun as the first, they had a new George as Georges son grew up, and still was Bredon and (her face) in a film that would "ve it was a little better than it was.
