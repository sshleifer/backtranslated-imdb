I'm rooting for this film as a remake of the 1970s children's television series "Escape into the Night", which, though chaotic and unnatural times was definitely strange, fascinating and disturbing. Which operates in the «PaperHOUSE» wood, unintentionally joke. The overlays Sun added tension, they only reinforced what I was watching failure. Casting annoyed tedious dialogue, which resulted in a relationship is not enough heat, chemicals or beliefs. As in most lackluster films I have some good support acts of these people need to be consoled, comforted and reassured that they will not be held responsible. the most unexpected ... lamer was selected from all the possible endings than I could dream of. <br /> <br /> «escape into the night," he deserves a proper remake, written by someone with life experience and aims to thin the mind.
