This is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was a slow, boring, not scary, funny Sun, Sun dramatically, not interested. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar was to her old playbook empty expressions of fear and shock. She could not sell its character and could not anyone else in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought that the Grudge was a "kind of good", then do not go see it if you do not get pleasure from having to spend time and life. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for free, by the way, so I do not want to come across as a rant from a guy who has lost 8 bucks on a terrible movie. He was free, he still sucked, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
