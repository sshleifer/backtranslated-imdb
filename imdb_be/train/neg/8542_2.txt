I'm working my way through a chilling Classics 50 Movie Collection and updates Witch Mountain (El Monte de las Brujas,) something like the 17th movie in the set. <br /> <br /> The film had no relation to her to keep my attention at all. The site has been incoherent. Dialogue seemed improvised. The action was poor. The characters were stale. <br /> <br /> The best scenes beginning with annoyed women driven to its incineration, seemingly willful daughter. However, the only connection this scene is to the rest of the film is the protagonist, Mario, who has the huge mustache ever. But, that's all. <br /> <br /> The film was not effective at all levels. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so that some of the scenes almost entirely black. It's actually just watchable - what else can I say?
