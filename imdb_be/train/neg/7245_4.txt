I'm not captured by a coffin, it's not so bad, but only very slowly at times. As the film goes on, it gets a little more interesting, but not brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer, and I think he's happy here. I'm not a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but I do not mind it, and sometimes it is all right. Pallbearer not highly recommended film, but if you like to spend, then you might enjoy it.
