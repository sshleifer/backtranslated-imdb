Family with dad Louis (Dale Midkiff), mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and about 3 years Gage (Miko Hughes) go to this beautiful home in Maine - seemingly unaware of the semi-finished products that Rowe down the highway in front of their home every 90 seconds or so! neighbor across the street (great Fred Guinea) makes them feel at home ... and shows them a pet cemetery, where children bury their pets. But a little further is the holy land, which could restore the dead to life ... but the dead come back in a nasty mood <br /> <br /> «» Definite spoilers ** in p Mana Stephen King was good -. it's been a long time, but he developed the characters and situations that made you care about what happened this film crosses all the character development and just plays up the gore and violence of animals killed on the camera (I know it's a fake. but it's still off-putting) ;. little boy hit the floor and his box pops open during the funeral (in a totally sore spot), it comes to life and attacks and kills people, including his mother (I wonder how 3 year-old was able to hang it); ghost runner (do not ask) is trying to help the family for no reason ... The film is just running through the audience pushing every hideous death or violence in the face. He just goes out of his way to shock you. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> duties will not help. Midkiff just awful, like a father - it was beautiful and buff, but completely empty. Crosby is not much better. These two kids just annoying. Only Guinea alone saves the picture with its easy good acting. <br /> <br /> This picture shows a general disdain for the audience to great leaps in logic, and having the characters do incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This film was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989, which led to an even worse sequel in 1992, I saw him in the theater while and was worried how the audience kept cheering on the violence and just shocked by what I saw, patient repellent film horror. A 1 all the way. <br /> <br /> If you think it's all over and can not get worse Ramones sing the title song !!!!!! ( "I do not want to be buried in a Pet Sematary"). Really beyond belief.
