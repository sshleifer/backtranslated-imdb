I picked up this DVD on the dollar Store. The DVD was 2 for $ 1 rack, but because he was Michael Madsen in this, I thought, as I have never seen the movie, I bought it anyway. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I'm waiting for "t like the movie. The film played more than a documentary or advertisement for religion than anything else. I have found that the use of flashbacks the director does not add to the storyline for me. I would prefer to see the story in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not throw it away as one of the other commentators, but it may be quite some time before I would consider watching this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since it was the film debut of Michael Madsen, maybe it could have some archival value at some date in the future.
