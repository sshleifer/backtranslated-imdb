Although I had some hopes for this film, the more I like the current Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) so much, I must say that it was one of the worst movies I've seen lately (Loser and Dr T and the women, too, in this list). <br /> <br /> Yes, there were a few laugh out loud moments, though the film could have been much better. The room was not bad- swindlers cheat their way through college to meet their match when they found someone with an offer for them. The problem is that the characters were so unpleasant that I did not care about any of them. Blackmailer (played by the talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath, that it was not was not funny to watch him- mad in particularly funny or magical, it was just crazy loser who was actually very dangerous and not fun to watch. Editing the film was difficult follow-- he continued sharp between fantasy and reality, and it was often unclear which one. Only two or three of the fraud gang have really shown, you just had to take it on faith that they really scam artists-- showing his scheme would make for a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact it was foolish and badly written and directed everything. I could about the shortcomings of the film, but you get the idea. Not worth the $ 4 rent or gas is required to get to and from the store to shoot a movie!
