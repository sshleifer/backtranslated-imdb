My personal vision of hell to be locked in a room without the possibility of a blind eye or block my ears, and there is this film play forever on every available surface in the room. The very notion that Streisand plays a boy / man is only beginning to scratch the surface of how ridiculous premise of this film. The most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of "ready to suspend disbelief." ,, It's impossible to do that in this movie.
