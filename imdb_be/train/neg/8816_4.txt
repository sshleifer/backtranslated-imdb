I saw my mom ... well, she's not exactly kissing Santa Claus; He has his hand on her hip, and the bad thoughts in your head. <br /> <br /> It was enough to emotionally scar a little boy who wanted to believe. He grew up to be a bitter person who was upset by the quality of toys made, and the lack of Christmas spirit. <br /> <br /> Waiting for a real slasher film, I was very disappointed by the fact that less than a handful of people are dying, and there was no nudity at all. Which is a bummer. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie, but it was too slow and did not have a good script. I did not expect that much action, but I'm sure he wanted some action. There simply was not.
