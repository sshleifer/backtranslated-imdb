It had to be one of the worst movies ever. When Kate and Jed is it with a bunch of guys and they all start screaming ... so Hollywood. Another bad scene when Kate ran her hands over the asphalt seemed that it was studying the texture of the coating. Andie actions are so bad in this film - I could not connect with them, or feel that they love each other. The remaining 2 women, however, were very good, and it dawned on Andy. In any case it was a campy movie. I usually these types of movies, but I just could not get into this film. Too many improbable situations and then acting Andie did not help the film. In addition, she gums. Lancome is to put it up on a spatula, because it looks glamorous in commericals.
