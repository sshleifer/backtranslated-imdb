What Robert "pretentious" Altman? if he was to save on lighting? It was so dark in this sad film, it was funny. I mean, have you ever seen a lawyer's office, where everyone is working by candlelight? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, do not waste your time on something Altman does: It's pretentious film waste.
