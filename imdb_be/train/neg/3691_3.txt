I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a huge disappointment. Between the terrible plot, action, and the songs were only mediocre. The storyline becomes very instructive. Instead of working in an office as NTR or MGR, Rajni almost seems to be working as the next great guru of Tamil Nadu. My wife tells me that since the movie came out, Rajni vowed to make any more movies! <br /> <br /> We are fortunate originally bought Babu (oldie on Sivajiganeshan) online by accident when trying to buy this .... it was a great film that is made to order, bought the rags ... but what does woman look even worse in comparison! <br /> <br /> Bryan
