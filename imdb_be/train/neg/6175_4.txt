Was it a thriller, I thought, when I saw the cover in the video library? No. Was it "food French thought", as the author was probably trying to do it? Not really. So what was it? It was a very average film that had great potential and was well directed, but let down by a confusing history without strong sides since the mid and late, with bad acting expect from a serial killer guy who, although he seemed to be overzealous in some points delivered the best performance of the cast as a whole. it was a good film, with good colors, cool greeting-Tec things beautiful scenery, but leaves you lost about where this is going and where he had been. And with a sense of let's just quickly wrap it in the end. the OK, to see if there's nothing else on TV.
