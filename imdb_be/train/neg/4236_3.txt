Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska, and a little bit of modern saykabili, we see that the live performances the only thing worth seeing. This movie has tons and tons of cameos group, along with the president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as semi-major role, as well as a lot of stupid scenes of death. It looks like it could be good, right? Well, death continued to arrive, and a few times to many different bands Warp Tour and fans at the event. Some of the deaths beginning stylish, but then they are recycled again and again, to the point to be completely repeated. Almost everyone dies from the fact that their head is broken, or the intestines pulled from his stomach. Gore looks as if it was from Andreas Schnaas Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence ", with this being" diluted blood ", but now the film is actually decent, and provides a sense of humor-that this film terribly lacking of course, film. Doug Sakmann made from Troma, he got a big low-budget potential, and he is trying ... but too hard. All too mean to be funny in this movie, and what brings it down. Everyone is trying to be too comical and absurd by the deliberate bad actions, excessive senseless death, and makes it is the same ... again and again It's basically "Malva:. Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board," or any movie you made with your friends :. it's funny for those who did it, and that's it <br /> <br /> great potential, great idea, great use of effects, but it is the same ... again and again, the gang plays, artist dies, fans are dying Everyone dies, the blood sprayed all over the place, the process is repeated. . <br /> <br /> The question for these types of films, which are basically "bad slap-stick'-do they try too hard, or no?
