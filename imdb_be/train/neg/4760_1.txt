This reworking of the classic play by Anthony Shaffer's not long in theaters. Recently suffered through a cable, I still congratulate yourself for not spending money on a ticket. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter, and star / producer Jude Law himself mistaken, that only their authority could withstand this travesty through endless 93 minutes, without addressing class or larger than the original. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine boost your reputation by playing second lead in the excellent 1972 film. Now he seems intent on destroying it, trying to lead, I played in this version of Laurence Olivier. (Both have been nominated for Best Actor Oscar, but lost Marlon Brando The Godfather.) Looking puffy and blurred, Caine slides through a portion with a shallower depth than it shows how the Butler Batman. He has already dropped to a guest appearance in the brutal remake GET Carter. What's next - ALFIE II, or the son of a man who wanted to be king? <br /> <br /> But, no one will benefit from this silly adaptation of Pinter, who believes that the frequent swearing and added a sexy angle can compensate for the lack of interaction witty character Schaeffer. The direction depends on the swearing bluish lighting and soulless scenography that will not hold up in the nightclub of the second course. No shadow, no hard, close-up replay of the Law can help to overcome a dull screen persona. The result of this is the inability and as a straight drama and, as a detective, almost making you forget about the purpose behind the title. <br /> <br /> The proponents of the original stage (Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Caine film will be well to consider this enterprise as a bad dream. The late Mr. Shaffer, who wrote the script in 1972, as well as the Frenzy and several Agatha Christie adaptation of Hitchcock, should be, in a coffin, wishing that he could plan the actual murder or two!
