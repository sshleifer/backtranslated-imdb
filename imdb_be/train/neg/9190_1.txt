This is definitely the worst film I've ever watched. I've seen some pretty terrible movies in my time, but that those takes the cake, no wait, I mean the whole damn bakery. It's so bad that I think the word to describe how you feel after watching this crime yet to be established. Please, just do yourself a favor, if you ever wish to watch it and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur Barney, and then multiply that times thirty fold, and you still get only a fraction of the horror you would have in store for. In summary, I believe that you can really call it a horror film, but only if you are prepared to be scared senseless actions of the worst in the business, and quite pointless story. <br /> <br /> The actual rating, -10 disgusting
