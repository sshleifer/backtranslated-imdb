This is not a good film. Very instructive in parts and the storyline was south Wed. 3D was good, but not great. I almost fell asleep in this film. <br /> <br /> The story of three young flies who want adventure and watch her. Symbols do not have enough, I do not really care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to adult interested. Pixar is not. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a special 3D effects. In addition, I would like to see Walden more flies than a joke mom always says, "Lord of the Flies" Quite sexist in showing women as wives and fainting at home.
