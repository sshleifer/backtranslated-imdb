Well, I'm blessed. I saw two very strong performances, one in New York, with the original cast, and the other in San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared with any of them, the film is almost unwatchable. I plodding through a DVD in the last two evenings, and I still have not been completed. Too many extraneous dialogue, and waaay too much added scenes and people. Thus, the four main characteristics are quite good, especially Ms. Streep. But comparing the phase of the film, of course, is an example of "less is more." Thickening of the game to meet the needs of the film viewers to scenic diversity and specificity was a bad choice. Please, please, please, go find scenic somewhere near you.
