I love Dracula, but the film was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee Dracula from other movies from when I was younger, and I thought he was great, but this film was very bad. I do not know if it was my youth, that I cheated, believing Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with the style, looks, appeal and evil underneath it. Or, perhaps, this is the movie that disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But you can imagine Dracula with snob English accent and body language to go along with it? Do you like it when the story contains unrealistic choice of characters and dull and does not have any tension ..? Then this is the movie for you! <br /> <br /> If not - I do not see! I only gave it 2 because once I managed to stay awake throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you like this movie, you should have been deprived of sleep and home alone in a dark room with plenty of space behind you unviewed. Maybe one in your parents' house or in an unfamiliar house. The reason is not even the characters in this film, it seemed, was afraid, and I think that sums up the whole thing! <br /> <br /> Maybe you like this film because of its place in the history of film Dracula, perhaps, being fascinated by the Dracula story evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. The reason the film is not so attractive, she does not pull you in suggestive mystery that make the myth of the Vampire is so interesting for me. <br /> <br /> And, besides, he has so much that the adhesive 70, the feel of it. The scenery looks like a cheap theater. And I'm not saying that it is not taking all made in the 70s. Because I love the old film, as well as a new one.
