Well, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture. In addition, Spanish I, I eat paella and I like black humor <br /> <br /> Well, from this point a lot, I can comment on the film :. I do not have the slightest idea about how it's nice to Japanese audiences, Mamoru Oshii director-quite good despite the excessively pedantic things postmodern style tells the head, and even that was interesting and somehow interesting- and I am surprised, he came up with this. It may just be one of those lost in the transfer-case, I am afraid it is, but as a European audience watching a movie with overtones overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible. Jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked- I mean, to give the audience a break, and you plug in a little damn narrator- almost to the point of doing my head will explode over the excessive and rapid talk absurd action. <, Br /> <br /> However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great and it is well maintained in these animated scenes. However, the eye candy ends as soon as the characters remain the side to start with the infinite is not funny at all fetish speech on photographs. It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut hysterical scene. <br /> <br /> I read Mamoru Oshii actually plans to continue to do so. The idea was good, but terribly exploited. Perhaps the second part will bring up a good part of the first and actually make an interesting movie, or perhaps it will be more and more over-the-scenes narrated. But damn it, when you thought that the speaker's head was thick, the country still life with Gifters Fast Food will cause you to blow. <br /> <br /> Of course, this observation is based on the experience of one who is a European. Probably, it is absolutely useless to the Japanese people, maybe it was a really funny movie lost in translation and cultural framework. Maybe.
