I watched this movie, hoping to find a nice and interesting history has the story was not good at all. Game actors were not any better. <br /> <br /> Of course there was Shah Rukh Khan was not enough to make this film "credible" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I've read that this movie was based on a novel by Flaubert's "Madame Bovary", but for me, I did not see his correspondence with the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> as a whole we buy movies to dream and have a good time, so as not to waste time and change our mood worse. I just can not understand how he could get a "high" voice of an average of 6.8 / 10 <br /> <br /> So, it is a kind of film that you should run away and ignore, because there is no nothing to evaluate it! You'll be wasting your time if you do not like "dark film" with "amazing and is not a history of the senses."
