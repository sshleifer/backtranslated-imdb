I decided to see this, because he was nominated for an Oscar this year. I believe that so many people here, I really wanted to like this film, but ultimately boring and frustrating. The first stage was really annoying it is OK, but the rest of the movie in the "trembling hands" camera mode <br /> <br /> I think the main reason for making this film and releasing it at the Oscars this :. <, Br /> <br /> American "war machine" (people who make money in the war) urgently need a reason or justification for the war in Iraq bungling something (like) patriotic. <br /> <br /> Why the "heroic" efforts of the director and the protagonist to _inspire_ audience with the idea of ​​"loving the war as-a-drug"? .. Well, please, come on! what anguish! <br /> <br /> look at it to get an idea of ​​how low the film academy might fall ...
