Several years ago, the movie is going to a friend and I went to see a horror film that we thought it would be good, because it starred John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, Cassavetes was an actor, screenwriter and director (married actress Gena Rowlands), nominated for an Oscar three times, who wrote and directed a lot of good low-budget films, using his income as an actor, to keep themselves afloat By seeing Incubus we did not realize that John Cassavetes income was made from any film, which was proposed to him. If we knew what the film was about, before you see it could have been avoided altogether. But we do not go out. At that time, my friend, and I jokingly revealed that this is the worst movie ever made. Now, to be honest, it is not. I've seen a lot of bad movies made on Friday evening on Cinemax (did I just say that out loud?), Which is much worse than the Incubus. Almost any film starring Brian Bosworth by definition worse than the movie The Incubus. Of course Santa Claus will punish the Martians is worse than the movie The Incubus. However, since then I have constantly used Incubus as a threshold below which I do not want to fall. When talking with the others about the movie that I could have seen I always, I note that it is better (or worse) than the Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
