There's not a drop of sunshine in «The Sunshine Boys», which makes the name of this alleged comedy only ironic moment of Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the script with his play (which is in the credits), equate old age with an irrational behavior - and, even worse, awkward, galumphing, meanest irrational behavior. Matthau plays a ruthless us obsolete vaudeville performer said in a reunion with the former partner of George Burns comedy special for television (he said they were a team for 43 years, which raises the question 'how long vaudeville in the past, anyway? ") Burns, who won an Oscar Supporting, has the misfortune to come to the film about thirty minutes, after which the material Matthau already blown to hell and back. Noisy film becomes, the less tolerant and is watchable. Director Herbert Ross only made solid work, if it was not coupled with one of the scenarios Neil Simon; Here, Ross sets fun as shaking amateur pounded into warring procedures, which are not able to pay off (for example, half-incoherent Matthau display in a garage mechanics to audition for TV advertising). At this point, Matthau was still too young for the role, and he stooped over-compensates and screaming. That was before Ross and Simon mute character, temperament of Nuance to give «The Sunshine Boys» some sunshine, but Walter continues to act as if we are all deaf. The picture looks very smooth and creeps into spiritless pace; one loses hope it early. * 1/2 ****
