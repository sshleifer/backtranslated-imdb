I love Alec Guinness. And that's saying a lot after this film. In fact, he is not bad at it. He just seems to stand apart, to be polite, and his usual wonderful self, but we need to invest. Obviously, the girl he combined with a featherweight, even an inexperienced young French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen her, when he was very young and obviously not too happy about it. <br /> <br /> interesting character is thoughtful brother odd «Suzanne», another reproach. «Donald» seeks to become a French Heathcliffe, and I waited in vain for the source of his secrets. Which is a deep dark secret he was hiding behind this forehead? He was in love with the mistress of his father? Why did he pull hair Suzanne, when it was built to bring the disparate parts of the turkey together in the office? Or perhaps he was simply her hideous acting. <br /> <br /> The film would have been magical Guiness and "old woman" Remembrance and who sees Paris together. It would be a great story! Two excellent experienced people in the beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why someone did not come to this? I suggest watching Alec Guinness in the "Maps", a little known but well worth a movie.
