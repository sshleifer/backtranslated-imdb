I give this movie 1, because there is no negative numbers in the system IMDb rating. this movie was terrible. It was a very bad acting, the story was poorly written, the action was unbelievable. I doubt that even the Salvation Army can fight as badly as did the troops in this film. I will not even write any plot spoilers, because the film is simply not good enough for the plot spoilers. In order to comment on the site would be pointless. If I were to compare this film, I would have to compare it Reign of Fire, however, even though I did not want to Reign of Fire anything that film, at least better than this. <br /> <br /> Some of the people in the theater were left before the movie even half done. The only reason why I was not, because I just do not think to do it. I was hoping for CGI holiday and fighting skillfully done, but that's not what happened. Martial Arts lasted only 30 seconds, and it was on the training done during the back stage flash, very disappointing. CGI has not done well either. One scene comes to mind. During one of the previous tank battles troops shot far ...... nothing. Someone forgot to rewind the animation guys on this bit of the film because the street was completely devoid of bad guys. I also think the voice of the bad guy was voiced announcer with Imotep with Mummy films. If the same skinny repeating what was happening. (Somebody owes some royalties, here?) As I mentioned the scene of battle, I will say this, that can be seen as a spoiler, but I guess the purists. <br /> <br /> And do not go to see, do not buy the DVD, when it comes out either. You have been warned.
