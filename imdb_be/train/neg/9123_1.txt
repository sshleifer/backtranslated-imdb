I do not have much to say about this film. This could be a great tour-de-force for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic misfires in the history of cinema. What was the final movie Sellers makes it more painful. <br /> <br /> A terrible script, direction and shockingly wooden performances all come awfully together to make this one of the worst unwatchably films ever. <, Br /> <br /> I wish so much that I could find even a laugh or giggle buried somewhere in this pile of rotten fats, but lifeless, humor adversity. The truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why do not you stop in existence?
