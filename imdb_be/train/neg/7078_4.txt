This film could have been a decent B-movie, if 3/4 of the film is not so much focus on sex scenes. I mean, he was a sex addict, and I'm sure there is much more that comes with sex addicts is sex on a regular basis. Michael Des Barres did a good job, given the fact that all he had to do, which was not much. At one time or another, we could laugh at him, because his character was so miserable. Nastassja Kinski was good in her role as an interested sex therapist, she could do with more, though I did not invite her to have sex. The man who stood out the most to me in this film was Ryazanov Arquette in her convincing role of a loving and concerned wife. There's something about the beautiful inside and outside, which greatly appeals to me. She played this role, and as you watched the movie, you start to feel bad for her. <br /> <br /> Â«Anatomy of Crime", not Oscar material or modern classic with all standards, it is very informative and does a fair job of showing how his personal demons can take over and ruin the best things in life you think high.
