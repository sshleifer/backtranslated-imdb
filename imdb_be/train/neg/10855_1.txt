Of course this is a comedy, I will likely not forget for a while <br /> <br /> would not normally bother to comment on this movie :. It is so small that no one will see it anyway, but as it happens, is a kind of popular p2p networks section, such as Kazaa, and therefore it saaad proceedings shall be subject for what it is. <br /> <br /> So what is it then? Of course, this is not a comedy; instead, it is designed as a horror film - "appointed" really be the key word here. The script is completely incoherent and unbalanced mess, the special effects are special only in that they are particularly pathetic, and how to act, well, let's just say that if it was my alumni play in elementary school, my teachers have cried our talent. <br /> <br /> Of course, I understand that this is a very low budget of the film, and that in these cases it is necessary to lower their expectations, of course, as far as such things as the special effects are concerned. In addition, despite the fact that I'm a big fan of the horror genre, I know that these films are only rarely the place to look for interesting scenarios and highly professional operation. <br /> <br /> But until now. <, Br /> <br /> B-movies often have some redeeming features to compensate for the lack of financing, such as humor. Only laughter Cradle fear lies in the funny speeches. If you can find humor in the fact that - and I could during the first 20 minutes or so, gradually falling asleep after that - that this is the only thing that the movie has to offer. . Oh, and that two or three pairs of breasts <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how interesting <br /> <br /> As for the history, not even that is not trying to pass anything .: victims or use drugs and / or engage in serious crime. Lesson :. Beware, naughty boys and girls, because one day you will make to pay for what you've done <br /> <br /> I rest my case <br /> <br /> Yes. , In the end, a bit of sex, sufficient medicines, but absolutely zero of rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> I appreciate it a 1 out of 10, but would go to 0, if I could, or maybe I would not: he deserves one for the actors names correctly spelling the names. I mean, it's something, is not it?
