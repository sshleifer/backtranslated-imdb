I can not believe I wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this horrible film, I kept hoping it would be better to end, but boy was I wrong. The plot was boring, the current was extremely poor and the special effects were terrible. Not even 2 beautiful girls can revive my interest in this sad and bloody mess. However, I can not lie to you, some of the lines in this movie were very memorable, for example, when the Asian boy says' I lost my virginity to a babysitter so f **** stereotypes «» <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time with the accident when not ready or want to have a good laugh .. it is possible that the method and can watch it, to break this film with some friends
