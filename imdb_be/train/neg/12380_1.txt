Creation of this film has been lost from the very beginning, when the writers and directors left with a good story line, only to be replaced with a terrible special affects. This movie seemed to focus on the fun of children, but could not even get. Many small low-budget films have the potential to be a great movie, but this movie is no where near that. Fortunately, it will be another film easy to make and easy to forget. This film was probably a chance for the cast to earn a little money on the side, while their chance had not come to a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has little respect for the films should be avoided to see this film at all costs.
