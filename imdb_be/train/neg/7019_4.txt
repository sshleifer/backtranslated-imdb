After seeing a poster of the movie to choke, I knew I was going to live one of those unbearable movie experiences that make me want to take my eyes out.However, I felt a slight optimism, because the film was a solid cast, I thought it was going to save movie.Unfortunately, Sun happen.Smother a terrible film, but it is not execrable.That best thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> scenario stifle (written by the same guys from licenses for couples that explains they have nothing but the talent for writing films) full of cheap and predictable humor.Seriously, I did not laugh, even once watching this film.Besides, solid cast I mentioned earlier, it is absolutely wasted.After large amount of debris, it was involved in (as monumentally brutal and disgusting because I Said so), some people may think that a career with Diane Keaton is extinguishing.However, it is impossible for me to forget the excellent speech she brought us forth to Previo zesyatsigoddi on films like Annie Hall or baby Boom.On overwhelming, she does her best efforts to her work, but her character is so badly written that it can not do anything with it.Dax Shepard left a good impression on me with his solid performances on film Baby Mama and Idiocracy.However, he does what he can with his character.Mike White also makes a good effort, but it does not reach too far away.He very talented screenwriter (he pointed to the films as The Good Girl and school of rock), so I'd like to see that he was one of the writers of this movie And not only acts on it.Liv Tyler suffers from the same position all the previously mentioned actors: to spend. <br /> <br /> worst is over now strangle completely boring and unfunny.Its scenario is not nothing but a set of coercive scenes and situations, we have seen in the sedentary coms.Stay away from this crappy comedy.
