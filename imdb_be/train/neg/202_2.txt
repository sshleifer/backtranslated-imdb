It is not the sound of bees, it is the effect induced by watching a very long, very sad, the film acted badly. How I ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without sleep, I'll never know. The plot is simple ... 3 thoroughly unpleasant morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought that Romer was fatally. It is even worse when it is possible. > I really need to be a masochist if I could watch the whole film without turning it off ... or kill someone.
