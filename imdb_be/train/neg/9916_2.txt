Justin comes home to live with his strict, hard-nosed police detective father, but it seems to me, Dad turned upward in three makeshift apartments each with a bizarre inhabitants living in them. Puritan idealist Justin thrust into the world of the occult, murder, under-aged alcohol and other vile things. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, I've seen the same movie that almost all the other reviewers have seen on here ??? Clever, compelling, original, intense, intelligent, genius ???? !!? I have not seen one of these things. What I saw was uninteresting, bland, banal, formulaic extremely low-budget thriller, which was managed implausibilities and without tension in the least, as the killer telegraphed once in the film, he gives his monologue / debate / discussion. And where are these humorous laugh out loud moments? I've never so much as giggled, perhaps because I was too busy struggling not to euthanize the film <br /> <br /> My rating: D. <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Audio commentary with director Dave Kempfild; A second commentary with various contributers, and individual music tracks; 4 shorts (Production at the set, converting one room 4, & Inside the black circle); Interview with Felissoy Rose Desiree Gould, and Raine Brown; Alternate scenes; bloopers; music video for "drug addiction"; The trailer for this film; And Trailer «Shock-O-Rama», «Chainsaw Sally", "goose bumps", "Wicked", "bacterium", "Creature from the Hillbilly Lagoon" and "Crises of the Millennium"
