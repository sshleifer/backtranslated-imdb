Seeing the photograph of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio «Zombi» Fulci can be to him the old tricks. Unfortunately, except for close-ups of rotten corpse, there is little to recommend in this story the murder of a rich man and his daughter's quest to find out who killed him. None of the characters is not attractive, and at that time, when you find out how they did it (that turn, at least it was cool), you are no longer anxious. The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than the nightmare concert!
