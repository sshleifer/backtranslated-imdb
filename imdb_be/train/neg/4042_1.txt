This film is a pleasure to watch, but it's like watching a really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one), makes no sense. But this is a very "artistic". Many shots Wrestling half-dressed actors and looking deep into each other's eyes. Many artistic shots through the window, and with people from the frame. Muttering and people wandering lonely. The prolonged close-up of face and body. By the time you are in the top three on the roof with a cat, you are ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. <br /> <br /> It should be about a father and son relationship, but you'll only wish the two of them just F * $ & each other and get it over with. If you always wanted to see the bad Russian gay porn without any money shots, your wish has been granted.
