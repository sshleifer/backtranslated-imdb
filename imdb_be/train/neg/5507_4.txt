It was another big screen output to a TV show from the sixties the United States is quite funny, but it was a lot of formulas. Intelligent Martian ground in the world and meet people not too bright, in his opinion. <br /> <br /> Usually wackiness begins with a man, bridges, after all ties with him and help him get home. On the way, he also gets the girl, Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a good way out for some nice Hollywood stars that I have not seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Pleasant enough to pass some free time, if you have nothing better to watch.
