This is the most depressing movie I've ever seen. I first saw him as a child, or even think about it now really excites me. I know that it has been established at a time when life was hard, and I know that these people were poor, and crops were vital. Yes, I have it all. What I find hard to accept, I can not remember a single bright spot in the entire film. Maybe it's a fact of life, I do not know. I am quite sure that the action was at the highest level, and the direction and quality of filming, etc. etc. It was excellent, and I know that each film can not have a happy ending, but as a family film it is terrible in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it for those who want to be entertained film. I can not stress enough how this film to me as a child. I talked about this in recent years and all the sad memories came flooding back. I think it will be anything but heartless, reaching for the Prozac.
