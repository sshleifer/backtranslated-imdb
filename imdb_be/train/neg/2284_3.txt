Now, I will not deny that when I bought it in eBay, I had high expectations. It was an incredible work sold by comedy master, I enjoy. Nevertheless, I will soon be disappointed. Apologies to those who enjoyed it, but I found Al Completed very difficult to observe. I got a few smiles, of course, but the majority came from funny music video (which I received on the DVD), and the rest are mostly filler. You could say that it was not the greatest achievement of the video Elo (that honor goes UHF). Frankly, I doubt it will ever make the jump to DVD, so if you have an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just have everything to buy the tape from eBay. Just do not pay too much for him.
