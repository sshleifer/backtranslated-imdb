I see from the comments that most people who discuss the film bases its observations on the winding MST3K. That's fair enough (that is, in the end, it got its broader impact), but had the misfortune to see the «Final Justice» in its original form, I just wanted to share some thoughts and comments on the uncut version. <br /> <br /> First, we should recognize that the original version is a little more consistent than MST3K broadcast, thanks primarily explanatory scenes between Rossano and Brazza Venantino Venantini (I could use the names of the characters instead of actors, but I just like typing the word "Venantino Venantini"), explaining why a cursory character Venantini can not just leave Malta immediately. (This is not very convincing plot point, but, at least, the filmmakers were trying to hide it.) Is this scene was cut out only for a while, or because it does not provide much fodder for the reef, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Another point, the plot is not original: the betrayal of Stripper Venantino Venantini Joe Don Baker, seemingly unmotivated MST3K version, explained earlier, is very unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the shower. Although it does give her a reason to turn against him, the whole scenario just really ... icky. (There's no other word.) <br /> <br /> Some of the MST-worthy moments (secular truncated cries of "Son of a--" and "deja vu" shooting sheriff) were purely the result is edited to print to TV, they have worked with, and absent in the original film <br /> <br /> in one scene I wanted to do it in the version of MST3K :. Before the entrance to the bar, to question some people ask Joe Don Maltese police officer who accompanies him to stay on the street, because "they see the uniform, they will not cooperate." However, the very Joe Don wearing his ridiculous kavboy- slash sheriff outfit, complete with a shiny badge! I can not understand why they went on this great opportunity to make fun of him ... <br /> <br /> One final observation on the original, uncut version of the «Final Justice": Why, oh why, did I feel the need to put a naked ass Venantino Venantini in the screen?
