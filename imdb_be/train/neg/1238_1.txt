This is Tim Burton remake of the original "Planet of the Apes" in 1968 (and starring Charlton Heston) is far, far away from the plot and the quality of the original. <br /> <br /> Of course, the special effects have improved since 1968, but the letter does not. The characters were boring, and the dialogue was terrible. I spent the whole movie with one (which, fortunately, only rented it) and completely understood why, just before Christmas, all the "Planet of the Apes" toys at Target were in the lumen of the bin. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: Do not put it on your resume <br /> <br /> My advice to others :. see original 1968 "Planet of the Apes" movie.
