I watched this show, and I just did not find funny. It may have been the first episode. Recently, I understand, ABC plays a lot nowadays dumb show and goes down to the station. All the characters on the show pretty bad actors, but even if they were good jokes and the script is pretty awful and will continue to bring the show down. I would say that I believe that this show will be canceled, but seeing as ABC does pretty awful for quality shows that they play, they can just keep it just because it is on average in comparison with them.
