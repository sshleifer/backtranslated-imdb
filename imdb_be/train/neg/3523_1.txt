Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad film! Cowritten by starring Sylvester Stallone ??, which was enough ?? and showing too much climbing scenes, dizziness, falls and scene chewing villains and foul air robbery. There are two sections, and the lame. One of them is related traumatic unable to escape, while the other includes a bad man wrecking airplane for production, and killing a variety of friendly people, if possible. Usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps overwhelmed by the sheer awfulness of the product, are reduced to mocking and calling on those for whom he cares «Bostid!» In clear English accent approached. Janine Turner, who was cheerful and mysterious when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, boring lost in the rescue of the climber and pilot. Stallone phlegmatic and muscles of the head. Many immortal lines in it. A lot of live lines, either.
