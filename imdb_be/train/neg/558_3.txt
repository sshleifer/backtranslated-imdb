It's been about 14 years since Sharon Stone was awarded the audience leg intersections that are twisted minds of many people. And now, God knows why, she was back in the game. "Basic Instinct 2" is a sequel to smash hit erotica "Basic Instinct" with sexual stone and vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, proponents of the original could not even come close to this as "Instinct 2" is a painful film industry as a mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones kills legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> film's plot begins when a car bomb breaks at the beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to look sexy strength) is suspect, and it seems that has to do with the murder. Psychiatrist (awful David Morrissey) is designed to study it, but eventually falls to an intimate game of seduction. <br /> <br /> And this, without any further explanation, the main force that moves this «Instinct». Nothing special is not explained, and we have to sit through a sloppy, C-class erotic film. Sharon Stone plays his first role where she is most of the time off. This is partly due to the amateur writing, careless direction, and terribly low chemistry. The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sex (and three scenes had been cut, so that it will not be an NC-17 rating), than the first entry in the series. "Instinct" is a compelling torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, everything that made the original film is a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film. Act here is really bad. Sharon Stone have some moments, but here it gets really nasty. David Morrissey stars in the role of the worst of his life, and never seems to do more than two terms in the film confused and aroused. "Instinct 2" is a terrible way to continue otherwise the original series, which managed to put in a thriller with erotic very well. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you .... <br /> <br /> «Basic Instinct 2" never sounded like a good movie, and, in fact, it is not. Some movies should never get out of the paper, and the feeling that you get after watching. Now, it is much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg has dropped, and why Sharon Stone was waiting for a huge bill for this ......----- 3/10
