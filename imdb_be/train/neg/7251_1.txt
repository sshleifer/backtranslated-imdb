Great Western I have heard all the talk! Brilliant first effort! Well, I'm not sure that all the film you watched, but it should be more to each other, I saw. Big Westerns or really good movies of any genre have characters you can believe, and this movie had none! The acting was poor, to say the least, and I could not care less about any of the characters, which makes the entire movie pointless. the story was too big for manufacturers and perhaps they should try their hand at something so right on the low-budget TV trash, as you can see on these programs in the sci-fi "or fiction." <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for a good movie, great western, or even just a nice half hour, please look elsewhere.
