I saw this movie last night, and even after a couple of beers just giggle this film came to me was when I realized that I was actually playing. In a word, it is unfunny. Unfunny. I fully believe in the little things tasty for Jack Black apologizes for making this garbage. I can not believe that Barry Levinson does not just throw the script when he read the first page. Moreover, I can not believe what I was watching more than ten minutes of this. <br /> <br /> I gave 3 out of 10 *, because I love to see Christopher Walken make terrible movies for salaries. In addition, the horse "cork", simply existing as a character in this film is actually quite funny.
