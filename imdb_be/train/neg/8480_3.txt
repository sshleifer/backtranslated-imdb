I can not say that this is one of the best films I've ever seen. But then again, I can not say that this is one of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> So, it's basically the girl makes skating, he is good, wants to go to an expensive school, can not afford it and should take Hockey scholarship. She must hide her secret from her skating friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like the actress playing Katelin. She could not cry at all, to save his life, just screaming sounds made as small pretending to cry to get their own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just annoying people. The way she was trying to act all nice and helpful people. In addition, the part where the two skaters called her name, and they say something about her choreographer and she says that she draws the line "made me shudder. <br /> <br /> We all knew where it was going to go with her and Spencer. Classically, they are not similar to each other and how to get along in the end was just typical. <br /> <br /> overall, I think this is a movie to watch if you love to skate, but if you do not mind basic skater to be very annoying. It's good to kill time, basically.
