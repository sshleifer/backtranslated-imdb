Wow. I do not even remember much about this movie, except that it is smelly <br /> <br /> The story basically. the girl's parents ignore her, so Sicko Pokemon faking her dad. I have only one concern is that? Then the eccentric kidnaps Pokemon Ash Mom to pretend to be a girl. I do not care if he's trying to make a girl happy, it's just ugly. <br /> <br /> There was no real plot. She was just a whiny brat who like things their own way. She played with Unowns, was the "daughter" Entei and, apparently, can increase and decrease in the age of on a whim, with the help of his "father". <br /> <br /> That's pretty much all I can remember, but I think you can take it as a hint, and did not see it. (Or, if you see him, do not expect much.) 1 of 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want Pokemon movie rental "Pokemon, the first film."
