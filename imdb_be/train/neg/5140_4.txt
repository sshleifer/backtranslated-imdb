Demer Daves, outstanding director, when it comes to Westerns and "Broken Arrow" remains mind.As all as romance is concerned, it should leave this knowledge to people like Vincente Minnelli, George Cukor or Douglas Sirk fabulous. The script is so predictable that you will not be surprised when when viewing such tepid character weepie.Natalie Wood was inspired by the "imitation of life" Fannie Hurst (see Stahl and Sirk), but who would believe that she was black? daughter of the man anyway Susan Connery had more confidence in the "imitation of life") and Sinatra and Curtis is shown as part of the stereotype that they can not do anything with them: the poor officer, and rich beautiful and standard sergeant.Guess who will fall in love with Natalie ? France shows how the land of tolerance, where interracial unions heat welcome.At time (around 1944) it was questionable, it still is for minded people you can find here and elsewhere,
