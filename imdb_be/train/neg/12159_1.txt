I can not believe I actually watched it, but I guess I just wanted to know if this movie will get unintentionally funnier and funnier to end. and he did. the climax was the worst result ever given to a lawyer - this is real life, even for a fictional story that was too weird. does anyone on this planet can not behave in front of the court, as she did. and probably the worst prosecutor on the ground. Why, in any case, he was in court? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty. a simple search of his house would have led to the discovery of the rings. but no go. he preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during the trial - it was. blonde fool got the truth-drug, to prove his innocent, but Brett. Brett almost lunatic was an altar in their home who could have proved his sick obsession. But again, do not go. during the trial stage, I felt a tacit desire to take the island from her hands and bang it several times against her head. even real freaks do not look that stupid fake "I'm innocent," as she did. and that makes this film tells us? never marry a woman with life insurance as soon as it falls down the stairs, her husband would be thrown in jail, guilty or not. evil, evil people.
