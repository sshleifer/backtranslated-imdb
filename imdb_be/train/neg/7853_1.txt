No story, shitty action, gore and senseless .... <br /> <br /> It does not have to be a horror film? There's no fear, or uncertainty, just BOOM BANG GORE, is done. Some curious Marines in the desert a strange, bad reason, and they get hunted down those mutated animals from the first film, which was nice, and had to stay on it. <br /> <br /> It's just one more reason for the money, and the use of senseless violence, as well as the "Saw" sequels. They know that no matter how pointless story is, and the more gore they can add, people will see it. I miss the good horror anxiety. Let's Hollywood, you can do much better.
