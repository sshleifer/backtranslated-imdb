I loved this film, I admit it. This must be the best (right?) Video movie that I have seen. Well ... me and my friend decided just to damn n giggles that we would make this film. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, and many others. If this red neck gets slammed against a tree on the Sasquatch, we literally watched that part of the three or four times, it was surprisingly (hysterical, of course). And why? About why the main character must roll that much? How to be honest, we know that you are in danger, rolling, that much does not help all that much. But in fact, if the movie you are a local video store RENT IT. It costs money, and it's not even as bad as a bad thing, but not incredibly bad. In general, the country will be full in store for you if you shoot this film.
