I can enjoy the schadenfreude vigilante flick, but it's just bad. And it's not bad as you might enjoy seeing MST3K make fun of him. It's just sickening bad as you can not find something to enjoy about it no matter how hard you try. I'm really sorry to spend 2:00 valuable life is shit. You can tell by watching him that no one had asked to act, and everything in it knew that this film will only dig in their careers. Apparently «Walking Tall» gathered sufficient income that someone decided that they could make a buck on their investment. If this is not the worst film I've seen it so bad that he washed the worst films of my memory.
