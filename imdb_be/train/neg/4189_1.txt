I had a clear misfortune overtakes two in 2004 in the worst films back-to-back in the morning, first, incoherent CGI-driven vacuum Chronicles of Riddick, and then, defective vanity project known as Greendale. The cost of one multimillions fines and other costs, but they are both bad. In fact, really bad. <br /> <br /> Ahead I must state that I am not the world's biggest Neil Young fan, but he has made his share of classic tunes from Buffalo Springfield (whose best record was young compositions) in Rust Never Sleeps, harvest and mirror ball, man wrote some really great songs. Unfortunately, there are no good songs in Greendale and precious few good, and the film around which they built really cringeworthy and simplistic political slogans. Completely without merit as art and unimpressive in controversy, Greendale best left forgotten. Buy the book, if you are forced to contribute to the bank account of Yang.
