It is time to move into their dream home, not knowing that she and her neighbors were built on land formerly used as a cemetery. The film is said to have been based on a true story, but how much it must be true, is not disclosed. The plot is not unique - see Spielberg's "Poltergeist" (1982). Within a short time, they feel different supernatural phenomena: they range from indignant - the mysterious shadows, a serious disease of his daughter - a frankly ridiculous - toilet continually flushing and garage doors are getting out of control. There is little depth of history: when he became established that the land was used as a cemetery, we have nothing more to learn. The plot does not seem to develop. Characters are not particularly well drawn, or any way memorable or special atmosphere. The film may be disturbing to some viewers. There's no sense of catharsis, or any kind of a positive message from him.
