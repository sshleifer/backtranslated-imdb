This film is a terrible distortion of lies and exaggerations, which were put together the most shameless lunatics ever work for a television movie. History is not so full of lies. There's nothing in this film that accurately reflects Senator McCarthy. It's just a terrible scam, and it surprises me that anyone connected with this production ever got another job in this area. The Marxist-Leninists, who wrote this garbage made it to attack the man who was acquitted by history and the fear that someone dared to destroy communism. Unfortunately, these communist nut jobs, Ronald Reagan picked up where McCarthy stopped, and they could not stop it, so the end of the Soviet Union and his cohorts. <br /> <br /> Never, never watch this movie if you are looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read the book of Ann Coulter's "Treason" for a better view of the truth about Senator McCarthy <br /> <br /> It will also help if you read about what really happened with Senator McCarthy, reading HTTP: // WWW. . thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
