I just finished watching Going Overboard. I must say that we have to send each copy of the film in Iraq and get them to watch. I even tried to blind woman to look at it, and she turned it in 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? With regard to the letter, what you want to call it, the perpetrators should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell !! I think that somewhere I read that the film's budget was $ 10,000, and they were under way. Wallmart possibly get a good deal on this? Each store has a big huge bunker that shit sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this film, you can use the DVD as a coaster, or exchange it for another, but then they might not be your member !!
