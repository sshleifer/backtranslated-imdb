Standard "paint-by numbers" monster fare, filled with a bunch of the usual plot devices from the large creatures movies. It's like someone had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies recorded on them, which are mixed and treated. Regardless of the storylines and characters have come to the agreement he was then dropped into the script. <br /> <br /> The characters are so clich√©-ridden, you can play a game of "Guess who ends up as a meal monster" after less than ten minutes into the film, and possibly get each of right- - including the order that they will be devoured. Many of the characters are so unpleasant that you root for the creatures to close them. Some of the main characters: a clone of Billy Idol, who is traveling with the sharks and loudmouth kid who breaks bankroll guy Captain Ahab vendetta, and a friend of Ahab, which makes raunchy dancing in a bar .. Oh, and a big, big animal needs anger management therapy. <br /> <br /> Along the way, many people argue, pretty girls running around with wet t-shirt, a pair of do on exotic beaches, explosions occur, the ruins of the temple there, and tallow face Pirates fall. <br /> <br /> A fun, for the most part, but one thing bothers me: the characters of callousness when other people were killed. After one violent death, they make one-liner joke. I could almost hear the rim shots. <br /> <br /> In general, well, if you have 90 minutes to spend, and you want to laugh so bad-is-good movie. Otherwise, you can skip this.
