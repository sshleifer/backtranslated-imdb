Zu Warriors most definitely should have been animated series, because the film is like watching an old anime acid.The film only starts from nowhere and people just do not fight to fly with metal wings and other blunt weapons to this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something .Whether this princess god or angel, is beyond me, but fast enough this summer wind the bad guy comes and kills her, and the guy with razor wings fighting some other mystical God / Demon / master of things .The storyline either does not exist or is very difficult rytrymlivatstsa you need to be incredibly intelligent to get this site will soon be showing the film this Chinese mortal, which is designed to this god to fight against evil fly, princess kills the bad guy, and soon we have a very bad set Uwe Boll as the fight scene supplied with terrible martial arts on the mountain or something.Even visual strange some might say that they are stunning and colorful, but I will say that they are washed and acid trip like (yes it's a word!). I watched it as a duplicate and with subtitles, and both were equally bad and difficult to understand .... who am I kidding, I do not understand all.It felt like I was watching an episode of 30 of some of the 1980s anime and completely missed how story began or how I started to read a comic series with 5 number 4, because I had no idea how it started, where it is going and how it will end, I had lost all the time.I I can honestly say that this was one of the worst event film ever it was like watching Inu-Yasha in episode 134 drunk ... yeah, that's right, you do not know what kind of Fever occurs on.Don't spend your brain trying to figure it out.
