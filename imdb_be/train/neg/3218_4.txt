I found this film to be an interesting study in a causal relationship, but little more than that. The main plot follows the lives of a handful of people and their actions (intentional or otherwise) affect the lives of others. The premise of the film is very promising, but I feel that they are unable to fulfill their promises. Too much time is spent tells the audience about chaos theory and too little time to actually show it. As a result, I never got a true feel for any of the characters, and never made a good connection with them emotionally. By the end of the film, I had a "So what" attitude about all of them. Stronger development direction of the character would have made this film great, but it's worth it just so-so
