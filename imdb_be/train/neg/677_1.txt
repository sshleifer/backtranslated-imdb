I shudder to think what people should think, environmentalist after watching this piece of powerful, enlightening cinematic garbage. Crammed with enough Indo-wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery save New Age store, the Starlight does someone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather-wearing crystal caresses idiot. <br /> <br /> The plot? Alien Rey Don Chong came to lead underwear model flute game in a mystical quest to prevent an impending environmental collapse of the Earth. But first they must defeat the evil alien who does not look anything like a refugee from Castro Street bar. Fortunately, they have a mystical grandfather Willie Nelson together to help (which looks a little perplexed affairs, as well as it should be), along with buckets of cheap F / X and packs aimlessly swelling music. <br /> <br /> Of course, a clumsy script helps to hide the film banal plot, and a staggering pace, but this is just the tip of the melting iceberg film. Everyone is concerned about this film should have their union cards revoked until they finish the real exchange rate of environmental science.
