There are a few preliminary comments here who believe the richness of this flick cliches in all - and I totally agree, both in terms of the characters and the dialogue <br /> <br /> I read about Elizabeth Berkley awful. performance in the same terrible «Showgirls», which I have never seen - and her work here, while not terrible, just a standard fare worse than a lifetime. There was no hint of the depth of her character, but then it probably should not be. If so, it would have made the film completely out of balance, because I was not a hint of depth or charisma - should not - in any one sign, artist, or drawing <br /> <br />. handling the initial application of the principal Liz after her tutee kissed her in the room was ridiculous. The initial reaction of her husband and councils were also (Forrest Gump, Jenny one striker in their car provides a more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, he was mentally call). <br /> <br /> smarmy, unctuous lawyer (forgive the redundancy) father lay student actually performed it probably praiseworthy in his performance: he was both funny and totally annoying at the same time, no mean feat.

This script performance in history was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. It was something to achieve, as the transition from the «F» to «F-minus." <br /> <br /> All of this limping situation should be solved - in real life - for about 15 minutes, after a realistic meeting between the teacher and the school administration, and her husband involved. But then, that would exclude the following contrived drama, and left empty film Chaska in the chamber. <br /> <br /> But the author (s) here, were on their end, they could do worse. If the situation was finally "agreed" and "correct", it was made only about 45 seconds, without specifying what action would be forthcoming in any "real world" context for the offender and his or her parents, or they might be able to find a path to redemption <br /> <br /> this one is 2 * presentation. second "*", because he has some soft "fun."
