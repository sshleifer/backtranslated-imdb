Alas, but aside from Kim Basinger does a good job acting scared, it was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in awhile. The logic thrown in 4 young men terrorize the woman outside a crowded shopping mall, then shoot the guard. However, no one seems to have noticed. Then, instead of screaming for help and rushes back to the mall, she leaves and ends in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit. I can not even describe how stupid he sees this woman is running away from 4 late thugs, carrying a red set of tools, crying for God to come help her, and then have sex with one of them after brutally killing others. Please believe me, this is bad and a bit tasteless as well.
