This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead. He first uses it to his brother when he was shot in the disk. His brother then infects other gang members.In some scenes perceived zombies walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast, which makes no sense. Acting mediocre, but the story does not help the film. The composition consists of the blood on the face of a zombie. The budget of this film, I'm sure, I was very limited. I believe that the film could have done better if the story was more original and with the best budget. If you wan't, to see a good zombie flick do not see it.
