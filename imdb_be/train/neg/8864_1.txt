After watching this, I lost a bit of respect for Christopher Lee (This took place over time). This movie was a complete waste. First, they tried to recreate the ending of the first "Oh" with incredibly bad makeup. They then try to turn it into a sad excuse for a werewolf porn! The plot sucks, and the whole film is just awful !!!! Brother werewolf victim from the first film (From the look of it, he had to be Dee Wallace Stone) teams up with Lee and another woman to destroy a group of werewolves, lead by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked all the time. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth renting (If you do not want to waste your time and money watching nudity.). Try to catch it on cable instead. It would be so indented, it may actually make sense.
