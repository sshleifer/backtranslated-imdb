I read somewhere that if Kay Francis refused to take a pay cut, Warner Bros. retaliated by casting it into the lower part of the projects for the remainder of his contract. <br /> <br /> She decided to take the money. But her career has suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> This may explain what it does in the "Comet Over Broadway." (Although this does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter in it, too.) "absurd" is the word that others have used to plot this film, and it's right on target. The murder trial. its seedy vaudeville career. its success in London. her final scene with her daughter. No part logically leads to the next part. <br /> <br /> in addition, sets and costumes looked like a B-movie material. and her hair! Turner shows lots and lots of her films this month. See any and shi, and you'll be doing yourself a favor.
