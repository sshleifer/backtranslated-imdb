Listen, I'm sorry, if half of the world to take offense at it, but life is complicated enough. I do not need to see it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, a great time. I even watched the fracture, and I knew it would be steaming pile of Quentin. But it's not a very good shot, and that's not daring - even if it is pretentious. Well-received films have a reason for the decline and rapid changes, it is not, "Oh, but this is the real interpretation of" justification. It thing'll make your head hurt. This is the fastest movie ever take you nowhere at all. I still love the Arts, and I will always give him another chance, but if you are not from time to look bad ideas on the screen, skip it.
