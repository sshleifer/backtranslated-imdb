Well, let me start by saying how totally HILARIOUS this film, I just could not help laughing at the stupidity of it. Do not get me wrong, it is a well acted especially Bassinger but the script is just, well, truly boggles the mind. <br /> <br /> The room is good and up to the Della actually witnessed the murder of his participation, but after that it just comes down. Half way through the movie the main character pulls out its tool kit and, of course, instead of throwing it on the guy's head, she decides to pull out the screwdriver, jack and finally flash (both during the sinking ship), respectively, to kill their victims. <br /> <br /> Then there's the final conclusion, I promise you, if he does not have you in stitches, then I'll eat my own left leg. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who just wants to laugh at some old-fashioned, horrible movie. Can I suggest you keep an eye on the scene in the scrap yard with a guy falling from one foot high plank of wood, it gets me every time.
