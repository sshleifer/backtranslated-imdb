One of the cornerstones of a low-budget movie takes a well-known, a classic story and making a complete bastardization of it. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. Writer takes a steady Phantom of the opera story line and moves it to the end of the 80th shopping center. However, the goal of "Phantom" is now simply to avenge those responsible for disfiguring his face and the murder of his family. Special effects give a good laugh, especially when parts of the body start to appear in the dishes of yogurt stand. Pauly Shore has a small role, which does not allow it to be completely unpleasant, as might be expected, mainly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of fame MTV had not yet arrived. If you are looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew, check this movie out. Otherwise, keep looking for something else.
