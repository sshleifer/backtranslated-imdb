bad film. Nothing special - just a "child" is a film without serious things in it. There is at least one reason to see this on: talking animals. Some of them are so funny, they say, you just can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear the dog in the dog pound to say: "I am Kaiser Soze", or other animal to say "You're dead cat walking", many other great liners, see it. Because there is no other good film to watch it. Vote: 4 of 10.
