I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 pounds and a house, M.D .. character Tucci is brilliant, but socially inept with choices like the character of Laurie House, but without the caustic wit that Laurie brings into the house. At the same time, Tucci "straight guy", underlined Dr. Shigeru, Sun grew into a more interesting character, Cuddy and Wilson fallibility "straight guys. Warmia character in Adrienne Holland too similar to Jennifer Morrison, Dr. Cameron be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Someone the CBS, apparently noticed the success of House, MD and told his staff to get him (her) and seems to show, in the hope that mimicry is successful. However, copying the show as a house requires the same high level of balance of wit and suspense and Tucci and companies simply do not cope with this task. <br /> <br /> I did not know that the show was canceled, until I read the comments on IMDb, but it was not a surprise to me.
