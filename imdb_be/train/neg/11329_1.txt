Elizabeth Taylor could never act at all, and it was only her usual annoying talentless herself in this film. That was before she got so thick, but it still looked very short and squat. Rock Hudson was in order as BIC Benedict, but clearly an actor with a wide range, like William Holden would have been better. James Dean, of course, proved that he knew how to stammer his way through the movie. The entire film is incredibly slow and takes too long. The actors were too young and light, and none of them are between the ages convincingly due to bad makeup. Hudson kinds of funny just being laid, and Dean and Carroll Baker were clearly the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
