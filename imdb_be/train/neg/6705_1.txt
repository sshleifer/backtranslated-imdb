This film is just a shame. Orlando, Florida, seems to have become more well-known film production (as lifting Vancouver to prominance). The brothers were shot in Central Florida, and this short film a little bad for the area (which made great strides with the film Walking Indy across Africa and the big HBO miniseries from the Earth to the Moon). <br /> <br /> I'll try to be honest, as much as possible. I think that Orlando was the perfect place for the film Brothers. It had the potential to give a new twist on the craze in the "boy band". In the end, like N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area. But, brothers hold, probably due to a weak script. Both main characters are flat, almost without development (some of this may be amateur actors, but some of them are, of course, the way the script was written). <br /> <br /> Also, the problem is the choice of jokes. Many jokes are repeated too (they come off funny the first time, but it does not grow to be a bit boring). Some of the scenes of "concert" are bad (and many of these scenes also do not seem to move the story forward in any case). <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately, his efforts frustrated. I also hope that it is better for the upcoming features on the basis of this short. But I think what is best for director John Figg to go to different genres (coming soon). Comedy is not his strong point. But it certain that he is certainly one of the most prominant filmmakers in Orlando (its just a shame that at the moment he is sad, is not known). <br /> <br />
