Listen to some of the interesting things our fighting hero doctor Pat, his son Gordon (TV ministry, it seems like a family business.) And Terry Miuusen (Won Miss America in 1973 wearing a swimsuit and showing her legs. Oh, my God Merciful) say, when our poor viewers sick and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. One of the "right tooth abscess" only now been healed.2. Some of the "twisted intestines" was healed.3.Then Terry said that people with "state of the country" (Do you know God does not mind?) The burning sensation in the legs, which has just been healed.4. Then Gordon said that there is a man (That narrows it down!) With swelling of the sinuses in his right cheek, with great pain over the right eye, but he now healed.5.Someone with problematic right hip, limited mobility of a stroke, can now walk. 6. Terry said that he had seen someone with severe to severe stiffness in the bones of the neck, but did not know the exact disease (God does not know?) - that man is now healed. 7. Someone paralyzed on the right side, in particular, (Not really!) The right side of his face were now healed.8. Man (That narrows the world's population again.) On the plate in his skull, which has constant problems, and doctors simply do not know what to do. Terry said that the bones reforming seen around the plate (funny bone ?!) And the pain is gone Mans, now he is healed. <br /> <br /> Hers, as our hero Pat war helps our sick and poor people. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas, but it narrows it down.), Who has a sinus Mr dries it now the glory of Jesus. 2. There is one person with the financial need- I think of thousands of dollars. (I think that their god has to go to school or something!) This need is met met right now, and within three days, the money will be delivered through the miraculous power of the Holy spirit.Thank you Jesus. 3.There is a woman in Cincinnati with lymph node cancer. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it even diagnosis (Ask vengeful god Pat!), but you do not feel well, and Mr. dissolves the cancer right now! (What?) 4. There is a lady in Saskatoon (I think, Canada.) In a wheelchair, curvature of the spine, Mr. rectified that our right now, and you can get up and go! (If this condition is ignored, Pat!) Just claim it and it's yours. Thank you Jesus! Amen, amen! <br /> <br /> If Pat Robertson had prostate cancer, he got to Peter Popoff?, Oral Roberts ?, Benny Hinn ?, Terry or Gordon? Nope! In February 17.2003 Pat went to a real doctor, to his operation! (You mean, he does not trust his faith healing friends, Terry and his own son, Gordon?!) <br /> <br /> If LT Pat Robertson was in the Marine Corps during the Korean War, he was an officer in the liquor, responsible for maintaining employees who come with meadow. He was known to drink himself and often prostitutes, and he was afraid that he contacted gonorrhea. (If asked a doctor for help!) <br /> <br /> The reason Pat went out of the fight because his dad Absalom Willis Robertson (D Va from 1946-66) was the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Military. <br /> <br /> terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, we presented themselves invulnerable and were swallowed up in the pursuit of health, wealth (Pats values ​​between 150 and 200 million people!) material pleasures (mansion in Virginia beach Virginia Helicopter springboard !) and sexuality (he had sex with his future wife before marriage that they had a son!). It (terrorism) is because God is raising up his defense against us. (Statement issued September 13, 2001) Pat Robertson reminds me Bürgermeister Santa Claus is coming to town and his evil vengeful god reminds me of Wenger in the Dungeons and Dragons. <br /> <br /> Spoiled brother Gordon does what dad tells him Pat and Terry paid and the woman who no minds of their own! <br /> <br /> This will really grab you! September 5, 2005 edition of The 700 Club included the Christian Broadcasting Network report correspondent Harry Lane because of the New Orleans Convention Center, which is placed in the main victims of the poor black distress throughout the weekend. "A number of things left to offer the minds of some of the evacuees," Lane said, "they include in the bait cup with saying" Let the curse with you. "A shot of a plastic cup souvenir cups from one of the countless trinkets shops in New Orleans appeared on the screen." In addition, a music CD with the name of Guerrilla Warfare and Bandits «R» Us. "Lane said, pointing to a heap or rap CDs scattered on the ground. (His fanatical dad taught Pat racism Absalom well!) <br /> <br /> If any of you good people ever think about donating it sexist bigoted people, please, for God's sake do not! Sponsor a softball or basketball team, to the food shelf, be an older brother or sister with a child, but please do not give these people because they have been around for over 40 years, and did not solve anything. <br /> <br /> If you still do not believe that I'm like Pat Robertson overheard during a commercial break on the Internet, and then click search, and if you hear what he's really like, I know for sure that you will not give each Conning cent of the liars! And by the way, Terry once a divorce and Pat spoke against divorce many times on his show. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say hello to people in Dover Pennsylvania, Orlando, Florida, and the good people who got hit by Hurricane Katrina, and I hope its a nice day. Operation Blessing has been helpful to New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Please let our readers know! I'm doing! By the way people, if your sick, go to a real doctor and lets all laugh at these liars and ever Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry can go somewhere else and take their angry god Venger with them!
