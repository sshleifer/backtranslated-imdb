I would like to see is one of my favorite television shows.I saw Universal trademark stands with the new sign and the name of the theme song, which still seems me.Computer animation on some scenery as a solid header name «Jetsons» or views measurements from the spacecraft approaching amusement park and many other things made this version a great fantastic.Shortly and then to the end ... I could not believe it !!!! How lucky I was that I could forget what I had seen.Just song Tiffany and his theme song in the new arrangement was in my head.Anyway, I would like to see this space-age families (as The Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in all graphic computer design as Toy Story or Bug life.The best style for Hanna-Barbera-x in my opinion.
