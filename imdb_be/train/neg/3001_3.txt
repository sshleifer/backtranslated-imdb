Slaughter High tale of vengeance on the nerd man who was the victim of one of the most attractive and most cold joke in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, after a promising opening Flick went straight to hell. It is very difficult and excessive mess with mediocre slashings and the final half-hour, that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness. The guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the film was released. If you want to rent a flick to stop it after a prank, and remember to choose life.
