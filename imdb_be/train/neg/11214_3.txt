I also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago. Firstly, I want to say that it looks cool. Cassella incredibly talented filmmaker and fantastic. I just want the film to be as good as it looks. I would not call this a horror movie. Putting a few shots disintegrates ghost does not make it a horror film. There is no mystery, there is no stress, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It is a drama. You know what happens the entire film on both sides. The action was good, I think, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the slogan "Revenge can be fatal" .... really? ... They need to check how many hundreds of horror / thriller films have that exact same slogan? <br /> <br /> It pains me to say a few, but I know a lot of people who worked on this film, and I know that they do not want people to blow smoke up my ass, so I give my honest opinion.
