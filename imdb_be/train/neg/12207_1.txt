I remember, I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, was a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo on it. So I was very excited when I got to buy this movie is really cheap. I put it in the VCR and put: Man this movie is very bad! Sylvester Stallone says as a 3 word in the entire film (for this terrible sentimental speech at the end, with the exception), and has the same expression on his face, all the way. And it is foolish love that's in the middle, it's just so amazingly predictable. I just end up fast forwarding of all things, and went to exchange the film something else.
