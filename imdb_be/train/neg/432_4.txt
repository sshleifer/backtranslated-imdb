This film had the potential to be much more than it was. But it is not only fails to deliver, it brings up a sickening samoopravdatsya preaching at the same time. <br /> <br /> John Cusack even flatter than it was at midnight in the garden of good and evil. The difference is that this time it should have a Southern accent, which he visibly lost several times for each scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino makes his feature, but it seems to be going through this film and collecting salaries. It is good as usual, but hardly outstanding <br /> <br /> Support for actors. - throw in the women's romantic interest, who added little if anything to the story. Speaking of stories, tangled "who really cares," a fairy tale, where Cusack is complacent Mayor boy who just needs to look for the "right thing" to do. <br /> <br /> People do not work here. Cusack character loses credibility by the end of which is not revealing it is preaching and sick. The final scene makes the penultimate nonsense seem deep. It is also quite inaccurate, but I will not go into law. <br /> <br /> it's bad in the movie room. It is interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it really instructive, proselytizing, smug film for the last hour. Better with mindless shit than this pile of garbage.
