Nicole Eggert was listed as a star, despite the Micheal Dorn and Stacy Keach to be a much bigger star than her. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a little spin on the "foreign land in the world" movie. Eggert plays a girl who feels sorry for Alien chased by the military and takes essentially run away from her very sexy disguise. A little bit of nudity or partial nudity, mindless sex scene all the features along the way. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles a few obvious Set-pieces and running jokes about showing photos. I really liked Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was adopted and it was really cool death scene. <br /> <br /> It was quite obvious that Stacy Keach was about to be taken, and the film was rather weak ending, it would be good to show what kind of talent Aliens transferred Eggert.
