The next day finally came for me to watch the veneration of fate Azumi as a murderer, fruiting her character, and ultimately attempt to draw me deeper into the world, she rampaged so mercilessly the first saga. <br /> <br /> This is how poetic, how will I receive when it comes to Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I crouched over the heavy sentimentality of the House of Flying Daggers and complained of trust Ue Aya drawing blood managed Assassins, after watching Azogo 2 I began to appreciate the previously mentioned drawbacks, more than ever before. <br /> <br /> Not only is the definition of each killer feels sluggish and dull, but many important elements are omitted from the whole experience. In Azuh 1, we saw that the killer used different tactics stealth (their number one priority), as well as logic, to make light work of their brands with fast executions and faster ability to escape. But I will not hold that against this movie too much, as the story of a little altered in this time, and a lot of obstacles planted in Azogo way to prevent her from entering a military commander and a reflection of any signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is mindlessly frozen for most of the film and basically played a toned-down version of Go Go, minus the cool weapons and a sense of danger. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final blow, which is an act in the title simply disguised as "death" side of the epic. In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising opponents with flashy appearance and even brighten weapons. To the surprise of no one, they meet their end, one way or another, but the film does not hold, if each of them start dying very quickly and easily. In Azuh 1, young killers were basically overpower the opposition with the fast, but few meet the battles and the final confrontation between Azuma and Bijomaru compared to fighting in Azuh 2 at least, and should have finished. Some interesting effects have been introduced, but they could not reach an innovation due to the short duration of each meeting. I am in no way knocking the usual style of the samurai films with their fast and realistic battles, but the characters in both movies Azumi were so imaginative and straight from the anime that the rules can be broken and action needs to be further enriched. <, Br /> <br /> romance side Azogo have to fill the time between a fight and, unfortunately, in the end, it serves no purpose, neither provides much-needed resolution. <br /> <br /> As a fan with an open mind for a wide variety of films and animation, I will not lie, and I admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness to the first film Azumi, but I step to the right and say that after watching Azuh 2, the original was looks like a flawless masterpiece. For what it's worth, Azumi 2: Death or Love could have gone straight to video, with its invisible richer budget and unfortunate potential to add or expand on a bumpy path desperate killers, making every effort to restore peace, with unshakable courage, to die trying.
