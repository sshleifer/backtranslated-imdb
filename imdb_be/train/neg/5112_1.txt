Awwww .... yes, it is a touching and all, that some lucky family gets adopted ABC / Sears and has its home "refurbished." That's where the humanist call ends. I liked it at the beginning of its run, but now the show was disgusting excessive. <br /> <br /> Ten low-income families may be data on luxury homes with lots of goodies for each of the same family, each episode of the show splurges on, people in the Habitat for Humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief. For example, it is necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a jacuzzi in the bedroom, or bed-cheat with «Low Rider» hydraulics? There really needs her mom dilapidated, defaulting and rusted out old pickup restored and "pimped" one of the best modifiers in California? The new one would have done a pretty good job, and probably a third of the price. There are people who really need sixty-five inch plasma screen in each room of the house? And then there is the question of who pays higher property taxes and utility bills. Even after zaniacs on «Makeover» to leave, someone still earns his living. I doubt that the friendly people down in the social services will see the humor in all this. Generosity <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for ABC, and tacit commercial for his sponsor.
