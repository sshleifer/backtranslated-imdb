I saw this movie a few years ago on the BBC I sat through it. How? I do not know what is the way out there in the "so bad it'GoodÂ» charts Kidman, by Baldwin, and Pullman should twists, when they see that now.I think Woody Allen would have worked a miracle with an amazing story, and Baldwin's part can be played enthusiastically Leslie Nelson.it was again today I tried to look at it again, but life is too short. A few minutes later I looked were beautiful Nicole, she was so hot about 93, Baldwin was ever made a good movie? Pullman made his stock in trade "is good, but the blackout" nature of the F-word out of his mouth when a lady from the "Fraser" ed as miscast detective accuses him of murder sounds so wrong. stay away.
