Joe Don Baker is good for a good actor in small roles here and there ... it was well Gogol and made a pretty good Villan Bond in The Living Daylights, and has appeared in various other films. One thing he can not do is to carry a film like lead, which he is in a very bad place set in Malta. partner Joe Don killed so he kills the murderer's brother and carry out the murderer in Italy, but some guys make the plane landed in Malta and the killer leaves. The rest of the film sees Joe Don pursue the killer here and there, Joe Don receive enclosed in a different time, Joe Don torment bartendar and interrupted, and so on. The film is very bad, and you do not end up just pulling the character Joe Don. You'll be amazed how many times Joe Don hero gets taken out by one stroke and how incompetent he is. Wreath of the film occurs when Joe Don chases the assassin across Malta with the killer in priest robe, and then they get into the boat, and he chases them across Malta. This film also has one of the worst closing lines to the end of the film ever.
