Many of the main characters in the 1969 film by Hideo Gosha "hitokiri" (murderer aka "Tenchu" - heaven punishment) were real historical figures (in the format of "Western" name-ordering): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hampeita Takechi, Shimbei Tanaka, Izo Okada , ____ Anenokoji. The name "hitokiri," a historical term, refers to a group of four super-swordsmen, who carried out numerous killings of key figures in the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate in the mid-1800s on the orders of Takechi "loyalists" leader (ie, an ultra-nationalist, the Emperor ) fraction Tosa. What is the fight about? It is sad to say that you will not find in this movie. «Brilliant History Lesson" really! <br /> <br /> No, gosh much more interested in showing you the usual bloody slicing and dicing, and (for a ridiculous length) internal suffering is not very-bright assassin Izo Okada than revealing the true history. Sakamoto, for example, some historical significance, is considered the father of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Nearest Ghosh comes to providing a history lesson is a scene in which Sakamoto, whose Takechi considers a traitor case Loyalists comes Takechi mansion to try to shake his ideological. He starts to talk about the international political situation, with foreign warships in Japanese ports, and Japan, which is too weak militarily to defend against them. Want to know more? Sorry. Gosh cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in the middle of a sentence (!). So much to inform its audience about the turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> The film left me at a loss with respect to the objectives of both sides in this fight. For two and a half centuries, the shogunate that belong to the central government in Japan, it was an institute dedicated to the prevention of social change, to preserve feudal relations of society. He was afraid of external contamination, both ideological and technological. In accordance with this spirit, it is the law of firearms, these instruments of "leveling" in Europe and America, to which the farmer would have stood up to the samurai. During this period, the Emperor was no more than a spiritual figurehead <br /> <br /> But in the cities, which stood in the neutral zone between the feudal fiefdoms, a new class of merchants, landowners and craftsmen developed. - - the class known in Europe by its French name, the bourgeoisie. Inevitably, as a new class gained strength, he chafed against the many frontiers of feudal society. As in Europe, the king (emperor) became a central figure in the struggle against the bourgeoisie for power against the feudal aristocracy. But political leaders are not always fully understand the class interests it serves. If the outside world has arrived with a bang in 1853, a US patent Admiral Perry's "black ships" of Japan's ruling elite has been thrown into crisis. Their military was no match for these foreigners. In addition, they had heard about the destruction of the British and French imperialists were sown in China. What Japan should do to save themselves from the fate of his poor neighbor? Surprisingly, some elements within the normally isolationist Shogunate were inclined to open up trade with foreigners, to get some of their advanced technology. This point of view is represented by the (slightly) in Sakamoto film. On the other hand, the emperor-loyal to the ultra-nationalists, represented Takechi, felt that they could not let an alien force, unless they would interfere with the other faction of the "country of sale." (Sound familiar?) So, the murder of the key figures of the shogunate in order - and away we go <br /> <br /> The motives Takechi been for me the biggest puzzle of the film .. Ghosh says that he is fighting primarily for his personal development and not for the Loyalist cause. Can we take it to submit tenor loyalists in general? (Do you care?) <br /> <br /> Some reviewers have compared this film compares favorably with «Goyokin», which Ghosh made in the same year. But where «Goyokin» is a crackling, suspenseful yarn adventure with a hero, worthy of sympathy, "hitokiri" is perseverance, not so convincing and lacking a hero. Sakamoto could be the hero of this film, but we have no right to know it - or what he stands for -. Good enough for him to reach this status <br /> <br /> Due to its fine points in the five previous Kurosawa films, Masaru Sato score here was very disappointing, it sounds like a reject from the series "Bonanza." <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
