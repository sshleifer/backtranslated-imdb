Really bad movie. While the special effects Rick Baker is very large (if your stomach turn), he has no other redeeming features. Like many 70th movies, it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower, and clean the mucus away. Uniformly unpleasant characters, and the plot does not make sense.
