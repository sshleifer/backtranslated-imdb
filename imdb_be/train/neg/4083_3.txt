I saw this film when it was released, and my aversion to it stuck with me all these years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> The purpose of Greenaway seems to take all the literary image in the Tempest and make it literally. If a character had to say, "My heart takes off," we would have shown an actual human heart, with pigeon wings, flapping across the screen. <br /> <br /> This process makes for some great pictures, but ultimately this is a superficial exercise. And it becomes deadly dull. <br /> <br /> I do not envy the satisfaction of other audiences find in this film, but it should be aware that not everyone in the audience were impressed.
