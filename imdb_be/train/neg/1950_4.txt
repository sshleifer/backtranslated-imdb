I grew up with Scooby (a kind of re-runs where you are) I hate patchwork, love Daphne, and feel it is not included with a whole gang. But it's boring, Scooby Doo is a mystery solving comedy is not bad at all JAP anime spy. I love the "What's New", they had to give a risk-prone Daphne makeup sometimes :( and try to lose * sex * drug jokes many generations, but it is "get a clue" flat out crap and should not be named Scooby attached. They even tried to make some lame punk thing with the theme song. Now I'm going to watch my DVD to Scooby doo, where are you to wash the dirt of this new series from my eyes
