I must warn you is that I'm a big romantic. So I really wanted to like this movie. So I write my thoughts in order to save all of you from the frustration I felt while watching it. Leap said the fate filled Leigh-Anne history, who falls in love uchtivoge Jeremy, and they commit to meet every leap year. Very romantic premise on the basis of a great novel, and with a cast that does not feel like you are watching another movie Jack Neo. Then why oh why is it so bad? Firstly, I believe that the filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video, because they decided to replace the speaking of stories and all real emotions with cheesy installation, predictable and clich√©d action lines. I was so upset and embarrassed that was one of the first few people in Singapore to see the leap years, but those of us in the movie would agree that our muffled moans at the crawl worthy performances speak volumes. My hope is to watch a romantic movie, which surpass all Fever, Singapore best romantic comedy so far, and leap years do not even come close. Some blogs have called it The Crap years, which is a harsh but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or your emotions, as I did. The film will force you to give up love forever.
