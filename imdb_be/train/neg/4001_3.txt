Having heard so much about the series of the 1990s, Cracker, without seeing any of them, I've been waiting for this look. Of course, a combination of Jimmy McGovern and Robbie Coltrane can not go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> debate relying frequent, repetitive and violent flashback, were overpowering. Production of trying to be a super-modern, but the flashing boxes and even a children's font annoyed. Robbie Coltrane was sleeping two hours, coming up with unexplained and are unlikely to "ideas", and the police are portrayed as one-dimensional clumsy idiots. As a result, the tension built up and never coming to the final stage (no details, fearing spoiler) was not ridiculously bad piece of TV drama, as I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> no, I do not want to see more of them, but I will come back to a DVD-series of the 1990s to see if they match their reputation.
