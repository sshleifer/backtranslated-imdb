Now, I'm not a film critic, but I really hated the "September 11th." This film was, on a common basis, a bad thing. With the exception of segment Gonzalez Inarritu, which is the most effective and direct about the subject, short films were at best boring and at worst offensive. Worst of all, in my opinion was a pretentious segment Youssef Chahine, in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers on US soldiers, even so far as suicide bombers fighting for the great cause. Segment was fully on and taking into account the apparent lack of Shahin any decency at all, a waste of my time and patience. The idea of ​​obtaining eleven different producers from different countries to make the film with their views on the tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was tasteless.
