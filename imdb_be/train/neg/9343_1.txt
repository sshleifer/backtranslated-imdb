How to start a review of the film, which will soon be recognized as `the worst film of all time" by `the worst director of all time? The film, which could develop a cult, because Eto'o is so bad it's good" <br /> <br / > analytical approach, criticizing the film seems like a meaningless part of the syndrome, and band-wagon - let's beat freely, without fear of a negative reaction because every person on earth does this, and the people who love film like for these shortcomings we cite. <br /> <br /> versatile poor quality of the film goes without saying-- «Sixteen years of alcohol 'are not without competition for the title of worst movie so it should sink low enough to get the title, and lay hold on him, but I think that this film could go the distance. IMDb does not allow enough words to cite all the films of failure, and it will be much easier to site elements of "Sixteen years of alcohol" doing the right thing. Unfortunately, these moments of glory so far buried in the shadow of this film poverty that this problem should not continue. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was getting into, I was warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this (sorry, that the proposal was a cup of vodka). Despite my low expectations, "Sixteen years of Alcohol 'could not make me happy even on a bad movie` mock' level. Not just bad, but bad and insulting as if Jobson deliberately trying to make this film a poetic yawn, but went to the mass murder of poetry and pushed down our throats, which makes it not deep, but it is ridiculous. .. and presumably Jobson genuinely trying to make a good movie? Even after watching "Sixteen years of alcohol" promotional literature, I do not believe in the sincerity of Jobson. Pointless and back to the end with a few grin / laugh moments (all, I'm not sure that anyone intentionally) seasoned film and the few elements prevented me from turning the DVD excluded. So bad it's good? No, it was quite simple: "I can not believe that these are serious moments of the movie," to keep me from turning it off, and nothing more. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch with a group of experts bad- cinema. Get your own running commentary going on. It would have significantly improved the experience for me. So bad, it's commentator Mike Myers in his Scottish accent cod on it, how it works to make the whole piece of mud in a comic farce «Ok dare man ma, give me annuder Gliss protective wiskey».
