... It is the worst movie I have ever seen. Hmm, well, it may be associated with The Boogeyman then. Awful, really awful. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations, and he was not able to meet them! I really can not think of one good thing. so here is the worst point of ... <br /> <br /> 1. 2. Acting plot 3. CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. Conspiracy 5. Dialogue and finally .. .. 6. story <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions, they did at 2:32 hour long film, you realize that they do not call Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together, and were forced to agree to After 3 minutes a little bit or they really think no one will notice that the protagonist and the villain less time on screen together than the son of Superman and protege he kills? !! <br /> <br /> There was a half of the budget is spent on the conviction of Kevin Spacey to do this? <br /> <br /> If Superman is sent to the hospital, why doctors do not ask, "What F *** you want us to do? He F *** ING alien! we do not know jack about his anatomy! "? <br /> <br /> What happened in 5 years Superman has been away to bring technology to promote 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where are the people who have written good reviews are watching the same movie? <br /> <br /> And, finally, why? Just why? <br /> <br /> By the way, for those of you wondering how Superman can lift the whole continent krypyonite, I think I figured it out ... <br /> <br /> ... because Superman does not depend on krypton as he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. Therefore, a continent that only it suppresses your own shiny green rock .... <br /> <br /> either that or the writers saggy jaw pivot pranksters who thought that it was pretty obvious mistake.
