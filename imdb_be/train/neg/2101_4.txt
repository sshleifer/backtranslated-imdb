Bernard Rapp died last year and was very cultural journalist. The movie was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a huge World Dictionary films), and so he was obliged to have the camera at least once in their life. But the films he left received warm reviews, "Tire à Part" (1996), despite the sensational performance by Terence Stamp was a caricature in the image of characters, "une Affaire De Gout" (2000) was a smooth affair, even if Bernard Giraudeau delivered perverse performance "In-Si Grave» (2003) was another let-down and "un Petit Jeu Sans consequence" as destroyed, as its predecessors. His comic potential is exploited in unconvincing fashion. <br /> <br /> And yet, since the idea can be predictive of the spit, the spiritual comedy. Couple held Attalia and Sandrine Kiberleyn, who invited their friends to fully move into lustful mansion. In order to play with his guests, they pretend to part with each other. And things do not go as planned, because the announcement of their separation does not surprise them. Two lovers begin to wonder about the legitimacy of their vapors. <br /> <br /> In spite of the gorgeous scenery and a promising material that he had before, unobtrusive direction RAPP can not manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well-worn pattern with characters that have a certain well-known functions and masks that are open about who they really are. Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. Poor editing fades a little more film with this silly habit of Rapp dramatically reduce the number of sequences. Even genuine input actors in SP is debatable. They seem to be boring and to read their texts than to live it, especially Sandrine Kiberleyn. The audience quickly caught in a deep daze <br /> <br /> It's sad to say :. Movies Bernard Rapp has never lived up to his intentions as "UN Petit Jeu without consequences" shows.
