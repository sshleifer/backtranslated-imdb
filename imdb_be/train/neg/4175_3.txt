I think Micheal Ironsides acting career to be over when he should act in this type of low-Budge shit. Of course, he could have done better than to waste their time on this rubbish. <br /> <br /> This film could have been much better if it was a good budget, but he repeatedly shows through out the movie. There is one scene in the outpost, which looks like it from the outside in front of the train station, and I bet it was. <br /> <br /> There is one scene of which give the film 3, and it shows the spacecraft landing and take-off over the lake, surrounded by woods. It was well done, but the rest of the movie, forget it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene that looks like a machine-building factory, I made a bet, and does not look like a space outpost that character says it. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, has a serious low budget, it makes no sense, and God Help Micheal Ironsides.
