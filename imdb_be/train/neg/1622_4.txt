One reason I remember is that it was revealed a week after Nigel Kneale`s brilliant Quatermass series is broadcast. Trailers have emphasized that the main character had a mutilated hand that was my hope he`d be Victor Caroon with Quatermass Experiment haunting the streets of London. <br /> <br /> No such luck, because the racing game is not just a pretty drab thriller with a trick to have a hero with disabilities, trying to get to the corrupt race studies. I believe that if you`re a supporter of Dick Francis, you might enjoy it, but to set it in the context of the late '70s, when SWEENEY just ended, and professionals still produced, there`s something lacking about racing games. One trailer shows the vehicle for taking on another engine, if it`d was a trailer for SWEENEY `d see Jack Regan for taking the car and beating a confession made who`d slag robbery while the professionals will have a car and took a blown terrorists inside. I think that sums up What`s wrong with this series
