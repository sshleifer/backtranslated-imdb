Well, I shot this film because the director ... he made some interesting flicks in the past (if you have not seen Waxork you are missing a fun ride). Anyway, I had my doubts about this film from the beginning, but I decided to suck it up and give it a look. This is bad. Too bad. If you have not seen the movie and do not mind spoilers, read on. First of all, the old saying "You can not judge a book by its cover" applies here. Crate Flick for this seems to show that Jill stone fox with long hair with highlights. The back of the box has a cool shot of red leather Jill and some other shots. Description makes you want to rent a movie, because it sounds good. You start watching it, and suddenly you find that the film takes place (for unknown reasons) in 1977. Jill total dog, which is not the girl on the cover. The film is not quite as predictable as you might think ... and it's not a good thing. Symbols do so many stupid things without a shred of motivation ... it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie, and Dolph other ladies sex for no reason. Furthermore, what is the point to have Dolph kill the other woman in cold blood, who helped him. Anthony Hickox director must have seen a bitch when he read the script. If it has been installed in the underground and the new Milennium made character halfway intelligent it might be worthy. In order to install it in the 70 makes no sense and has no relation to the story at all. Avoid this!
