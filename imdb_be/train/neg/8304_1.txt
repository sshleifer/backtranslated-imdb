"A Christmas Carol" is one of the all-time favorite movies many people. ACS was able to take the audience on a time and place in such a way that very few films ever. He had a sweetness and kindness to him, which is rare. <br /> <br /> So what I expected (and highly anticipated) he continued, "it runs in the family." The film was released almost a couple of times, only to be pulled in the last minute. When he finally came out, IRITF was (and I think) a complete failure. <br /> <br /> A lot of film and was just fine, but prescribes totally, totally missed. The film was nothing more than a formula for cash flow casting a lazy, lazy letters and disconnected actions. <br /> <br /> narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of the great comedians of America and storytellers, imposed upon us a false reprise warm wit he used in the ACS. He too emoted, and why he did it, I'll never know. He somehow managed to become irritable and overwrought parody of itself. <br /> <br /> In writing and acts IRITF is unreliable and forced. Actors may have seen the ACS, but no matter wit and nuance that has been in ACS shall not be registered at all on any of them. The action was a farce and strikingly devoid of any dry humor Shepard. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a treasure, but to call IRITF continuation is to insult all the fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
