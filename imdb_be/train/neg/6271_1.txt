There are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend. It simply defies description. Something about the computer that you can change your personal belongings silver beads, which are included in the victim's mouth, which kills them or turn them into zombies. All this is so precarious that it is incredible. There's also a girl with a personal computer in their room and the computer talks through the hands of a puppet !!!!!!!! I do not do this stuff. In addition, the computer controls things such as cars, despite the fact that there is nothing to connect the computer to the car. <br /> <br /> Â«film" a total waste. Surreal bad rubbish. Effectively, one of a kind of bad rubbish. There's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which is not very hot or erotic. There's even a scene where the woman seemed to want to make love to French kiss a tarantula, I was rolling on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst movies ever. At the top of equally squalid straight to home video pension or Boogeyman II (two NIGHTMARE WEEKEND Bugimna II, and there are scenes with deadly toothbrush!). At least, it is fun to watch and try to understand what is happening.
