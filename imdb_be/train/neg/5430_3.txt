Priyadarshan- whenever people heard his name, his first thought is "comedy". This is something that this person is known, or, rather, was known. Giving huge blockbuster comedies like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train derailed slowly with films like Chupke Chupke and several others whose names I can not remember right now. Now with terrible movies like Dhol, the first word that strikes our mind after hearing his name was be- "torture". <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mixture of bad, pointlessly toilet jokes, several AMD bad unknown and Idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol had one or two of the scenes that were funny but not witty, and secondly, for Kuhn Khem and hysterical grandmother except the acting was decent. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, I felt that Razhpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were on the top (if you compare them with others in the film), then Tusshar Kapoor, Tanushree and then in the last two idiots mentioned above. Dent in Kunaley Khem was that it was loud at his jokes and even his actions. Grandmother, at first, looked like a ghost, plus it's not funny and silly. <br /> <br /> The story was the same one seen. Four boys and girls behind the need of money, but with a few twists. There is a "bad" person who is hopelessly stupid and dumb. Finally, a good win over the bad and everything is fine. The idea of ​​having DHOL with a tone full of cash in it simply ingenious. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the film is its length. After an hour or so, you are exhausted and want to leave the theater. But being a critic, it is my duty to carry as much as two and a half hour movie. The film goes on and on, and the same jokes are repeated again and again, and the situation only perennial elsewhere. <br /> <br /> If your mother in law came into your house and start mocking you in everything, and then send it to the movie and having fun. 3 of 10.
