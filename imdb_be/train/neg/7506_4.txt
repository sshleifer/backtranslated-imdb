Good actors and good performances can not disguise the senseless script, bad dialogue, and model behavior that increases in anything you care about. The most interesting character Berkowitz. No character development - there is no growth, there is no interest, just some pain for no particular reason, does not teach us anything and not even bothering to please yourself.
