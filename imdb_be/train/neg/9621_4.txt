I'm dying to see it as soon as I saw the ridiculous meatballs poster and guess what it was supposed to be the best satire ever. What a great idea for a satire - a genre is booming. Unfortunately, the final product (as I think all involved are likely to understand) is a catalog of missed opportunities, it is not there and the performances (fortunately!) Some very funny, inspired bit. Janine Garafolo, which is very striking looks very bad here, probably because she was uncomfortable with all his strength to make your apartment funny role. David Hyde Pierce is just boring to watch, trying to hard to be funny and looking like a nerd Castro. Molly Shannon just so funny to see her laugh, but somehow its segment can not grow into something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great manners and teenagers was sexy as hell, the other guys are also very funny (in the nerdier). I think the problem is not just the director to move things forward at the right pace. He starts very calm, and sets a monotone. But if he lets things get really outrageous (a sequence of drugs is the second funny moment, I had a whole year to the cinema, the first also coming in the chrome film: Andrea Martin around complaining GUY IN & OUT film), it's just ridiculous. I wanted this movie to work so bad, but it just was not there. Clothing and style to one thousand nine hundred eighty-one is 99.9% perfect, and very few songs used are also perfect. It ends up as a medium-bad MAD TV episode, complete with sketches painfully overlong.
