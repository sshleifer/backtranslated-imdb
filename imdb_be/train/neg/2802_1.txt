I think that if I went to the first school, somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the lower range of the English language to come up with a scenario, it would make more sense than that. Then I could go in the first year of dramatic group, and they will act it better than the Joker in this film.

No ability to act or write anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Watch it only if you are extremely drunk, high, or need a good excuse for why your decomposed body was found with a slit wrist. Now I will go to my bowl of fish and collect all the poo in the bottom. After that, I cast it into the shape of a disk and put it in my a DVD-player, waiting for him to produce something much better than tinsel <br /> <br /> Acting. - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 breast - 9/10
