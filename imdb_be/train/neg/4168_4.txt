Well, this film has become ridiculous, but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more "adult-oriented" humor, based on the first few minutes, but then the film switches to the channel type of regime made bad for Disney, especially kart racing scene, which was an incredibly long time. Alana De La Garcia is great, but there is actually a fake Italian accent. The film looked and sounded very independent and low budget. There was one very nice moment, I'll just call serenade scene, but overall it was a pit. Laughter is very few and far apart. The final surprise, "Mr. Fix ItÂ» so ridiculous that left me more sense than anything else. It may be worth a look if you can catch it for free or TV, but do not spend money to buy or rent this movie.
