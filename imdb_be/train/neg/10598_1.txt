this work with - t !! it looks worse than it is made for TV cinema. I shutter to think that continued even concieved and the results of the war ... more beautiful than this. Jean-Claude Van shame did it again, and he wonders why his career, where he is now. no script, no history and no time should not be spent on it. I mean that. 1 out of 10 is too high, too high. Goldberg should be jackhammered for this. Van shame is not an actor.
