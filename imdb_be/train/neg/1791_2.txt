That muddy the video at the beginning and sporadically throughout the film? It's like someone put muddy water on the camera lens. <br /> <br /> The violence and nudity can turn some people, but that, along with the main bad acting is what makes a good cult film, I suppose. <, Br /> <br /> My favorite line comes Tarquinius vampire "Unfortunately, your breed is dumb." It's good that no one should ever say "unfortunately" in the movie line, if they are not in English and the living in the 18th century. <br /> <br /> actions Van Helsing character and a bad girl "rally" is not bad. I also liked the master Little plays Ron Little. Evil martial arts! Do not take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.
