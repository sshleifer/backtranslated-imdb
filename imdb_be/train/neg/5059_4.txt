If you want to watch a film about two very unsympathetic characters, this is one. The current fair as from John Cassavetes like crazy paranoid that, as they say, they really are to get, and from Peter Falk as its throughout the life of his best friend, to whom he turns for salvation. Big mistake, but since they are both immoral mafia and misogynist bastard to boot, it's hard to decide who to root for less. Only the writer / director Elaine May would come down with it. I thought it was interesting that in a large interview with producer Michael Hausman included in the DVD, it showed that the two stars were "very different ideas" about the script that the director was almost impossible to work out what the cameraman was impossible demands, placed upon them, the crew was constantly dissatisfied with having to sit and wait, and so on. This mood of one large dysfunctional family comes very clearly on the screen.
