This film did poorly, borrowed garbage. I love romantic comedies time. Looking good as eating ice cream for dinner. It's not what you're going to do all the time, but the experience is so pleasant that you can ignore how unwise it is to be you. This movie made me think about how stupid I was to continue to remain in their seats during the whole of his working time. All this shouting is done on the cheap. It really looks like they overexpose the film at certain times she washed. It has cheesy and lame CGI sets, too. <br /> <br /> The writing was awkward. I know what you can expect, as a rule, some of the problems in the area of ​​eccentric comedy, but as a rule, do not really care, because you're laughing. This film is so unfunny that you actually sit and wonder about that improbable series of coincidences and absolutely incredible behavior drawn. Events were placed in a film only to move characters from one scene to another, or to provide exposure. Of course, this is how all movies work, but you do not notice that this happens. Tasteless. It is a term that I should use. <br /> <br /> There was almost no one in the film, which was very cute. I do not care who end up with whom, as long as they all stayed away from me, and I do not listen to them talk about it anymore. Why just really cool character in the film, the character Paul Rudd, want nothing to do with a completely bitchy, patronizing, control freak, played by Eva Longoria? In addition, almost all of the characters involved consistently chose sleaziest solution in any situation. Straight man pretending to be gay to just hang out (and swim with) a woman for five years, he is involved in? Top wellness point, they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmuck, where he gets along with the equally annoying false Rudd, kleptomaniac sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, attractive women. Maybe they'll find something better to come in down the road.
