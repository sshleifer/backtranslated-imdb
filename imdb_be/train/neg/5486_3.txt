First of all, this film actually starts blunt remark: 10-year-old girl playing in a moving vehicle, decides that it would be ridiculous to cover the eyes of her mother with her hands and then leads to a terrible accident that kills mom .... hmm .... I'm sorry that there is not a positive 10-year-old that dumb. The rest of the film does not get much better. After her mother's death from apparent blunt 10-year-old on the planet, Dad moved the family to Genoa, Italy, where he taught at the local university, but here's the clincher: he does not say a word in Italian! Then the little girl "vision" of the mother (which she killed), and often subsequent nightmares that always, always end with the father holding and coddle her. Then we are forced to watch a family permanently lost and then found, and then hug and cry and then lost, and then found (and then, of course, more hugging and crying) to the fact that I actually wish for a disaster in just delete all those boring, ignorant man with the planet. Do not get me wrong because I love indie, but indie about stupid people (and I mean really stupid) is ridiculous and pointless. It's really a shame that this movie was based on such tawdry characters are bathed in such backward scenarios, as the locale was interesting.
