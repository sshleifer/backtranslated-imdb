I saw this film at the time of Tolkien-themed Vremennymov class during my second year of college. I sat there, unfortunately close to the screen, and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else laughed, but they were not in constant view <br /> <br /> Let his way .: "The Lord of the Rings "Peter Jackson's films really have something to Bakshi film. In the version of Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring, for example, a scene in which riders attack an empty inn bed almost complete scenes in tracing Bakshi film shot by shot. You could call it plagiarism or tribute, depending on the day. <br /> <br /> I believe that the similarities do not stop there. I'm not going to do any research to find out what they are, because that would mean I have some mote respect for this film. I'm sure others have outlined similarities- look. <br /> <br /> This film is full of train wreck in all senses of metaphors, and died many, many people in the accident. I decided to list what I remember, in a more or less chronological If fashion-I have left something else that hurt me it is because I am completely overwhelmed when faced with an abundance of failure (and, at high points, Sun mediocrity). <br /> <br /> due to the intensive use of rotoscoping, Gandalf is not gentle, the wise wizard, but wildly flailing prophet of doom (whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice in the course of the film). <br /> <br /> * Saruman the White is sometimes called «Aruman» during the film, without any explanation. He wears a purple and red, for some mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> * Sam thins disgusting. The image of his friendship with Frodo strangely childish and unsatisfactory. For example, Hobbits are small such as children, but they are not the children <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin never injected. - they just appear when scenes change from one sentence explanation. The film is full of careless editing like this. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry fun singing as they passed through along the way. One of the hobbits procures lute at least twice as much as it is from behind - which was not seen before - and begins strumming in a typical fantasy fashion bard as they are divided into "la-la-la" with. HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> * Aragorn, apparently, Native American dressed in a very stereotypical fantasy tunics (without pants), complete with a huge square pilgrimage belt buckle. He is perhaps the worst swordsman in the whole film - often it gets a shaky swing in before knocked flat on my ass <br /> <br /> * Black Riders are more leprous than formidable instrument of evil .. They limp everywhere they go in the painfully slow pace. This is alarming, to be sure, but not terrible. <br /> <br /> * The scene in front of the Black Riders trying to cross the Ford Bruinen (in which they look at Frodo, who is on the other side of the horse) goes on forever, in which the rear of the horse riders in a dimly threatening manner and ... do not do anything else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate hallucinations reduce Frodo as he succumbs to injury. It turns out to be more down to earth than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli pricked as high as Legolas the elf. He DWARF. There's just no excuse for this. It also looks like a twisted Gnome David. It's rough, but an accurate description. <br /> <br /> * Boromir seems to have pulled gold armor Viking Elmer Fudd Bugs Bunny from this opera episode. It looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the similarities with the illustration of Tolkien, the Balrog is howling and the induction of the least dangerous to the villain in the whole film. It seems that someone is wearing a pink bedroom slippers, and this is hardly higher than Gandalf. "Purists" may prefer the Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's version any day. <br /> <br /> * The fight scenes embarrassing and shameful. Almost none of the characters does not reflect any level of competence with their weapons. I'm not asking for the action-packed scenes, such as those in the Jackson film, but they have to fight. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very short appearance, and I was sorry that he had bothered to point at all. Watch a movie, you'll understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> Ok, now for the good part of the film. <br /> <br /> Some of the voice acting is pretty good. This is not something that Aragorn SOUND bad, it just looks kind of like a Jolly Green Giant <br /> <br /> * Galadriel more interesting in this figure. Tom Bombadil, she seems to be immune to the powers of the temptation of the ring, and her voice actress is not got none. <br /> <br /> Death Boromir is not so painful heart, as in the figure of Jackson and the same scene, but it is still properly dramatic (or rather his death, and in the book, although I do not believe that Jackson made a mistake shooting as he did). <br /> <br /> * as my professor showed (between whispering threats), orcs (mainly Helm, if I'm correct) resemble war-torn corpses of soldiers, political statement, which works pretty well if you know what was attempted. <br /> <br /> * although it is not entirely positive thing about the film, Bakshi can not be blamed for the majority of failures in this film, so I was told - the project was on a tight budget, and at the end of it. production he lost control of the creative process in some higher (which I'm sure did not read the book) <br /> <br /> Let me be clear: I respect Bakshi to even attempt SOMET Hin this magnitude. I just do not believe that he was pleased with the final product. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy, even laugh when you do not read books and have their own visualization of the characters, places and events. I am sure that someone, somewhere, will pick up a copy of this in confusion; if you do, keep an open mind and choose what is good you can from him.
