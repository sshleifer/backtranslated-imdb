I should explain why I gave this ... "work of art" rated 1 star out of possible 10. Just because it is difficult or almost impossible to evaluate it objectively. - if I gave him a 10/10 it would probably be the same. explanation in any case be followed <br /> <br /> I do not like these senseless blood gore films like HOSTEL or so - I think it's disgusting and pretty awful (in the context of all the possible values), but, as I learned after watching this movie - there is a genre called "historical drama" - and, probably, it would be in the case of 10/10, as it has a lot of him and Tarantino would have been happier with it (and Bill made 3 kills shed more blood screen than here to show that this is possible). but the thing about the "historical drama" genre is that it is sub-categories of the "cinema of garbage," where John Romero is undead-bloody-Emperor-of-the-gut, and so can not automatically be judged as a standard, the film - like these films are made intentionally bad, and you can not tell if there was comically bad moment meant to be so, or it was just bad. it is for those who like to enjoy the bad acting, bad script and bad everything else. And somehow turn faith - I am one of them too. There are days when I have a desire to see a really bad movie and look at some sort of debris and here you go - the day is saved! but it is definitely an opinion and does not match with another <br /> <br /> anyones' What I wanted to say that if you want to see some ghastly film -. Then Casanova Fellini's definitely a choice, but to listen to my advice and not to evaluate it with the default help.
