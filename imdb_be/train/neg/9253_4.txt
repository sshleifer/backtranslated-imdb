If I had not read his name on the DVD cover, I would never have suspected that this is quite a rich and old-fashioned musical was made man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from what I'm wondering if in the 50's and 60's, The Auteurs New Wave would have absolutely hated this type of film - it's so ... so ... unreal. And it seems to have little in common with many of his previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing. - just very strange that <br /> <br /> What I also found a little strange was the amount of praise some reviewers gave this film - especially when there is so much better than the French musicals there. The songs in the film were just not particularly interesting, and the characters all seemed so fresh and stereotyped. If I had to see another rich man who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or to get a good sale price of a designer outfit, I was going to puke. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that as an American musicals, not every French musical gold. This film is not another «Les Parapluies de Cherbourg" (Umbrellas of Cherbourg or «Huit Femmes» (eight women) and, despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can not see many reasons to recommend it as anything other than dumb oddity.
