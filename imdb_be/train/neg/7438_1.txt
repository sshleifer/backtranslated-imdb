This film is a complete waste of time, the story is awful, awful dialogue. <br /> <br /> To act in order, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. Photographs and some of the special effects in order, too, but again, there is nothing interesting in this film to watch. There is no logical progression to the story, the plot is utter nonsense. It's not even scary. For movies to be scared, to be at least a small element of credibility. This film has no credibility at all. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the film. Each sign is shallow and has no individuality. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects and make the work of both the poorly done, or, at best, mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read this and do not waste time on this film, if you are interesting to look completely awful film.
