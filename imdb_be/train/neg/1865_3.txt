Well what can I say, there is a B-Grade movies and there are movies B-Grade and it certainly falls into the latter. However, since it is obvious that even the filmmakers know that this is not a credible film (watch the closing credits), he can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> plot generally condemned psycho killer killed accidentally It has its genetic material mixed with some experimental acid receiving combined and then lost in the snow. Killer now takes the form of a snowman - if you can believe that. Snowman, Jack Frost, after the cities of the sheriff, who put him behind bars. At the same time, Jack Frost ends with the murder of half the town. <br /> <br /> In this film there is no real horror stories, and only the effects remind me of the B-Grade movies 50s. This alone makes it worth a look at laughter. Movie to pass the time away.
