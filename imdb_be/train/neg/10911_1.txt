I hated this movie, so I remember it vividly. It's not even funny. Any film that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racist humor does not deserve the money it costs to make. In the first half, Rob Schneider drinks carton of rancid milk. All I could think of, "he deserves it, to create such a bad movie." Do not waste time and money on it.
