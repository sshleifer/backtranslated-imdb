It was 1 am in the morning and I did not have anything to do. Do not judge me ... please <br /> <br. /> We're back in time during the Spanish settlements. The group made its way to the island. It does not take too much time before they encounter a large "reptile", which absorbs their horses. Soon, they are passionate about the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill "God reptiles." KG sucks; it reminds me of CG early console video games. Clashes were lame. The only positive I have to say this was the beauty of the native runs in a poor dress. Otherwise, it's just a middling effort.
