I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just imposable. The action was ultra unnatural plot was irritable, and the pace was slow, sooo slowwwwww. All the time sitting in the theater, I wanted the film to end. Twenty minuet in the movies, and I pray for the ending. Of course, some of the visuals were good, but c'mon guys, I mean really! A film about the setup tools Man magic really was not much to speak of music. The music was annoying and sad. There were loud sound shrill sounds sometimes, it was also annoying. Basically, this film managed to bore me, and me to crawl at the same time. <br /> <br /> I am glad that is over. I need to go see the "saline" and wash the bad taste out of my mouth.
