Stereotypes, derivative, unoriginal and sad western. Two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both give performances that are far from their best, and it is justified; they both have a superficial role and character trait, said in the main dialog. Heston is the sheriff, who "loved the world a better place, as it was before", and Coburn is a criminal who "has something to someone who has blocked it and should pay his debt." In addition, Heston is so old that he has a problem with riding a horse and Coburn is mean and tough, but not as a cold-blooded killer, as some of the secondary villains. Apparently, the filmmakers could not think of even one original idea on how to make this film a little different. ( * 1/2)
