Kosmatos "Rambo: First Blood Part II" pure wish fulfillment. The United States is clearly not win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to the country for the imaginary and the film continues the story of the fairy-tale so innocent soldiers. Only the bad guys were the leaders of the nation who have made this war happen. Rambo character is perfect to notice it. He was very patriotic, laments that US Americans did not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of one soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officials and politicians. As with any film that protects the war (eg, "We Were Soldiers"), as it is one eliminates the need to provide an acceptable excuse for participation in South Asia. And on this issue the reasons for each of the US-American soldier who was there. Instead, Rambo gets to avenge the wounds of a nation. It would be better to work out how to deal with the memories, rather than suppress them. "Do not we get to win this time?" Yes, you do.
