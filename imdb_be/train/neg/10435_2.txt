With the help of these people pretending to be so many shots, using old footage, and gassing animals to get them, not to mention the fact that some scenes were filmed on the created set with actors, it's to believe? Old film countries nice, but animal cruelty and degradation of native painful to watch these films. I know that racism is OK in these old films, but there is more to do to make the pair to lose confidence. Portrayed as pilots, they never flew their planes, Martin Johnson was a former vaudeville, using each as Jack London for financial gain, and stiffing their fees, denying the obvious deepening of his wife, using her as a cute props, all this makes the movies unbearable. They were not in any case, the first to travel on the land, or the first to write about them. He was fine as a director and photographer, but that's about it.
