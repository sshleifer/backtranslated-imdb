If you ever hear these three words, spoken to you ... "Joe Don Baker" fear ... <br /> <br /> Final Fairness based on the film of low budget action sheriff in Texas town called Geronimo ( pronounced Heronimo). He was ugly, slimy, rough character, who is on the hunt for the culprit in Malta, who killed his partner in Texas. His partner is actually slipping down twice in the film. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) goes to prison, like 4 or 5 times in this film, which makes the story going nowhere fast. In addition, he shoots all, as he is in the wild west. I guess no one told him that it was the 20th century. A woman police officer appointed to show him around Malta (which looks like Elaine from Seinfeld), and it is the only one who can put up with the cattle. It must be crazy! <br /> <br /> strippers in the bar the most fascinating characters in this film. Their dance shows throughout the film, and I began to communicate with sloppy women. Well, at least it was better than watching Jeronimo try to mute his way with something. The ending of the deficiencies and to some extent predictable, and I was happy that it was finally over. You will never forget that the last line of Joe Don Baker from the film. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to imagine how it was in three Bond movies ... very strange! In any case, if you are up for a laugh, and then see this on the MST3K. In addition, I felt it a bad movie (among many), "MitchellÂ» MST3K version is released on DVD via Rhino. I can not wait to see that!
