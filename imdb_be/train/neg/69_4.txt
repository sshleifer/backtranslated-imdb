I thought it was very awkward, uninvolving version of the famous Australian history. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave them to the nature of some person; but it felt forced and mechanical <br /> <br /> In the beginning could be much greater involvement. perhaps starting with the shoot, and then flashes back to repeat how they got there, or that sort of thing. And I felt that every scene was generally predictable and labeled as very bad TV soap. <br /> <br /> I'm really looking forward to this film, and in the hope of something better. The only thing I can say in its favor is that he hits version of Mick Jagger, but not much.
