I still did not get to see it all; it now runs on cable, and I seem to keep coming up the middle. My main reason for the interest is that I'm a fan of Bill Paxton; he is a very good actor, and became a good job consistently throughout his career. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that, while never really a supporter of the old series, I liked Thunderbirds for the courts and the effect of the work. Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business in the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the International Rescue ship excellent. Currently, the team did a good job of translating his work on the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is one lame story. Children are asked to go, and while they are doing a good job, it is hard to suspend disbelief, especially if you have an eight-year-old son flying Brain T2, a huge multi-ton trucks with all Aerodynamics Buick. Everywhere you look, you will see the logo of the company Ford. Location of the product is the way over here, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job as the hood, but it can do so much with the one-dimensional role. If you can take a movie on a very delicate matter of fact, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable to drive. Just not too close look at the car, causing it <br /> <br /> adding :. I finally got to see it all, and it's worse than I thought. Actions fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are pretty good, the story on multiple viewings got cheesier. Exaggerated product placement for Ford is annoying, and the children as central characters grate on my nerves remaining. Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it is bearable. But not much. See the original show, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And a word of advice for John Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Guild Director. You can do better than that, old friend. <br /> <br /> Another note ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Yesterday evening. On Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with a bad comedy sound effects. And yes, I have come about in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophie in their fight scene on the island of Tracy. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was possible to have a lame film will be worse, but it was. It was incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> If it was done right, no children to the rescue, Sun mocking jokes, it might work. As it is, it's just another favorite childhood joy that was destroyed.
