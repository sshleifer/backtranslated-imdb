Millie is a juice. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. Then she catches him cheating on her and divorcing him ... but it allows him to keep the child she claims to love. Then, in the early 1930s, it would have had the right to marriage and hefty child support, but allows the guy from surprisingly easy to ... ... without the support of some juice! Later, when she has a boyfriend, and life seems to be pretty good, it is also can be a fraud! Wow, she has a hard time going person. <br /> <br /> As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she is a wild party girl - do whatever it can to distract themselves from her bad luck. Suddenly, it may take many years. daughter Millie, who she had left at an early stage in the film is already 17 and surprising fashion has not changed one bit. An old friend Millie (yes, this is another evil man!) Now, pretend one daughter, but he has a lecherous designs on it. Milly promises him that if he touches the girl, she would kill him. Take a wild guess what will happen next! <br /> <br /> In general, the film is confusing and often bizarre disorder - a bit like "Madame X", but much, much less attention. So often the motivations and actions of Milli seems to make little sense. And, the film seems to be a little thrown at him - as long as it justifies the idea that all men are pigs. Unusual, but not particularly well.
