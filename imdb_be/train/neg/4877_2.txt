Frank Capra's work had just about spent time, he made this film. While it has a few charming moments, and many fine artists, chat with recycle Capri not only the script, but meaningful shots with his first version of the story, Broadway Bill (1934) is quite poor. It is quite clear that it will be re-used footage from Naivysočajšij races that exciting. But he uses the whole dialogue scene with a few actors, and then returns the actor and probably we will not see that, for example, Ward Bond 14 years older! If you do not want to see one of the last performances of Oliver Hardy, skip this and watch Broadway Bill instead.
