"Valentina" is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash the list of movies (think "Halloween," "Friday the 13th", "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer"). it is certainly not as good as those films that I have listed about this, but it's better than most of the stolen, released after the first movie "Friday the 13th." One of these films was one thousand nine hundred eighty-one Canadian made «My Bloody Valentine», which I hated a lot. "Valentin" is the best movie than one, but that's not saying much. Plot: A nerdy boy tease and pranked couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film. Then moves the film years later, when these classmates are all grown up, they are removed one by one. The killer is assumed that the boy is now all grown up looking for revenge. But it's him? Or it could be someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive shade which includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, Catherine and Hagel. They are doing what they can with the material, they have but a dim script really does not do them any justice. There are some strange moments in the whole, however. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
