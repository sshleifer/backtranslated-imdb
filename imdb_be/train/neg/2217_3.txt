As pseudo-Russian scientist says that two thirds of the way into the movie, "I came to science." That pretty much sums up the reason I watched this movie - all that is associated with a half-man, half hammerhead shark is certainly worthy of serious empirical studies by impartial aspiring scientist. Or as they say in the business, the brother of my friend was a remote control, and the rest is history. To say that the special effects were bad to bad service in the field of special effects. It's 2005, it's not so difficult to shoot a scene without the car Bluescreen cheese background. Yes, it was a magical and state of the art, when Hitchcock filmed "The Birds", but in 2005, he just looks like a low budget. Deliver me cheap attempt Sci-Fi & do me a favor really does attempt to complete suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> However, having seriously blemished the overall concept of this movie, let me tell you, once again, that, as sad as it may seem, it's probably worth your time. If nothing else, it is the power of the Tour de bad Sci-Fi. - costs of education for the new lover of cinema and, of course, worthy of retraining for those who have seen a few movies on the day they <br /> <br /> hunchback crazy mad scientist with a hammer transceiver, which thinks it is a good idea to spoon blood canfuls a nearby water makes me question not only the intellect of mankind, but also the ability to «B» movie writers come up with a remotely plausible storylines <br /> <br /> this film also largely fulfills one of my old bad strife movie -. the bad guys always wear sunglasses, <br /> <br /> If it was not in 2005, I would. be deadset in fact this film was something terribly poor metaphor for the Cold War. I mean, you might as Han bridge Klingons bird of prey migrate inserts into the ear of Chekhov. <br /> <br /> One of the most touching movie lines when chicken without a bra claims that Charlton Heston double "wait Tom," as he tries to escape the helicopter to lift off the ground. The thing is, Tom spends the bad guys from the sunglasses his endless banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov, or AK-47, in layman's terms. <br /> <br /> As a mad scientist says that towards the end of a movie, "My goal is to develop the human race" - suffice it to say that this film is promoted only to human transmission. Weak link Freudian pronounced himself mad scientist as he prepares a female character to be paired with a hammerhead shark is a simple reminder that even in a worst case scenario of science fiction we can find something to laugh.
