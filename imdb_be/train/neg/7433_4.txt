I have to be completely honest, the truth, the first thing I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, so I can not give a complete opinion about the movie, I do not see it in its entirety. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernite Bragg (Bernard Bresslo), plans to make a fortune stealing shipments of contraceptive pills Finisham hospital. This is where the title character Matrona (Hattie Jacques) works together with the staff Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors around too, including pregnant Mrs. Tidey (Joan Sims) and its nervous dad-to-be husband Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also starring Bill Maynard, Freddie and Eastenders' Wendy Richard, Miss I want. The plan, by the way does not work, by the way, because all employees are on the road. That's pretty much all we can say about the film until I see it again in its entirety. Good!
