This is a Japanese film, but there is quite a bit of English as saying here. This is a pretty film with nice visuals, showing the scenic beauty of the Hawaiian Islands. <br /> <br /> However, it was the only redeeming quality for me. The history of the whole sad. Who wants to watch a young woman pouting at 90 percent of the film, because of its "picture" the husband is much older than he was advertised? Of course, this can be a bummer ...... but get over it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes it makes a turn around and become fond of him. By then, for most viewers, it was too little too late. We fell asleep to the time.
