I think that if you're in the sixties such things as I do, you have to spend about 80 minutes of your life watching this little watchable Trainwreck. Saving grace of this strangeness includes strangely accurate social commentary on the values ​​of the sixties, as well as a number of relatively well-known actors who have appeared in the beginning (and uncomfortable) frame. It's as if manufacturers Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full-length film, which covers all the high points (or more) issues between the colors of children and the creation of, and then put it in the hands of a hippie couple and gave them a budget of $ 10,000 to complete it. It is unlikely that this is a classic, but in its own way is to grab as really odd that there was a time, stupidity, it is idealism, and uptightness institutions. It is clear that it is not for everyone.
