Hanna-Barbera sucks the life out of another famous property. Violence diluted, formulaic stories, the animation is bad, unpleasant and repetitive music, and to be honest, the show just is not funny. <br /> <br /> At the time, HB put each of its series through the same clich√©d situation, regardless of what is appropriate or not the cartoon world. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in the repeated segment of the cave ( "Hey! Once popular, and Flinstones popular. Put them together and you can not miss!"). In addition, in an obvious robbery "Private Benjamin," Olive Oyl and Goon has a regular segment that distinguishes them conscripts in the army. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> Adding to the annoyance factor of public service announcements appear in every episode (standard practice at the time for the cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye lectures his nephews at the intersection safely, recycling, and - are you ready for this? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I'm not making this up.) <br /> <br /> The rest of the original cartoons only beauty that Jack Mercer, Popeye the voice from the early days are still here role. <, Br /> <br /> You should check once just to get a new appreciation for the old underpants Fleischer. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
