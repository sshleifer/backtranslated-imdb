Radar Man Moon fairly typical rate 1950 series. The special effects are quite cheap, lunar rovers, obviously surplus jeeps WWII painted plywood over them, and the like. It acts just like that. It inspires children's imagination, which I believe that it was sent. By today's standards, it's sad, cheap and bad. There is also a hefty amount of footage in the first 9 disaster scenes.
