This is the second time I saw the film for about 12 years. These comments come from someone who thinks Kane and Ambersons be strange, worthy films. But the rest of Welles's career, unfortunately, is spent on material unworthy of his talent and too flimsy to withstand his cinematic embroidery. And if he makes a hack like Shanghai, the lack of anything substantial to hang his cinematic stunts, it's just some kind of boring. I can not tell you that he is studying here. It's all mannerisms like how godawful Irish accent in Welle; which takes a lot of effort, but adds absolutely nothing to the film. Wells few projects became this excessive and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (choose, any version) is the same ponderous project. The material is immaterial. He just can not bear the weight of all this noodling. For trade director in a reality-based drama (as here), he will never feel any attraction to tie your bundle of vanity to reality; or a coherent story. Murder for hire scheme is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos Wells, though, for what Hayworth cut her hair, and get the job done with it. The camera loves her. She's classy, ​​highest quality, hot and excellent rock ever put on film. But her betrayal comes so late in the film feels like a desperate decision, made sure that the film will have what genre it fits. The film can not be saved noir Convention deployed in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done in L.F.S., coils of all for what?; to convince you that you have seen something thoughtful? Wells to do more? that you roll your eyes? Wells has no sensitivity to the scale of history, either tells the story directly. It is interesting that Shanghai has to say to anyone who is not crippled billionaire, arranging a quadruple cross the murder for hire scheme or FanBoy in love with film vanity deprived of meaning or substance. <br /> <br /> overwrought, inappropriate, unengaging.
