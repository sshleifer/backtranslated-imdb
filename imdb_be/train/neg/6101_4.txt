Almost two-man play, and as such dialogue and performances findings will be important. Neither are particularly good. It might be more, in fact, if the first one was produced as a two person play, and then worked in the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, annoying vampire who seems to be a little autistic gets caught with stripper (as a result of watching too much porn in his poor house). He wants her to tell him about daylight. He would have been better to find someone with a hard day or someone who copes paint a picture with words, as a poet, but then they could not have a hot CHB. <br /> <br /> Once he gets her to do whatever he wants (and he's not very good at it), he intends to feed her at 6 am, after which the sun rises. Much of this period, despite the fact that he says he can do without feeding, it will just make him hungry. In addition, he claims that he can not allow the stripper to go, so she knows about it, but it allows a number of other people who are going to learn what it is. There are many inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> Why is this vampire prefers to live in the house, bad boards that light from street lights and pouring the neighboring buildings, as if it was the day I'm not sure. With ever in the world, you would think that he would have done a better job, or a fixed position a little bit. He was obviously not a wealthy vampire. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly a remake, and I am very interested to see the original version, the Dance of the Damned. Despite the fact that he was sent Katt Shea and other films she directed at Corman (Stripped kill STK II) it was quite bad.
