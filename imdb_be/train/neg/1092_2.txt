Well, I guess that's good news regarding the 2001 opus William Winkler, "The Double-D Avenger,» is that he has managed to unite the three mammarian wonders Russ Meyer - Kitten Natividad, Haji, and Raven De La Cruz - in one picture. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy week, they shot this thing ... or was able to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news, though (and there is plenty of it), is that that this film - if you can even call it that, was shot directly to video - is a complete misfire, the total abortion categorical crime, an absolute abomination, and indeed one of the worst pictures I have ever seen. Look no further for Lamest superhero movie ever made! The plot here, such as it is, has to do with Kitty gets supernormal after fellating rare cockazilla plant in South America to treat her breast cancer (OY), and then struggling trio megalunged bikini dancers back to Los Angeles is a pity that every lame boob joke trot completely falls (you should pardon the expression) flat, there is ZERO actual nudity in the film at all (except for some old photos of the kitten in its heyday), and that some shaving creams and papier-waving Boulder amount of special FX . Meyer Hals is a bit long in the tooth / saggy chest, to put it mildly, though Sheri Don Thomas, like bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), All it turns out well, be nice. So why did I give it to the juvenile, unfunny, it failed embarrassment film 2 stars and not 1? To be brief: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice-over commentary in the special features of the DVD I just looked absolutely hilarious, especially when he pulls about 100 synonyms of the word "mother" with 1,000+ on its website "canonical List Hooters.» The man is a national treasure, and it manages update these disk plates to the status coasters!
