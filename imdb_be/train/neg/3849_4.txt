Debbie Reynolds toe taps, and tango and tap-dancing his way through the ordinary thriller, which has clearly trumped «30s atmosphere. Two ladies, brought together when their children commit murder, try to start my life over, running the tap dance school for kids in Hollywood.

Nha ounce of honest fun around a cool package. * 1/2 ****
