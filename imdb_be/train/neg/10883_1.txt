This film has not been programmed in the Italian cinema, I saw him in the manifestation called «fantafestival» third find it terrible, because some scenes seem clips chaotic and dark, the use of fluorescent colors ridicule and no suspence in the film. Music full of stories, and I have no words to describe the visual effects.If you look at the first scene of the movie seems interesting, but after a few minutes it becomes busy.The interesting history, but needs a complete overview of the development.
