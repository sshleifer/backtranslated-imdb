I am looking at Hulu (too much advertising!), So that broke the pace, but even still, it was like a very bad buddy movie from the beginning of the sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both parts played by Jerry Lewis. If I were a Hindu, I protest the portrayal of men as corrupt and all women as shrews. They lied to music videos for Western sales and used a lot of Western models because males could touch them, I usually use a lot of Indian movies, but it was a great disappointment, especially for the modern Indian cinema. History does not occur in India (uncle keeps in mind when Mac returned to India), but I can not find out where he should be.
