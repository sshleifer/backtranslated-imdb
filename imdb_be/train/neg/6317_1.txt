I have no idea what a fool out of San Francisco came up with this silly story, but apparently they have to leave all the drugs they take and put them at risk of analytics money. - NOW <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a plausible story, if we consider the sequence of alien abductions in the "Life of Brian" is plausible. <br /> <br /> This film is a little more than a pipe dream left. If the US and the Soviet Union would have to abandon nuclear weapons, it would eliminate the only real obstacle in the result, which is held two to participate in the war. Poor as Korea, Vietnam and other war era were, they were "proxy war" fought to keep the superpowers from direct participation. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me think about how realistic it was, when some group of high school children will continue the hunger strike against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As if someone says, "Mr. President, some of the children in the High Drastic do not eat!" And Ronald Reagan would have said: "Oh my God! I'd better reconsider its security policies! "That's right. <br /> <br /> As the film? Would not it be better if the Soviet Union had already collapsed, because they can not support their massive arms build ... wait, what happened!
