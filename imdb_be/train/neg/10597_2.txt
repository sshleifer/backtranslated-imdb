This film was Absolutly awful. I can not think of one thing good about it. Plot holes were so large, you could manage them through the Hummer. The action was stuningly soo bad that even Jean-Claude should be ashamed of, and that's saying a lot !!! And the dialogue, dialogue What ??? To think that I was a supporter of the first (I'm using this comment freely, it more schadenfreude than anything else). This film was Goldberg in her calling loudly !!!! Nothing good will come out of this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that Su is bad you can not even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun !!! It should be in my top five worst films of all time. 2/10, because it is soo hard for me to give the first
