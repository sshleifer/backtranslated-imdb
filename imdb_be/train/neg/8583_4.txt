. Americans have the attention span of the fruit fly, and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest very quickly <br /> <br /> I learned an interesting fact from the film: someone has to draw a high tension poles and do it on a schedule! And guess what they really would like to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> It's amazing, but when I was sad to watch infomercials late at night and decided to actually watch this movie, I found the characters to be interesting and very attractive. <br /> <br /> I just usually do not watch that much TV late at night, so I can not recommend this film if you watch paint dry is not your idea of ​​an exciting two o'clock from your life.
