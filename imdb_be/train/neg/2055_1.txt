There's absolutely no reason to waste your time with this "film". The original said it all and still holds. Or read a book or do some research on the history, and you will realize that it is a remake of the ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! Having Holcomb & Edgerton, KS, where the story takes place, the scenery and the place does not look like Kansas. Original riveting, from field surveys using direct participants, weapons and belongings of the victim. Unforgettable performances of Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Quincy Jones soundtrack and cinematography Conrad Hall ... Original is now available on DVD in widescreen. Let it die a quick death turkey.
