TNT every stereotype and deception, you've heard about the semi-devout Mormons, and you will see that all of them were shot in this ridiculous excuse for a movie. Finally, the fate of Kurt Hale changed (thank God), and we hope that it will be long before we see some of its features in theaters. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was an amateur (I think they used the camera for some basketball scene). The plot has been sluggish and very unfunny. You really do not understand why someone has done something. It was like I had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound woman was sitting on my face, it was that painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give this film a negative rating because the scale will not let me.
