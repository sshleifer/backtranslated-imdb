And I thought, bad beach, with the difference that this film is one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame him for the terrible scenario if anyone can make any sense of what the hell was the point of this film, give your self a pat on the back. His cross between The Village and crappier scenario. It begins a kind of catch the eye, and then he goes on in the story, it just does not make any sense, and do not get me started on the final !!!! What was it? The only thing that makes this film exists in the Nicolas Cage is usually a great sense of humor and his ability to be funny in a strange situation. If you go to Blockbuster, and this is the only film to watch, save five bucks and just go home and turn to put some things on fire, and when some of them asked why, just say stupid thing that comes to mind, and there you go!
