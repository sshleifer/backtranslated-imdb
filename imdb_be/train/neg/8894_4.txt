This film is falsehood incarnate, straight 11-10 on a scale of falsehood. Fakeness accents, as well as the tightness cardigan spandex pants staggering. Yankees, although the real Scotland can be as colorful, if you ever go there do not expect much of a chance to "dance with" a dispute with locals. In addition, do not try to sway local opinions on the other fine arts tapdancing. <br /> <br /> There are several infectious singing and dancing scenes, but the plot is too cheesy and linear, the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt that anyone wants to be stuck in the Scottish village timewarped 18.th century in a remote corner and not a gay New York. Maybe it's not such a great sacrifice to the priest left Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get out of this dump. <br /> <br /> Look out for a beautiful view of an alternate reality Christopher Streed Day-parade in Scotland will look like on LSD. In addition, I would only recommend it to Hollywood muscial Completists.
