I read about this film in the magazine, and I was intrigued. A woman who one day see himself passing by in his car. Well, I thought it might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it is not. First, the name. Frustrated? Broken ... what? What does not work? ... oh wait ... I know the name, "broken"! WOW, clever! Unfortunately, this is almost the only thing going for it. <br /> <br /> The room is not too bad, but I think that the Kiefer Suderland did much better in the "Mirror". Crossbreed invasion Snatchers and body mirrors and a rather mediocre in this. More appropriate name would be Â«The boring", since it draws each scene for bloody ages. Or maybe, "confusing" because it does not explain anything, but not in the narrative, no story, per se, just some vague ideas about unclean copies and convert dotted with cheap panic and scenes, which are used to death, but nothing tangible. It's just messed up. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, action and special effects are very good, but again, this is not a difficult role to act. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie twice, I still feel unsatisfied, a little confused, maybe, not EA Poe or Stephen King sort of way. Do yourself a favor i did not look this. Simply put, there are better thrillers there.
