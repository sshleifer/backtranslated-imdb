I have the idea of ​​the great epic of the American war. This is not so. (And on this issue, nor was the Emmerich / Devlin / a Gibson patriot. But I digress.) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on a promotional screening at the old MGM Studios (now the Sony) was released directly in front of him. The audience had high hopes for this expensive period piece, written by veteran Robert Dillon, director of the venerable Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire with glory), and Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it did not take long for people to start to squirm in their seats, whispering ironic comments about the terrible misunderstood Pacino accent - he was supposed to be the American colonists of Scottish descent (!) - and that of Anastasia Kinsky, who was supposed to be recently emigrated from England (!!). Then the story started, and things went downhill fast. <br /> <br /> The motives were confused, the dialogue was brutal event had no historical or political context. Whatever the story was rushed forward by ridiculous accident; on the second or third time that the alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into each one was a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave upset performance as a British officer / pederast. His focus was all over the map, too. I think that there were no English actors available. <br /> <br /> A lot of people left. Those who remained tried to stifle the giggles, and then openly laughed. I'm stuck - I realized that at least the battle scenes can be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably, Hudson decided to shoot them with a hand-held camera, not even the Steadicam, twitching gives "authenticity" inappropriate newsreels, which destroyed a sense of scale. <br /> <br /> It was a few rows in front of me half a famous TV critic audience, (the late) Gary Franklin Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could tell that he was annoyed by the behavior of the rest of us. And, of course, on a televised segment on the next day he gave the film "10" on his famous "Franklin scale of 1 to 10", while the remark churlishly of louts who have disrupted the screening night, which is obviously futile "know the art when they saw him. What a clown. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, not Pacino to star in another film for nearly 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered. You can not say I did not warn you.
