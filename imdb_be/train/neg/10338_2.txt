This film is just dumb. <br /> <br /> With the cast Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in a silly climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the true psychopaths detective fiction. Unlike Marlowe and Spade, who put the pieces together to solve the puzzle, photo breaks things apart to get to the truth. This film turns the hammer in the boob, surrounding it with the bad guys, who ... well, too stupid to get away with anything. One of them was so bad it was concluded that he succumbs to attack popcorn. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the film are straight out of the Three Stooges play book. Velda dance at Barre, for example, or a bad guy who accidentally injures his boss in the back. And continuity gusts infamous: Frau Blucher runs down the center line of the road, when the camera is tightly at its lower legs, but it way through the board, when the camera zooms out to a wider shot. Worst break, however, preceded by an attack of popcorn. Annoying bad guy hammer passes second hour after our hero, with the exception of hours show that it was seven minutes for our guy. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the final is so bad that he had to see that this is the only reason that he gets two points from 10.
