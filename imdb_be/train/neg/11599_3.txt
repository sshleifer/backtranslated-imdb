The only thing that prevented this movie on a complete disaster had some interesting stylish touches. <br /> <br /> (Moderately Spoiler Alert) Death from the comic scene in a little derivative of Twilight Zone: The Movie, which ensures the cartoon death. Nevertheless, this was handled well, especially watching the ink bleed and color draws. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is another good scene with a motorcycle demon. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I was glad that I got a cheap DVD in the store going out of business sale, because it was pretty creepy. I bought «Soul Survivors» at the same time and both films was as annoying with constant realizations that you were watching a dream. However, where the «Soul Survivors» has nothing to redeem him, or to have any meaning, it at least had a few stylish notes mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the DVD allows you to go to 8 "nightmares" where something actually happens, it is the only way to look at it. Scenarios between creative moments baked blood quite unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
