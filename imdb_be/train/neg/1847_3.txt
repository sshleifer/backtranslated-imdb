SCHIZOPHRENIAC: slut, Mangler is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of talentless people together to make "extreme" horror movie. Any kind of action, production, storyline, FX, etc ... go out the window in an attempt to create a "shock value". Do not get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of "shock" films, and sleazier / gorier / nastier the better. - but it's still nice to see some kind of talent from anyone involved in the film <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicles the life of Harry Russo - drug interested freak show, which takes the orders to kill from dummy of his spirit, I asked on. He goes on several spree murders of prostitutes and other random people and shout about how much he hates the "Hoo-UHSÂ» (a "whore" for those of you who do not speak New-ESE ...) and how he wants to rape . them in the ass There are several scenes of necrophilia weak, very little of Gore, and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing that you have not seen the best movie ... <br /> <br /> The only thing that atoning I can find in this film is often slow (unintentionally?) hilarious screaming-tailored by our main man, Harry. It goes on and -on-and-on about wanting to kill all and make them in the ass, and it does get very comical after a while. In fact, I'm almost tempted to believe that there should be some kind of homo-erotic undertone to this film, with all the ass to speak and constant shots of Harry with his dong run to the gallows. Frankly, that joker Nekkid more in this film that few chicks who show some T-and-a (and some full frontal, for good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC mildly amusing as a 1-watch, but I really can only recommend it to those who want to be able to say that they were watching a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: slut, Mangler. To be honest - the name, of course - it's the best thing about this garbage ... Generous 3.5 / 10
