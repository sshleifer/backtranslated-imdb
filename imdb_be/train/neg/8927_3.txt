Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - dead drunk) and comes out as Myra (Raquel Welch). Then she decides to destroy the courage (or something similar), and continues to teach the history of cinema in the acting college run by Slutty John Huston (do not ask) and accelerates the Young happy couple (young, handsome, hunky Roger HERREN and Farrah Fawcett - yes Farrah Fawcett ). <br /> <br /> They took great novel Gore Vidal, who was unfilmable and, of course, tried to remove it. They also hired an English guy with a clearly anti-American sentiment and hired a bunch of actors with dubious "talentÂ» (Welch, Reed) and puzzled by the old pros (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim BACKUS, Mae West), throw it all together and ... . Casus !!! Absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The film won the X rating on its release (it was downgraded to R), mainly due to the truly tasteless scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in which Welch attempts to have sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The film is very Scattershot ... scene jumping everywhere, and people say and do things that make no sense. This is not good, but I was never boring. <br /> <br /> duties varies wildly ... Reed awful ... very sad. Huston chews the scenery again and again and again on the nauseating extreme. Welch is not really bad, like the world, but its line makes no sense, so you never know what to do with it. The West is unlikely in the film (the blessing), and it's really a kind of painful to hear a woman almost 80 years cracking sex jokes. Roger Herren (what happened to ...) was very young, handsome and not bad as Rusty. Fawcett is in order. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find things to say about it ... you just watch in disbelief. A must see movie - believe !!!!
