Roy Rogers and the company is trying to bring «Sintown» back to life - it is a ghost town that can go boom, when silver mining was successful. Andy Devine (as "Cookie") slapsticks around. Jane Frazee (like Carol) loses some of his bitch to a sharp grin Mr. Rogers. Foy Ready and Purple Sage Riders stand (or that sing-in?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of Pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the "farce" views "of the Grand Canyon Trail." Weakened flooring delivers a winning performance comedy. Mr. Devine mule kicks him in the heel. There are energetic performances human, too - but the material is not grand. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
