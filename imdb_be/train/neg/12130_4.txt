Massacre film directed by Andrea Bianchi (the repository) and the production of the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. But now there was a mix of great talent, you might think this film would be true gusset festival. This could not be further from this. Massacre falls directly on his face as one of the saddest slasher films that I've seen come out of the Italian cinema. I was really struggling not to sleep during the movie, and I've never had this problem with the Italian horror films. <br /> <br /> Massacre begins with a prostitute on the road cut with an ax sidelines. This scene was used in Fulci Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene, and it raises your expectations of the film as an ax has slaughtered. Unfortuanitly, the next hour of the film is so sad. The film goes on the set of a horror film is removed and there is a lot of character development in all these scenes, but the characters in the film are so dull and poorly acted your interest begins to flow. The last 30 minutes of the film is not so bad, but still could be better. Gore's movie was moody and so Fulci used most of the gore scenes in a nightmare of a concert that was nothing new. The end of the film did leave a good turn, but there was still a lot of unanswered and continuity falls directly through the floor. <br /> <br /> It's not a very good film, but for the present the Italian horror freak (like me), this film is a must, because it is very rare. 4/10 stars
