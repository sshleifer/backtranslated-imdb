This movie was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched this film with a group of cinema enthusiasts who ranged taste yet always a keen eye to the cinema for "genius" (as one of my fellow commenters on this site, had the audacity to label the steaming pile ??); not one of them found no mitigating quality. We ended the film with an incendiary chorus of curses I do not reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the positive reviews listed here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins himself. Afterall, since one of these reviewers would say that he financed the film himself ?? because nobody in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world, for that matter, would risk a penny, or their good name in connection with this film. Do not let the semi-known actors who appear in the film to lure you into the talons ?? and Christian Slater admits in particular "product", he signed a contract for the film without reading the script or knowing any of the details (stupid, I'm sure it will never happen again). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the unlucky person who stumbles into this morass of self-indulgence is written, a director, producer, and is funded by a man who is too well known to admit to himself that he is not all that he creates a masterpiece (and if you do not believe me, please Google «Anthony Hopkins» And art).
