The film opens on the Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten blood drooling into his waiting mouth, where he keeps it about two feet above it. It was so provocative, and I thought, "Here we go! Good vampire movie! Â»<br /> <br /> And then he died. It was literally just a scene that captures any part of the imagination. It was a slow, monotonous nonsense in the future. I was very disappointed, as my previous experience with acting Sands' was very enjoyable. However, this attempt was clearly mishandled and the script leaves a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> performance even questionable Sands could not begin to keep this already drowning barge film. <br /> <br /> This rate is 1.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
