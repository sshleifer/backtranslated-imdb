"Godzilla vs. King GhidorahÂ» is a fine example of how a great idea can be ruined deplorable how pseudo-patriotism. Here, travelers from the future trying to destroy Japan, replacing the local hero Godzilla with your puppy monster three-headed dragon Golden King Ghidorah. They fail, however, and in the end, Godzilla fights Ghidorah. Fighting between the two giants is very cool, but the plot of the movie is full of holes and all of the "big in Japan" really stupid. The creators of this movie is not even a threat against Japan's enemies, which makes them stupid big blond guys that are easily outwitted clever Japanese. The good thing is that in the end, Godzilla and King Ghidorah virtually destroyed in Japan, and it is ridiculous enemies in another (actually two) exciting fights. But until now, Battle Royal, the film was very boring and pathetic.
