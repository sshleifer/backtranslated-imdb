I would rather have my eyes gouged out with rusty ice axes than have to sit through the abortion. There is no plot. There's no acting ability. Liotta shamed themselves and should be blacklisted from any additional work. I'm sorry that this industry gives a shit, as shown in any medium. <br /> <br /> There are rumors that Maddona rushed to the floor to break it second hand so that she could take on a stretcher. Actullly, she deserves to be married to this loser and want-to-be-actor-director. I hope she stays in London and never returned to the United States. Please do not waste your money on this so-called film. I beg you.
