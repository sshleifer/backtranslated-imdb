The problem with the «Killer Elite» is something that just looks for this film out, and take the time to look it up, you put more effort into the experience than many of its leaders had made, in particular, directed by Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> is already flying in bad weather Peckinpah directed this film. At least one biographer, it was where he met with cocaine. Add to that his drinking, and it's not surprising it's not collapsed. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the concept of the film is good, and the first ten minutes, promise a lot. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors who do a lot of the dirty work of the CIA. They move quickly, do well, and it seems like the best of friends - something happens to destroy their brotherhood <br /> <br /> The opening scene shows that they explode the building. - why we did not say, par for the course in terms of murky motivations of this film. But it is understood that these guys hurt people and do not really care - anti-heroes as well as the Wild Bunch Peckinpah is not so long ago. Name discovery tells us that they are working for ComTeg, and then adds with obvious tongue in cheek "... thought the CIA could use such an organization, for any purpose, of course, ridiculous." It's a very clever way to let the audience know all bets off. <br /> <br /> Add to that the traditionally strong backing Peckinpah cast including Burt Young, Young gig, and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins as plum crazy, who can not miss the opportunity to be shot at a $ 500 per day and you want only the writers, including the famous Stirling Sillifant, tried to do something more to the story than to turn it into a platform for the lazy one -liners and bad chop-socky forgery. Trying to inject a dose of liberal social commentary Inconvenient squeeze in. "You are so busy doing their dirty work, you can not tell who the bad guys," someone says, Locken, as if he or she needs, he said. <br /> <br /> worse clumsy direction Peckinpah and led to walk . we are 40 minutes into the film, before we get our first fight scene, it is a chaotic set of random shots, where a bunch of people we do not even met before seen battle in the San Francisco airport, their fight interspersed with conversation in the office suite . <br /> <br /> at the end of the movie that remains of the cast has a battle inside the park preserved ka Victory flying around, ninja, working in the open to be shot while Caan throws of one liners that undercut any hint of real uncertainty. «Lay me seven to five, I'll take the little guy," he acuity directly to climate samurai duel between two ninja warriors - from China, which we all know, the land of ninjas. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly not entirely Mounties we reach breaking things.) <br /> <br /> Kaan much better in small scenes, like when Locken, recovering from some nasty injuries, said one of his bosses plays smooth Arthur Hill that he was a "Humpty-dumped" organization. Kaan refuses to stay down, and its recovery stage, although the momentum kills for the film, has excellent acting from him and Oh Heflin, daughter Wang, as an auxiliary nurse. Caan was one of the best actors of the 1970s, and his laconic episode of Heflin, Duval, Hopkins, and both Youngs provide "Professional" real watchability. <br /> <br /> But you do not see the "Elite" Assassin's think about it. You see, he thinks about the film, which is gone.
