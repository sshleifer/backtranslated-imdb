Brilliant book with excellent performance and insight into human nature, in particular, the nature of addiction, which still resonates strongly today. <br /> <br /> As for the film ... oh. Nothing special. The cameraman was obviously unfortunate tendency to circling and circling and circling all that makes the viewer quite a chore. Why did the director does not put an end to it for me - but maybe he was too busy, and somehow fails to make good performances of these are usually excellent, but inappropriately cast of actors. In general, poor adaptation. Your three o'clock would be better spent reading (or re-read) the book.
