«Cut» is a film about some film students making a film. It is very much in the "cry" of mold, ironic, self-referential horror film that, for me at least, falls down, because, for all its irony, it's still just a bad horror movie, like his films, with reference . <, Br /> <br /> But it was not without its charms. Well, a cute anyway. Ringwald was fantastic as spoiled, cynical American actress hating every minute of working with Australian amateur film-making. She was so convincing that it is attractive to believe that this was not an act, although all participants to «Cut», she says she was lovely to work with. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene with her plump, pout or click was great. Everyone else, however, ranged between OK and be very wooden. <br /> <br /> Anyway, «Cut» have some laughs, a few buckets of gore (some of them surprisingly disgusting), and in the end it .. just another bad horror movie.
