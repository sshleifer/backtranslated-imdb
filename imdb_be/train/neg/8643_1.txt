Blair Witch-War film that much disappointment as Bwitch was! The name says it all, save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie as "Once in America," "The Shawshank Redemption" and "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to see more "war" movie) and Mr. d. <br /> <br /> This film, if it were a baseball team, and in the Major Leagues was top and single were beginners, this film was a high school dance. It was filmed as if it were a high school drama club shooting with an old camera of his father. Of course, they went into the enemy area (to make the film), but I do not call that brave, here we call it just plain stupid! This pass all the way! Now go look, and then you tell me what you think.
