If a derivative and predictable rape revenge thriller your thing, then you are in for a rare treat ... They do not really appeal to me, so I could not find a single thing to make up for this kind of story. It looks like something straight out of the 1980s, at different ages, when it would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer doing OK working with a weak script and tedious script. But what makes Gillian Anderson is involved with the film, as after gloss of its work as Lady deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House in the past year? The director is said to have influenced the witness about the rape and his work on documentaries, but even that is no reason for the amazing scene where a pack of hounds rural beat Dyer. I do not think I was the only person in the movie laughing. What I can not understand is the involvement of companies for this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some of the largest independent British films of recent years. Verve spread bullets Boy, Code 46, and Red Road - Straightheads not worth mentioning in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: this is really the best you can do? That the independent British filmmakers are going to make out of your artistic opinion? This is a great spot to both your reputation. Listen carefully: you can hear thousands of supporters of independent British films weep in despair?
