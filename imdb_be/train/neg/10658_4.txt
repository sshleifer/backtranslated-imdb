On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five (note the three of us hardcore fans Kamal) of us have reached a unanimous verdict; B. was hard shit and thanks to the movie, we'll have a pretty fucked up Monday. Not to mention, we have vowed to stay away from the theaters over the next year. <br /> <br /> I will not accuse Kamal here because he sort of hinted in a recent interview with the multiplier Mada (on Vijay TV), he said something like, «Tamizh Cinema'la Photo, Editing'la Namba munnera'na maadri script, direction, Acting'la innum Namba munnera'la »(Tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing, but we hardly improved. when it comes to scenario of directing and acting") while you see by VV, these words sound very accurately <br /> <br /> Now, here are 10 reasons to hate this movie :. <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Aris Jeyaraj I could hardly restrain himself from using profanity here, but the fact is, HJ mastered the fine dexterity screwing every recent movie it (remember, «Anniyan», «Ghajini») with a concussion cacophony, he puts in as background music. Next time I have change the eardrum, he pays for it. <br /> <br /> 4. The song lyrics do not help move the narrative of the film space / time, they do not make you sit up and take messages. the film feels like it's made of four very long songs with a few scenes quit claim between them. <br /> <br /> 5. Brief gone too far. VV are best suited as a short story, instead of 2 hours plus "thriller". To use a cliché here, like the Energizer Bunny, he goes on and on and on; Only in this case you do not want. Later part of the film feels like a lot of resistance. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika pairing of two ice cubes rubbing against each other, possibly made more sparks than the lead pairing. There's no reason you rooting for them to do it together. In fact, every time they get together in the second half of the film, they are doing a good stimulus for the story. I hate to say it, but 10 minutes Romancing Kamalini Mukerjhee to do more than reach Kamal and Jothika in this film, plus «Thenali». <br /> <br /> 7. emphasis Kamal Hassan Kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in India or in the US; and this is not something new. He did this because «Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae». It just gets to the nerve. Imagine what havoc it can cause when his talent for this wonderful accent responds shooting on location in the United States. He does not leave it to the immigration or dose it offers its people boards (TN bewildered cop with Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in the virgin Kamanglish ( «Wha we VG is usually a bad police wok"), of course, with the sickening effect . <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are some directors who do you expect to be in a certain scale. Gautam might not have ill with a poor performance in the Department of common sense. D.C.P that his feelings will meet her love interest in the streets to discuss issues such as the commission itself and life after! The scene in the theater was so bad, to a climax; we could hear people behind us loudly call IQ hero. "Is he stupid, he can not simply use his siren or fire?" (On a busy road Madras, Kamal-The-Cap-at-a-police jeep chases the guy on the bike just like any ordinary dude! ). "He can not just use a gun?" ( "The guy on the bike," begins in the legs and we have a fully geared Kamal hot on the trail for a significant period of time). I have not voted in favor of the later, but I'm just trying to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore and Violence If I wanted to watch the women raped, their throats get slashed, more women are getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity, I would sit at home and watch a «Police Report »or« Kuttram ». The use of excessive violence should go this way, to expand the story, not pressing it! Somewhere down the line Gautum seems to be confused about what extensions (rape and murder) and that the base (history) is! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double espresso shot could not get the pain out of my head.
