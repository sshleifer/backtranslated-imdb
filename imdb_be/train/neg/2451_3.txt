This film raises more unintentional laughter than anything else I've ever seen. In fact, if you're a fan of Tolkien, rent it just to laugh at it with your friends. I'm not a million people to break their drawbacks ... all I will say that the movie (for me, anyway) have lost major points for turning my favorite character, Sam, in a clumsy idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
