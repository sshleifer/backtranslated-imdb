Typical 70s Italian mature age film, original and good music, but with some strange, interesting, but not fantastic photos, poor and sometimes confused storyline (for example, the role of wolf-dog, and where the boy come from?) With bad dialogue, good atmosphere . <br /> <br /> the reason for which is still (relatively) well-known and sought after, probably nude scenes (including 70 typical pseudo-coitus) with 11 and 13-year-old girl with an older adolescents ( Eva Ionesco and ENT Wendel) - it's interesting socio-political point of view, to see how these ideas are very young teens are considered acceptable and normal in all of Europe (and the USA) 30 years ago, while now it is more than a taboo . <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the abuse of a girl (Laura) from the other two characters, and her discovery of sex, a pretty clear idea of ​​the aspect of life of a teenager. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not develop until the very end of the film, and already seems to be very experienced in the erotic arts - there is no "coming of age" for her: she is a vain young girl who knows her sexual charms, but ultimately just used and It ends with a film that is crying like a little girl, she's really still there. The boy is quite despicable bully, while Laura comes across as a very naive and weak victim.
