SEX WISH was actually released (minus ten minutes longer, um, "extreme" images) here in the UK in the early days of the video boom, and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup, when he allegedly inspired imitators murder case. Oddly enough, this paper matte ultra-preventing film under the carpet in his headlong rush to obtain relatively innocuous loves ice cream and SCREAM night DEMON canned, and the film was all but forgotten as a result. I jumped at the chance to see it on the DVD-RW and spent most of the duration of the movie with my jaw on the field. It is not so much politically incorrect as completely insane, triple X take on Death Wish Michael Winner (made genus name chatted as regards inspiration?) From the hard sex, and some do the opposite of violence has dropped in the boiling broth from the seventies song. If you do not consider yourself to be squeamish, it might make you think again. By the time SEX WISH is over, you'll want to clean out your eyeballs with a disinfectant cleaner and take long hot shower to clean yourself. If any film really deserves "it is only in the movies, only in the movies, but the movie" tag line, this is one <br /> <br /> Highlights (or) dark place. - rapist, using a vibrator on the victim he masturbates over her scene-stealing mustache Harry Reems, in helpless young black couple who have to screw in front of the sword cane killer (they won Oscars for them quite credible performances, when the Academy was crazy) to people neutered for their troubles, and some annoying spot trends, which threatens to increase production above their obvious grind-house of origin. Do not say I did not warn you. If you thought that the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will prove that you are very, very wrong.
