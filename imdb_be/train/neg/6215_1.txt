It's really a waste of time ... the film has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many slots .... although the animation at the highest level. <br /> <br /> After the movie started, I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, saying to himself that he can get interesting in a late stage, but it has never been unique. The same story has been played over and over again, but what made it worse was the fact that the basic plot of the hole was a story about how to kill the villains ... The author could do a lot more with the whole concept, but it seemed that he or she did not have his heart in it and would like to close this movie as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> as a whole, too much hype, but failed to deliver.
