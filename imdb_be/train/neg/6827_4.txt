Dumb as a dumb does this completely uninteresting, presumably black comedy. In fact what begins as Chris Klein is trying to maintain a low profile, eventually turns into uninspired version of "The Three Amigos", only without the laughs. To make a black comedy to work, it has to be outrageous that «Play Dead» is not. To black comedy work, he can not be mean energetic that «Play Dead» is. That «Play Dead» in fact, it is a city full of nut jobs. Fred Dunst nevertheless make a pretty fair imitation of the character Billy Bob Thornton from «A Simple Plan», while Jake Busey makes a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
