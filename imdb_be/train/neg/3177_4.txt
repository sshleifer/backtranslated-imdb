I must admit that Over Her Dead Body was actually not as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see him, so I rented it. I realized, just go ahead and see the horror in front of my eyes, but in fact it was not so bad. I was just waiting for this terrible film, but it seems that the authors did not mean any harm, but the casting of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry), it seems a little off set for the movie. I think I might have found it a little better without her, she just annoys me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell was decent chemistry that made the film a few cute. But you have to admit that there was no point in the film, it was one of those quick money for things such as the actor. The film could have been funnier if someone is not paying attention to it and be better actors. <br /> <br /> Henry had just lost his bride to be, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on the wedding day, but when his sister takes him to the psychic, Ashley, Henry falls in love, but Kate has her due beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move so quickly, and it will make sure that Ashley does not get it, tormenting her day and night with its walks, believe me, with the voice of Kate, it's scary. <br /> <br /> Over Her Dead Body is a good film, not sure if it's worth the money, but I'll give it a rent to you if you want to see it or curious. Eva Longoria just do not have the star power to do the job in the movie, no offense to those who love it, it simply does not rely on a small screen on the silver screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, it seems, is still not too cute whatever she pulls, or "gay" friend, Dan, but then again, is not really cute. Just with some rewriting and due care, this film could have been better, but instead we get a predicted average romantic comedy that will leave with an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
