It was a great idea, and the scenery was beautiful, but that's where it ends. It seemed like a dim Set It Off meets West. The plot has a little sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. They also may be unnecessary things happening that do not belong to the story and did not contribute to the further history together. There were also long empty moments where the story could be explored, but has been used to silence or unwanted conversations. The script should be more meaning and direction. I had a huge question mark to watch this movie on my head. But the casting was great, in my opinion. If you look just for eye candy, then this movie is for you.
