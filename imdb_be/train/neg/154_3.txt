I watched it on DVD in original language with English subtitles. Or subtitling was very poor or the actual dialogue has a great story and give any character development. There are quite a lot of HK stars in this, but the film does not need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. Bright and colorful scene, made in CG are attractive for a sheer color and shine, but it can get a preferred fast time. If there is something that makes me think of a child's film, with its unrestrained barrage of hCG, the fight scenes and story crap. I am sure that I understand what happened in the movie, but the whole delivery of the story was pretty bad.
