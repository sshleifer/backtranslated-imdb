I watched as 8 or 9 Herzog films and none of them had any effect on me. <br /> <br /> I've watched several documentary films about him. He's obviously an intelligent man with great knowledge about the films and the passion for making them, but it does make it a good director. Definitely NO! Full anti-talent. He can make a good documentary due to features mentioned above, but the film with actors ?? never! <br /> <br /> It can not send or write. His script full ill-conceived situations, and many situations / dialogues in his films as children, and poorly made that they can not be hidden behind the word "art" in some sense. No way. Not to mention the mismanagement, so amateurish-like. To say that he wants to direct and write crap like this is a lie. <br /> <br /> As the stage when Scheitz divert Storszek and hiding in the rear of the store. Who is he kidding <br /> <br /> He was a crook; he knows that fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he has to put in the script to get your attention and empty boast. Never mind the rest of the script and direction untidy. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog could make a movie as a sweeping can, then I could re-test your old movies and try to find in their talents.
