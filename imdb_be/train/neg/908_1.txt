After buying the DVD for Bin deal thanks to an impressive number of features listed on the cover, I put it in the DVD-player and everything looked good. Nice animated menu and a lot of extra features ... but when I played the film itself is lowered. This is the worst that I have ever seen, and I've seen some bad movies in your time. Note that compliments the film here IMDB actually from people who have made this film. So do not believe if you do not like to spend money!
