Nothing could have saved this movie, not even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, it would be strange effects. Best Director may have received a little more sense and the best performances out of actors. But nothing more than feeding the dragon script could not secure it. holes of the earth, bad lines, horrible pacemaker, the endless play of one and the same frame in CGI dragon stomping through the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at any price. <br /> <br />
