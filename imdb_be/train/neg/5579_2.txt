In 60 years it is sometimes interesting film, most of these entertainment from laughter in the film. It is very uneven and includes a plurality of irritating components. Take, for example, switch between black and white and color. If done correctly, it can have been a very effective, but because it was done poorly, it has become a nuisance, and only detracts from the already bad experience; most of the film has an odd feel to it. Act is not very bad for TV Flick, but then again it was quite uncomfortable at another time. Many of these events have not been consistent, and ending with the fact that confusing. As this family somehow end up on many of the major events during the 1960s? The ending was too mellow for my taste; because it was hollywoodized, everything should turn out in the end. I would advise you not to waste your time on the 60 years, and make something else out of your time. I'm glad I watched it in class, rather than on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. It's just a random thought of the film. I hope that you my advice and stay away from it.
