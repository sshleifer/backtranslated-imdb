I watched 3 episodes Caveman, and I have no idea why I'm still with the exception, perhaps, waiting for it to get better. <br /> <br /> For me, this show just pumping themselves from commercials, without any real humor. As we sat, watching these shows, we all talked about what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> In the episode, a woman cave woman with the attitude has been really great, looking for us. it is wet in the theater and acting tough to strangers, and, in truth, she needed a slap in the face <br /> <br /> I consider myself a pretty good opponent, taking in everything, but I have to say, Cavemen is comparable to the old show, my mother, car. I give it a 2 only because they deserve one better than one because they actually spend money on it.
