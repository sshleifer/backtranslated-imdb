Many people thought it was a good movie, but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the film, the spaceship crushed on the ground, and some of the aliens escaped from a spaceship, then hey killed several people in the world, but for no reason. In addition, he is in a dark forest, I do not see anything on the screen, I could just barely hear the sound. <br /> <br /> A few days later, the predator came to earth, but no one had sent signals to him to the point that he does not know what happened on the ground, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the director of the predator found alien school and killed him for no reason. He does not live in the land, that is not his job to thing happened here. Finally, the duration of the film is only 90 minutes, a summary is too short, and it can not be said about the history of the reviewer clearly. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I do not think it's a good movie.
