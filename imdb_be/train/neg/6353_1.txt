For comedy writer Woody Allen really allows the viewer paying down this meager attempt at character development. There are not a few entertaining moments, but no more than you would listen to them dryer drum tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell waste your time in this film, which was unable to demonstrate his usual funny delivery. Amanda Peet has done well, but again, there was no room to move in this otherwise corpse like a movie. The film is so heavy and sad, that it can not be done, but if it were to, Radha Mitchell did. <br /> <br /> If you like films that go on and on in one scene, and do not really achieve anything except to show that their author can write a few lines about the instantaneous dialogue, then you'll love this movie.
