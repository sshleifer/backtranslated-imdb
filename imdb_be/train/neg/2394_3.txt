This movie was amazing ... I watched it while swallowing a quarter psilcybe Cubensis (mushrooms). It was really weird. Im sure you have to watch it high, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not stop laughing .. maybe LSD will work. The film is a bunch of things morph into other things, and dancing. It's really a cheese for today's standards, but when he was released to them that it was good ... one of a kind. I could see how some people think that this film was good, but I do not think it was very interesting, and I was on mushrooms at the time. If your party or something and Everybodys pretty lit, push it on you get a few laughs.
