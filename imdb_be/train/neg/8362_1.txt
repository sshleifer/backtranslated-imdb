This is a very bad movie. I racked my brain, and I can not think of one positive comment to make. Brutal act. I've seen more realistic representations of access to the cables. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, the secret recording of President, and shark attacks everything that gets close to him would have to do for fun cheese at worst. shark night is not even so bad it's good. Dialogue sounds and comes as if it was written seconds before it is removed. And to top it off, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm surprised has ears begin to bleed from the 80's techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to write. <br /> <br /> From what I've read, Italian cinema was dead sharks 1987. Night is the last nail in the coffin.
