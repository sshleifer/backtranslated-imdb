This is a film that leaves you with the impression .. one writing the story of a film-making. <br /> <br /> Incredible visuals .. Very good acting, especially from Shu. Everything is perfect except .. .. history only poor and so, everything fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you had the right to be invisible .. What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon), he could not think of another thing to do, but to caress and rape women .. This is all his supposed "genius" of the mind can think of. Is he trying to get extra power? No, he did not even bother to explore the way to return to be visible. The guy basically sex crazed maniac. <br /> <br /> Add to this, the laboratory atmosphere, you have all these young guys .. joke tossed around like they were in the bar .. If it was not all white coats and equipment, you might think, it is a bad imitation of "Hello". Very small and poor persons and very little care are in making you think these guys are nothing but lambs to the wolves. <br /> <br /> Even the floors Man as a thriller, the film provides a short way, because most of the "exciting scenes" so poorly written and full of illogical behavior of actors who simply shout "this is just the stupidest thing I have to do so to Hollow person can find me alone and kill me. "<br /> <br /> If you have read this book, while a scientist (cane) goes after a woman has a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that enters his character. In the film Cane simply a sick man , which goes to the crowded market to rub his body in women and get to it. Just bored.
