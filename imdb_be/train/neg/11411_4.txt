The storyline was the summer a few times; "Breath of life in a nursing home." Several plays, films, novels, short stories, poems and news articles to hit the theme will not be the end, but it is still an excellent platform for the study of nature. <br /> <br /> If "Gideon" was built with great enthusiasm he might be brilliant, but the dialogue and painfully sad story is absolutely filled with stamps (even subtitles and summaries "simple wisdom" Gideon almost made me laugh at its ineffectiveness). Basically indifferent action is the last straw for this weak film, but otherwise it is gentle enough to the absence of actors of focus is almost irrelevant.
