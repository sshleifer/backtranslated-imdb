but not too much. Perhaps the worst "major release" a film that I have seen in my life. Definitely the worst this year. There's no point in commenting on the plot, cast or actions. The problem is that for all. It is in the absolute stupidity of irritating kind ( not funny sort of) all that is happening on the screen, I do not know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10 Perhaps because of Steve Martin It really try Result -.... 95 minutes, washed away down the toilet along with several brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
