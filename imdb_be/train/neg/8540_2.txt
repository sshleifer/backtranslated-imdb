As someone said, it starts with a bizarre prologue of a little blonde killing the cat. Then the main story: the photographer (Gaffari) and writer (Shepard) meet by chance and make a trip to the mountains. First, they spend the night in the hotel where the owner gets a bit dull yelled at, with increasing irritation of the audience, according to Gaffari. Once in the mountains, they seek shelter again and invited in for a good old woman, who seems to be too receptive to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, who?) What happens next I will leave for daring the viewer to understand, because I most certainly do not have can "t. At the moment, I like Eurohorror, and it would have turned out better if only Artigot (writer and director) have made some attempt to logical story. Backdrop (Pyrenees?) Is a beautiful and intriguing place for a mysterious and occult phenomena. Green tops can easily obscure the supernatural and those who command them. Photographing nice. Just want this whole thing made sense. You can watch this movie on archive.org.
