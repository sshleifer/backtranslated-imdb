I was not particularly impressed by this film, which has a dull music and only lasts 40 minutes. Thank God, because I fell asleep. I make a great use of time filming to reflect the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, this is all there is. <br /> <br /> I prefer to his predecessor, a great Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 at 87 minutes and prove that the continuation can be better than the original, Powaqqatsi made in 1988, it runs 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try to both of them.
