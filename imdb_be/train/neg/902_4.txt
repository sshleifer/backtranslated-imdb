I believe that today the film is important, because it was one of the first film Sophia Loren. She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie, because I wanted to see some of the early works of Sophia Loren. I was surprised when she came to the camera with her skin tanned over brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Of course, today it would be considered as a legate and should be avoided in making the film. It really was annoying to watch Ms. Lauren paint color in the skin throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie would have been better made when the real opera singers have made this film. Then, singing and gestures real face of these artists were apparent. I discount the comments from others that the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Ms. Lauren was at the age of 19 years and still today, the film would have been better received as though they were on the stage. In the end, we do not see beautiful young people on stage with "old opera singers' singing scenes from behind the curtain! Nha discounted success using heavy opera singers. One has only to turn to the most artistic production of television advertising for J. G. Wentworth Company with opera singers on stage to sing the praises of such a professional production company. This is one of the best and most entertaining TV commercials, which are produced today. <br /> <br /> The quality of printing film also makes the production of a slightly lower quality. Ink color lost a lot, and that can not be helped. <br /> <br /> In order to improve the film on a DVD production company must add subtitles in English, so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the lyrics say. This would help the story and teach him more than the narrator gives a 30 second introduction to the scenes. <br /> <br /> Look at this film not because of Aida story, nor the fact that it's Opera. In addition, Ms. Sophia Loren, none of her fellow actors, as you know, nor in the memory of this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of Ms. Lauren and wish to see her at the age of 19 years - regardless of the fact that production <br /> <br /> Larry Illinois.
