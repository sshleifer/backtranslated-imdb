This film does not provide anything new or worthwhile. Seeing this, my wife and I agreed that the studio simply knead it and did not care if it was interesting. This is a good example of the movie "just a concept" - they have a concept of the film and other details are not important, because Execs knows what will make $$ only on the basis of the original concept <br /> <br />. the film begins with Cruella is released from prison and is going to release on parole. She no longer loves puppies, but have been programmed to love them - it simply can not hurt a flea. It does not last too long after her release, and she returned to her old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> the most annoying aspects of the film were secondary characters. Eric Idle as the voice of a bird Waddlesworth made me hate him - and this I consider TOUGH-hard fan Python. It was obvious that he did it because they gave him a lot of money (can not be any other reason). low self-esteem Cruella servant in Tim McInnerny was funny in the show Black Adder, but here he is completely lost and unfunny. And it should cost a few dollars to get GÃ©rard Depardieu, but he was utterly wasted as well. There were some other supporting actors as well, but given how poorly written characters, I try to block them crazy. <br /> <br /> In general, you would be best to let your kids watch television than allow them to bother to see this nonsense.
