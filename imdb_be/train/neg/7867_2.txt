Well, I tried and I tried, but I still do not get this thing Maddin. Tales from the Gimli Hospital left me cold, that a film about the Austrian peasants and one of the Ice Nymphs were pretty to watch, but do not have the department in this story ... and it Nudie film about abortion and hockey just boring. I am glad that Maddin has praised the silent movie, but I do not like his movies for the same reason I do not like films of Quentin Tarantino: they are empty honors to a better, more creative films - films that promoted the art form or have broken new ground - and all style and no substance. No amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can not hide the fact that Maddin is unoriginal copycats David Lynch, although he has one advantage over Tarantino: he did not write the dialogue is faulty, because most of his films rely on intertitles. The bottom line is, shtick Maddin is reasonable reasonable filmmaking for beginners majors film.
