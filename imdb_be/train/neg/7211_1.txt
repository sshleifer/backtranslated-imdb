I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. It was, and still is one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I do a lot of geography and history, extracted from the spin-off Field Trip Inspector Gadget. I'd like to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever. <br /> <br /> But the film destroyed the reputation as a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, an actor with the potential was definitely not the role of Inspector Gadget. First thing- in the movie, Inspector Gadget smart. Not as in the cartoon. In the film, the gadget solves the mystery in itself basically. In the cartoon, it was almost always Penny, the brain, and a huge book (I still want her book!). If a gadget has solved this mystery, it was an accident. Gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the movie was pretty dumb, which was where the humor came. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it is too much «Good Guy vs. Bad Guy» in the film. This is not just meant to be silly Saturday morning cartoon. In addition, the gadget does not have a love story, but the Disney Corporation filled idiots. <br /> <br /> Also, I miss the true gadget, the gadget had, and especially car gadget. In the film, it was a gorgeous convertible. In the cartoon, he was a police car and a sedan can turn into a van. In addition, almost did not have any tools, and basically there to get it from place to place. <br /> <br /> But if anything, the only thing that was scary about the film was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was stupid Saturday morning cartoon. The film was too serious, too exaggerated, it was too much of the plot, and was not even remotely funny <br /> <br /> Tip for those who have not seen :. Never seen. EVER. See the cartoon, it is a real classic.
