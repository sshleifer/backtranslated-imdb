I just saw it on the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. Synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good, so we decided to check this. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In addition to being poorly written, it was sad. I will not take the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script. <br /> <br /> The first bite was a cliche, wholly ironic, over the top of the seriousness is not funny. The film would have been better if Hunt Hoe went with a smug sense of horror. Instead, he took himself seriously, and this led to a sad movie. I can not recommend this film. He felt too long and generally just weak.
