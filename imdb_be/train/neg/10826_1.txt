I can not say that this is the worst movie of all time, but only because there are some movies I have not seen, but! This should be the most pretentious attempt to make a movie of all time! Director suffers from the same problems that he had with "There Will Be Blood" (although it was not quite so bad in this movie. The whole movie it feels like you're watching a guy trying hard to impress beyond his abilities. This, as he sits in the chair of his small director and thinks "like a great director to deal with this scene?" he just does not have it in him. I do not know if this film could have been saved by a great filmmaker. was known to some nuggets of greatness that can be polished, but nothing has been brought to mature. stage where all the characters sing was the worst moment in the history of cinema. One after the other, as we see, the characters sing, and I settled into the chair I kept repeating "please, please, just not a guy on the verge of death, singing, too!" Of course, MASSIVE FAILURE !
