Well, should I start? This is definitely one of the worst films I have ever paid good money to see. I will not comment on the story itself, it's a great classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. To begin with, the action, with the exception of Eric Bana, soap opera quality. I've always been a supporter of Pitt, but there is every actor on the Bold and the Beautiful puts him to shame. Action Camera does not help, either. As it lingers on him when he thinks it just takes me back to the days of Brooke Forrester in the lab! Peter O'Toole was a very bad plastic surgery, and he is desperate for a friend. In any case, it is more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to finish my comments, Diane Kruger is a pretty girl, but she sure did not Helen of Troy. Peterson should rather chose Saffron Burrows for a role as Elizabeth Taylor will be rather miscast today.
