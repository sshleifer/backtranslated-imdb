This film was not very interesting, of course, is no where as the original, or as good as the Christmas story. Symbols (except the smallest) try to imitate pre-actor, and they fail. The Hillbilly neighbors did not come out of nowhere, as they were not part of the first film. It really sucked, may have been fine with the original cast, and then again maybe not because the story is so weak. Skip it.
