Television productions at the start of the 2000s were between weak and bad. Before symbols (Alias, of Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk) TV does not have the right to hit another that can capture the attention and interest of spectators 2000s. Names like (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena) or (Baywatch Hawaii) were not encouraging for you to watch and follow, or at least was not that exciting and interesting all the while what preceded them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact it is the Men in Black are responsible deception The X Files'! (As if it were a special unit 1). But even in this brilliant formula; it does not work well. It was promising; while there was a saturation of a "supernatural" cases, after many decades of X files already, so that the natural spirit lampoon him as mischievous (imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). However, (Special Unit 2) was not the most powerful in this, or strong, when it comes to make a comic Sci-Fi-show. It was very funny when, for example, every sexual situation should turn into an ugly one disgusting. He enjoyed that bad taste sickly. (Landis) was not charismatic, and basically intolerable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Aleksondroy Lee), as well as any alleged sexual attention, everything was sluggish. Of course, the show got a funny look, but overall it was unfunny work. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main ideas. Among (Evan Katz) 's other works as a co-writer and co-producer as (seven days), or to (24), later it should be the lowest point !. Despite the distinctive personality, it could have been that kind of jokes most of the time. Therefore, if this was the purpose of them to make one of the silliest sure! Indeed, it would be one of the rare times, to be thankful for the cancellation of the show after 19 episodes only that!
