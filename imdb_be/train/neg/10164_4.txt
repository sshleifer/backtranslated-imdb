I just saw it at the Venice Film Festival, and can not quite decide on this. We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters, to care for them. Maybe it was a moment that we are all in the "bubble" of our own, but these people do not make me worry about them or shocked by their different destinies. At that time, runs a little more than an hour, the characters they were not very well developed. Much time was given to the personnel of factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and slightly horrible-looking doll with amazing realistic eyes, that most of the characters, made for life, was somehow more interesting than living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow it never came together.
