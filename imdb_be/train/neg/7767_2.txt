For those who are not familiar with c.S. Forrester book this film should be interesting. This is a colorful, well-acted, and reflects the high adventure, but for those of us who know the original story, it's terrible. I could hardly sit through it. <br /> <br /> For some reason, screen-writers seem to have to rewrite the stories they are working. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are some scenes that are difficult to remove. But why the screen writers to rewrite history, and not just to adapt it? In this case, the authors of self-made <br /> <br /> A few examples :. There was no rebellion in the glory. Officers also take the ship after half-mad captain was banished from the mind, when he fell through a hatch-for the reason implied, but never gave. There was no court martial. The Court of Inquiry has been held in almost congratulatory atmosphere. Peul captain comes to appear in this part of the saga of Hornblower and the wife of Colonel Ortega. Hornblower, he has never been in the cooler or on a ship or on shore. There are many such stories manipulation Forrester. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical basis, I think that the re-use of the film flash-back device hurts the continuity of history. <br /> <br /> Why, oh why screen-writers have to spoil a good story?
