I have discussed, I adhere to, or not tick spoiler. Since 99% of the show probably already have seen any follower of Scrubs, probably do not qualify as spoilers. <br /> <br /> clip show. Hmm. We all know, my friends sat up when they started with the clip shows ... and five and a half years in Scrubs they went and fell down the hole. <br /> <br /> I have to ask the question, the authors simply could not be bothered to write this week, and just said to myself, "Let's show the other funny things." It did not work. <br /> <br /> To begin showing all the times that people who have fallen down, not funny, when taken out of context. It's not funny to see Todd dangling his banana hammock when we do not know why he was hanging his banana hammock. <br /> <br /> Secondly, for what was supposed to be a compilation of the JD fantasies, one Turk was a dream, it also was not his imagination, although I forget. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode completely forgotten. We've seen these things before. And a collection of clips of people dancing? Why? It's not funny. <br /> <br /> And finally, I have to admit, two of my favorite moments Scrubs have been shown in the last compilation ... Dr. Cox realizing that Ben is dead ... and JD telling him how proud of him he was. <br /> <br /> But even see those moments again saved the episode. Resume says it all. <br /> <br /> The worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, please do not let the show go as well as friends, keep it fresh, keep it funny ... or wrap it.
