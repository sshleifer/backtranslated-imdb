You know that you're in trouble watching a comedy, if only funny parts in it from the plaster animals. It is a pity that the parrot, cat and dog were the only support and not vice versa, as the people there were pretty boring overall. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eve, Lake (what kind of name is that), Jason and Lindsay, I would forget this lark effective and do something else, because all of you as funny as watching paint dry, and awful actors bargain. <br /> <br /> The main gag in the film one of the characters who cry, I'm not gay, that's funny, as if you were not, you might change your mind when you had to put up with three bossy, tedious and I dare say very ugly women lead in the film. <br /> <br /> worst film I've seen in years, and hopefully never seen one as bad again, but I expect not.
