Five minutes later, in the film you realize that you've seen it all before. This boiler. This firm. And the devil's advocate. And there are no new elements here. only pure Bill Gates allegory exceptions. Conpsiracies always good material for film-making, but why should it be so great? Boiler room a good film, because it - for a while at least - seems realistic. The Antimonopoly all wrong. How realistic is it, for example, your boss pay the impostor to be your girlfriend, to get you to work and to control you? I would give it a 1, but the audio track in order, so 2/10.
