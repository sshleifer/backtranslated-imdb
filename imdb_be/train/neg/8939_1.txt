Yes, I've seen rough cuts. Unedited sex scenes. Gloomy cut scene. Almost on par with the film Â«The Need" for the hardcore action. This film is just as bad as bad movies get.the bad script, bad acting, bad effects, bad location, bad bad all the tricks. Best actors, "" in the film were lap dancers they hired for a vampire extras! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, the "conceited actor", as someone put it, makes the match look like talented here. His amazing ability to drive a car is bad when it is obviously being tossed people on the hood (check your reflection in the windshield), his inability to turn left that class. He did not forget the sex scenes. plus it noted the use of a toy gun, which props guys could not even bother to hide, like a real gun. The rest of the actors on the screen could hardly get them lines.It as though half the time they waited for a line that was not there! <br /> <br /> In the "special effects" were soooo good to the guys who took it their real names on the credits! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at the party, then this film ... then again, there are many good comedies that are just as funny and do not give money to people who do not deserve it.
