This time we get psycho toy manufacturer called "Joe PettoÂ» (get it?), That makes life, evil toys that kill people. He goes after the family who has a poor success simply lives in the same house where he and his mutant son robot "Ping" (again, get it?) Lived. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst (and, hopefully, [allegedly] last) in the half - series, this one and the previous one species as a soft core porn, but without the sex and nudity. It's kind of like a low rent hybrid "Dolls", "Halloween III of", "Puppet Master", and bad home movies. Presumably, in 2000 they began to make the sixth part in the series, but it was abandoned and never completed. We can only hope that it stays that way ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star with **** <br /> <br />
