I do not want to go too far into the details, because I can not justify spending a lot of time to consider this film, but I had to give a second opinion, we hope to help people to avoid the movie. Animation scoundrel and a story alternates boring / pointless very annoying. Humor was completely lost on the audience, and so - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is not an action sci-fi or anything like that - his attempt to slapstick and humor just does not work after the transfer. It was full of sickening to watch this movie, and a terrible way for me to push the film festival, especially considering I was excited, and I was open for something - I did not expect that a ghost in the future of Shell, but I expected it is entertaining, and it just does not accomplish this. Yaaawwnnn ... Rental Kino Journey instead.
