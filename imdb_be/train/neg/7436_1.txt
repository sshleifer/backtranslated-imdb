This film is a waste of time and money. Throughout the hour and a half, I continued to wait for him to get better, and it never did. It was slow moving, jumping around the story, it was not terribly interesting, and in fact never amount to anything. administering loans were long and drawn out, which was basically the rest of the film (a long and drawn out). Many parts of the story does not make sense. Several times during the movie, I thought that maybe I "tripped" because the mismatch of the plot, however, my companion had the same question, and assured me that I did not "fall into" out of boredom, but it was in fact, the film, I never actually did not post here about the film and to actively watch movies on IMDb for many years. So the fact that I actually took the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this film and that you should not waste your time and money on it.
