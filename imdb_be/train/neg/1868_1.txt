This movie is terrible. Each row of stolen 8MM (Italian duplicated embodiment, at least). If you want the real trash ... trash, give it a try; but be careful: it is not "so bad it's good" kind of film. In its low cost, it can really look like porn, but believe me, if you are looking for a "snuffÂ», s & m, hardcore, erotic ... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, you need to find something else in the store! I tell you this because absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting, acting, story, dialogues (only good line, as I said, those that they have stolen from 8MM Joel Schumacher!) Will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the "happy ending "it is absolutely impossible! I'll give it one star: a half for a sudden shot in the back of the scene, after the "eyes of the victim" Monologue (stolen from 8MM, as well), and half of mothers and sexy body of her daughter (who did not manage to keep me fully awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)
