Hard 2 is bloody awful, I mean super-bad. Words can not explain how bad it is, but I'll give it a go anyway. <br /> <br /> Cruel Story 2 is very similar to the first film. Sebastian (Robin Dunne), kicked out of private school and is forced to move to New York. There he decides to start a new life and only lives a normal life and settle down. Unfortunately, he has to deal with his stepsister Kathryn (Amy Adams) wants to drag him down. Sebastain begins to fall in love Danielle (Sarah Thompson), innocent daughter of the school principal. Kathryn wants Sebastain just sleep around with the whole school, which has been described as "the whore-house." Kathryn also wants to avenge Sheri (Keri Lynn Pratt), who had humiliated her during a school assembly. Catherine wanted to make a new to the biggest slut in school, like the sub-plot of the first film. <br /> <br /> Cruel, mostly canceled TV show, which was transformed into a prequel. There are so many problems with the film. It is badly written, unfunny, and poorly acted. Fortunately for Amy Adams, the show never took off, because now it is quite a big actress. Although Cornwall was a sense of realism and can be seen installed in the real world, Brutal 2 is set in the sitcoms and land, as described at amazon.co.uk «version with Randy Bell Saved." There were some dark themes related to sex and drug use the first film, but in a brutal 2 tried to make it funny, and some of the ideas in the film should not be, for example, Kathryn novel with the teacher. Other ideas do not work, such as a secret society, where all the popular kids meet to discuss the fall other students. Fruits and was the main problem sexualize 15/16-year-old. I know that teenagers are having sex, sometimes a lot, but if done on film or television, is treated very seriously. One notable point was when Daneille encourages Cherry (who is around 14, / 15 in the film) to simulate sex on a horse's back to the point where she has an orgasm. The idea of ​​transformation girls around 14/15 in slut just too bad to me, and should not be made the subject of comedy. Jokes in the film fall flat, no matter when it is verbal gag as "walking it all wet when she sees that you are" visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn face in the dirt. <br /> <br /> There is a lot wrong with this movie that I do not have time to go in, but I am saying that you should avoid. Just watch Cruel, while not classic, is still worthy of the film and considering the subject of things well. <br /> <br /> This film is just a wet dream pervert with school children having a lot of sex with each other,
