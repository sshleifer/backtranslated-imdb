I saw this pile of spit today vignettes on screening view and I was blown away just how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is almost flaunted his blind spots open. There's no black or gay New Yorkers in love? Or who, for example, to know yourself involved white people in love? I know that this is not the love of the collapse of the anvil tastic inclusiveness, but you can not claim to be a cinematic New York from these fairly common members of society. In addition, you know that the people who drafted this ish thought Crash earned clumsy Oscar, where is everybody? <br /> <br /> Perhaps worse than strange and deliberate social and economic ignorance was down right insulting the head (remember when you were in high school and people are openly contrary to very young women in wheelchairs? I do too). This film ran the gamut of ways to be the worst. Bad action, bad writing, bad direction - all covering all possible genres, ever touch the rich white people who smoke cigarettes outside trendy restaurants. <br /> <br /> But, thank God, they finally got the heavyweights Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson together for a reunion this jumper. And a side note, Mind dodged a bullet; Ethan Hawke looks Ravaged. This, of course, is one thing, in terms of its appearance, but added an additional incredibly eerie vibe to it awful awful scenario scene opposite the poor, the beautiful Maggie Q. <br /> <br /> I had a terrible time choosing my not least favorite scene in the movie end of the questionnaire, but it should be a little Anton Yelchin / Thirlby for sheer lack of taste that makes me sad, because I really like these two actors. I do not consider myself to be easily offended, but all I could do was to mock and look with disdain, as someone's 50-year-old aunt. <br /> <br /> second place in this incredibly tight contest hearing terrible things portrayal of Shia LaBeouf about what it means for the former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie. I do not mean the opposite, I mean against. Against the only explanation. Now I understand that in the beginning of the sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative event. HIGHLIGHT. Please keep this in mind if your brain starts to flow out of your ear soon after the opening credits, which seems to be a nod to the first New York City real world. This film is awkward, strangely dated, wishy-washy, ineffective, pretentious and, in the end, completely divorced from any real idea in New York at all. <br /> <br /> (additional star for / sequence Leachman Eli Wallach, as it is actually pretty sweet, but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of meaningless, masturbation flour.)
