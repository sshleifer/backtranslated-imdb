What a monstrous movie. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but aside from a few interesting set pieces, mostly hysterical film absorb divers cries, crying, sweating and general experience, when something goes wrong. <, Br /> <br /> Take that with a simplified derogation to ensure that the audience still understand what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington explains radio repairman, he should be like Scotty in Star Trek is no more what a joke), and you have simplified down thriller unworthy action. <br /> <br /> Let's just hope that the real US nuclear fleet is not in the hands of such a scenario! <br /> <br />
