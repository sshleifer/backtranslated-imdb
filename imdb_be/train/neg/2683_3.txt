Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai prison? If yes, then this is your movie. This Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be good, but the story was poorly done. Contrived plot twists, bad dialogue and unsolved problems abound. This short film has not earned the right to be as mysterious as it ends. Potential spoiler and utterly ridiculous fake plot voltage line is filled when a member of staff finds out that the girl is not there room and going to drive them. (This point innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity of the moment, when they are arrested at gunpoint). Later in the hotel clerk once we found, and the big city of Bangkok, mind you, Ive been there- and testify against the girls, like a pair of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison. Come on. Rent another day in Paradise instead.
