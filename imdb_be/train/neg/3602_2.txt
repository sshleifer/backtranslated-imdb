I am an avid B-Rate horror movie lover and saw its fair share of pictures of the chopper, so that I have a significant caliber to judge this film. It easily enters into the upper echelon of the worst horror films of the 1980s to offer. It's not as scary as the Night of the Demons, it's not as bloody Re-Animator and it does not matter cAMP There's nothing out there. That being said, this film does not really matter. Keep in mind, the artwork film to a completely different film. Boom shots on the back of the DVD box entirely taken from this movie <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: .. $$$ (There is a lot of violence, but we have seen all these before marriage killer kills the students and the occasional member of an object, cutting the throat and all the other tired method of killing that horror movies used) <br /> <br /> The nakedness: I do not take part. <br /> <br /> History: $$ (story focuses on Francine Forbes - who wisely changed his name Forbes Riley after the film was made - who takes a teaching job at the university people begin to die, and Forbes.. He believes that the assassin targeting her or her new heartthrob with a checkered past or libido prevent students to be honest, this is not possible, because the script is still not specifying any sign outside Forbes) <br /> <br /> acts? .. $ (Terrible at all levels of this shredder has a sense of school -High school yak because the students could do better than this movie. the Forbes demonstrates a modicum of talent, as does Seminara as one of the students, but also all the rest of my «Extras» caliber action).
