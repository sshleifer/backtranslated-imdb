In 1993, the "guests" was a huge hit in France. Thus, the sequence was inevitable and, unfortunately, this sequence is one of the worst ever made. <br /> <br /> This is a film that does not keep its promises. In fact, he should tell a single story. Jean Reno has to go in the twentieth century and to take Christian Clavier as early as the Middle Ages, so that time can normally stay the course. The problem is that the piano feels completely comfortable in the world of the twentieth century, and so force him to go back to the Middle Ages is quite difficult ... Instead, the film goes for a few other stories, entirely succeeding in the next major section. As a result, the film becomes sometimes stupid, sometimes a bit of a mess. <br /> <br /> But the film also suffers from doing almost all the actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that they nevertheless can be avoided in the first film, they're going over the top and become irritable. Then why Jean-Marie Poiré film-makers to engage Muriel Robin in the female lead role? He made a mistake, because it seems to be bad at, easy, and absolutely helpless. The rest of the actors are not better: Marie-Anne Chazel does not exist and the Christian Bujeau, unbearable <br /> <br /> Of course, the film has some good moments with effective stop-gap, but it often falls into vulgarity and easy .. Certain sequences and dialogues affected . He is also hollow because Poiré takes elements that ensured the success of the first film. Thus, the young girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding. <br /> <br /> And the difficulty and disappointing observation. In any case, the interest of this film differently to commercial? <br /> <br />
