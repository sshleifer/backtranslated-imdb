Before the release of the genre definition of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, zombies have been relatively well-mannered creature. Of course, they were much better dining style in the old days. But the social etiquette aside, whether these early zombie thrills offer movie-going public? According to this film, none at all. <br /> <br /> The story of the expedition to Cambodia, whose goal is to find and destroy the secret zombiefication. One of the parties reveal secrets about her and sets about building his army of zombies. <br /> <br /> This film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But, seeing as it is 30 in the movie, these zombies are more like a lunatic than a variety of carnivores we think today. They seem to respond to mind control, and not the insatiable appetites. And, quite frankly, "rebellion" multiple chop too. All of this is really very sad. In addition to the lack of fear, there is no over-the-top melodramatic theatricality to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that it could have provided a lot of fun, even 70 years ago. See if you have to see all the "zombies" in the title, but otherwise I would recommend to skip this.
