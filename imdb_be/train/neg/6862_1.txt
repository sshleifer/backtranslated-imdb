This lovely inferior to the original silent film «Blind Dead» is another rubbish bin. So many people have swollen the films I can not believe what they say about it. Since I was a kid I heard about how scary and large these movies, and I've seen them all, and was thoroughly disappointed, it was all on drugs, with the 1970s, or they simply do not know how sad it is wet oil?
