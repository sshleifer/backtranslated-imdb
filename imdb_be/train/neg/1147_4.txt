This film is the story, as the Federation of British Industries Knott Berry Farm is an old west. Shamelessly sanitized version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to combat crime. Hoover heavy hand (he had any other kind?) Shows all the quality teevee script reading actors, cheese sets, affordable sound effects and lighting 101. Jimmy Stewart 20% dramatic power, Vera Miles chewing the scenery, the film features kazh-lister, known in the mid-fifties, a drop of irony or humor of "the Amazon jungle" to "backyard barbecue", all smacks of pavilions and back lots. Even canned shots and familiar. I suppose Mervyn LeRoy got drunk every night. a few (very few) are interesting exterior establishing shots, nothing to note here except for a souvenir.
