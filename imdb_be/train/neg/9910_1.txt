One of the worst movies ever. Not funny, bad TV movie style, bad game. It is sad to see so many well-known older actors could barely walk, let alone act. Nancy Young female lead can not act. Threatening direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Mostly weak jokes fall flat. Even the basic premise of the film does not make sense. Somehow they have to stop the wedding from what is happening, but there is no logic behind his actions. Slowly walks made my wife stop watching, but I suffered through it. Old to act like they're young and horny, but instead comes off as funny helpless. How did they even get paid to do it?
