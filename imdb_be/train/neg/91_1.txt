I rented this film about 3 years ago and it still stands in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I do not think I've ever done. It's worse than a home video made in high school. I remember, as they do a flashback circa 1970 something and memories were people with polo shirt, Oakley sunglasses and a new SUV as Toyota Rav-4 or something (I do not remember). I do not understand how they could possibly say what will happen in 70 years. He could have a cell phone too, I can not remember, it was just awful. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie, and if I could get an hour of my life back. To date, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad ones.
