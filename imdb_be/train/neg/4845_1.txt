There's no artistic value in this film to earn any reward. Well, it does not deserve an audience as well. Ironically, one of the awards for cinematography, but honestly, the camera movement in disarray, to say the least. Each frame, you feel that you are getting the "full picture" him as someone "circumcision of your sight" from the edges. History deplorable. Well, I'll be honest, I could not watch the entire movie. The part that sucked the most, when I saw a party of soldiers in the barracks and one of the soldiers persuaded to drink liquor. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Take my advice, stay away from this piece of shit.
