As a big fan of only the first 2 seasons of BSG and only stand function BSG Razor I was hoping that this release will return the franchise to its original glory days. Normally I have no problem with science fiction, which is mostly online, as opposed to the visual special effects bonanza. If the script is heavy with some original ideas brought good actors, you can create a profound movie with a small amount of money spent by CGI. This prequel has none of the above requirements will be for her. Virtual reality world created by the terrorist adolescent was funny and incredible. This scene was just put there to raise the issue rating to the Limited. Not something that teenagers do not like virtual reality mosh pit filled with sex and violence and heavy dance music. Its part of the same adolescents with intellectual depth & cause or political and religious passions, to create a futuristic software or to become suicide bombers, that confuses me. These children are definitely not from this planet. The film plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being a little interesting. Scene from Stolz giving him a cyborg with Devine conscienceness through software upgrades to ensure the student was amusing, if not interesting. But this old concept was much better, drawing and much more plausible in a shiny, classic original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips his only interesting idea from an old horror movie in Hollywood. No wonder! Overall, this movie was bland and unoriginal, and cheapest form using recycled CGI with Caprica by BSG. I doubt that I'll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the channel Sci-Fi. If I am, of course, does not happen to be suffering from a bad attack of insomnia at this time the show will undoubtedly be treated. Zzzzzzzz
