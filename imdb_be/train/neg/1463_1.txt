Just imagine, the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would be such a moron babbling like, to produce portrayed him in the movie. <br /> <br /> No one could have followed him, even desperate, unemployed man in 1920. <br /> <br /> It's just a part of most Hollywood cardboard propaganda, disguised as a "true story." <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for anyone who actually believed any of this show. Carlyle and the producers did not get anything right with it. <br /> <br /> Why Hitler was able to win so many people, the whole district for his ideas, when there was such a sausage? Why do people follow him to death? Drawing it as such a loser, they make their own film, absolutely incredible. This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill, where the director shows only him as a drunkard for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This film is a shame and I wonder how they could say the actor, as done in this dreck.
