David Lean worst film. Even "In Which We ServeÂ» was'nt as bad as this. Typically, a film with a very good reputation, like this one, has at least some redeeming quality that makes one understand why it can be considered a classic. But after seeing that, I just could not, why is this piece of shit was so much, even in 1945! I did not like to act, stiff upper lip British manners, history, script (which can be very witty at times, but very unfunny) and sound. Elvira character is meant to be enticing and attractive, but really ugly and had a strange and annoying voice. Another film that convinced me not to trust the reputation of the films. Another very overpriced "British Classic".
