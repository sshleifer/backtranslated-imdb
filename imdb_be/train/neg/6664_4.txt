What begins as a gentle country yarn, harmless and mildly pleasant romantic story changes tempo as the original charming Harlan Edward Norton gradually reveals more about himself, and all turn sinister as the film gradually moves from the south of the novel in the modern western wildlife. <br /> <br /> venerable ranch (Norton) goes to the city and the charm of a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), it would seem, to save her from the dead-end existence with her bad temper parents with a whirlwind romance, but gradually it becomes clear that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? a real chameleon actor (with a change in facial hair to match) plays a sucker country, the emphasis a bit quirky, but maybe because he's just trying to play the role without worrying about hitting. He, of course, pretends to no effort to make all the nuances of small adjustments, as we learn more about Harlan. However, too many small changes, this means that we are never sure exactly where Harlan comes from, and what seemed like a good performance from Norton gradually becomes entangled. Evan Rachel Wood's cute, do not ever really have much in common, except for the bits of her eyelids at Norton. <br /> <br /> down in strikes valley like a slightly uneven tale because of his change of pace, and never really makes clear the motives of the protagonist the audience sympathy for the characters remain uncertain. If we like the hobo or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events remains unclear. This ambiguity to the detriment of the film, as if the writer could not make up your mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and to satisfy some of the stew. If the film was one or the other may be a solid film, but this is what we are left with something mess. Fans of old-fashioned romance like the film, but will scare tons darkening. Completist Norton supporters in the party (or lovers of lush landscape of San Fernando Valley), give it a miss.
