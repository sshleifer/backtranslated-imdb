The acting in the film is really well done fairly, but the film is so slow and so boring, as soon as it becomes interested in everything that slows down to the main stop. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job as well as other actors, as I said, but man ... this is one of the worst pulled movies I have ever seen. Now, perhaps, in the abbreviated form of the film this movie would have been nice, but other than that, to avoid it. This film has so much filler that makes Twinkie cake jealous. <br /> <br /> I never, ever, do not go to movies, but watching it alone at home with my family, I went out. Yes, it was that sad. Apparently my comment does not have enough lines to accommodate, so here is a little filler. I believe that I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
