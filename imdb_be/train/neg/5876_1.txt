I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for Shakespeare in my class, and, unfortunately, I chose this version. Everything from acting (actors provide the bulk of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all average or close up shots ... film development landscape and very little back ground in the picture) was absolutely awful. I watched it during my spring break, and it is very safe to say that I feel like I was gypped of 114 minutes of my vacation. We do not recommend any stretch.
