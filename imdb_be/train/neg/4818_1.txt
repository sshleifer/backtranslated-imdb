I was about 7 when it was released this DIRE MONSTROSITY film. In the UK, it was announced on television in the summer of 1977 for a few weeks, as if it was some incredible blockbuster movie. It was actually the first film I ever saw in a movie, and I was put off going for years to come. The next week I was invited to go and see the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. Until now, I never saw it as a sign of protest against the order to watch the Snow! Seriously, even in the age of 7, I could say that I saw the trash. It's just so bad it's almost unbelievable. Rambling nonsense that never should have done it in the movies. I was, however, pleased to read all these years later that the director has never directed again the same way, as I understand it. Avoid at all costs !!!
