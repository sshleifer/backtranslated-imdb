I took TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We reviewed with a trip to the east and thought it would give us a sense of what it was like. The film was a waste of time if I went out to buy it, I would call it TRAN SCAM, when I saw that it costs $ 49. <br /> <br /> DVD ran for 8 minutes and featured a roller coaster on across Canada, my stomach was not feeling well, they went up and down and around the film at a high speed curve. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of footage, they probably shot at this, and you would think that they could have made a better product. If I did this project, I would have given more shots, he stopped on the road signs to let people know where they are and remain in the field to see the scenery. In order to make a film like this should have been from 60 to 90 minutes. Ah, yes said that it was in stereo, the entire film was a hissing sound from the sound of the car accelerated, isoleucine could at least put some music to it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good cross-Canada film to watch The railrodder / National Film Board of Canada, starring Buster Keaton (one of the last film he made) in this comic Buster Keaton film gets on railway trackspeeder in Nova Scotia and travels to British Columbia
