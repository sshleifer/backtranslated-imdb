As the film with Amy Posey and Raechel may have nothing funny about this? Believe it or not "boys" do it better and funnier. I hope that the leaders had a good holiday and got the money - this film is a challenge for all of them. It's a cliché, from start to finish. Clichés can work well with the scenario, or at least the idea. This film does nothing but to use a cliche after cliche, not ideas or scenarios. It uses an existing person portrayed, actresses, not to develop the character. Poor, boring, and debris. Now I apparently must have ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why? As an IT manager OPS is another example of careless coding.
