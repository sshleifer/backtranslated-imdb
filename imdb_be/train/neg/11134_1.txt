This is a very cheaply made werewolf flick. A dark and poorly lit sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. Scenario cliché ridden garbage with normal characters, as the hard detective who shoots a werewolf with his silver pistol! [Filled, of course, with the silver bullets]. Act as wooden as heroes. FX is non-existent, many extreme close-up werewolves jaws and biting. the only thing that shows is a lot of soft rod T & A. Rather than file a $ 30 check for the scar really great recent werewolf Peak: «Dog Soldiers» with Pertwee.
