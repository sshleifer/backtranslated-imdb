I like Don Knotts, let me say up front! He's a tremendous talent and the best that he does that portray a nervous, lovably Puzzled loser, thrown into a position of power. He is incredible in that role as Roy Fleming, Reluctant Astronaut, but the movie is pretty boring, actually, even though as a child, my brother and I were delighted, watching it and his other films. It's still worth watching, but in fact it is a film that kids are the best. I would classify it as 100% of the family and the fact that you could sit and watch the children on a family night. <br /> <br /> As with all films Knotts', has a large cast of favorite character actors, and you can not help but smile when Knotts provides one of the shivering, with his mouth open looks, no matter how old and you jacked. <br /> <br /> from the point of view of an adult, the one thing that I think this is more about the film, as it captures the NASA in 1960 - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was amazed at how courteous and studly Leslie Nielsen was then. Only complaint about this story is the love interest Roy, rather shabby, unsympathetic woman who could not give him the time of day, until it becomes a great shot - if you're like me, you hope that he gives her a push-off at the end . Caution - you will be whistling the theme tune for a few days after watching it that clings.
