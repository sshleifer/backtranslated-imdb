I'll make it short and sweet .... this movie sucked !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever made 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought, maybe, part 2 and 3 would have been good sequels, I was wrong. This film I'm bored to death, and so different from the first, it was the story continues and it does. It was like a bad bills from one part or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him here. I was so glad Glenn Danzig to be in this movie, but do not blink, you'll miss them. There was a full roll full of bad actors and people I do not like such as Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. Nevertheless, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he's one of the funniest people on earth. <br /> <br /> This film will make you a little less like the first one, so I do not see because you feel that you owe it to yourself as a supporter of part 1. I'll wait a few days before I look the part 3, and I pray that it's better than this shit. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the film with the zipper was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film. Fast-forward or skip it if you can not digest the first part of <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars. - it was horrible!
