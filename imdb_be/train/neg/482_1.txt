This figure is a French film, LOL, with an emphasis on young girls with very old men ... why the French so fixated on that kind of thing? If the age difference is great, it really comes off like a pervert! Valentina Cervi is beautiful (it has a strong resemblance to Olivier Jose, with 68 Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet, set in the same period), but she looks about 15, and the actor who plays Tassi, her painting instructor, looks ... well, 50 'it is KIND. <br /> <br /> other posters has done work on the interpretation of historical facts (unusually detailed in this case) a real sage, a great artist and one of the earliest known female artists of this period (17th century). Its history tells us, in our time, especially because of the age-old accusation that "all great artists were men" - it pretty much bang this statement into pieces - and because the story of her rape trial is so bitter. Not only that, it is clearly an attack and had degraded sexual relationship (because in those days the marriage with your attacker was the only way to avoid social embarrassment), but Tassi was a serial rapist and may have killed his wife and child. <, Br /> <br /> film does a terrible disservice by turning it's really fun and wonderful story of real life - very dramatic and does not need any "fill" - because in some strange way Frencified is "hot" to draw teen hypersexuality male genitals and having a passionate affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather. This "sexy" - it is a sad truth and it seems too feminist / political correctness <br /> <br /> In addition, I am concerned that this is only part of the life of wormwood is considered interesting enough to film .. The fact that it is colored throughout decades (its famous painting of Judith beheading Holfernes was written after rather than before the rape), she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy, which she went on to have children ... that is the boring stuff. In the end, this is about middle-aged woman, and they are not "hot" as teenagers. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are a lot of artistic license in making the film (or a book) about a real historical character. You need to create a dialogue, there podagovory create dramatic structure. Of course, some parts can be sacrificed - it is no great thing if the timing will be moved in a few years, or if Artemisia plays blonde actress (if we know of her self-portraits, that she was a brunette ... and one big boned, not thin Mini), or something like that. But to turn your story around her, and to make rape within the novel is actually painful and disturbing. It's even worse, because the director of the female sex. It must be terribly ashamed of yourself! <br /> <br /> If you like it (and I know that some people could care less about real women and the artist as well as historical costumes and hot sex), you'll probably like Â«Dangerous Beauty" with Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack. Similarly, on the basis of much rewrite history, with many of the sinuses and is approaching the value of inlaid glasses: Bon appetit!
