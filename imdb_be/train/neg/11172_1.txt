2002 x undeservedly popular Â«I Love the 80s" is nonsensical, idiotic, offensive and absolutely disgusting mess of pop culture show, was the first in a long line of terrible television programs that ultimately spelled the end of the VH1, which has been in one time only real music-oriented channel went on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 until the spring or winter, I have not forgotten, who are now, in 2002, when the garbage, as it began to appear absolutely no reason. With curiosity (I guess that's what you would call it), I decided that I would go ahead and give it a curious way or another on the first night she arrived, even though the ads look like shit. At least, I can honestly say that I was not a little disappointed because my expectations were clearly lower basement level to start with. The focus of the show, I learned for the first 5 minutes was less for each year from 1980, and what was and was not culturally significant or popular (this is what I expected), but instead more than a makeshift platform Lots for no name really god-awful comedians, to show that they are likely to think of their comedic skills * rolls eyes * ... more like a no-them, if you ask me! It is quite easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on the show, because they are all so terribly unfunny and helpless in their attempts to so-called "humor" that I swear I could feel my intestines knot with each and every one-liner rancid they severed one after the other! In general, I have no problems in that "I love the 80s" was / is rubbish lowest common denominator, and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore.
