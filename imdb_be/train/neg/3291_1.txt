First of all let me say that I am not a supporter of Dukes' C, but after this film looked like a series Law & Order. Worst of all was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds Sun Boss Hogg, and even worse was the MK Gainey, like Roscoe, if they ever watched the show Roscoe was not a hard ass cop. He was more than Barney Fife role he played in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with the usual errors, cars getting broken, and continued as nothing happened. The worst example of this is when the General gets along with Billy Prickett and the General ran into the dirt mound, clearly slowing down to almost stops, but goes on to win the race.
