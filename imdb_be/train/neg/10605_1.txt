It was a disgusting waste of my time. There is no plot. Action was still below par, it should be used as a model in the acting classes that do not. It's just a commercial plagiarism previously Universal Soldier, which is also acting scraping the bottom of the barrel. Its sad that the VD must approve your ego every few years, and even sadder that people will pay good money to sit through it. This kind of schlock provides movies about martial arts a bad name. For comparison, it makes Segal, Norris, Arnold and look pretty talented. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, VD should take the trail of Leslie Nielsen, and not send the windows of its genre. At least we could laugh with him, not at him.
