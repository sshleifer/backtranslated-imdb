A fabulous book about a fox and his family, which makes what makes Foxs. that being to steal from the farm and kill prey. while farmers trio decides that they have had enough of this fox and try different ways to have a problem "to solve." They, of course, "a drunk" at every step, and while the trio spent the night at the fox hole family perform raids against three farmers' land. <br /> <br /> Â«movie" version, and I use the term very loosely movie, more with god awful pastiches of American Heist films especially films oceans. They have even George Clooney as Mr. fox add to the insult, and manage to miss the point of the story adequately. So kudos to them .They'll earn a lot of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children's book.
