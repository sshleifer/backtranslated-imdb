I see a lot of people liked that movie. For me, it was a film shot right to sign the 101 and especially not a class. Since then, Lindsey Price videographer shows until the end of the film was very predictable. I kept looking to see if there is anywhere. <br /> <br /> First, we widowed young father. Cliche # 1 movie / TV always kill the mother of one of the parents if the child is a girl or a brood of boys, so that a single parent can gain consciousness of his dead wife, and seems to be quite out of his element, taking care of children. Starting with my 3 Sons to 2 1/2 Pope. These films are usually drama and comedy TV show. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 2 If the assertive woman has a camera in her hand, she will play a big role in the film. And will always have a solution, or even if that person is a fool <br /> <br /> Cliche # 3 If a person in danger is a foreigner, they must be of Hispanic origin. And they should be illegal. Apparently, there is no legal and illegal Latino in Europeans, if if there is an element of IRA involvement. <br /> <br /> # 4 Cliche Latino said, need to be educated in his native country. In this case, it was Profesor, who made 200 in a month. And he said, highly educated Latino now have to act like he does not have a brain in his head now and allows air head side kick to take over. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 Crime person has committed a crime really was not, and the accident. But since in this case he lost all feeling he had when he crossed the border he now acts as a pathetic idiot, and now put your own daughter at risk, taking her with him to a fruitless search to the border with the idiotic side kick. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 One never works over the bully that come from crime, but some poor little cute baby. This is because the child's parents should play a greater part of the film, but because the person who accidentally killed a child can have an absurd interaction with parents. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 7 Name me one film in which one policeman was not angry vet, and they get paired with a newcomer. Even if they homicide detective, who must be the most experienced police officers in the police force. Sev7n and wannabe and law and order come to mind immediately. A veterinarian, although gruff exterior is a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 8 Let's round up some of the unemployed and the Soap Star. Now I like Lindsay Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not act her way out of a paper bag, and if she uses to be on One Life To Live, like Marty, he swung right every time she opened her mouth. It is used to me seasick. It can be fixed on the ground better, but it still may not work. <br /> <br /> The film may have been more perceptive if it was not filled with clichés. I do not think that the film should be expensive or cerebral to be good. But it was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I will not spoil the ending. Oh my gosh, I'm going, because I feel that it would be a disservice to humanity to waste time, people they will never get back, looking at this film. It includes the Cliche # 6 and # 7 If a person has never seen the movie before, you should have seen that coming. Father makes even dumber error running from the cops at the end and gets angry veteran shot that suddenly very upset. Do you think that she thought that the poor guy was innocent throughout the film, and she shot him by mistake. If she did not. Now for a little girl, my father brought with him. Guess what happened to her? Times, she ends up living in a family whose child was killed by her father !! Come on! You all knew that was going to happen, because it is a replacement for a child !! That's why she did not go and live with nature Lindey prices. <br /> <br /> This film was an insult, as far as I was concerned. Because there were so many ways, this film could scout out and went down, but he decided to take on the cliche ridden one. 2 stars are for 2 star, a little girl who I thought was very good, and Lindsey Price, which is annoying character, but she did what she could with him. My advice is to take a vise and squeeze the head with it, instead of looking at this dreck
