Ah WINTER KILLS, based on the novel by Richard Condon, who is dealing with the conspiracy that killed the president of the USA 20 years ago. I knew Condon also wrote The Manchurian Candidate, which dealt with a similar theme and am looking forward to see an intelligent thriller <br /> <br /> WINTER KILLS left me cold. This is not a thriller - it's a piece of useless crap, possibly the worst film I've seen this month, and boy, I saw a lot of bad movies in June. The problem is how in the direction and script and seeing how William Richert was responsible for, and then he should be blamed entirely for this unfunny farce <br /> <br /> There are two things wrong with this film. First of all it is all presented in a completely over the top way. This is not so, OTT, as something like this James Bond film with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but has farcial edge to it with the actors completely steal their performances. This can be justified, when there was entertainment value of the film, but there is none. The satire is very stupid, so stupid, that it becomes almost unwatchable. Second stage seems to have been reduced to such an extent that they are rendered meaningless. Take, for example, a scene where the hero encounters a loop militia leader called Dawson. Dawson says the hero, he has 30 seconds to start, then it cuts to the hero being on board the aircraft. Scenes begin and end entirely rhymes nor reasons <br /> <br /> hardest film that ordeal to sit through
