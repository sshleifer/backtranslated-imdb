I was raised a Baptist and I know the story of this movie is trying to say, although I no longer believe in history. I give kudos to the cinema, because as good as the average life expectancy of the film week. Moderately interesting, mediocre action, a little slow, the script is predictable, sappy music, and it's a bit melodramatic. And all the people remaining to be received squeakiest clean non-Christians ever. Not one bad word from any of them. But I laughed when the actor plays a man who controls the United Nations pronounced as "nuclear" as "nu-Cu-Lery," just like Bush. Are there any Christian code of honor, which requires that, as Bush claims that he also called God that all Christians need to cover up their ignorance mangling the word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a hard time taking the film seriously at all after that. After the "nu-si-Ler" incident, the film started to feel packed, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. In fact, I was looking for something that would make me think, but I found it here. If you are looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it is good to kill a rainy day. But if you are looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
