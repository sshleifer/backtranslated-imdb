Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), cook on a pirate ship, which takes over as captain after the murder of the previous one. Despite the fact that he was a witness to the treasure hides, he begins to lose his memory and treasure map he gets becomes empty. Thus, Dick forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (you place an ad for it?) And to help lead the way to the treasures. It's incredible how someone could finance this senseless film. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as a director, and talent Medak in the film of the ruling class, you can guess what kind of grainy, poorly lit scenes Milligan was in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the first 10 minutes of the film, as a convicted pirate captain. He must be very thankful that Young Frankenstein was released in the same year it was made and preserved, so that he can keep it on his resume. Franciosa dashing looks like a beautiful power of the scraper, but it and the seller both look pretty desperate, makeup and hair, even Sellers looks pretty scary. They must have known that this film was a bomb, even if they shot it. With lines like these, I can understand any possible awkwardness: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (hang about) you will pay for it <br /> <br /> scraper :. No, I won "t. I'll do it for free. <br /> <br /> And this is one of the good jokes. It is amazing to me that most of the sellers prolific material is still in storage, but it was available on VHS more than 15 years ago! How about someone stepping up to the plate and released in the United States he is well received by the British television program "show called Fred" starring sellers Milligan, and director Richard Lester's big?
