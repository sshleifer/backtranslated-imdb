Pretty fun part, which is trying to show how smart killer whales are, but at this time (and not paying attention to them) makes the audience feel stupid by making the most funny movie. Richard Harris played Quint .. I'm sorry, that's not true, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches a shark to life, but lured by a great catch, and trying to catch a killer whale. If the capture of a female killer goes wrong (do not ask), this helper (do not ask) goes on a rampage (do not ask), and begins to settle Captain Nolan (Do not ask). Soon Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (do not ask). Quite a strange shooting people here. I must tell you, though, the beginning (of whale noises and nothing much else) is quite intrusive and the end credits (with the most godawful song) are quite interesting.
