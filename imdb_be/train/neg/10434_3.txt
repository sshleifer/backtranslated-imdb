Maybe I go to something or a bad smell coming from the Dawn + 1 -? God of all? What does God have to do with the Sci-Fi? God is the only answer, if you can not come up with a reasonable explanation for something. In fact, this is exactly the problem the series finale - they obviously could not come up with a reasonable explanation for a number of big questions that have been raised throughout the series, such as Kara Thrace to return from the dead in a new snakes like her old viper and charred bodies appeared on Earth 2, why Baltar has on its head an imaginary 6, 6 has an apparent why Baltar in her head, and so on, so they explain this "angel", or simply do not explain at all. <br /> <br /> plot last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly Basestar later. For example, why Galactica and his team go on a suicide mission to save a girl (Hera), since as Adama said that there was no way he tries to rescue? Because they are located the Cylon base? This is not a good reason to sacrifice the life of the crew. And Anders know the location? And what was the point in the life of a flashback of the main characters for the war? It's like they forgot to do it earlier, so they threw something at the last minute. <br /> <br /> people who wrote the last two episodes could not be the same authors who created what was still a sensational series. It feels like writing the script was to take the evangelical Christians on a mission to spread the "Word." Forget trying to tie the ends meet at the site, the important message the authors wanted to convey not your faith in technology, as it will lead to your destruction; God is your final salvation (bad luck, if you have a disease that needs medical attention). <br /> <br /> Imagine the final Star Wars film series, they say you do not "force" ... instead, the Jedi actually derives its power from Jesus. Then they fly their spacecraft to the nearest star and go live in the woods with Ewoks. Will it be a good end? No, it frakken Â»will not.
