If you want to see the animals that are skinned alive, their heads smashed, the dog's throat squeezing my people stomping on them, then this one is for you! But if you are somewhat normal, and do not need to see real footage of animal abuse, to go through this alone. This film tries to shock the audience, and he is confident, does.With animal tobacco in the beginning, and the killing of children in the film (a fake, at least) it was enough to bring himself to turn his off.I've seen movies like this before this show slaughterhouse staff (BKI movie) and this type of frame should not be allowed to watch horror movie.We blood and terror, because we know it's just a make-up and special effects, so we should not sit down to watch the movie and see the real killing of animals, it is not that we rented a movie for.If anything, there has to be conducted ki warning labels put on these types of films debris so people won, t be surprised them. As a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned my stomach. The entire film cast and crew need their heads checked.
