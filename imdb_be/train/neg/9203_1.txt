Many people would like to point to this TV movie, when arguing with broad legions Hanks-fil there that Tom did actually makes bad movies (I think the "Bachelor" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on the "Dungeons and Dragons-style game", which eventually leads our young Gump in hallucinatory insanity. History magically early 1980s, focusing as it does on the immediate threat to our young people who come from these stupid role-playing games. <br /> <br /> However, I prefer to watch "Mazes and Monsters", as a turn in the business, "Whatever happened to Chris Makepeace?" story. we all remember him as a "by Rudy rabbit in" Meatballs "and how unfortunate Clifford in" My Bodyguard ", where he gave us all the vicarious thrill of beating the shit Matt Dillon. Few can argue (especially those of us who read the "Dynamite!" On a regular basis), that great things were in store for him. <br /> <br /> And then Rona Jaffe. The line between a bad action and bad works fine razor, so I'll leave it to you to decide whose fault it Makepeace performance. All I know is that the last major release, I saw him in was the "Vamp", and it was 1986. He had a small role his brother Sean Penn in "The Falcon and the Snowman ', but by the time when the package was a torch Brat transfers to another with straight hair and brighter resume. <br /> <br /> I can not in good conscience recommend this film. See, if only to see the younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace to Rona Jaffe feasted on his soul.
