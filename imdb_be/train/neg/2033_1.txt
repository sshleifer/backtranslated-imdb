If I could give it less than that 1 I would. It is not necessary to rent; If someone gives you a DVD to burn it. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie-making. A total waste even a digital "film". I've seen better on Youtube, made the 12-year-old boys. Lommel claims to have written it, if it is, it is a classic example of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The storyline is not there, the dialogue is mainly crying, the camera work is a genus of artistic attempt Flairs with meaningless sharp jumps completely unrelated to transport or industrial scenes and some odd hard-core young woman break. <br /> <br /> I usually go for less than obvious plot sees the goal in the "creative" film. - I love David Lynch <br /> <br /> This is one either so far beyond my limited powers of understanding, or I missed it completely meaningless. I think that this "allows us to see if we can capture the title, which will be published shortly and make a wonderful break on it and see if we can capture some of the dollars" against the work. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Lionsgate even tinker with it. Completely useless, this is so bad, I will not rent any other by the same director.
