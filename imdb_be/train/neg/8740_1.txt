My friends and I rented the movie last night, and we had one of the biggest laughs in a while. The film should not be funny, but it's just so funny, and he lacks any reality at all. Firstly, Philippe (I forget what his character is called, and I do not really care) uses a regular employee ID to get through all the terminals top security. Not only that miserable, but he gets on top when his great efforts highlight of his find so scary Lego hall, which hosts a super computers. This is the usual ridiculous. The tense mood that we have to experience completely spoiled infant that looks suite. The ending, like everything else, very very very cheesy, especially if the lawyer a bad guy shows up "just in time". Anyway, this film a good laugh. If you need something to make fun, definitely see it.
