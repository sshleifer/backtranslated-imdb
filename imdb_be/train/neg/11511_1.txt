I had (MIS) fortune to see this movie to show in the US. Having reluctantly sat up all bottomless thing, I'm in shock, I saw a lot of good reviews here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> the original film was a turkey, but interesting. It is set in the early seventies that, after 1969 revolutions things; This film is just stinks ....... well, nothing really. It's so bad <br /> <br /> Imagine a badly made perfume commercials -.? See what I mean <br /> <br /> Madonna can never act, and was an embarrassment on the big screen for years. It looks worse and worse with each of those years, increasingly come to such skeletal Meerkat <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who built his "reputation" on the part of Locke can not send any -. His films are small, poorly cut, fashion shows. He does not disappoint here either; he wisely left his wife, as the star of this disaster. <br /> <br /> Please, people, occupy little attention to the good reviews the film has received from other posters below. They are quite obvious, business plants. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage Ritchie humiliate himself further, giving him the money. <br /> <br />
