Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who had a minor role in the classic "Soldiers") is the first person in the community to understand that there are murderous slugs in his small town. Not just slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer more then normal, mutated slugs of toxic waste (which is still only as fast as a normal cochlea, which is not so bad, but I digress). No one would believe him at first, but they will. Oh, yes, they will. <br /> <br /> Well, the killer snails directly above psychotic laziness and directly under Zhonaton Winters, as a child MORK in horror factor. Thus, the absurdity of all this is clear from the get go. Flick through a few fun with the "so bad it's good" variety. I understand that they are registered, it's snails: The film, unlike the slugs: children's games or slugs: other white meat. Probably not worth it to watch it a few times and quickly forget him for playing the game rather vague details, except. Director Juan Piquer Simon, more widely known for his previous films "Under the People» (which deservedly MST3K mocked) and «Peices» (which is quite possible, fun bad movie ever made) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows the T & <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: a theatrical trailer for this film
