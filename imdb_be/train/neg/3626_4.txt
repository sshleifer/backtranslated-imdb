I do not know that Oscar voters have seen this film, but they must have seen some pretty difficult things to see in it, to be able to reward him with Oskara`. All I know is that, fortunately, was Gene Kelly to play it would be twice as bad as I think it is. First of all, I do not think Leslie Caron was very suitable to play such a role. It is not that talented, it is not a great dancer, and she was not very nice to look at everything. It's a shame that one actor or actress can spoil the film as well as playing in it, because if Leslie Caron was not in it, might have made a great movie. The story was a clever, direction was not bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all these things about Leslie Caron only criticize it, I'm just saying, because I think that is what the worse part of the film. It is probably a good actress, but I can not say because I have not seen her in anything else, but I think it is very bad in "An American in Paris." So if you want to see it, go ahead, but I tell you that you look way better "Singing in the Rain."
