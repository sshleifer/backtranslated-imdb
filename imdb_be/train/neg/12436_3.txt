The first Home Alone was a decent enough film ... sequel was almost the same as in the new environment. This one tries to be original, and succeeds to some extent ... of course, the formula is basically the same, so as to watch the same movie for the third time with a slightly modified storyline. The new estimate is very bad (although the new "set a trap" piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the tremendous number of the first, and almost no-nya-quite-as-good result other. It's (almost) makes up for it, using some pretty okay, not the original music, but it's just not the same. The plot is valid and several original franchise, but it is still basically the same film as the first two, with the worst effect and less impressive example "terrible character proving to be good. There are basically unimpressive. Symbols in mainly cartoons. New thieves less interesting than the old (and they make fun of the spy stuff that is almost criminal, given the limited number of good spyware clicks are and how precious few of them are cool). the fact that they are bigger (and thus more traps) easy a feeble attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films ... and it does not work. The idea of ​​thieves and their mission ... a little too serious for adult and children's film (and had sexual joke or two, although it is not the first time in the series). This is also unnecessarily complicated as the plot as a whole. I could follow him, but I doubt that a child could. Some exposure set so obvious that even children can find silly. Speech of the animal as usually not funny. There are fewer brothers and sisters who have to mean that those there to get worked over, but they have less than a person the least featured those of the first two films. In general, just not particularly good, worth watching if you * really * love to watch the criminal injured in a cartoon in the violence. I recommend this huge supporter of the only series. 3/10
