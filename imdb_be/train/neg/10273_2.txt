When it comes to horror movies, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, to ignore the subpar production values, and leave plot holes in the interest of a good scare. This movie just does not make good horror stories to offer. He can not even be served as a camp. Bad dialogue, bad action, bad direction, the killing was predictable and poorly organized, the music annoying camera work was miserable, even the costumes were bad. I felt very bad for the actors, who obviously tried, but who had to deal with the awful, contrived dialogue and the apparent lack of direction. I doubt that they have received any rehearsal, either. Ashamed to look, and so sad, you make it to the far-fetched "surprise" ending requires tremendous endurance. It is quite easily one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not usually write reviews, but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This film is a waste of time. If you need to watch this movie, do not miss "MakingÂ» -featurette. Writer / director, seems to be under the impression that the woman makes the killer was a sort of bold, courageous step. (A visit to him.) He and the cast to spend a half-hour deconstruction of this movie as if it were a new-age "Citizen Kane." It's like listening to a group of third graders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas pageant. Do they really think that they have created something of substance. It's sad, really ?? The only reason I gave this film "2", because I think that the "1" should be reserved for these atrocities as "Manos: Hands of Fate" and ". Mutiny in Space" Thus, "American Nightmare" is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I have to say that it is somewhere in the bottom fifty.
