I really have to watch a good movie in the near future, because it seems like any other input or so is that I despise. However, my story says that I should not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield, and everything about it sucks big green banana peel. I never thought that I would see the film thud like thunder, as this one did. Al Pacino does not act in this film: it creates. There are many, many scenes of his character, which is a race car driver, just looking at the camera. He's terrible. Marthe Keller as bad. These two must be in love, and there's just no chemistry at all. Sydney Pollack directed this film? There is no trace of the genius of Tutsi here. This is the same person that I was rooting for in Eyes Wide Shut? I can not believe it. Save an awful movie experience. Run, do not walk, from Bobby Deerfield.
