Note to fans of horror :. The only fear here, if you realize you just wasted 95 minutes of my life on a film, which is so not worth anything, it is offensive <br /> <br /> I've been watching this because: <br /> <br /> premise sounded a little promise: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same flimsy set pieces from other low-budget horror films that were not good. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked wood nymphs sounded nice, even if the movie was terrible: It's not. This is no way. Amateur cinematography is convinced that the "fallen angels" is about as sexy as the average homeless <br /> <br /> The name Savinykh has a long history in the horror genre :. He is the king of low-budget special effects and a lower operating budget. Think about it, Savinykh was not the reason to watch this movie. This does not mean that he is bad, but it is almost always in bad movies. His only good part was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he was milking, that horror conventions since then, <br /> <br /> But let's focus on the positive :. Forest Damned is a perfect example of how not to make a film. <br /> <br /> All the rest is negative. It is obvious that the author is allergic to originality. a horrible scenario. That's all there is given after the first 10 minutes. But ignorant pacemaker; as the director treats the "plot" and "characteristics" as a nuisance, he thinks that no one cares about either; and painfully long and tedious sequence of driving, walking, and nature (no doubt added to extend the time to make the movie right of distribution) show a complete lack of ability to film and history in general. <br /> <br /> this is another good example of the number one, how can you tell when a movie is bad, if it is written and directed by the same person, wait for the garbage.
