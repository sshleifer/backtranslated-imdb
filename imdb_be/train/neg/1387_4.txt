Hard to believe, the "action" packed Jet Li movie could be so boring, but it was a transcendant debris. The plot is a mixture of other chopsocky film Hong Kong. Martial arts action of all the special effects and human talent. <br /> <br /> It's a comic story of a group of superhuman soldiers to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of their number (Li), which takes an incompetent army to rescue them and reconstructs life as a pacifist librarian . Accumulated killer resurface with the quality of the plot Austin Powers to take over the world, and Lee throws a new life, to save the world. <br /> <br /> In the version I saw was duplicated, and that perhaps focused cheesiness with the finest comic plot and special effects of 25 cents. But I suspect that even a ninja turtle-watching 8-year-old child would have found that teenagers and hollow.
